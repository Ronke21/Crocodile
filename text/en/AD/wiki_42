<text>John Milton Hay (October 8, 1838July 1, 1905) was an American statesman and official whose career in government stretched over almost half a century. Beginning as a private secretary and an assistant for Abraham Lincoln, he became a diplomat. He served as United States Secretary of State under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. Hay was also a biographer of Lincoln, and wrote poetry and other literature throughout his life.

Born in Salem, Indiana to an anti-slavery family that moved to Warsaw, Illinois, Hay showed great potential from an early age, and his family sent him to Brown University. After graduation in 1858, Hay read law in his uncle&#x27;s office in Springfield, Illinois, adjacent to that of Lincoln. Hay worked for Lincoln&#x27;s successful presidential campaign and became one of his private secretaries in the White House. Throughout the American Civil War, Hay was close to Lincoln and stood by his deathbed after the President was shot. In addition to his other literary works, Hay co-authored, with John George Nicolay, a ten-volume biography of Lincoln that helped shape the assassinated president&#x27;s historical image.

After Lincoln&#x27;s death, Hay spent several years at diplomatic posts in Europe, then worked for the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; under Horace Greeley and Whitelaw Reid. Hay remained active in politics, and from 1879 to 1881 served as Assistant Secretary of State. Afterward, he returned to the private sector, remaining there until President McKinley, of whom he had been a major backer, made him the Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1897. Hay became the Secretary of State the following year.

Hay served for nearly seven years as Secretary of State under President McKinley and, after McKinley&#x27;s assassination, under Theodore Roosevelt. Hay was responsible for negotiating the Open Door Policy, which kept China open to trade with all countries on an equal basis, with international powers. By negotiating the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty with the United Kingdom, the (ultimately unratified) Hay–Herrán Treaty with Colombia, and finally the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty with the newly independent Republic of Panama, Hay also cleared the way for the building of the Panama Canal.

==Early life==
===Family and youth===
John Milton Hay was born in Salem, Indiana, on October 8, 1838. He was the third son of Dr. Charles Hay and the former Helen Leonard. Charles Hay, born in Lexington, Kentucky, hated slavery and moved to the North in the early 1830s. A doctor, he practiced in Salem. Helen&#x27;s father, David Leonard, had moved his family west from Assonet, Massachusetts, in 1818, but died en route to Vincennes, Indiana, and Helen relocated to Salem in 1830 to teach school. They married there in 1831. Charles was not successful in Salem, and moved, with his wife and children, to Warsaw, Illinois, in 1841.

John attended the local schools, and in 1849 his uncle Milton Hay invited John to live at his home in Pittsfield, Pike County, and attend a well-regarded local school, the John D. Thomson Academy. Milton was a friend of Springfield attorney Abraham Lincoln and had read law in the firm Stuart and Lincoln. In Pittsfield, John first met John Nicolay, who was at the time a 20-year-old newspaperman. Once John Hay completed his studies there, the 13-year-old was sent to live with his grandfather in Springfield and attend school there. His parents and uncle Milton (who financed the boy&#x27;s education) sent him to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, &quot;alma mater&quot; of his late maternal grandfather.

===Student and Lincoln supporter===
Hay enrolled at Brown in 1855. Although he enjoyed college life, he did not find it easy: his Western clothing and accent made him stand out; he was not well prepared academically and was often sick. Hay gained a reputation as a star student and became a part of Providence&#x27;s literary circle that included Sarah Helen Whitman and Nora Perry. He wrote poetry and experimented with hashish. Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.

Milton Hay&#x27;s firm was one of the most prestigious in Illinois. Lincoln maintained offices next door and was a rising star in the new Republican Party. Hay recalled an early encounter with Lincoln:

Hay was not a supporter of Lincoln for president until after his nomination in 1860. Hay then made speeches and wrote newspaper articles boosting Lincoln&#x27;s candidacy. When Nicolay, who had been made Lincoln&#x27;s private secretary for the campaign, found he needed help with the huge amounts of correspondence, Hay worked full-time for Lincoln for six months.

After Lincoln was elected, Nicolay, who continued as Lincoln&#x27;s private secretary, recommended that Hay be hired to assist him at the White House. Lincoln is reported to have said, &quot;We can&#x27;t take all Illinois with us down to Washington&quot; but then &quot;Well, let Hay come&quot;. Kushner and Sherrill were dubious about &quot;the story of Lincoln&#x27;s offhand appointment of Hay&quot; as fitting well into Hay&#x27;s self-image of never having been an office-seeker, but &quot;poorly into the realities of Springfield politics of the 1860s&quot;—Hay must have expected some reward for handling Lincoln&#x27;s correspondence for months. Hay biographer John Taliaferro suggests that Lincoln engaged Nicolay and Hay to assist him, rather than more seasoned men, both &quot;out of loyalty and surely because of the competence and compatibility that his two young aides had demonstrated&quot;. Historian Joshua Zeitz argues that Lincoln was moved to hire Hay when Milton agreed to pay his nephew&#x27;s salary for six months.

==American Civil War==
===Secretary to Lincoln===

Milton Hay desired that his nephew go to Washington as a qualified attorney, and John Hay was admitted to the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a shabby bedroom. As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours a day. As Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.

Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities, Nicolay tending to assist Lincoln in his office and in meetings, while Hay dealt with the correspondence, which was voluminous. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with his charm, escaped much of the hard feelings from those denied Lincoln&#x27;s presence. Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as &quot;a nice young fellow, who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy.&quot; Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union. Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a &quot;White House propagandist,&quot; in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Bull Run in July 1861.
Despite the heavy workload—Hay wrote that he was busy 20 hours a day—he tried to make as normal a life as possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard&#x27;s Hotel, going to the theater with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in French. Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers in the homes of Washington&#x27;s elite. The two secretaries often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln&#x27;s salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries&#x27; objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to save almost 70 percent of her husband&#x27;s salary in his four years in office.

After the death of Lincoln&#x27;s 11-year-old son Willie in February 1862 (an event not mentioned in Hay&#x27;s diary or correspondence), &quot;it was Hay who became, if not a surrogate son, then a young man who stirred a higher form of parental nurturing that Lincoln, despite his best intentions, did not successfully bestow on either of his surviving children&quot;. According to Hay biographer Robert Gale, &quot;Hay came to adore Lincoln for his goodness, patience, understanding, sense of humor, humility, magnanimity, sense of justice, healthy skepticism, resilience and power, love of the common man, and mystical patriotism&quot;. Speaker of the House Galusha Grow stated, &quot;Lincoln was very much attached to him&quot;; writer Charles G. Halpine, who knew Hay then, later recorded that &quot;Lincoln loved him as a son&quot;.

Hay and Nicolay accompanied Lincoln to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for the dedication of the cemetery there, where were interred many of those who fell at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although they made much of Lincoln&#x27;s brief Gettysburg Address in their 1890 multi-volume biography of Lincoln, Hay&#x27;s diary states &quot;the President, in a firm, free way, with more grace than is his wont, said his half-dozen lines of consecration.&quot;

===Presidential emissary===

Lincoln sent Hay away from the White House on various missions. In August 1861, Hay escorted Mary Lincoln and her children to Long Branch, New Jersey, a resort on the Jersey Shore, both as their caretaker and as a means of giving Hay a much-needed break. The following month, Lincoln sent him to Missouri to deliver a letter to Union General John C. Frémont, who had irritated the President with military blunders and by freeing local slaves without authorization, endangering Lincoln&#x27;s attempts to keep the border states in the Union.

In April 1863, Lincoln sent Hay to the Union-occupied South Carolina coast to report back on the ironclad vessels being used in an attempt to recapture Charleston Harbor. Hay then went on to the Florida coast. He returned to Florida in January 1864, after Lincoln had announced his Ten Percent Plan, that if ten percent of the 1860 electorate in a state took oaths of loyalty and to support emancipation, they could form a government with federal protection. Lincoln considered Florida, with its small population, a good test case, and made Hay a major, sending him to see if he could get sufficient men to take the oath. Hay spent a month in the state during February and March 1864, but Union defeats there reduced the area under federal control. Believing his mission impractical, he sailed back to Washington.

In July 1864, New York publisher Horace Greeley sent word to Lincoln that there were Southern peace emissaries in Canada. Lincoln doubted that they actually spoke for Confederate President Jefferson Davis, but had Hay journey to New York to persuade the publisher to go to Niagara Falls, Ontario, to meet with them and bring them to Washington. Greeley reported to Lincoln that the emissaries lacked accreditation by Davis, but were confident they could bring both sides together. Lincoln sent Hay to Ontario with what became known as the Niagara Manifesto: that if the South laid down its arms, freed the slaves, and reentered the Union, it could expect liberal terms on other points. The Southerners refused to come to Washington to negotiate.

===Assassination of Lincoln===

By the end of 1864, with Lincoln reelected and the victorious war winding down, both Hay and Nicolay let it be known that they desired different jobs. Soon after Lincoln&#x27;s second inauguration in March 1865, the two secretaries were appointed to the US delegation in Paris, Nicolay as consul and Hay as secretary of legation. Hay wrote to his brother Charles that the appointment was &quot;entirely unsolicited and unexpected&quot;, a statement that Kushner and Sherrill found unconvincing given that Hay had spent hundreds of hours during the war with Secretary of State William H. Seward, who had often discussed personal and political matters with him, and the close relationship between the two men was so well known that office-seekers cultivated Hay as a means of getting to Seward. The two men were also motivated to find new jobs by their deteriorating relationship with Mary Lincoln, who sought their ouster, and by Nicolay&#x27;s desire to wed his intended—he could not bring a bride to his shared room at the White House. They remained at the White House pending the arrival and training of replacements.

Hay did not accompany the Lincolns to Ford&#x27;s Theatre on the night of April 14, 1865, but remained at the White House, drinking whiskey with Robert Lincoln. When the two were informed that the President had been shot, they hastened to the Petersen House, a boarding house where the stricken Lincoln had been taken. Hay remained by Lincoln&#x27;s deathbed through the night and was present when he died. At the moment of Lincoln&#x27;s death, Hay observed &quot;a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features&quot;. He heard War Secretary Edwin Stanton&#x27;s declaration, &quot;Now he belongs to the ages.&quot;

According to Kushner and Sherrill, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s death was for Hay a personal loss, like the loss of a father ... Lincoln&#x27;s assassination erased any remaining doubts Hay had about Lincoln&#x27;s greatness.&quot; In 1866, in a personal letter, Hay deemed Lincoln, &quot;the greatest character since Christ&quot;. Taliaferro noted that &quot;Hay would spend the rest of his life mourning Lincoln ... wherever Hay went and whatever he did, Lincoln would &quot;always&quot; be watching&quot;.

==Early diplomatic career==
Hay sailed for Paris at the end of June 1865. There, he served under U.S. Minister to France John Bigelow. The workload was not heavy, and Hay found time to enjoy the pleasures of Paris. When Bigelow resigned in mid-1866, Hay, as was customary, submitted his resignation, though he was asked to remain until Bigelow&#x27;s successor was in place, and stayed until January 1867. He consulted with Secretary of State Seward, asking him for &quot;anything worth having&quot;. Seward suggested the post of Minister to Sweden, but reckoned without the new president, Andrew Johnson, who had his own candidate. Seward offered Hay a job as his private secretary, but Hay declined, and returned home to Warsaw, Illinois.

Initially happy to be home, Hay quickly grew restive, and he was glad to hear, in early June 1867, that he had been appointed secretary of legation to act as chargé d&#x27;affaires at Vienna. He sailed for Europe the same month, and while in England visited the House of Commons, where he was greatly impressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Benjamin Disraeli. The Vienna post was only temporary, until Johnson could appoint a chargé d&#x27;affaires and have him confirmed by the Senate, and the workload was light, allowing Hay, who was fluent in German, to spend much of his time traveling. It was not until July 1868 that Henry Watts became Hay&#x27;s replacement. Hay resigned, spent the remainder of the summer in Europe, then went home to Warsaw.

Unemployed again, in December 1868 Hay journeyed to the capital, writing to Nicolay that he &quot;came to Washington in the peaceful pursuit of a fat office. But there is nothing just now available&quot;. Seward promised to &quot;wrestle with Andy for anything that turns up&quot;, but nothing did prior to the departure of both Seward and Johnson from office on March 4, 1869. In May, Hay went back to Washington from Warsaw to press his case with the new Grant administration. The next month, due to the influence of his friends, he obtained the post of secretary of legation in Spain.

Although the salary was low, Hay was interested in serving in Madrid both because of the political situation there—Queen Isabella II had recently been deposed—and because the U.S. Minister was the swashbuckling former congressman, General Daniel Sickles. Hay hoped to assist Sickles in gaining U.S. control over Cuba, then a Spanish colony. Sickles was unsuccessful and Hay resigned in May 1870, citing the low salary, but remaining in his post until September. Two legacies of Hay&#x27;s time in Madrid were magazine articles he wrote that became the basis of his first book, &quot;Castilian Days&quot;, and his lifelong friendship with Sickles&#x27;s personal secretary, Alvey A. Adee, who would be a close aide to Hay at the State Department.

==Wilderness years (1870–1897)==
===&quot;Tribune&quot; and marriage===
While still in Spain, Hay had been offered the position of assistant editor at the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;—both the editor, Horace Greeley, and his managing editor, Whitelaw Reid, were anxious to hire Hay. He joined the staff in October 1870. The &quot;Tribune&quot; was the leading reform newspaper in New York, and through mail subscriptions, the largest-circulating newspaper in the nation. Hay wrote editorials for the &quot;Tribune&quot;, and Greeley soon proclaimed him the most brilliant writer of &quot;breviers&quot; (as such editorials were called) that he had ever had.

With his success as an editorial writer, Hay&#x27;s duties expanded. In October 1871, he journeyed to Chicago after the great fire there, interviewing Mrs. O&#x27;Leary, whose cow was said to have started the blaze, describing her as &quot;a woman with a lamp [who went] to the barn behind the house, to milk the cow with the crumpled temper, that kicked the lamp, that spilled the kerosene, that fired the straw that burned Chicago&quot;. His work at the &quot;Tribune&quot; came as his fame as a poet was reaching its peak, and one colleague described it as &quot;a liberal education in the delights of intellectual life to sit in intimate companionship with John Hay and watch the play of that well-stored and brilliant mind&quot;. In addition to writing, Hay was signed by the prestigious Boston Lyceum Bureau, whose clients included Mark Twain and Susan B. Anthony, to give lectures on the prospects for democracy in Europe, and on his years in the Lincoln White House.

By the time President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant&#x27;s administration had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected members of his party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in by the Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay&#x27;s stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.

By 1873, Hay was wooing Clara Stone, daughter of Cleveland multimillionaire railroad and banking mogul Amasa Stone. Their marriage in 1874 made the salary attached to office a small consideration for the rest of his life. Amasa Stone needed someone to watch over his investments, and wanted Hay to move to Cleveland to fill the post. Although the Hays initially lived in John&#x27;s New York apartment and later in a townhouse there, they moved in June 1875 to Stone&#x27;s ornate home on Cleveland&#x27;s Euclid Avenue, &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot;, and a mansion was quickly under construction for the Hays next-door. The Hays had four children, Helen Hay Whitney, Adelbert Stone Hay, Alice Evelyn Hay Wadsworth Boyd (who married James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr.), and Clarence Leonard Hay. Their father proved successful as a money manager, though he devoted much of his time to literary and political activities, writing to Adee that &quot;I do nothing but read and yawn&quot;.

On December 29, 1876, a bridge over Ohio&#x27;s Ashtabula River collapsed. The bridge had been built from metal cast at one of Stone&#x27;s mills, and was carrying a train owned and operated by Stone&#x27;s Lake Shore and Michigan Railway. Ninety-two people died; it was the worst rail disaster in American history up to that point. Blame fell heavily on Stone, who departed for Europe to recuperate and left Hay in charge of his businesses. The summer of 1877 was marked by labor disputes; a strike over wage cuts on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad soon spread to the Lake Shore, much to Hay&#x27;s outrage. He blamed foreign agitators for the dispute, and vented his anger over the strike in his only novel, &quot;The Bread-Winners&quot; (1883).

===Return to politics===

Hay remained disaffected from the Republican Party in the mid-1870s. Seeking a candidate of either party he could support as a reformer, he watched as his favored Democrat, Samuel Tilden, gained his party&#x27;s nomination, but his favored Republican, James G. Blaine, did not, falling to Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, whom Hay did not support during the campaign. Hayes&#x27;s victory in the election left Hay an outsider as he sought a return to politics, and he was initially offered no place in the new administration. Nevertheless, Hay attempted to ingratiate himself with the new president by sending him a gold ring with a strand of George Washington&#x27;s hair, a gesture that Hayes deeply appreciated. Hay spent time working with Nicolay on their Lincoln biography, and traveling in Europe. When Reid, who had succeeded Greeley as editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot;, was offered the post of Minister to Germany in December 1878, he turned it down and recommended Hay. Secretary of State William M. Evarts indicated that Hay &quot;had not been active enough in political efforts&quot;, to Hay&#x27;s regret, who told Reid that he &quot;would like a second-class mission uncommonly well&quot;.

From May to October 1879, Hay set out to reconfirm his credentials as a loyal Republican, giving speeches in support of candidates and attacking the Democrats. In October, President and Mrs. Hayes came to a reception at Hay&#x27;s Cleveland home. When Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward resigned later that month, Hay was offered his place and accepted, after some hesitancy because he was considering running for Congress.

In Washington, Hay oversaw a staff of eighty employees, renewed his acquaintance with his friend Henry Adams, and substituted for Evarts at Cabinet meetings when the Secretary was out of town. In 1880, he campaigned for the Republican nominee for president, his fellow Ohioan, Congressman James A. Garfield. Hay felt that Garfield did not have enough backbone, and hoped that Reid and others would &quot;inoculate him with the gall which I fear he lacks&quot;. Garfield consulted Hay before and after his election as president on appointments and other matters, but offered Hay only the post of private secretary (though he promised to increase its pay and power), and Hay declined. Hay resigned as assistant secretary effective March 31, 1881, and spent the next seven months as acting editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot; during Reid&#x27;s extended absence in Europe. Garfield&#x27;s death in September and Reid&#x27;s return the following month left Hay again on the outside of political power, looking in. He would spend the next fifteen years in that position.

===Wealthy traveler (1881–1897)===
====Author and dilettante====
After 1881, Hay did not again hold public office until 1897. Amasa Stone committed suicide in 1883; his death left the Hays very wealthy. They spent several months in most years traveling in Europe. The Lincoln biography absorbed some of Hay&#x27;s time, the hardest work being done with Nicolay in 1884 and 1885; beginning in 1886, portions began appearing serially, and the ten-volume biography was published in 1890.

In 1884, Hay and Adams commissioned architect Henry Hobson Richardson to construct houses for them on Washington&#x27;s Lafayette Square; these were completed by 1886. Hay&#x27;s house, facing the White House and fronting on Sixteenth Street, was described even before completion as &quot;the finest house in Washington.&quot; The price for the combined tract, purchased from William Wilson Corcoran, was $73,800, of which Adams paid a third for his lot. Hay budgeted the construction cost at $50,000; his ornate, mansion eventually cost over twice that. Despite their possession of two lavish houses, the Hays spent less than half the year in Washington and only a few weeks a year in Cleveland. They also spent time at The Fells, their summer residence in Newbury, New Hampshire. According to Gale, &quot;for a full decade before his appointment in 1897 as ambassador to England, Hay was lazy and uncertain.&quot;

Hay continued to devote much of his energy to Republican politics. In 1884, he supported Blaine for president, donating considerable sums to the senator&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign against New York Governor Grover Cleveland. Many of Hay&#x27;s friends were unenthusiastic about Blaine&#x27;s candidacy, to Hay&#x27;s anger, and he wrote to editor Richard Watson Gilder, &quot;I have never been able to appreciate the logic that induces some excellent people every four years because they cannot nominate the candidate they prefer to vote for the party they don&#x27;t prefer.&quot; In 1888, Hay had to follow his own advice as his favored candidate, Ohio Senator John Sherman, was unsuccessful at the Republican convention. After some reluctance, Hay supported the nominee, former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected. Though Harrison appointed men whom Hay supported, including Blaine, Reid, and Robert Lincoln, Hay was not asked to serve in the Harrison administration. In 1890, Hay spoke for Republican congressional candidates, addressing a rally of 10,000 people in New York City, but the party was defeated, losing control of Congress. Hay contributed funds to Harrison&#x27;s unsuccessful re-election effort, in part because Reid had been made Harrison&#x27;s 1892 running mate.

====McKinley backer====

Hay was an early supporter of Ohio&#x27;s William McKinley and worked closely with McKinley&#x27;s political manager, Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. In 1889, Hay supported McKinley in his unsuccessful effort to become Speaker of the House. Four years later, McKinley—by then Governor of Ohio—faced a crisis when a friend whose notes he had imprudently co-signed went bankrupt during the Panic of 1893. The debts were beyond the governor&#x27;s means to pay, and the possibility of insolvency threatened McKinley&#x27;s promising political career. Hay was among those Hanna called upon to contribute, buying up $3,000 of the debt of over $100,000. Although others paid more, &quot;Hay&#x27;s checks were two of the first, and his touch was more personal, a kindness McKinley never forgot&quot;. The governor wrote, &quot;How can I ever repay you &amp; other dear friends?&quot;

The same panic that nearly ruined McKinley convinced Hay that men like himself must take office to save the country from disaster. By the end of 1894, he was deeply involved in efforts to lay the groundwork for the governor&#x27;s 1896 presidential bid. It was Hay&#x27;s job to persuade potential supporters that McKinley was worth backing. Nevertheless, Hay found time for a lengthy stay in New Hampshire—one visitor at The Fells in mid-1895 was Rudyard Kipling—and later in the year wrote, &quot;The summer wanes and I have done nothing for McKinley.&quot; He atoned with a $500 check to Hanna, the first of many. During the winter of 1895–96, Hay passed along what he heard from other Republicans influential in Washington, such as Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.

Hay spent part of the spring and early summer of 1896 in the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in Europe. There was a border dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana, and Cleveland&#x27;s Secretary of State, Richard Olney, supported the Venezuelan position, announcing the Olney interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. Hay told British politicians that McKinley, if elected, would be unlikely to change course. McKinley was nominated in June 1896; still, many Britons were minded to support whoever became the Democratic candidate. This changed when the 1896 Democratic National Convention nominated former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan on a &quot;free silver&quot; platform; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech. Hay reported to McKinley when he returned to Britain after a brief stay on the Continent during which Bryan was nominated in Chicago: &quot;they were all scared out of their wits for fear Bryan would be elected, and very polite in their references to you.&quot;

Once Hay returned to the United States in early August, he went to The Fells and watched from afar as Bryan barnstormed the nation in his campaign while McKinley gave speeches from his front porch. Despite an invitation from the candidate, Hay was reluctant to visit McKinley at his home in Canton. &quot;He has asked me to come, but I thought I would not struggle with the millions on his trampled lawn&quot;. In October, after basing himself at his Cleveland home and giving a speech for McKinley, Hay went to Canton at last, writing to Adams,

Hay was disgusted by Bryan&#x27;s speeches, writing in language that Taliaferro compares to &quot;The Bread-Winners&quot; that the Democrat &quot;simply reiterates the unquestioned truths that every man with a clean shirt is a thief and ought to be hanged: that there is no goodness and wisdom except among the illiterate &amp; criminal classes&quot;. Despite Bryan&#x27;s strenuous efforts, McKinley won the election easily, with a campaign run by himself and Hanna, and well-financed by supporters like Hay. Henry Adams later wondered, &quot;I would give sixpence to know how much Hay paid for McKinley. His politics must have cost.&quot;

==Ambassador==
===Appointment===
In the post-election speculation as to who would be given office under McKinley, Hay&#x27;s name figured prominently, as did that of Whitelaw Reid; both men sought high office in the State Department, either as secretary or one of the major ambassadorial posts. Reid, in addition to his vice-presidential run, had been Minister to France under Harrison. An asthmatic, he handicapped himself by departing for Arizona Territory for the winter, leading to speculation about his health.
Hay was faster than Reid to realize that the race for these posts would be affected by Hanna&#x27;s desire to be senator from Ohio, as with one of the state&#x27;s places about to be occupied by the newly elected Joseph B. Foraker, the only possible seat for him was that held by Senator Sherman. As the septuagenarian senator had served as Treasury Secretary under Hayes, only the secretaryship of state was likely to attract him and cause a vacancy that Hanna could fill. Hay knew that with only eight cabinet positions, only one could go to an Ohioan, and so he had no chance for a cabinet post. Accordingly, Hay encouraged Reid to seek the State position, while firmly ruling himself out as a possible candidate for that post, and quietly seeking the inside track to be ambassador in London. Zeitz states that Hay &quot;aggressively lobbied&quot; for the position.

According to Taliaferro, &quot;only after the deed was accomplished and Hay was installed as the ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s would it be possible to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend, Whitelaw Reid&quot;. A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latter&#x27;s papers, dated December 26 (most likely 1896) reveals the former&#x27;s suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editor&#x27;s friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office, especially in London&#x27;s smoggy climes. The following month, in a letter, Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship, and urged McKinley to act quickly, as suitable accommodations in London would be difficult to secure. Hay gained his object (as did Hanna), and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid. Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay, but Kushner and Sherrill recorded, &quot;Reid was certain that he had been wronged&quot; by Hay, and the announcement of Hay&#x27;s appointment nearly ended their 26-year friendship.

Reaction in Britain to Hay&#x27;s appointment was generally positive, with George Smalley of &quot;The Times&quot; writing to him, &quot;we want a man who is a true American yet not anti-English&quot;. Hay secured a Georgian house on Carlton House Terrace, overlooking Horse Guards Parade, with 11 servants. He brought with him Clara, their own silver, two carriages, and five horses. Hay&#x27;s salary of $17,000 &quot;did not even begin to cover the cost of their extravagant lifestyle&quot;.

===Service===

During his service as ambassador, Hay attempted to advance the relationship between the U.S. and Britain. The United Kingdom had long been seen negatively by many Americans, a legacy of its role during the American Revolution that was refreshed by its neutrality in the American Civil War, when it allowed merchant raiders such as the &quot;Alabama&quot; to be constructed in British ports, which then preyed on US-flagged ships. In spite of these past differences, according to Taliaferro, &quot;rapprochement made more sense than at any time in their respective histories&quot;. In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897, Hay echoed these points, &quot;The great body of people in the United States and England are friends ... [sharing] that intense respect and reverence for order, liberty, and law which is so profound a sentiment in both countries&quot;. Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.

An ongoing dispute between the U.S. and Britain was over the practice of pelagic sealing, that is, the capture of seals offshore of Alaska. The U.S. considered them American resources; the Canadians (Britain was still responsible for that dominion&#x27;s foreign policy) contended that the mammals were being taken on the high seas, free to all. Soon after Hay&#x27;s arrival, McKinley sent former Secretary of State John W. Foster to London to negotiate the issue. Foster quickly issued an accusatory note to the British that was printed in the newspapers. Although Hay was successful in getting Lord Salisbury, then both Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, to agree to a conference to decide the matter, the British withdrew when the U.S. also invited Russia and Japan, rendering the conference ineffective. Another issue on which no agreement was reached was that of bimetallism: McKinley had promised silver-leaning Republicans to seek an international agreement varying the price ratio between silver and gold to allow for free coinage of silver, and Hay was instructed to seek British participation. The British would only join if the Indian colonial government (on a silver standard until 1893) was willing; this did not occur, and coupled with an improving economic situation that decreased support for bimetallism in the United States, no agreement was reached.

Hay had little involvement in the crisis over Cuba that culminated in the Spanish–American War. He met with Lord Salisbury in October 1897 and gained assurances Britain would not intervene if the U.S. found it necessary to go to war against Spain. Hay&#x27;s role was &quot;to make friends and to pass along the English point of view to Washington&quot;. Hay spent much of early 1898 on an extended trip to the Middle East, and did not return to London until the last week of March, by which time the USS &quot;Maine&quot; had exploded in Havana harbor. During the war, he worked to ensure U.S.–British amity, and British acceptance of the U.S. occupation of the Philippines—Salisbury and his government preferred that the U.S. have the islands than have them fall into the hands of the Germans. Hay succeeded in making sure that the British were kept &quot;in the loop&quot; with regards to the U.S. invasion of Cuba, and in both reassuring the British that none of their interests in Cuba would be harmed by the invasion, while simultaneously communicating those interests to the McKinley administration (McKinley was himself keen on maintaining a good relationship with the British).

In its early days, Hay described the war &quot;as necessary as it is righteous&quot;. In July, writing to former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, who had gained wartime glory by leading the Rough Riders volunteer regiment, Hay made a description of the war for which, according to Zeitz, he &quot;is best remembered by many students of American history&quot;:

Secretary Sherman had resigned on the eve of war, and been replaced by his first assistant, William R. Day. One of McKinley&#x27;s Canton cronies, with little experience of statecraft, Day was never intended as more than a temporary wartime replacement. With America about to splash her flag across the Pacific, McKinley needed a secretary with stronger credentials. On August 14, 1898, Hay received a telegram from McKinley that Day would head the American delegation to the peace talks with Spain, and that Hay would be the new Secretary of State. After some indecision, Hay, who did not think he could decline and still remain as ambassador, accepted. British response to Hay&#x27;s promotion was generally positive, and Queen Victoria, after he took formal leave of her at Osborne House, invited him again the following day, and subsequently pronounced him, &quot;the most interesting of all the Ambassadors I have known.&quot;

==Secretary of State==
===McKinley years===

John Hay was sworn in as Secretary of State on September 30, 1898. He needed little introduction to Cabinet meetings, and sat at the President&#x27;s right hand. Meetings were held in the Cabinet Room of the White House, where he found his old office and bedroom each occupied by several clerks. Now responsible for 1,300 federal employees, he leaned heavily for administrative help on his old friend Alvey Adee, the second assistant. 

Hay believed that America&#x27;s most valuable foreign relationship &quot;by far&quot; was its relationship with Great Britain. As Secretary of State he did everything he could to cultivate a positive relationship with London. Eventually this proved successful, one example of this success being the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty. Hay formed a habit of confiding in the British, and sharing sensitive intelligence with them, while at the same time shutting out the governments of Spain, France, Germany and Russia. Senator Mark Hanna remarked that &quot;Hay and McKinley are &quot;outrageously&quot; pro-British.&quot; The French ambassador remarked that &quot;Hay is friendly to the British and unfriendly to us, we should regard him with much suspicion.&quot;

By the time Hay took office, the war was effectively over and it had been decided to strip Spain of her overseas empire and transfer at least part of it to the United States. At the time of Hay&#x27;s swearing-in, McKinley was still undecided whether to take the Philippines, but in October finally decided to do so, and Hay sent instructions to Day and the other peace commissioners to insist on it. Spain yielded, and the result was the Treaty of Paris, narrowly ratified by the Senate in February 1899 over the objections of anti-imperialists.

====Open Door Policy====

By the 1890s, China had become a major trading partner for Western nations and newly westernized Japan. China had had its army severely weakened by several disastrous wars, and several foreign nations took the opportunity to negotiate treaties with China that allowed them to control various coastal cities-known as treaty ports-for use as military bases or trading centers. Within those jurisdictions, the nation in possession often gave preference to its own citizens in trade or in developing infrastructure such as railroads. Although the United States did not claim any parts of China, a third of the China trade was carried in American ships, and having an outpost near there was a major factor in deciding to retain the former Spanish colony of the Philippines in the Treaty of Paris.

Hay had been concerned about the Far East since the 1870s. As Ambassador, he had attempted to forge a common policy with the British, but the United Kingdom was willing to acquire territorial concessions in China (such as Hong Kong) to guard its interests there, whereas McKinley was not. In March 1898, Hay warned that Russia, Germany, and France were seeking to exclude Britain and America from the China trade, but he was disregarded by Sherman, who accepted assurances to the contrary from Russia and Germany.

McKinley was of the view that equality of opportunity for American trade in China was key to success there, rather than colonial acquisitions; that Hay shared these views was one reason for his appointment as Secretary of State. Many influential Americans, seeing coastal China being divided into spheres of influence, urged McKinley to join in; still, in his annual message to Congress in December 1898, he stated that as long as Americans were not discriminated against, he saw no need for the United States to become &quot;an actor in the scene&quot;.

As Secretary of State, it was Hay&#x27;s responsibility to put together a workable China policy. He was advised by William Rockhill, an old China hand. Also influential was Lord Charles Beresford, a British Member of Parliament who gave a number of speeches to American businessmen, met with McKinley and Hay, and in a letter to the secretary stated that &quot;it is imperative for American interests as well as our own that the policy of the &#x27;open door&#x27; should be maintained&quot;. Assuring that all would play on an even playing field in China would give the foreign powers little incentive to dismember the Chinese Empire through territorial acquisition.

In mid-1899, the British inspector of Chinese maritime customs, Alfred Hippisley, visited the United States. In a letter to Rockhill, a friend, he urged that the United States and other powers agree to uniform Chinese tariffs, including in the enclaves. Rockhill passed the letter on to Hay, and subsequently summarized the thinking of Hippisley and others, that there should be &quot;an open market through China for our trade on terms of equality with all other foreigners&quot;. Hay was in agreement, but feared Senate and popular opposition, and wanted to avoid Senate ratification of a treaty. Rockhill drafted the first Open Door note, calling for equality of commercial opportunity for foreigners in China.

Hay formally issued his Open Door note on September 6, 1899. This was not a treaty, and did not require the approval of the Senate. Most of the powers had at least some caveats, and negotiations continued through the remainder of the year. On March 20, 1900, Hay announced that all powers had agreed, and he was not contradicted. Former secretary Day wrote to Hay, congratulating him, &quot;moving at the right time and in the right manner, you have secured a diplomatic triumph in the &#x27;open door&#x27; in China of the first importance to your country&quot;.

====Boxer Rebellion====

Little thought was given to the Chinese reaction to the Open Door note; the Chinese minister in Washington, Wu Ting-fang, did not learn of it until he read of it in the newspapers. Among those in China who opposed Western influence there was a movement in Shantung Province, in the north, that became known as the Fists of Righteous Harmony, or Boxers, after the martial arts they practiced. The Boxers were especially angered by missionaries and their converts. As late as June 1900, Rockhill dismissed the Boxers, contending that they would soon disband. By the middle of that month, the Boxers, joined by imperial troops, had cut the railroad between Peking and the coast, killed many missionaries and converts, and besieged the foreign legations. Hay faced a precarious situation; how to rescue the Americans trapped in Peking, and how to avoid giving the other powers an excuse to partition China, in an election year when there was already Democrat opposition to what they deemed American imperialism.

As American troops were sent to China to relieve the nation&#x27;s legation, Hay sent a letter to foreign powers (often called the Second Open Door note), stating while the United States wanted to see lives preserved and the guilty punished, it intended that China not be dismembered. Hay issued this on July 3, 1900, suspecting that the powers were quietly making private arrangements to divide up China. Communication between the foreign legations and the outside world had been cut off, and the personnel there were falsely presumed slaughtered, but Hay realized that Minister Wu could get a message in, and Hay was able to establish communication. Hay suggested to the Chinese government that it now cooperate for its own good. When the foreign relief force, principally Japanese but including 2,000 Americans, relieved the legations and sacked Peking, China was made to pay a huge indemnity but there was no cession of land.

====Death of McKinley====

McKinley&#x27;s vice president, Garret Hobart, had died in November 1899. Under the laws then in force, this made Hay next in line to the presidency should anything happen to McKinley. There was a presidential election in 1900, and McKinley was unanimously renominated at the Republican National Convention that year. He allowed the convention to make its own choice of running mate, and it selected Roosevelt, by then governor of New York. Senator Hanna bitterly opposed that choice, but nevertheless raised millions for the McKinley/Roosevelt ticket, which was elected.

Hay accompanied McKinley on his nationwide train tour in mid-1901, during which both men visited California and saw the Pacific Ocean for the only times in their lives. The summer of 1901 was tragic for Hay; his older son Adelbert, who had been consul in Pretoria during the Boer War and was about to become McKinley&#x27;s personal secretary, died in a fall from a hotel window.

Secretary Hay was at The Fells when McKinley was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, on September 6 in Buffalo. With Vice President Roosevelt and much of the cabinet hastening to the bedside of McKinley, who had been operated on (it was thought successfully) soon after the shooting, Hay planned to go to Washington to manage the communication with foreign governments, but presidential secretary George Cortelyou urged him to come to Buffalo. He traveled to Buffalo on September 10; hearing on his arrival an account of the President&#x27;s recovery, Hay responded that McKinley would die. He was more cheerful after visiting McKinley, giving a statement to the press, and went to Washington, as Roosevelt and other officials also dispersed. Hay was about to return to New Hampshire on the 13th, when word came that McKinley was dying. Hay remained at his office and the next morning, on the way to Buffalo, the former Rough Rider received from Hay his first communication as head of state, officially informing President Roosevelt of McKinley&#x27;s death.

===Theodore Roosevelt administration===
====Staying on====

Hay, again next in line to the presidency, remained in Washington as McKinley&#x27;s body was transported to the capital by funeral train, and stayed there as the late president was taken to Canton for interment. He had admired McKinley, describing him as &quot;awfully like Lincoln in many respects&quot; and wrote to a friend, &quot;what a strange and tragic fate it has been of mine—to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends, Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen to be head of the State, and all done to death by assassins&quot;.

By letter, Hay offered his resignation to Roosevelt while the new president was still in Buffalo, amid newspaper speculation that Hay would be replaced. When Hay met the funeral train in Washington, Roosevelt greeted him at the station and immediately told him he must stay on as secretary. According to Zeitz, &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s accidental ascendance to the presidency made John Hay an essential anachronism ... the wise elder statesman and senior member of the cabinet, he was indispensable to TR, who even today remains the youngest president ever&quot;.

The deaths of his son and of McKinley were not the only griefs Hay suffered in 1901—on September 26, John Nicolay died after a long illness, as did Hay&#x27;s close friend Clarence King on Christmas Eve.

====Panama====
Hay&#x27;s involvement in the efforts to have a canal joining the oceans in Central America went back to his time as Assistant Secretary of State under President Hayes, when he served as translator for Ferdinand de Lesseps in his efforts to interest the American government in investing in his canal company. Hayes was only interested in the idea of a canal under American control, which de Lesseps&#x27;s project would not be. By the time Hay became Secretary of State, de Lesseps&#x27;s project in Panama (then a Colombian province) had collapsed, as had an American-run project in Nicaragua. The 1850 Clayton–Bulwer Treaty (between the United States and Britain) forbade the United States from building a Central American canal that it exclusively controlled, and Hay, from early in his tenure, sought the removal of this restriction. But the Canadians, for whose foreign policy Britain was still available, saw the canal matter as their greatest leverage to get other disputes resolved in their favor, persuaded Salisbury not to resolve it independently. Shortly before Hay took office, Britain and the U.S. agreed to establish a Joint High Commission to adjudicate unsettled matters, which met in late 1898 but made slow progress, especially on the Canada-Alaska boundary.

The Alaska issue became less contentious in August 1899 when the Canadians accepted a provisional boundary pending final settlement. With Congress anxious to begin work on a canal bill, and increasingly likely to ignore the Clayton-Bulwer restriction, Hay and British Ambassador Julian Pauncefote began work on a new treaty in January 1900. The first Hay–Pauncefote Treaty was sent to the Senate the following month, where it met a cold reception, as the terms forbade the United States from blockading or fortifying the canal, that was to be open to all nations in wartime as in peace. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee added an amendment allowing the U.S. to fortify the canal, then in March postponed further consideration until after the 1900 election. Hay submitted his resignation, which McKinley refused. The treaty, as amended, was ratified by the Senate in December, but the British would not agree to the changes.

Despite the lack of agreement, Congress was enthusiastic about a canal, and was inclined to move forward, with or without a treaty. Authorizing legislation was slowed by discussion on whether to take the Nicaraguan or Panamanian route. Much of the negotiation of a revised treaty, allowing the U.S. to fortify the canal, took place between Hay&#x27;s replacement in London, Joseph H. Choate, and the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne, and the second Hay–Pauncefote Treaty was ratified by the Senate by a large margin on December 6, 1901.

Seeing that the Americans were likely to build a Nicaragua Canal, the owners of the defunct French company, including Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered their price. Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for it, if it could be secured within a reasonable time. In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia&#x27;s acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay–Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.

Roosevelt was minded to build the canal anyway, using an earlier treaty with Colombia that gave the U.S. transit rights in regard to the Panama Railroad. Hay predicted &quot;an insurrection on the Isthmus [of Panama] against that regime of folly and graft ... at Bogotá&quot;. Bunau-Varilla gained meetings with both men, and assured them that a revolution, and a Panamanian government more friendly to a canal, was coming. In October, Roosevelt ordered Navy ships to be stationed near Panama. The Panamanians duly revolted in early November 1903, with Colombian interference deterred by the presence of U.S. forces. By prearrangement, Bunau-Varilla was appointed representative of the nascent nation in Washington, and quickly negotiated the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, signed on November 18, giving the United States the right to build the canal in a zone wide, over which the U.S. would exercise full jurisdiction. This was less than satisfactory to the Panamanian diplomats who arrived in Washington shortly after the signing, but they did not dare renounce it. The treaty was approved by the two nations, and work on the Panama Canal began in 1904. Hay wrote to Secretary of War Elihu Root, praising &quot;the perfectly regular course which the President did follow&quot; as much preferable to armed occupation of the isthmus.

====Relationship with Roosevelt, other events====
Hay had met the President&#x27;s father, Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., during the Civil War, and during his time at the &quot;Tribune&quot; came to know the adolescent &quot;Teddy&quot;, twenty years younger than himself. Although before becoming president Roosevelt often wrote fulsome letters of praise to Secretary Hay, his letters to others then and later were less complimentary. Hay felt Roosevelt too impulsive, and privately opposed his inclusion on the ticket in 1900, though he quickly wrote a congratulatory note after the convention.

As President and Secretary of State, the two men took pains to cultivate a cordial relationship. Roosevelt read all ten volumes of the Lincoln biography and in mid-1903, wrote to Hay that by then &quot;I have had a chance to know far more fully what a really great Secretary of State you are&quot;. Hay for his part publicly praised Roosevelt as &quot;young, gallant, able, [and] brilliant&quot;, words that Roosevelt wrote that he hoped would be engraved on his tombstone.

Privately, and in correspondence with others, they were less generous: Hay grumbled that while McKinley would give him his full attention, Roosevelt was always busy with others, and it would be &quot;an hour&#x27;s wait for a minute&#x27;s talk&quot;. Roosevelt, after Hay&#x27;s death in 1905, wrote to Senator Lodge that Hay had not been &quot;a great Secretary of State ... under me he accomplished little ... his usefulness to me was almost exclusively the usefulness of a fine figurehead&quot;. Nevertheless, when Roosevelt successfully sought election in his own right in 1904, he persuaded the aging and infirm Hay to campaign for him, and Hay gave a speech linking the administration&#x27;s policies with those of Lincoln: &quot;there is not a principle avowed by the Republican party to-day which is out of harmony with his [Lincoln&#x27;s] teaching or inconsistent with his character.&quot; Kushner and Sherrill suggested that the differences between Hay and Roosevelt were more style than ideological substance.

In December 1902, the German government asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its dispute with Venezuela over unpaid debts. Hay did not think this appropriate, as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money, and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in. Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, &quot;I have it all arranged. If Teddy will keep his mouth shut until tomorrow noon!&quot; Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. The commission was to be composed of &quot;impartial jurists&quot; and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. Although Hay was supportive of the President&#x27;s choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.
One incident involving Hay that benefitted Roosevelt politically was the kidnapping of Greek-American playboy Ion Perdicaris in Morocco by chieftain Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli, an opponent of Sultan Abdelaziz. Raisuli demanded a ransom, but also wanted political prisoners to be released and control of Tangier in place of the military governor. Raisuli supposed Perdicaris to be a wealthy American, and hoped United States pressure would secure his demands. In fact, Perdicaris, though born in New Jersey, had renounced his citizenship during the Civil War to avoid Confederate confiscation of property in South Carolina, and had accepted Greek naturalization, a fact not generally known until years later, but that decreased Roosevelt&#x27;s appetite for military action. The sultan was ineffective in dealing with the incident, and Roosevelt considered seizing the Tangier waterfront, source of much of Abdelaziz&#x27;s income, as a means of motivating him. With Raisuli&#x27;s demands escalating, Hay, with Roosevelt&#x27;s approval, finally cabled the consul-general in Tangier, Samuel Gummeré:

The 1904 Republican National Convention was in session, and the Speaker of the House, Joseph Cannon, its chair, read the first sentence of the cable—and only the first sentence—to the convention, electrifying what had been a humdrum coronation of Roosevelt. &quot;The results were perfect. This was the fighting Teddy that America loved, and his frenzied supporters—and American chauvinists everywhere—roared in delight.&quot; In fact, by then the sultan had already agreed to the demands, and Perdicaris was released. What was seen as tough talk boosted Roosevelt&#x27;s election chances.

====Final months and death====
Hay never fully recovered from the death of his son Adelbert, writing in 1904 to his close friend Lizzie Cameron that &quot;the death of our boy made my wife and me old, at once and for the rest of our lives&quot;. Gale described Hay in his final years as a &quot;saddened, slowly dying old man&quot;.

Although Hay gave speeches in support of Roosevelt, he spent much of the fall of 1904 at his New Hampshire house or with his younger brother Charles, who was ill in Boston. After the election, Roosevelt asked Hay to remain another four years. Hay asked for time to consider, but the President did not allow it, announcing to the press two days later that Hay would stay at his post. Early 1905 saw futility for Hay, as a number of treaties he had negotiated were defeated or amended by the Senate—one involving the British dominion of Newfoundland due to Senator Lodge&#x27;s fears it would harm his fisherman constituents. Others, promoting arbitration, were voted down or amended because the Senate did not want to be bypassed in the settlement of international disputes.

By Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration on March 4, 1905, Hay&#x27;s health was so bad that both his wife and his friend Henry Adams insisted on his going to Europe, where he could rest and get medical treatment. Presidential doctor Presley Rixey issued a statement that Hay was suffering from overwork, but in letters the secretary hinted his conviction that he did not have long to live. An eminent physician in Italy prescribed medicinal baths for Hay&#x27;s heart condition, and he duly journeyed to Bad Nauheim, near Frankfurt, Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm II was among the monarchs who wrote to Hay asking him to visit, though he declined; Belgian King Leopold II succeeded in seeing him by showing up at his hotel, unannounced. Adams suggested that Hay retire while there was still enough life left in him to do so, and that Roosevelt would be delighted to act as his own Secretary of State. Hay jokingly wrote to sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens that &quot;there is nothing the matter with me except old age, the Senate, and one or two other mortal maladies&quot;.

After the course of treatment, Hay went to Paris and began to take on his workload again by meeting with the French foreign minister, Théophile Delcassé. In London, King Edward VII broke protocol by meeting with Hay in a small drawing room, and Hay lunched with Whitelaw Reid, ambassador in London at last. There was not time to see all who wished to see Hay on what he knew was his final visit.

On his return to the United States, despite his family&#x27;s desire to take him to New Hampshire, the secretary went to Washington to deal with departmental business and &quot;say &quot;Ave Caesar!&quot; to the President&quot;, as Hay put it. He was pleased to learn that Roosevelt was well on his way to settling the Russo-Japanese War, an action for which the President would win the Nobel Peace Prize. Hay left Washington for the last time on June 23, 1905, arriving in New Hampshire the following day. He died there on July 1 of his heart ailment and complications. Hay was interred in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, near the grave of Garfield, in the presence of Roosevelt and many dignitaries, including Robert Lincoln.

==Literary career==
===Early works===
Hay wrote some poetry while at Brown University, and more during the Civil War. In 1865, early in his Paris stay, Hay penned &quot;Sunrise in the Place de la Concorde&quot;, a poem attacking Napoleon III for his reinstitution of the monarchy, depicting the Emperor as having been entrusted with the child Democracy by Liberty, and strangling it with his own hands. In &quot;A Triumph of Order&quot;, set in the breakup of the Paris Commune, a boy promises soldiers that he will return from an errand to be executed with his fellow rebels. Much to their surprise, he keeps his word and shouts to them to &quot;blaze away&quot; as &quot;The Chassepots tore the stout young heart,/And saved Society.&quot;

In poetry, he sought the revolutionary outcome for other nations that he believed had come to a successful conclusion in the United States. His 1871 poem, &quot;The Prayer of the Romans&quot;, recites Italian history up to that time, with the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; in progress: liberty cannot be truly present until &quot;crosier and crown pass away&quot;, when there will be &quot;One freedom, one faith without fetters,/One republic in Italy free!&quot; His stay in Vienna yielded &quot;The Curse of Hungary&quot;, in which Hay foresees the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After Hay&#x27;s death in 1905, William Dean Howells suggested that the Europe-themed poems expressed &quot;(now, perhaps, old-fashioned) American sympathy for all the oppressed.&quot; &quot;Castilian Days&quot;, souvenir of Hay&#x27;s time in Madrid, is a collection of seventeen essays about Spanish history and customs, first published in 1871, although several of the individual chapters appeared in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 1870. It went through eight editions in Hay&#x27;s lifetime. The Spanish are depicted as afflicted by the &quot;triple curse of crown, crozier, and saber&quot;—most kings and ecclesiastics are presented as useless—and Hay pins his hope in the republican movement in Spain. Gale deems &quot;Castilian Days&quot; &quot;a remarkable, if biased, book of essays about Spanish civilization&quot;.

&quot;Pike County Ballads&quot;, a grouping of six poems published (with other Hay poetry) as a book in 1871, brought him great success. Written in the dialect of Pike County, Illinois, where Hay went to school as a child, they are approximately contemporaneous with pioneering poems in similar dialect by Bret Harte and there has been debate as to which came first. The poem that brought the greatest immediate reaction was &quot;Jim Bludso&quot;, about a boatman who is &quot;no saint&quot; with one wife in Mississippi and another in Illinois. Yet, when his steamboat catches fire, &quot;He saw his duty, a dead-sure thing,—/And went for it, ther and then.&quot; Jim holds the burning steamboat against the riverbank until the last passenger gets ashore, at the cost of his life. Hay&#x27;s narrator states that, &quot;And Christ ain&#x27;t a-going to be too hard/On a man that died for men.&quot; Hay&#x27;s poem offended some clergymen, but was widely reprinted and even included in anthologies of verse.

===&quot;The Bread-Winners&quot;===
&quot;The Bread-Winners&quot;, one of the first novels to take an anti-labor perspective, was published anonymously in 1883 (published editions did not bear Hay&#x27;s name until 1916) and he may have tried to disguise his writing style. The book examines two conflicts: between capital and labor, and between the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and old money. In writing it, Hay was influenced by the labor unrest of the 1870s, that affected him personally, as corporations belonging to Stone, his father-in-law, were among those struck, at a time when Hay had been left in charge in Stone&#x27;s absence. According to historian Scott Dalrymple, &quot;in response, Hay proceeded to write an indictment of organized labor so scathing, so vehement, that he dared not attach his name to it.&quot;

The major character is Arthur Farnham, a wealthy Civil War veteran, likely based on Hay. Farnham, who inherited money, is without much influence in municipal politics, as his ticket is defeated in elections, symbolic of the decreasing influence of America&#x27;s old-money patricians. The villain is Andrew Jackson Offitt (true name Ananias Offitt), who leads the Bread-winners, a labor organization that begins a violent general strike. Peace is restored by a group of veterans led by Farnham, and, at the end, he appears likely to marry Alice Belding, a woman of his own class.

Although unusual among the many books inspired by the labor unrest of the late 1870s in taking the perspective of the wealthy, it was the most successful of them, and was a sensation, gaining many favorable reviews. It was also attacked as an anti-labor polemic with an upper-class bias. There were many guesses as to authorship, with the supposed authors ranging from Hay&#x27;s friend Henry Adams to New York Governor Grover Cleveland, and the speculation fueled sales.

===Lincoln biography===

Early in his presidency, Hay and Nicolay requested and received permission from Lincoln to write his biography. By 1872, Hay was &quot;convinced that we ought to be at work on our &#x27;Lincoln.&#x27; I don&#x27;t think the time for publication has come, but the time for preparation is slipping away.&quot; Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father&#x27;s papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln&#x27;s papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, as well as many of the Civil War books already being published. They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay&#x27;s recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.

Hay began his part of the writing in 1876; the work was interrupted by illnesses of Hay, Nicolay, or family members, or by Hay&#x27;s writing of &quot;The Bread-Winners&quot;. By 1885, Hay had completed the chapters on Lincoln&#x27;s early life, and they were submitted to Robert Lincoln for approval. Sale of the serialization rights to &quot;The Century&quot; magazine, edited by Hay&#x27;s friend Richard Gilder, helped give the pair the impetus to bring what had become a massive project to an end.

The published work, &quot;Abraham Lincoln: A History&quot;, alternates parts in which Lincoln is at center with discussions of contextual matters, such as legislative events or battles. The first serial installment, published in November 1886, received positive reviews. When the ten-volume set emerged in 1890, it was not sold in bookstores, but instead door-to-door, then a common practice. Despite a price of $50, and the fact that a good part of the work had been serialized, five thousand copies were quickly sold. The books helped forge the modern view of Lincoln as great war leader, against competing narratives that gave more credit to subordinates such as Seward. According to historian Joshua Zeitz, &quot;it is easy to forget how widely underrated Lincoln the president and Lincoln the man were at the time of his death and how successful Hay and Nicolay were in elevating his place in the nation&#x27;s collective historical memory.&quot;

==Assessment and legacy==

In 1902, Hay wrote that when he died, &quot;I shall not be much missed except by my wife.&quot; Nevertheless, due to his premature death at age 66, he was survived by most of his friends. These included Adams, who although he blamed the pressures of Hay&#x27;s office, where he was badgered by Roosevelt and many senators, for the Secretary of State&#x27;s death, admitted that Hay had remained in the position because he feared being bored. He memorialized his friend in the final pages of his autobiographical &quot;The Education of Henry Adams&quot;: with Hay&#x27;s death, his own education had ended.

Gale pointed out that Hay &quot;accomplished a great deal in the realm of international statesmanship, and the world may be a better place because of his efforts as secretary of state ... the man was a scintillating ambassador&quot;. Yet, Gale felt, any assessment of Hay must include negatives as well, that after his marriage to the wealthy Clara Stone, Hay &quot;allowed his deep-seated love of ease triumph over his Middle Western devotion to work and a fair shake for all.&quot; Despite his literary accomplishments, Hay &quot;was often lazy. His first poetry was his best.&quot;
Taliaferro suggests that &quot;if Hay put any ... indelible stamp on history, perhaps it was that he demonstrated how the United States ought to comport itself. He, not Roosevelt, was the adult in charge when the nation and the State Department attained global maturity.&quot; He quotes John St. Loe Strachey, &quot;All that the world saw was a great gentleman and a great statesman doing his work for the State and for the President with perfect taste, perfect good sense, and perfect good humour&quot;.
Hay&#x27;s efforts to shape Lincoln&#x27;s image increased his own prominence and reputation in making his association (and that of Nicolay) with the assassinated president ever more remarkable and noteworthy. According to Zeitz, &quot;the greater Lincoln grew in death, the greater they grew for having known him so well, and so intimately, in life. Everyone wanted to know them if only to ask what it had been like—what &quot;he&quot; had been like.&quot; Their answer to that, expressed in ten volumes of biography, Gale wrote, &quot;has been incredibly influential&quot;. In 1974, Lincoln scholar Roy P. Basler stated that later biographers such as Carl Sandburg did not &quot;ma[k]e revisions of the essential story told by N.[icolay] &amp; H.[ay]. Zeitz concurs, &quot;Americans today understand Abraham Lincoln much as Nicolay and Hay hoped that they would.&quot;

Hay brought about more than 50 treaties, including the Canal-related treaties, and settlement of the Samoan dispute, as a result of which the United States secured what became known as American Samoa. In 1900, Hay negotiated a treaty with Denmark for the cession of the Danish West Indies. That treaty failed in the Danish parliament on a tied vote.

In 1923 Mount Hay, also known as &quot;Boundary Peak 167&quot; on the Canada–United States border, was named after John Hay in recognition of his role in negotiating the US-Canada treaty resulting in the Alaska Boundary Tribunal. Brown University&#x27;s John Hay Library is named for him as well. Hay&#x27;s New Hampshire estate has been conserved by various organizations. Although he and his family never lived there (Hay died while it was under construction), the Hay-McKinney House, home to the Cleveland History Center and thousands of artifacts, serves to remind Clevelanders of John Hay&#x27;s lengthy service. During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor. Camp John Hay a United States military base established in 1903 in Baguio, Philippines, was named for John Hay, and the base name was maintained by the Philippine government even after its 1991 turnover to Philippine authorities.

According to historian Lewis L. Gould, in his account of McKinley&#x27;s presidency,

<doc id="16579" wikidata="Q172763" url="?curid=16579" title="Joy Division">
<text>Joy Division were an English rock band formed in Salford in 1976. The group consisted of vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris.

Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division&#x27;s first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk rock, they soon developed a sparse sound and style that made them one of the pioneering groups of the post-punk genre. Their self-released 1978 debut EP &quot;An Ideal for Living&quot; drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979.

Curtis struggled with personal problems, including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band&#x27;s popularity grew, Curtis&#x27;s health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band&#x27;s first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division&#x27;s second and final album, &quot;Closer&quot;, was released two months later; it and the single &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; became their highest-charting releases.

Between July and October 1980, the remaining members, with the addition of keyboardist and guitarist Gillian Gilbert, regrouped under the name New Order. They were successful throughout the next decade, blending post-punk with electronic and dance music influences. In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
On 4 June 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook separately attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. Both were inspired by the Pistols&#x27; performance. Sumner said that he felt the Pistols &quot;destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship&quot;. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy a bass guitar. They formed a band with Terry Mason, who had also attended the gig; Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. After their schoolfriend Martin Gresty declined an invitation to join as vocalist after getting a job at a factory, the band placed an advertisement for a vocalist in the Manchester Virgin Records shop. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. Sumner said that he &quot;knew he was all right to get on with and that&#x27;s what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.&quot;

Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name &quot;Stiff Kittens&quot;, but the band settled on &quot;Warsaw&quot; shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Warszawa&quot;. Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the &quot;NME&quot; by Paul Morley and in &quot;Sounds&quot; by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band&#x27;s manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band the Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join the Panik, and even had Curtis audition. On 18 July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale&#x27;s aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off.

In August 1977, Warsaw placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian&#x27;s wife, stated that Morris &quot;fitted perfectly&quot; with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a &quot;complete &#x27;family. To avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing the name from the sexual slavery wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel &quot;House of Dolls&quot;. On 14 December, the group recorded their debut EP, &quot;An Ideal for Living&quot;, at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year&#x27;s Eve at the Swinging Apple in Liverpool. Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip&#x27;s Disco in Manchester.

=== Early releases ===
Joy Division were approached by RCA Records to record a cover of Nolan &quot;N.F.&quot; Porter&#x27;s &quot;Keep on Keepin&#x27; On&quot; at a Manchester recording studio. The band spent late March and April 1978 writing and rehearsing material. During the Stiff/Chiswick Challenge concert at Manchester&#x27;s Rafters club on 14 April, they caught the attention of TV music presenter Tony Wilson and manager Rob Gretton. Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his Granada Television show &quot;So It Goes&quot;; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV. Gretton, the venue&#x27;s resident DJ, was so impressed by the band&#x27;s performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager. Gretton, whose &quot;dogged determination&quot; was later credited for much of the band&#x27;s public success, contributed the business skills to provide Joy Division with a better foundation for creativity. Joy Division spent the first week of May 1978 recording at Manchester&#x27;s Arrow Studios. The band were unhappy with the Grapevine Records head John Anderson&#x27;s insistence on adding synthesiser into the mix to soften the sound, and asked to be dropped from the contract with RCA.

Joy Division made their recorded debut in June 1978 when the band self-released &quot;An Ideal for Living&quot;, and two weeks later their track &quot;At a Later Date&quot; was featured on the compilation album &quot;Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus&quot; (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review, Chris Brazier said that it &quot;has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they&#x27;re no mere drone-vendors—there are a lot of good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on&quot;. The packaging of &quot;An Ideal for Living&quot;—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band&#x27;s name fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later said they were intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris believed that the group&#x27;s dalliance with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band &quot;to keep on doing it, because that&#x27;s the kind of people we are&quot;.

On 20 September 1978, Joy Division made their television debut performing &quot;Shadowplay&quot; on &quot;So It Goes&quot;, with an introduction by Wilson. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7&quot; EP &quot;A Factory Sample&quot;, the first release by Tony Wilson&#x27;s record label, Factory Records. In the &quot;NME&quot; review of the EP, Paul Morley praised the band as &quot;the missing link&quot; between Elvis Presley and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Joy Division joined Factory&#x27;s roster, after buying themselves out of the RCA deal. Gretton was made a label partner to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, during the drive home from a gig at the Hope and Anchor in London, Curtis had his first recognised severe epileptic seizure and was hospitalised. Meanwhile, Joy Division&#x27;s career progressed, and Curtis appeared on the 13 January 1979 cover of &quot;NME&quot;. That month the band recorded their session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, &quot;Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realisation that Ian&#x27;s illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate&quot;.

=== &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; and breakthrough ===
Joy Division&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, was recorded at Strawberry Studios, Stockport, in April 1979. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, a fact that greatly displeased the band at the time; however, in 2006, Hook said that in retrospect Hannett had done a good job and &quot;created the Joy Division sound&quot;. The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who went on to provide artwork for future Joy Division and New Order releases.

&quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Wilson said the success turned the indie label into a true business and a &quot;revolutionary force&quot; that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, writer Jon Savage described the album as an &quot;opaque manifesto&quot; and declared it &quot;one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year&quot;.

Joy Division performed on Granada TV again on 20 July 1979, and made their only nationwide TV appearance on 15 September on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Something Else&quot;. They supported the Buzzcocks in a 24-venue UK tour that began that October, which allowed the band to quit their regular jobs. The non-album single &quot;Transmission&quot; was released in November. Joy Division&#x27;s burgeoning success drew a devoted following who were stereotyped as &quot;intense young men dressed in grey overcoats&quot;.

=== &quot;Closer&quot; and Curtis&#x27;s health problems ===
Joy Division toured Europe in January 1980. Although the schedule was demanding, Curtis experienced only two grand mal seizures, both in the final two months of the tour. That March, the band recorded their second album, &quot;Closer,&quot; with Hannett at London&#x27;s Britannia Row Studios. That month they released the &quot;Licht und Blindheit&quot; single, with &quot;Atmosphere&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Dead Souls&quot; as the B-side, on the French independent label Sordide Sentimental.

A lack of sleep and long hours destabilised Curtis&#x27;s epilepsy, and his seizures became almost uncontrollable. He often had seizures during performances, which some audience members believed were part of the performance. The seizures left him feeling ashamed and depressed, and the band became increasingly worried about Curtis&#x27;s condition. On 7 April 1980, Curtis attempted suicide by overdosing on his anti-seizure medication, phenobarbitone. The following evening, Joy Division were scheduled to play a gig at the Derby Hall in Bury. Curtis was too ill to perform, so at Gretton&#x27;s insistence the band played a combined set with Alan Hempsall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio singing on the first few songs. When Topping came back towards the end of the set, some audience members threw bottles at the stage. Curtis&#x27;s ill health led to the cancellation of several other gigs that April. Joy Division&#x27;s final live performance was held at the University of Birmingham&#x27;s High Hall on 2 May, and included their only performance of &quot;Ceremony&quot;, one of the last songs written by Curtis.
Hannett&#x27;s production has been widely praised. However, as with &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, both Hook and Sumner were unhappy with the production. Hook said that when he heard the final mix of &quot;Atrocity Exhibition&quot; he was disappointed that the abrasiveness had been toned down. He wrote; &quot;I was like, head in hands, &#x27;Oh fucking hell, it&#x27;s happening again ... Martin had fucking melted the guitar with his Marshall Time Waster. Made it sound like someone strangling a cat and, to my mind, absolutely killed the song. I was so annoyed with him and went in and gave him a piece of my mind but he just turned round and told me to fuck off.&quot;

=== Curtis&#x27;s suicide and aftermath ===
Joy Division were scheduled to commence their first US/Canada tour in May 1980. Curtis had expressed enthusiasm about the tour, but his relationship with his wife, Deborah, was under strain; Deborah was excluded from the band&#x27;s inner circle and objected to Curtis being close to Belgian journalist and music promoter Annik Honoré, whom he met on tour in Europe in 1979. He was also anxious about how American audiences would react to his epilepsy.

The evening before the band were due to depart for America, Curtis returned to his Macclesfield home to talk to Deborah. He asked her to drop an impending divorce suit, and asked her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film &quot;Stroszek&quot; and listening to Iggy Pop&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;The Idiot&quot;, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned.

The suicide shocked the band and their management. In 2005, Wilson said: &quot;I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen ... We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn&#x27;t take it seriously. That&#x27;s how stupid we were.&quot; Music critic Simon Reynolds said Curtis&#x27;s suicide &quot;made for instant myth&quot;. Jon Savage&#x27;s obituary said that &quot;now no one will remember what his work with Joy Division was like when he was alive; it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous&quot;. In June 1980, Joy Division&#x27;s single &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; was released, which hit number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart. In July 1980, &quot;Closer&quot; was released, and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, &quot;&quot;Closer&quot; is as magnificent a memorial (for &#x27;Joy Division&#x27; as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-Presley popular musician could have.&quot;

Morris said that even without Curtis&#x27;s death, it is unlikely that Joy Division would have endured. The members had made a pact long before Curtis&#x27;s death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would change the band name. The band re-formed as New Order, with Sumner on vocals; they later recruited Morris&#x27;s girlfriend Gillian Gilbert as keyboardist and second guitarist. Gilbert had befriended the band and played guitar at a Joy Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.

New Order&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Ceremony&quot; (1981), was formed from the last two songs written with Curtis. New Order struggled in their early years to escape the shadow of Joy Division, but went on to achieve far greater commercial success with a different, more upbeat and dance-oriented sound.

Various Joy Division outtakes and live material have been released. &quot;Still&quot;, featuring live tracks and rare recordings, was issued in 1981. Factory issued the &quot;Substance&quot; compilation in 1988, including several out-of-print singles. &quot;Permanent&quot; was released in 1995 by London Records, which had acquired the Joy Division catalogue after Factory&#x27;s 1992 bankruptcy. The comprehensive box set &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; was released in 1997.

== Musical style ==
=== Sound ===
Joy Division took time to develop their style and quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as fairly generic and &quot;undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock&quot;. Critic Simon Reynolds observed how the band&#x27;s originality only &quot;really became apparent as the songs got slower&quot;, and their music took on a &quot;sparse&quot; quality. According to Reynolds, &quot;Hook&#x27;s bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner&#x27;s guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group&#x27;s sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris&#x27;s drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.&quot; According to music critic Jon Savage, &quot;Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy&quot;. In 1994 Sumner said the band&#x27;s characteristic sound &quot;came out naturally: I&#x27;m more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn&#x27;t hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn&#x27;t be the clock, because he&#x27;s passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.&quot; By &quot;Closer&quot;, Curtis had adopted a low baritone voice, drawing comparisons to Jim Morrison of the Doors (one of Curtis&#x27;s favourite bands).

Sumner largely acted as the band&#x27;s director, a role he continued in New Order. While Sumner was the group&#x27;s primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, &quot;He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian&quot;. During the recording sessions for &quot;Closer&quot;, Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.

Producer Martin Hannett &quot;dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division&#x27;s eerie spatiality&quot;. Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group&#x27;s records. Hannett said, &quot;[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn&#x27;t have a clue. They didn&#x27;t argue&quot;. Hannett demanded clean and clear &quot;sound separation&quot; not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris&#x27;s drumkit. Morris recalled, &quot;Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he&#x27;d get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound&quot;. Music journalist Richard Cook noted that Hannett&#x27;s role was &quot;crucial&quot;. There are &quot;devices of distance&quot; in his production and &quot;the sound is an illusion of physicality&quot;.

=== Lyrics ===
Curtis was the band&#x27;s sole lyricist. He typically composed his lyrics in a notebook, independently of the eventual music to evolve. The music itself was largely written by Sumner and Hook as the group jammed during rehearsals. Curtis&#x27;s imagery and word choice often referenced &quot;coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control&quot;. In 1979, &quot;NME&quot; journalist Paul Rambali wrote, &quot;The themes of Joy Division&#x27;s music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad.&quot; Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that &quot;Curtis&#x27;s great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying reality of a society in turmoil, and to make it both universal and personal,&quot; while noting that &quot;the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature.&quot; Critic Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were &quot;obvious influences&quot; to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse.

Curtis was unwilling to explain the meaning behind his lyrics and Joy Division releases were absent of any lyric sheets. He told the fanzine &quot;Printed Noise&quot;, &quot;We haven&#x27;t got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They&#x27;re multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.&quot; The other Joy Division members have said that at the time, they paid little attention to the contents of Curtis&#x27;s lyrics. In a 1987 interview with &quot;Option&quot;, Morris said that they &quot;just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone&#x27;s got their own opinion.&quot; Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of &quot;Closer&quot; did many who were close to the singer realise &quot;[h]is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics&quot;. The surviving members regret not seeing the warning signs in Curtis&#x27;s lyrics. Morris said that &quot;it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics...you&#x27;d find yourself thinking, &#x27;Oh my God, I missed this one&#x27;. Because I&#x27;d look at Ian&#x27;s lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin&#x27; stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn&#x27;t go in and grab him and ask, &#x27;What&#x27;s up?&#x27; I have to live with that&quot;.
=== Live performances ===
In contrast to the relatively polished sound of their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were especially unhappy with Hannett&#x27;s mix of &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;, which reduced the abrasiveness of their live sound for a more cerebral and ghostly sound. According to Sumner &quot;the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars&quot;.

The group did not typically interact with the audience during concerts. According to Paul Morley, &quot;During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you&#x27;ll be lucky to hear more than two or three words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion.&quot; Curtis would often perform what became known as his &quot;&#x27;dead fly&#x27; dance&quot;, as if imitating a seizure; his arms would &quot;start flying in [a] semicircular, hypnotic curve&quot;. Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis&#x27;s dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic seizure, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy.

Curtis&#x27; diagnosis made live performances difficult for the band. Sumner later reflected in 2007, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He&#x27;d go off in a trance for a bit, then he&#x27;d lose it and have an epileptic fit. We&#x27;d have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing room where he&#x27;d cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him.&quot;

===Influences===
Sumner wrote that Curtis was inspired by artists such as the Doors, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Kraftwerk, the Velvet Underground and Neu!. Hook has also related that Curtis was particularly influenced by Iggy Pop&#x27;s chaotic stage persona. The group were inspired by Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;marriage between humans and machines&quot;, and the inventiveness of their electronic music. Joy Division played &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; through the PA before they went on stage, &quot;to get a momentum&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; elaborated with Brian Eno, influenced them; the &quot;cold austerity&quot; of the synthesisers on the B-sides of &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; and &quot;Low&quot; albums, was a &quot;music looking at the future&quot;. Morris cited the &quot;unique style&quot; of Velvet Underground&#x27;s Maureen Tucker and the motorik drum beats, from Neu! and Can. Morris also credited Siouxsie and the Banshees because their &quot;first drummer Kenny Morris played mostly toms&quot; and &quot;the sound of cymbals was forbidden&quot;. Hook said that &quot;Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big influences... The way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing&quot;. Hook drew inspiration from the style of bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel and his early material with the Stranglers; he also credited Carol Kaye and her musical basslines on early 1970s work of the Temptations. Sumner mentioned &quot;the raw, nasty, unpolished edge&quot; in the guitars of the Rolling Stones, the simple riff of &quot;Vicious&quot; on Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot;, and Neil Young. His musical horizon went up a notch with Jimi Hendrix, he realised &quot;it wasn&#x27;t about little catchy tunes ... it was what you could do sonically with a guitar.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Despite their short career, Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence and achieved widespread critical acclaim. John Bush of AllMusic argues that Joy Division &quot;became the first band in the post-punk movement by ... emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the &#x27;80s.&quot;

The band&#x27;s dark and gloomy sound, which Martin Hannett described in 1979 as &quot;dancing music with Gothic overtones&quot;, presaged in part the gothic rock genre. While the term &quot;gothic&quot; originally described a &quot;doomy atmosphere&quot; in music of the late 1970s, the term was soon applied to specific bands like Bauhaus that followed in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included &quot;high-pitched post-Joy Division basslines usurp[ing] the melodic role&quot; and &quot;vocals that were either near operatic and Teutonic or deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Ian Curtis.&quot;

Joy Division have been dramatised in two biopics. &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002) is a fictionalised account of Factory Records in which members of the band appear as supporting characters — Ian Curtis portrayed by Sean Harris, Bernard Sumner by John Simm, and Peter Hook by Ralf Little. Tony Wilson said of the film, &quot;It&#x27;s all true, it&#x27;s all not true. It&#x27;s not a fucking documentary,&quot; and that he favoured the &quot;myth&quot; over the truth. The 2007 film &quot;Control&quot;, directed by Anton Corbijn, is a biography of Ian Curtis (portrayed by Sam Riley) that uses Deborah Curtis&#x27;s biography of her late husband, &quot;Touching from a Distance&quot; (1995), as its basis. &quot;Control&quot; had its international premiere on the opening night of Director&#x27;s Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, where it was critically well received. That year Grant Gee directed the band documentary &quot;Joy Division&quot;.

Joy Division have influenced many bands, including their contemporaries the Cure and U2. In 1980, U2 singer Bono said that Joy Division were &quot;one of the most important bands of the last four or five years&quot;. Joy Division was an influence on Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and on Tears for Fears.

Other acts that cite Joy Division as an influence include Soundgarden, the Proclaimers, Mogwai, Hüsker Dü, and Future Islands. Rapper Danny Brown named his album &quot;Atrocity Exhibition&quot; after the Joy Division song, whose title was partially inspired by the 1970 J. G. Ballard collection of condensed novels of the same name. In 2005 both New Order and Joy Division were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame.

<text>Johnny Lee Bench (born December 7, 1947) is an American former professional baseball player. He played his entire Major League Baseball career, which lasted from to , with the Cincinnati Reds, primarily as a catcher. Bench was the leader of the Reds team known as the Big Red Machine that dominated the National League in the mid-1970s, winning six division titles, four National League pennants and two World Series championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com&quot;&gt;Johnny Bench How Stuff Works.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourteen-time All-Star and a two-time National League Most Valuable Player, Bench excelled on offense as well as on defense, twice leading the National League in home runs and three times in runs batted in. At the time of his retirement in 1983, he held the major league record for most home runs hit by a catcher. He was also the first catcher in history to lead the league in home runs. He hit 45 home runs in 1970, which was a single-season record for catchers until Salvador Perez hit 48 in 2021. His 389 home runs and 1,376 runs batted in remain the most in Cincinnati Reds history.

On defense, Bench was a ten-time Gold Glove Award winner who skillfully handled pitching staffs and possessed a strong, accurate throwing arm. He caught 100 or more games for 13 consecutive seasons. In 1986, Bench was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 in his first year of eligibility. ESPN has called him the greatest catcher in baseball history.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Oklahoma, Bench is one-eighth Choctaw; he played baseball and basketball and was class valedictorian at Binger-Oney High School His father told him that the fastest route to becoming a major leaguer was as a catcher.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
As a 17-year-old, the Cincinnati Reds selected Bench in the second round, 36th overall, of the 1965 amateur draft. He played for the minor-league Buffalo Bisons in the 1966 and 1967 seasons. During the 1967 season, he hit a grand slam against Jim Palmer, who would go on to never allow a grand slam in 19 years in the Major Leagues.

===Cincinnati Reds (1967–1983)===
Bench was called up to the Reds in August 1967. He hit only .163, but impressed many people with his defense and strong throwing arm, among them Hall of Famer Ted Williams. Williams signed a baseball for him and predicted that the young catcher would be a &quot;Hall of Famer for sure!&quot; Williams&#x27; prophecy became fact 22 years later in 1989 when Bench was elected to Cooperstown.

During a 1968 spring training game, Bench was catching right-hander Jim Maloney, an eight-year veteran. Maloney was once a hard thrower, but injuries had dramatically reduced the speed of his fastball. Maloney nevertheless insisted on repeatedly &quot;shaking off&quot; his younger catcher by throwing fastballs instead of the breaking balls that Bench had called for. When an exasperated Bench bluntly told Maloney, &quot;Your fastball&#x27;s not popping,&quot; Maloney replied with an epithet. To prove to Maloney that his fastball was no longer effective, Bench called for a fastball, and after Maloney released the ball, Bench dropped his catcher&#x27;s mitt and caught the fastball barehanded. Bench was the Reds&#x27; catcher on April 30, 1969, when Maloney pitched a no hitter against the 

In 1968, the 20-year-old Bench impressed many in his first he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, batting .275 with 15 home runs and 82 RBIs. This marked the first time that the award had been won by a catcher. He also won the 1968 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, which was the first time that the award had been won by a rookie. He made 102 assists in 1968, which marked the first time in 23 years that a catcher had more than 100 assists in a season. During the Vietnam War, Bench served in the United States Army Reserve as a member of the 478th Engineer Battalion, which was based across the Ohio River from Cincinnati at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. This unit included several of his teammates, among them Pete Rose, Bobby Tolan and Darrel Chaney. In the winter of 1970–1971 he was part of Bob Hope&#x27;s USO Tour of Vietnam.

===1970s===
In 1970, Bench had his finest statistical season. At age 22, he became the youngest player to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award. He hit .293, led the National League with 45 home runs and a franchise-record 148 runs batted in as the Reds won the NL West Division. The Reds swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League Championship Series, but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in five games in the World Series.
Bench had another strong year in 1972, winning the MVP Award for a second time. He led the National League in home runs (40) and RBI (125) to help propel the Reds to another National League West Division title and won the NL pennant in the deciding fifth game over the Pittsburgh Pirates. One of his more dramatic home runs was likely his ninth-inning, lead off, opposite field home run in that fifth NLCS game. The solo shot tied the game at three; the Reds won later in the inning on a wild pitch, 4–3. It was hailed after the game as &quot;one of the great clutch home runs of all time.&quot; However, the Reds lost the World Series to a strong Oakland Athletics team in seven games.

After the 1972 season, Bench underwent surgery to remove a lesion from his lung, out of concern that it might be cancerous. The lesion would prove to be benign however, Bench stated in an interview that he was never the same player after the surgery. “They cut the ribs, they cut the bones, they cut the nerves, and so I never was the same player afterwards.” He remained productive, but never again hit 40 home runs in a season.

In 1973, Bench hit 25 home runs and 104 RBI and helped the Reds rally from a 10-game deficit to the Los Angeles Dodgers in early July to lead the majors with 99 wins and claim another NL West Division crown. In the NLCS, Cincinnati met a New York Mets team that won the NL East with an unimpressive record, 16 games behind the Reds. The Mets boasted three of the better starting pitchers in the NL, future Hall of Famer Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, and Jon Matlack. Bench&#x27;s bottom of the ninth-inning home run off Seaver in the first game propelled the Reds to victory, but Seaver would get the best of the Reds and Bench in the deciding Game 5, winning to put the Mets into the World Series against the Oakland A&#x27;s.

In 1974, Bench led the league with 129 RBI and scored 108 runs, becoming only the fourth catcher in major league history with 100 or more runs and RBI in the same season. The Reds won the second-most games in the majors (98) but lost the West Division to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1975, the Reds finally broke through in the post season. Bench contributed 28 home runs and 110 RBI. Cincinnati swept the Pirates in three games to win the NLCS, and defeated the Boston Red Sox in a memorable seven-game World Series.
Bench struggled with ailing shoulders in 1976,
 and had one of his least productive years, with only 16 home runs and 74 RBI. He finished with an excellent postseason, starting with a 4-for-12 (.333) performance in the NLCS sweep over the Philadelphia Phillies. The World Series provided a head-to-head match-up with the Yankees&#x27; all-star catcher, Thurman Munson. Bench rose to the occasion, hitting .533 with two home runs, while Munson also hit well, with a .529 average. The Reds won in a four-game sweep and Bench was named the Series&#x27; MVP. At the post-World Series press conference, Reds manager Sparky Anderson was asked by a journalist to compare Munson with his catcher. Anderson replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to Johnny Bench.&quot; Bench bounced back in 1977 to hit 31 home runs and 109 RBI but the Dodgers won two straight NL pennants. The Reds reached the postseason just once more in his career, in 1979, but were swept in three straight in the NLCS by the Pittsburgh Pirates.

===1980s===
For the last three seasons of his career, Bench moved out from behind the plate, catching only 13 games, while primarily becoming a corner infielder (first or third base). The Cincinnati Reds proclaimed Saturday, September 17, 1983, &quot;Johnny Bench Night&quot; at Riverfront Stadium, in which he hit his 389th and final home run, a line drive to left in the third inning, before a record crowd. He retired at the end of the season at age 35.

==MLB career statistics==

Bench had 2,048 hits for a .267 career batting average with 389 home runs and 1,376 RBI during his 17-year Major League career, all spent with the Reds. He retired as the career home run leader for catchers, a record which stood until surpassed by Carlton Fisk and the current record holder, Mike Piazza. Bench still holds the Major League record for the most grand slam home runs by a catcher, with 10. In his career, Bench earned 10 Gold Gloves, was named to the National League All-Star team 14 times, and won two Most Valuable Player Awards. He led the National League three times in caught stealing percentage and ended his career with a .990 fielding percentage at catcher and an overall .987 fielding percentage. He caught 118 shutouts during his career, ranking him 12th all-time among major league catchers. Bench also won such awards as the Lou Gehrig Award (1975), the Babe Ruth Award (1976), and the Hutch Award (1981).

Bench popularized the hinged catcher&#x27;s mitt, first introduced by Randy Hundley of the Chicago Cubs. He began using the mitt after a stint on the disabled list in 1966 for a thumb injury on his throwing hand. The mitt allowed Bench to tuck his throwing arm safely to the side when receiving the pitch. By the turn of the decade, the hinged mitt became standard catchers&#x27; equipment. Having huge hands (a famous photograph features him holding seven baseballs in his right hand), Bench also tended to block breaking balls in the dirt by scooping them with one hand instead of the more common and fundamentally proper way: dropping to both knees and blocking the ball using the chest protector to keep the ball in front.

==Personal life==
Bench has been married five times. Once hailed as &quot;baseball&#x27;s most-eligible bachelor,&quot; he shed that distinction before the 1975 season when he married Vickie Chesser, a toothpaste model who had dated Joe Namath. Four days after they met, Bench proposed, and they were married on February 21, 1975. Quickly, the pair realized they were incompatible, especially after Bench suggested that his wife accept &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine&#x27;s offer for her to pose nude for $25,000. They broke up at the end of the season (Bench reportedly said to her, &quot;Now I&#x27;m done with two things I hate: baseball and you&quot;), divorcing after just 13 months. &quot;I tried. I even hand-squeezed orange juice,&quot; Chesser told Phil Donahue in December 1975. &quot;I don&#x27;t think either of us had any idea what marriage was really like.&quot; After returning to Manhattan, Chesser said, &quot;Johnny Bench is a great athlete, a mediocre everything else, and a true tragedy as a person.&quot;

Before Christmas 1987, Bench married Laura Cwikowski, an Oklahoma City model and aerobics instructor. They had a son, Bobby Binger Bench (named after Bob Hope and Bobby Knight, and Bench&#x27;s hometown), before divorcing in 1995. They shared custody of their son. &quot;He was, and is, a great dad,&quot; according to Bobby, who works in Cincinnati as a production operator on Reds broadcasts. Bench&#x27;s third marriage, to Elizabeth Benton, took place in 1997. Johnny filed for divorce in 2000 on grounds of marital infidelity. His fourth marriage took place in 2004, to 31-year-old Lauren Baiocchi, the daughter of pro golfer Hugh Baiocchi. After living in Palm Springs with their two sons, Johnny wished to return to South Florida, where he lived from 2014 to 2017. However, Lauren would not relocate to Florida, leading to their divorce. As of 2018, Bench has primary custody of their sons.

Bench was married for the fifth time in March 2024.

While still an active MLB player, he made a cameo appearance as a Kings Island Inn poolside waiter in &quot;I Left My Heart in Cincinnati,&quot; a Season 3 episode of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; which first aired on January 26, 1973.

==Honors and post-career activities==

Bench was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1989 alongside Carl Yastrzemski. He was elected in his first year of eligibility, and appeared on 96% of the ballots, the third-highest percentage at that time. Three years earlier, Bench had been inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and his uniform No. 5 was retired by the team. He is currently on the board of directors for the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. In 1989, he became the first individual baseball player to appear on a Wheaties box, a cereal he ate as a child.

For a time in the 1980s Bench was a commercial spokesman for Krylon paint, featuring a memorable catchphrase: &quot;I&#x27;m Johnny Bench, and this is Johnny Bench&#x27;s bench.&quot; In 1985, Bench starred as Joe Boyd/Joe Hardy in a Cincinnati stage production of the musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, which also included Gwen Verdon and Gary Sandy. He also hosted the television series &quot;The Baseball Bunch&quot; from 1982 to 1985. A cast of boys and girls from the Tucson, Arizona, area would learn the game of baseball from Bench and other current and retired greats. The Chicken provided comic relief and former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda appeared as &quot;The Dugout Wizard.&quot;

In 1986, Bench and Don Drysdale did the backup contests for ABC&#x27;s Sunday afternoon baseball telecasts (Al Michaels and Jim Palmer were the primary commentating crew). Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the No. 2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio to help Brent Musburger call that year&#x27;s National League Championship Series. Bench would later serve as color commentator CBS Radio&#x27;s World Series coverage alongside Jack Buck and later Vin Scully from 1989–1993. In 1994, Bench served as a field reporter for NBC/The Baseball Network&#x27;s coverage of the All-Star Game from Pittsburgh.

After turning 50, Bench was a part-time professional golfer and played in several events on the Senior PGA Tour. He has a home at the Mission Hills-Gary Player Course in Rancho Mirage, California.

In 1999, Bench ranked Number 16 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was the highest-ranking catcher. Bench was also elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-receiving catcher. As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team.

From the 2000 college baseball season until 2018, the best collegiate catcher annually received the Johnny Bench Award. Notable winners include Buster Posey of Florida State University, Kelly Shoppach of Baylor University, Ryan Garko of Stanford University, and Kurt Suzuki of Cal State Fullerton. The award was renamed the Buster Posey Award for the 2019 season onwards.

In 2003, he guest starred on an episode of &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; as himself, along with Ernie Banks and Frank Robinson.

In 2008, Bench co-wrote the book &quot;Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life&#x27;s Pitches&quot; with Paul Daugherty, published by Orange Frazer Press. An autobiography published in 1979 called &quot;Catch You Later&quot; was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments.

Bench was interviewed by Heidi Watney of the New England Sports Network during a September 2008 Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park. While knuckleballer Tim Wakefield was on the mound for the Red Sox, Bench related a story that then-Reds manager Sparky Anderson told him that he was thinking of trading for knuckleballer Phil Niekro. Bench replied that Anderson had better trade for Niekro&#x27;s catcher, too.

On September 17, 2011, the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Bench at the entrance way of the Reds Hall of Fame at Great American Ball Park. The larger-than-life bronze statue by Tom Tsuchiya, shows Bench in the act of throwing out a base runner. Bench called the unveiling of his statue his &quot;greatest moment.&quot;

In 2016, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. He was also the Hall of Fame recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award in 2018, for his service and continued support of the United States Military.

<doc id="16584" wikidata="Q522245" url="?curid=16584" title="Jasmuheen">
<text>Jasmuheen (born Ellen Greve; 1957) is a proponent of &quot;pranic nourishment&quot; or breatharianism, the practice of claiming to live without food or fluid of any sort and regarded by the scientific community as a lethal pseudoscience. She makes appearances at New Age conferences worldwide, has hosted spiritual retreats in Thailand and has released books and audio recordings.

==Early life==

Jasmuheen was born in 1957 in New South Wales, Australia, of post-war Norwegian migrant parents.

==Breatharianism==
Jasmuheen developed financial and business management skills working full-time in the finance industry. In 1992, she began combining her experience in business and finance with meditation, selling access to workshops and seminars on the topic and, by deed poll, changed her name to Jasmuheen.

The Australian television programme &quot;60 Minutes&quot; challenged Jasmuheen to demonstrate how she could live without food and water. The supervising medical professional Dr. Beres Wenck found that, after 48 hours, Jasmuheen displayed symptoms of acute dehydration, stress, and high blood pressure. Jasmuheen claimed that this was a result of &quot;polluted air&quot;. On the third day, she was moved to a mountainside retreat about 15 miles from the city, where she was filmed enjoying the fresh air, claiming she could now successfully practice inedia. But as filming progressed, Jasmuheen&#x27;s speech slowed, her pupils dilated, and she lost over a stone (6 kg or 14 lb) in weight. After four days, she acknowledged that she had lost weight, but stated that she felt fine. Dr. Wenck stated: &quot;You are now quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%.&quot; The doctor continued: &quot;Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risk if she goes any further is kidney failure.&quot; Jasmuheen&#x27;s condition continued to deteriorate rapidly due to acute dehydration, despite her contrary insistence. Dr. Wenck concluded that continuing the experiment would ultimately prove fatal. The film crew agreed with this assessment and stopped filming.

Regarding her intake of food, Jasmuheen said: &quot;Generally not much at all. Maybe a few cups of tea and a glass of water, but now and then if I feel a bit bored and I want some flavour, then I will have a mouthful of whatever it is I&#x27;m wanting the flavour of. So it might be a piece of chocolate or it might be a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that.&quot; In the aftermath of the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster&quot;.

Jasmuheen has stated that she has lived on approximately 300 calories per day for the past fourteen years, maintaining full health through supplementing a fluid intake with &quot;cosmic particles&quot; or &quot;micro-food&quot;, which she describes as prana. She has stated that she has not yet mastered the ability to be fluid-free for more than short periods.

Jasmuheen was awarded the Bent Spoon Award by Australian Skeptics in 2000 (&quot;presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle&quot;). She was also awarded the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize for Literature for her book &quot;Pranic Nourishment – Living on Light&quot;, &quot;which explains that although some people do eat food, they don&#x27;t ever really need to.&quot;

Jasmuheen maintains that some of her beliefs are based on the writings and &quot;more recent channelled material&quot; of the Count of St Germain. She states that her DNA expanded from 2 to 12 strands to take up more hydrogen. The extra strands of DNA have not been scientifically verified. When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, Jasmuheen stated &quot;you cannot view spiritual energy under a microscope&quot;. She claimed that such a challenge would be a deliberate attack on her beliefs, and that she refuses to act as an example of her alleged paranormal attributes.

In 2005, James Randi offered her the James Randi Educational Foundation US$1 million prize to demonstrate her claims. In 2010, she appeared in the documentaries &quot;3 Magic Words&quot; and &quot;In the Beginning There Was Light&quot;.

=== Deaths of followers ===
, five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen&#x27;s publications. Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.

Lani Marcia Roslyn Morris, a 53-year-old Melbourne resident, died in 1999 while attempting the breatharian &quot;diet&quot; advocated by Jasmuheen. Jim Vadim Pesnak, 63, and his wife Eugenia, 60, were jailed for six years and two years, respectively, on charges of manslaughter for their involvement in the death of Morris. Pesnak had delayed seeking medical attention. Referring to this case, Jasmuheen commented that Morris&#x27;s practice of inedia perhaps was &quot;not coming from a place of integrity and did not have the right motivation&quot;.

Jasmuheen offered similar defence in response to the death of Verity Linn, who died of hypothermia and dehydration with lack of nutrition while practising inedia in Scotland, her diary mentioning Jasmuheen&#x27;s teachings. Linn&#x27;s body was found in a tent. In 2012, it was reported that a Swiss woman died of starvation after having attempted to survive purely on light, as taught in one of Jasmuheen&#x27;s books. In 2017, a Dutch woman living in a household of four practitioners of breatharianism inspired by Jasmuheen died under mysterious circumstances. The three remaining members of the household are suspected of withholding the malnourished woman adequate medical care.

In 1999, Michelle Shirley, spokeswoman for the Cult Information Centre, told the BBC that the centre had been contacted five times in the previous 12 months by concerned friends and family members of Breatharians and that &quot;although Breatharianism is not strictly a cult, the centre has been monitoring its activities&quot;. She added, &quot;We are particularly concerned about any implication that if it doesn&#x27;t work, it is the person&#x27;s fault. That implies there is nothing wrong with the Breatharians&#x27; teachings.&quot;

In the end of 2017, 22-year-old German citizen Finn Bogumil died on the Caribbean island of Dominica, reportedly of fasting. According to witnesses, he was not eating or drinking for several days ahead of his death, and had told friends and family members of his plans to only live off of sunlight. German news station NDR also released a documentary about this case in March 2019.

Jasmuheen has written that &quot;If you haven&#x27;t found the light that will nourish you, you may have the intention to become a breatharian, but in fact you may be putting yourself through food deprivation. There is one known case where a person died when trying to become a breatharian.&quot;

The dessert was especially popular in the first half of the 20th century. The original gelatin dessert began in Le Roy, New York, in 1897, when Pearle Bixby Wait trademarked the name &quot;Jell-O&quot;. He and his wife May had made the product by adding strawberry, raspberry, orange, and lemon flavoring to sugar and granulated gelatin (which had been patented in 1845). The powder is mixed with boiling water and then cooled to produce a gel.

==Description==
Jell-O is sold prepared (ready-to-eat), or in powder form, and is available in various colors and flavors. The powder contains powdered gelatin and flavorings, including sugar or artificial sweeteners. It is dissolved in hot water, then chilled and allowed to set. Fruit, vegetables, and whipped cream can be added to make elaborate snacks that can be molded into shapes.

Some non-gelatin pudding and pie-filling products are sold under the Jell-O brand. Ordinary Jell-O pudding is cooked on the stove top (with milk) then eaten warm or chilled, whereas Jell-O instant pudding is mixed with cold milk and chilled; it sets without cooking. To make pie fillings, the same pudding products are prepared with less liquid.

==History==
===Early history===

Gelatin, a protein produced from collagen extracted from boiled bones, connective tissues, and other animal products, has been a component of food, particularly desserts, since the 15th century.

Gelatin was popularized in New York in the Victorian era with spectacular and complex jelly molds. Gelatin was sold in sheets and had to be purified, which was time-consuming. Gelatin desserts were the province of royalty and the relatively well-to-do. In 1845, a patent for powdered gelatin was obtained by industrialist Peter Cooper, who built the first American steam-powered locomotive, the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;. This powdered gelatin was easy to manufacture and easier to use in cooking.

In 1897, in LeRoy, New York, carpenter and cough syrup manufacturer Pearle Bixby Wait trademarked a gelatin dessert called &quot;Jell-O&quot;. Wait and his wife, May, added strawberry, raspberry, orange, and lemon flavoring to granulated gelatin and sugar. In 1899, Wait sold Jell-O to &quot;Orator Francis Woodward&quot;, whose Genesee Pure Food Company produced the successful Grain-O health drink. Part of the legal agreement between Woodward and Wait dealt with the similar Jell-O name.
===Going mainstream===
Various elements were key to Jell-O becoming a mainstream product: new technologies, such as refrigeration, powdered gelatin and machine packaging, home economics classes, and the company&#x27;s marketing.

Initially, Woodward struggled to sell the powdered product. Beginning in 1902, to raise awareness, Woodward&#x27;s Genesee Pure Food Company placed advertisements in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; proclaiming Jell-O to be &quot;America&#x27;s Most Famous Dessert.&quot; Jell-O was a minor success until 1904, when Genesee Pure Food Company sent armies of salesmen into the field to distribute free Jell-O cookbooks, a pioneering marketing tactic.
Within a decade, Genesee Pure Food Company added three new flavors, chocolate (discontinued in 1927), cherry, and peach, and it launched the brand in Canada. Celebrity testimonials and recipes appeared in advertisements featuring actress Ethel Barrymore and opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink. Some Jell-O illustrated advertisements were painted by Maxfield Parrish.

In 1923, the newly rechristened Jell-O Company launched &quot;D-Zerta&quot;, an artificially sweetened version of Jell-O. Two years later, Postum and Genesee merged, and in 1927 Postum acquired Clarence Birdseye&#x27;s frozen foods company to form the General Foods Corporation.
By 1930, there appeared a vogue in American cuisine for congealed salads, and the company introduced lime-flavored Jell-O, to complement the add-ins that cooks across the country were combining in these aspics and salads. Popular Jell-O recipes often included ingredients like cabbage, celery, green peppers, and even cooked pasta.

In 1934, sponsorship from Jell-O made comedian Jack Benny the dessert&#x27;s spokesperson. At this time Post introduced a jingle (&quot;featured&quot; by the agency Young &amp; Rubicam) that was familiar over several decades, in which the spelling &quot;J-E-L-L-O&quot; was (or could be) sung over a rising five-note musical theme.

The jingle was written by Don Bestor, who, at the time, was the bandleader on Jack Benny&#x27;s radio show, &quot;The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny.&quot;

In 1936, chocolate returned to the Jell-O lineup, as an instant pudding made with milk. It proved enormously popular, and over time other pudding flavors were added such as vanilla, tapioca, coconut, pistachio, butterscotch, egg custard, flan, and rice pudding.

By the 1950s, salads became so popular that Jell-O responded with savory and vegetable flavors such as celery, Italian, mixed vegetable, and seasoned tomato. These flavors have since been discontinued.

===Baby boom===

Though much of the elaborate and dainty tea time fare served between the 1920s and 1950s was luxurious and decorative, using fancy ingredients like caviar or lobster, Jell-O became an affordable ornamental ingredient that women were able to use to create feminine, light, delicate dishes that were the standard of refined tea time fare during that period. By the Jazz Age nearly 1/3 of salad recipes in an average cookbook were gelatin-based recipes including varied fillings of fruit, vegetables or even cream cheese.

Typical recipes from the early 20th century included exotic fruits like figs, dates and bananas, or lemon flavored jello paired with maraschino cherries and other ingredients like marshmallows and almonds. One sweet gelatin-based fruit dessert called only &quot;Good Salad&quot; includes vanilla pudding, tapioca pudding, pineapple, mandarin oranges and orange gelatin. The pudding mixes are made with the reserved juice from the canned fruit and the flavored gelatin, the fruits are added and the dessert salad is allowed to set in the fridge and served cool.

One savory recipe collected by the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;, published in Iowa, is for a tomato soup gelatin salad. The salad, served chilled, is made from lemon gelatin, tomato soup, cream cheese, stuffed olives combined with various other ingredients and seasonings.

The baby boom saw a significant increase in sales for Jell-O. Young mothers didn&#x27;t have the supporting community structures of earlier generations, so marketers were quick to promote easy-to-prepare prepackaged foods. By this time, creating a Jell-O dessert required simply boiling water, combining the water with Jell-O, and putting the mixture into Tupperware molds and refrigerating it for a short time.

New flavors were continually added and unsuccessful flavors were removed: in the 1950s and 1960s, apple, black cherry, black raspberry, grape, lemon-lime, mixed fruit, orange-banana, pineapple-grapefruit, blackberry, strawberry-banana, tropical fruit, and more intense &quot;wild&quot; versions of the venerable strawberry, raspberry, and cherry. In 1966, the Jell-O &quot;No-Bake&quot; dessert line was launched, which allowed a cheesecake to be made in 15 minutes. In 1969, Jell-O 1∗2∗3 (later Jell-O 1•2•3), a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, was unveiled. Until 1987, Jell-O 1•2•3 was readily found in grocery stores throughout most of the United States, but the dessert is now rare. In 1971 packaged prepared pudding called Jell-O Pudding Treats were introduced. Jell-O Whip &#x27;n Chill, a mousse-style dessert, was introduced and widely promoted; it remains available in limited areas today. A similar dessert called Jell-O Soft Swirl was introduced in 1972, flavors included Chocolate Creme, Strawberry Creme, Vanilla Creme, and Peach Creme. Florence Henderson appeared in TV ads for this product.

===Sales decline and turnaround===

In 1964, the slogan &quot;There&#x27;s always room for Jell-O&quot; was introduced, promoting the product as a &quot;light dessert&quot; that could easily be consumed even after a heavy meal.

Throughout the 1960s through the 1980s, Jell-O&#x27;s sales steadily decreased. Many Jell-O dishes, such as desserts and Jell-O salads, became special occasion foods rather than everyday items. Marketers blamed this decline on decreasing family sizes, a &quot;fast-paced&quot; lifestyle and women&#x27;s increasing employment. By 1986, a market study concluded that mothers with young children rarely purchased Jell-O.

To turn things around, Jell-O hired Dana Gioia to stop the decline. The marketing team revisited the Jell-O recipes published in past cookbooks and rediscovered Jigglers, although the original recipe did not use that name. Jigglers are Jell-O snacks molded into fun shapes and eaten as finger food. Jell-O launched a massive marketing campaign, notably featuring Bill Cosby as spokesman. The campaign was a huge success, causing a significant market gain.

Cosby became the brand&#x27;s spokesperson in 1974, and he continued as the voice of Jell-O for almost thirty years. Over his tenure as the mouthpiece for the company, he helped introduce new products such as frozen Jell-O Pops (in gelatin and pudding varieties); the new Sugar-Free Jell-O, which replaced D-Zerta in 1984 and was sweetened with NutraSweet; Jell-O Jigglers concentrated gummi snacks; and Sparkling Jell-O, a carbonated version of the dessert touted as the &quot;Champagne of Jell-O&quot;. In 2010, Cosby returned as Jell-O spokesperson in an on-line web series called &quot;OBKB&quot;.

In 1990, General Foods was merged into Kraft Foods Inc. by parent company Philip Morris (now the Altria Group). New flavors were introduced: watermelon, blueberry, cranberry, margarita, and piña colada, among others. In 2001, the state Senate of Utah recognized Jell-O as a favorite snack food of Utah, recognizing the fundamental basis of Jell-O in Mormon cuisine such as Jell-O salad, and Governor Michael O. Leavitt declared an annual &quot;Jell-O Week.&quot; During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the souvenir pins included one depicting green Jell-O.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jell-O&#x27;s family-friendly reputation was slightly tarnished by Jell-O shots and Jell-O wrestling.
, there were over 420 million boxes of Jell-O gelatin and over 1 billion Jell-O cups sold in the United States each year. , there were more than 110 products sold under the Jell-O brand name.

Jell-O is used as a substantial ingredient in a well-known dessert, the &quot;Jell-O mold&quot;, which requires a mold designed to hold gelatin, and the depositing of small quantities of chopped fruit, nuts, and other ingredients before it hardens to its typical form. Fresh pineapple, papaya, kiwifruit, and ginger root cannot be used because they contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from &quot;setting&quot;. In the case of pineapple juice and the enzyme bromelain that it contains though, the enzyme can be inactivated without denaturing through excessive heating and thus altering the flavor by the addition of a small measured amount of capsaicin sourced from hot chilies.

==Jell-O shots==
An alternative recipe calls for the addition of an alcoholic beverage to the mix, contributing approximately one third to one half of the liquid added after the gelatin has dissolved in a boil. A serving of the resulting mixture is called a &quot;Jell-O shot&quot;, or the genericized &quot;Jello shot&quot;, at parties. The quantity and timing of the addition of the liquor are vital aspects; it is not possible to make Jell-O shots with liquor alone, as the colloidal proteins in dry gelatin consist of chains which require a hot liquid to denature them before they can then reform as a semisolid colloidal suspension. Pure alcohol cannot be heated sufficiently to break down these proteins, as it evaporates.

Vodka or rum is commonly used in Jell-O shots, but the shots can be made with almost any liquor or blends of multiple liquors. It is important to adjust the proportions of alcohol and cold water to ensure that the mixture sets when experimenting with various liquors. The Jell-O shots can be served in shot glasses and/or small paper or plastic cups; the paper or plastic cups are easier to eat from, but shot glasses are more attractive. The alcohol in Jell-O shots is contained within the Jell-O, so the body absorbs it more slowly, causing people to underestimate how much alcohol they have consumed. Drinkers must monitor their intake because of this.

American singer-songwriter Tom Lehrer claims to have invented the Jell-O shot in the 1950s to circumvent restrictions on alcoholic beverages at the army base where he was stationed. An early published recipe for an alcoholic gelatin drink dates from 1862, found in &quot;How to Mix Drinks, or The Bon Vivant&#x27;s Companion&quot; by Jerry Thomas: his recipe for &quot;Punch Jelly&quot; calls for the addition of isinglass or other gelatin to a punch made from cognac, rum, and lemon juice. Thomas warns that strength of the punch is &quot;artfully concealed&quot; by the gelatin.

==Manufacturing and tourism==

, LeRoy, New York, is known as the home of Jell-O and has the only Jell-O Museum in the world, located on the main road through the small town. Jell-O was manufactured here until General Foods closed the plant in 1964 and relocated manufacturing to Dover, Delaware. The Jell-O Gallery museum is operated by the Le Roy Historical Society at the Le Roy House and Union Free School, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

At the museum, visitors can learn about the history of the dessert from its inception. Visitors starting on East Main Street, follow Jell-O Brick Road, whose stones are inscribed with the names of former factory employees. The museum offers looks at starting materials for Jell-O, such as sturgeon bladder and calves&#x27; hooves, and various molds.

The Jell-O plant in Mason City, Iowa, produces America&#x27;s supply of ready-to-eat Jell-O gelatin dessert and pudding cups.

== Advertising ==
Jell-O&#x27;s early advertising campaign, initially directed by William E. Humelbaugh and later Frank LaBounty, first appeared in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in 1904. The print ads were often accompanied by recipes and color illustrations and became very popular. Artists such as Rose O&#x27;Neill, Maxfield Parrish, Coles Phillips, Norman Rockwell, Linn Ball, and Angus MacDonall contributed to the campaign. Franklin King, working for ad agency Dauchy Company, depicted his daughter Elizabeth in many of the illustrations, making her the recognizable &quot;Jell-O Girl&quot;.

Jack Benny&#x27;s top-rated radio program began its Jell-O sponsorship in 1934. The show did not break for commercials; instead, announcer Don Wilson incorporated speeches about Jell-O into the program at appropriate places, to Jack&#x27;s feigned comic annoyance. The first show originated the five-note &quot;J-E-L-L-O!&quot; jingle retained in Jell-O&#x27;s later advertising. Lucille Ball&#x27;s &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, the radio predecessor to TV&#x27;s &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, was another popular program sponsored by Jell-O for much of its 124-episode run, beginning January 7, 1949. Ball&#x27;s character Liz Cooper often opened the program with the lively greeting, &quot;Jell-O, everybody!&quot;

Comedian Bill Cosby is associated with Jell-O and, more famously, Jell-O pudding, and he appeared in many commercials promoting both. Later shows like &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody Cosby, using Jell-O references like &quot;pudding pop&quot;. In the 1960s, the cast of the sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; did a commercial with Carol Channing featuring Colonel Hogan, his men, Kommandant Klink and Sergeant Shultz having Jell-O and Dream Whip for dessert. Also, in the first few seasons of the first of Lucille Ball&#x27;s two 1960s television series, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, cast members including Vivian Vance often did commercials for Jell-O.

In 1995, Jell-O carried the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s alive!&quot; and had the phrase &quot;J-E-L-L-OOOOOOO!&quot;.

In August 2018, Jell-O released an animated series on YouTube and Amazon Prime Video titled &quot;JELL-O Wobz&quot; in partnership with DreamWorksTV.

In 2023, Dessert brand Jell-O updated the brand design for the first time in a decade, making it more playful. The logo became bolder and blockier, and hyper-realistic images of pudding and jelly fruit appeared.

In September 2024, Jell-O launches The Jelly Collection inflatable furniture series inspired by the iconic Jell-O molds. 

==In culture==
Jell-O is mentioned in the 1936 popular song &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; by Dorothy Fields (with music by Jerome Kern), where it is humorously referred to as a mundane alternative to the excitement of romantic love. In 1980, the American composer William Bolcom wrote a popular humorous song about Jell-O, &quot;Lime Jello Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise&quot;, satirising its use in combined sweet and savory dishes such as Jello salad.

In 1992, Ivette Bassa won the second ever Ig Nobel Prize in chemistry for inventing blue Jell-O.

The rock group Green Jellÿ was originally named Green Jellö, but had to change their name due to a lawsuit by Kraft Foods which claimed that the band was infringing the trademark for Jell-O.

===Mormonism===
Jell-O is especially popular among Mormons, so much so that the Mormon Corridor region is nicknamed the &quot;Jell-O Belt&quot;. Jell-O was recognized in 2001 as &quot;a favorite snack food of Utah&quot; by the Utah Senate, observing that Utah had had the highest per-capita consumption of Jell-O for many years, and how citizens of Utah had rallied to &quot;Take Back the Title&quot; after Des Moines, Iowa, exceeded Utah in Jell-O consumption in 1999. The culture of Utah, petitions by Utahns, and campaigning by students of Brigham Young University were also mentioned as reasons for recognizing Jell-O. Bill Cosby, longtime spokesperson for the Jell-O brand, appeared before the Utah Legislature in support of the resolution. &quot;He told the assembly that he believes the reason people in Utah love Jell-O is that the snack is perfect for families – and the people of Utah are all about family.&quot;

The stereotype of Mormons loving Jell-O does not have a long history. Media reports in 1969 and 1988 on foods popular among Mormons or in Utah make no mention of Jell-O, and a 1988 article mentions Jell-O as a Lutheran tradition. In the late 1980s, Jell-O had a marketing campaign promoting the snack and its Jigglers recipe as fun for children and easy for parents, which played well among family-oriented Mormons. In 1997, Kraft released sales figures revealing Salt Lake City to have the highest per-capita Jell-O consumption.

<text>Javier Pedro Saviola Fernández (; born 11 December 1981) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a forward.

He represented both Barcelona and Real Madrid, also having notable spells with Benfica and Olympiacos, and was named as the youngest player on Pelé&#x27;s FIFA 100 list of the 125 greatest living footballers in 2004. Due to his ancestry he also holds Spanish nationality since 2004, and he amassed La Liga totals of 196 games and 70 goals over the course of eight seasons; he started and finished his career at River Plate.

Saviola won league titles in Argentina, Spain, Portugal and Greece during his playing career, as well as a UEFA Cup. An Argentine international for seven years, he represented his country at the 2006 World Cup and the 2004 Copa América, where Argentina reached the final. He also won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.

==Club career==
===River Plate===
Nicknamed &quot;El Conejo&quot; (&quot;The Rabbit&quot;), Buenos Aires-born Saviola made his debut for River Plate at the age of 16, and went on to be a prolific goalscorer for the club.

He helped River to the 1999 &quot;Apertura&quot; and 2000 &quot;Clausura&quot; championships, and earned the 1999 South American Footballer of the Year award. Still only 18, he gained a reputation as a phenomenal prospect, and was even regarded as a potential heir to Diego Maradona, in particular after he broke the latter&#x27;s 1978 record by becoming the youngest player to win the Golden Boot award.

===Barcelona===
In 2001, aged 19, Saviola moved abroad to play for Barcelona in a £15 million transfer. He obtained Spanish citizenship shortly after, thereby not being restricted by the Spanish league maximum on the number of non-European Union citizens allowed in each team; under coach Carles Rexach, he scored 17 goals in his first season, finishing joint-fourth top scorer in La Liga.
Saviola&#x27;s second year at the Camp Nou did not start well, as he only scored two goals in the first half of the season. Radomir Antić became the new coach after Louis van Gaal was fired, and he went on to net eleven goals in the latter half of the campaign; Frank Rijkaard was subsequently appointed as new manager for 2003–04, and the player scored 14 times in the league alone, but was deemed surplus at the club as was longtime attacking partner Patrick Kluivert.

Saviola was sent on loan in the summer of 2004, moving to Monaco in Ligue 1. As he did not fit into Rijkaard&#x27;s plans, he was again loaned out the following year, this time to Sevilla who were seeking to replace Real Madrid-bound Júlio Baptista; with the Andalusians he won his first title in Europe, conquering the UEFA Cup — he also scored nine times in the league, good enough for fifth.

Saviola returned to Barcelona for 2006–07, playing in 18 league games, six as a starter, and netting five goals. He benefited greatly from injuries to teammates, most notably to Samuel Eto&#x27;o, and added five in as many matches in that season&#x27;s Copa del Rey, notably a hat-trick against Alavés (3–2 win at home, 5–2 aggregate).

===Real Madrid===
On 10 July 2007, Real Madrid signed Saviola after his Barcelona contract expired, on a three-year deal. Although on a financially lucrative contract, he endured a difficult time at Real, being mainly restricted to cup matches and sporadic appearances (mainly as a substitute) in the league and the UEFA Champions League.

The arrival of Klaas-Jan Huntelaar limited Saviola&#x27;s opportunities even more, and he finished his Real Madrid spell with five goals in 28 overall appearances.

===Benfica===

On 26 June 2009, Benfica and Real Madrid agreed on a €5 million deal that would see Saviola play in Portugal for the next three years, with an option for one more; a €30 million clause was added. On 16 July, he scored two goals to send his team into the Guadiana Trophy finals after defeating Athletic Bilbao.

Saviola netted twice on 22 October 2009, guiding his side to a 5–0 victory over Everton for the UEFA Europa League (he would also score in their 2–0 win in Liverpool in the second match), adding another brace four days later in a 6–1 routing of C.D. Nacional for the Primeira Liga.

On 6 December 2009, Saviola scored through a chip shot against Académica de Coimbra in a 4–0 home win. On 20 December, he netted the game&#x27;s only goal as Benfica defeated rivals Porto at home; during the victorious campaign, he formed a deadly attacking partnership with Paraguayan Óscar Cardozo, with the pair combining for more than 50 goals overall.

On 3 January 2010, shortly before receiving the SJPF Player of the Month award, Saviola scored another winning goal against Nacional, now for the Taça da Liga, again being the game&#x27;s only scorer in an away defeat of Rio Ave, netting in the 48th minute. He scored his 19th goal overall in a 3–1 home triumph against Paços de Ferreira on 7 March, and the Lisbon club was eventually crowned league champions

===Málaga===
In the last hours of the 2012–13 summer transfer window, Saviola agreed on a move to Málaga. He played 45 minutes in his first appearance, a 1–0 win at Real Zaragoza on 1 September.

On 15 September 2012, Saviola scored once and provided one assist in a 3−1 home win against Levante. He continued with his streak the following game, Málaga&#x27;s first-ever in the Champions League group stage, netting in a 3–0 home win over Zenit Saint Petersburg.

===Olympiacos===
On 25 July 2013, Saviola signed a two-year contract with Greek champions Olympiacos. He scored his first goal in the Superleague on 25 August, coming on at half-time and helping his team come from behind to win 2–1 at home to Atromitos On 10 December, he netted a brace – and also missed a penalty – in a 3–1 success over Anderlecht also at the Karaiskakis Stadium in the group stage&#x27;s last round, which helped the Piraeus team finish second and qualify at the expense of former side Benfica.

===Verona===
On 2 September 2014, Saviola joined Serie A club Hellas Verona. He made his official debut on 22 September, starting in a 2–2 home draw against Genoa, and scored his first goal on 2 December, netting the only in a home win over Perugia for the Coppa Italia. His sole goal of the league season came on 25 January 2015, the only one in a home victory over Atalanta.

===Return to River===
On 30 June 2015, River Plate announced that Saviola had returned to the club. He left in January of the following year, after failing to find the net in his second spell, and subsequently retired from professional football at the age of 34.

===Retirement, coaching, and futsal career===
Immediately after retiring, Saviola settled in Andorra with his family and was appointed assistant manager at Ordino in the Primera Divisió. In February 2018, he joined local futsal team Encamp. In April of that year, he won the principality&#x27;s futsal league with the side.

==International career==

Saviola starred in the 2001 edition of the FIFA U-20 World Cup, held in Argentina. He was top scorer and was voted player of the tournament, as the national team won the competition; with 11 goals in seven games, he became the record goal-scorer in the tournament&#x27;s history.

Three years later, Saviola played in the 2004 Olympic Games and won the gold medal. Under coach Marcelo Bielsa he was given few playing opportunities for the senior team but, after the former&#x27;s resignation in 2004, new manager José Pékerman, who also worked with him at youth level, turned the tide in the player&#x27;s favour; he was also a member of the squads that reached final of the 2004 Copa América and the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, netting three times in the former tournament and one in the latter.

Saviola was called up to represent Argentina at the 2006 World Cup – Luciano Figueroa and Luciano Galletti were also in contention for a place on the roster, but his excellent form for Sevilla secured his place in the squad. He scored against Ivory Coast in the country&#x27;s opening game, and made two assists in the 6–0 victory over Serbia and Montenegro also in the group phase.

Saviola retired from international football on 5 December 2009, although not yet 28. He stated that he felt his career as an Argentina player had come to an end, and that he wanted to concentrate on club football.

==Style of play==
Saviola was known for his speed, agility, dribbling and ability to score from almost any attacking position on the field. A diminutive, talented, and prolific forward, with a slender build, he was capable of playing as a striker, in a more creative role as a second striker, or even in a playmaking role as an attacking midfielder. Throughout his career, Saviola was nicknamed &quot;El Conejo&quot; (&quot;The Rabbit&quot;, in Spanish), due to his appearance, and also &quot;El Pibito&quot; (&quot;The Little Kid&quot;, in Spanish), a reference to compatriot Diego Maradona, who was nicknamed &quot;El Pibe de Oro&quot; (&quot;The Golden Kid&quot;, in Spanish), and to whom Saviola was often compared in his youth.

==Media==
Saviola was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in commercials for the brand. In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scopion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside footballers such as Luís Figo, Thierry Henry, Hidetoshi Nakata, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Francesco Totti, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

<text>The Junkers Ju 87, popularly known as the &quot;Stuka&quot;, is a German dive bomber and ground-attack aircraft. Designed by Hermann Pohlmann, it first flew in 1935. The Ju 87 made its combat debut in 1937 with the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 and served the Axis in World War II from beginning to end (1939–1945).

The aircraft is easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its faired main gear legs were mounted ram-air sirens, officially called &quot;Lärmgerät&quot; (noise device), which became a propaganda symbol of German air power and of the so-called &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; victories of 1939–1942, as well as providing Stuka pilots with audible feedback as to speed. The Stuka&#x27;s design included several innovations, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings to ensure that the aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces, or suffered from target fixation.

The Ju 87 operated with considerable success in close air support and anti-shipping roles at the outbreak of World War II. It led air assaults during the Invasion of Poland in September 1939. Stukas proved critical to the rapid conquest of Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France in 1940. Though sturdy, accurate, and very effective against ground targets, the Stuka was, like many other dive bombers of the period, vulnerable to fighter aircraft. During the Battle of Britain of 1940–1941, its lack of manoeuvrability, speed, or defensive armament meant that it required a heavy fighter escort to operate effectively.

After the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe deployed Stuka units in the Balkans Campaign, the African and the Mediterranean theatres and in the early stages of the Eastern Front war, where it was used for general ground support, as an effective specialised anti-tank aircraft and in an anti-shipping role. Once the Luftwaffe lost air superiority, the Stuka became an easy target for enemy fighters, but it continued being produced until 1944 for lack of a better replacement. By 1945 ground-attack versions of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 had largely replaced the Ju 87, but it remained in service until the end of the war in 1945.

Germany built an estimated 6,000 Ju 87s of all versions between 1936 and August 1944.

&quot;Oberst&quot; Hans-Ulrich Rudel became the most successful Stuka pilot and the most highly decorated German pilot of the war.

==Development==

===Early design===
The Ju 87&#x27;s principal designer, Hermann Pohlmann, held the opinion that any dive-bomber design needed to be simple and robust. This led to many technical innovations, such as the retractable undercarriage being discarded in favour of one of the Stuka&#x27;s distinctive features, its fixed and &quot;spatted&quot; undercarriage. Pohlmann continued to carry on developing and adding to his ideas and those of Dipl Ing Karl Plauth (Plauth was killed in a flying accident in November 1927), and produced the Ju A 48, which underwent testing on 29 September 1928. The military version of the Ju A 48 was designated the Ju K 47.

After the Nazis came to power, the design was given priority. Despite initial competition from the Henschel Hs 123, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM/German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, double vertical stabilisers were introduced to give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The main, and what was to be the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.
After Plauth&#x27;s death, Pohlmann continued the development of the Junkers dive bomber. The Ju A 48 registration D-ITOR, was originally fitted with a BMW 132 engine, producing 450 kW (600 hp). The machine was also fitted with dive brakes for dive testing. The aircraft was given a good evaluation and &quot;exhibited very good flying characteristics&quot;.

Ernst Udet took an immediate liking to the concept of dive-bombing after flying the Curtiss F11C Goshawk. When Walther Wever and Robert Ritter von Greim were invited to watch Udet perform a trial flight in May 1934 at the Jüterbog artillery range, it raised doubts about the capability of the dive bomber. Udet began his dive at and released his bombs at , barely recovering and pulling out of the dive. The chief of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Command Office Walther Wever, and the Secretary of State for Aviation Erhard Milch, feared that such high-level nerves and skill could not be expected of &quot;average pilots&quot; in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Nevertheless, development continued at Junkers. Udet&#x27;s &quot;growing love affair&quot; with the dive bomber pushed it to the forefront of German aviation development. Udet went so far as to advocate that all medium bombers should have dive-bombing capabilities, which initially doomed the only dedicated, strategic heavy bomber design to enter German front-line service during the war years—the 30-metre wingspan Heinkel He 177A—into having an airframe design (due to Udet examining its design details in November 1937) that could perform &quot;medium angle&quot; dive-bombing missions, until &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring exempted the He 177A, Germany&#x27;s only operational heavy bomber, in September 1942 from being given the task of such a mismatched mission profile for its large airframe.

===Evolution===
The design of the Ju 87 had begun in 1933 as part of the &quot;Sturzbomber-Programm&quot;. The Ju 87 was to be powered by the British Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. Ten engines were ordered by Junkers on 19 April 1934 for £20,514, two shillings and sixpence. The first Ju 87 prototype was built by AB Flygindustri in Sweden and secretly brought to Germany in late 1934. It was to have been completed in April 1935, but, due to the inadequate strength of the airframe, construction took until October 1935. The mostly complete Ju 87 V1 W.Nr. 4921 (less non-essential parts) took off for its maiden flight on 17 September 1935. The aircraft was later given the registration D-UBYR. The flight report, by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Willy Neuenhofen, stated the only problem was with the small radiator, which caused the engine to overheat.

The Ju 87 V1, powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 cylinder liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers&#x27; chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in a dive. The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating, along with brackets riveted to the frame and longeron, was fitted to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.

The RLM was still not interested in the Ju 87 and was not impressed that it relied on a British engine. In late 1935, Junkers suggested fitting a DB 600 inverted V-12 engine, with the final variant to be equipped with the Jumo 210. This was accepted by the RLM as an interim solution. The reworking of the design began on 1 January 1936. The test flight could not be carried out for over two months due to a lack of adequate aircraft. The 24 January crash had already destroyed one machine. The second prototype was also beset by design problems. It had its twin stabilisers removed and a single tail fin installed due to fears over stability. Due to a shortage of engines, instead of a DB 600, a BMW &quot;Hornet&quot; engine was fitted. All these delays set back testing until 25 February 1936. By March 1936, the second prototype, the V2, was finally fitted with the Jumo 210Aa engine, which a year later was replaced by a Jumo 210 G (W.Nr. 19310). The testing went well, and the pilot, Flight Captain Hesselbach, praised its performance. However, Wolfram von Richthofen, in charge of developing and testing new aircraft in the Technisches Amt, or Technical Service, told the Junkers representative and Construction Office chief engineer Ernst Zindel that the Ju 87 stood little chance of becoming the Luftwaffe&#x27;s main dive bomber, as it was underpowered in his opinion. On 9 June 1936, the RLM ordered cessation of development in favour of the Heinkel He 118, a rival design. Udet cancelled the order the next day, and development continued.

On 27 July 1936, Udet crashed the He 118 prototype, He 118 V1 D-UKYM. That same day, Charles Lindbergh was visiting Ernst Heinkel, so Heinkel could communicate with Udet only by telephone. According to this version of the story, Heinkel warned Udet about the propeller&#x27;s fragility. Udet failed to consider this, so in a dive, the engine oversped and the propeller broke away. Immediately after this incident, Udet announced the Stuka the winner of the development contest.

===Refinements===
Despite being chosen, the design was still lacking and drew frequent criticism from Wolfram von Richthofen. Testing of the V4 prototype (A Ju 87 A-0) in early 1937 revealed several problems. The Ju 87 could take off in and climb to in eight minutes with a bomb load, and its cruising speed was . Richthofen pushed for a more powerful engine. According to the test pilots, the Heinkel He 50 had a better acceleration rate, and could climb away from the target area much more quickly, avoiding enemy ground and air defences. Richthofen stated that any maximum speed below was unacceptable for those reasons. Pilots also complained that navigation and powerplant instruments were mixed together, and were not easy to read, especially in combat. Despite this, pilots praised the aircraft&#x27;s handling qualities and strong airframe.

These problems were to be resolved by installing the DB 600 engine, but delays in development forced the installation of the Jumo 210 D inverted V-12 engine. Flight testing began on 14 August 1936. Subsequent testing and progress fell short of Richthofen&#x27;s hopes, although the machine&#x27;s speed was increased to at ground level and at , while maintaining its good handling ability.

==Design==

===Basic design (based on the B series)===
The Ju 87 was a single-engined all-metal cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage and could carry a two-person crew. The main construction material was duralumin, and the external coverings were made of duralumin sheeting. Parts that were required to be of strong construction, such as the wing flaps, were made of Pantal (a German aluminium alloy containing titanium as a hardening element) and its components made of Elektron. Bolts and parts that were required to take heavy stress were made of steel.

The Ju 87 was fitted with detachable hatches and removable coverings to aid and ease maintenance and overhaul. The designers avoided welding parts wherever possible, preferring moulded and cast parts instead. Large airframe segments were interchangeable as a complete unit, which increased speed of repair.

The airframe was also subdivided into sections to allow transport by road or rail. The wings were of standard Junkers double-wing construction. This gave the Ju 87 considerable advantage on take-off; even at a shallow angle, large lift forces were created through the aerofoil, reducing take-off and landing runs.

In accordance with the Aircraft Certification Centre for &quot;Stress Group 5&quot;, the Ju 87 had reached the acceptable structural strength requirements for a dive bomber. It was able to withstand diving speeds of and a maximum level speed of near ground level, and a flying weight of . Performance in the diving attack was enhanced by the introduction of dive brakes under each wing, which allowed the Ju 87 to maintain a constant speed and allow the pilot to steady his aim. It also prevented the crew from suffering extreme g forces and high acceleration during &quot;pull-out&quot; from the dive.

The fuselage had an oval cross-section and housed, in most examples, a Junkers Jumo 211 water-cooled inverted V-12 engine. The cockpit was protected from the engine by a firewall ahead of the wing centre section where the fuel tanks were located. At the rear of the cockpit, the bulkhead was covered by a canvas cover which could be breached by the crew in an emergency, enabling them to escape into the main fuselage. The canopy was split into two sections and joined by a strong welded steel frame. The canopy itself was made of Plexiglas and each compartment had its own &quot;sliding hood&quot; for the two crew members.

The engine was mounted on two main support frames that were supported by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the engine&#x27;s top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.

The fuel system comprised two fuel tanks between the main (forward) and rear spars of the (inner) anhedral wing section of the port and starboard wings, each with capacity. The tanks also had a predetermined limit which, if passed, would warn the pilot via a red warning light in the cockpit. The fuel was injected via a pump from the tanks to the engine. Should this shut down, it could be pumped manually using a hand-pump on the fuel cock armature. The powerplant was cooled by a , ring-shaped aluminium water container situated between the propeller and engine. A further container of was positioned under the engine.

The control surfaces operated in much the same way as other aircraft, with the exception of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking manual control.

The wing was the most unusual feature. It consisted of a single centre section and two outer sections, each installed using four universal joints. The centre section had a large negative dihedral (anhedral) and the outer surfaces a positive dihedral. This created the inverted gull, or &quot;cranked&quot;, wing pattern along the leading edge. The shape of the wing improved the pilot&#x27;s ground visibility and also allowed a shorter undercarriage height. The centre section protruded by only on either side.

The offensive armament was two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns fitted one in each wing outboard of undercarriage, operated by a mechanical pneumatics system from the pilot&#x27;s control column. The rear gunner/radio operator operated one 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun for defensive purposes.

The engine and propeller had automatic controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit side window with the horizon and aiming at the target with the sight of the fixed gun. The heavy bomb was swung down clear of the propeller on crutches prior to release.

===Diving procedure===

Flying at , the pilot located his target through a bombsight window in the cockpit floor. The pilot moved the dive lever to the rear, limiting the &quot;throw&quot; of the control column. The dive brakes were activated automatically, the pilot set the trim tabs, reduced his throttle and closed the coolant flaps. The aircraft then rolled 180°, automatically nosing the aircraft into a dive. Red tabs protruded from the upper surfaces of the wing as a visual indicator to the pilot that, in case of a g-force induced black-out, the automatic dive recovery system would be activated. The Stuka dove at a 60–90° angle, holding a constant speed of due to dive-brake deployment, which increased the accuracy of the Ju 87&#x27;s aim.

When the aircraft was reasonably close to the target, a light on the contact altimeter (an altimeter equipped with an electrical contact which triggers at a preset altitude) came on to indicate the bomb-release point, usually at a minimum height of . The pilot released the bomb and initiated the automatic pull-out mechanism by depressing a knob on the control column. An elongated U-shaped crutch located under the fuselage swung the bomb out of the way of the propeller, and the aircraft automatically began a 6g pullout. Once the nose was above the horizon, dive brakes were retracted, the throttle was opened, and the propeller was set to climb. The pilot regained control and resumed normal flight. The coolant flaps had to be reopened quickly to prevent overheating. The automatic pull-out was not liked by all pilots. Helmut Mahlke later said that he and his unit disconnected the system because it allowed the enemy to predict the Ju 87&#x27;s recovery pattern and height, making it easier for ground defences to hit an aircraft.

Physical stress on the crew was severe. Human beings subjected to more than 5g in a seated position will suffer vision impairment in the form of a grey veil known to Stuka pilots as &quot;seeing stars&quot;. They lose vision while remaining conscious; after five seconds, they black out. The Ju 87 pilots experienced the visual impairments most during &quot;pull-up&quot; from a dive.

Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown RN, a British test pilot and Commanding Officer of No. 1426 Flight RAF (the captured enemy aircraft Flight), tested the Ju 87 at RAE Farnborough. He said of the Stuka, &quot;I had flown a lot of dive-bombers and it&#x27;s the only one that you can dive truly vertically. Sometimes with the dive-bombers ... maximum dive is usually in the order of 60 degrees ... When flying the Stuka, because it&#x27;s all automatic, you are really flying vertically ... The Stuka was in a class of its own.&quot;

===G-force test at Dessau===
Extensive tests were carried out by the Junkers works at their Dessau plant. It was discovered that the highest load a pilot could endure was 8.5 g for three seconds, when the aircraft was pushed to its limit by the centrifugal forces. At less than 4 g, no visual problems or loss of consciousness were experienced. Above 6 g, 50% of pilots suffered visual problems, or &quot;greyout&quot;. With 40%, vision vanished altogether from 7.5 g upwards and black-out sometimes occurred. Despite this blindness, the pilot could maintain consciousness and was capable of &quot;bodily reactions&quot;. After more than three seconds, half the subjects passed out. The pilot would regain consciousness two or three seconds after the centrifugal forces had dropped below 3 g and had lasted no longer than three seconds. In a crouched position, pilots could withstand 7.5 g and were able to remain functional for a short duration. In this position, Junkers concluded that of pilots could withstand 8 g and perhaps 9 g for three to five seconds without vision defects which, under war conditions, was acceptable. During tests with the Ju 87 A-2, new technologies were tried out to reduce the effects of g. The pressurised cabin was of great importance during this research. Testing revealed that at high altitude, even 2 g could cause death in an unpressurised cabin and without appropriate clothing. This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested. When the United States Army occupied the Junkers factory at Dessau on 21 April 1945, they were both impressed at and interested in the medical flight tests with the Ju 87.

===Other designs===
The concept of dive bombing became so popular among the leadership of the Luftwaffe that it became almost obligatory in new aircraft designs. Later bomber models like the Junkers Ju 88 and the Dornier Do 217 were equipped for dive bombing. The Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber was initially supposed to have dive bombing capabilities, a requirement that contributed to the failure of the design, with the requirement not rescinded until September 1942 by Göring.

Once the Stuka became too vulnerable to fighter opposition on all fronts, work was done to develop a replacement. None of the dedicated close-support designs on the drawing board progressed far due to the impact of the war and technological difficulties. So the Luftwaffe settled on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the Fw 190F becoming the ground-attack version. The Fw 190F started to replace the Ju 87 for day missions in 1943, but the Ju 87 continued to be used as a night nuisance-raider until the end of the war.

==Variants==

===Ju 87 A===

The second prototype had a redesigned single vertical stabiliser and a Jumo 210 A engine installed, and later the Jumo 210Da. The first A series variant, the A-0, was of all-metal construction, with an enclosed cockpit under a &quot;greenhouse&quot; well-framed canopy; bearing twin radio masts on its aft sections, diagonally mounted to either side of the airframe&#x27;s planform centreline and unique to the -A version. To ease the difficulty of mass production, the leading edge of the wing was straightened out and the ailerons&#x27; two aerofoil sections had smooth leading and trailing edges. The pilot could adjust the elevator and rudder trim tabs in flight, and the tail was connected to the landing flaps, which were positioned in two parts between the ailerons and fuselage. The A-0 also had a flatter engine cowling, which gave the pilot a much better field of vision. In order for the engine cowling to be flattened, the engine was set down nearly . The fuselage was also lowered along with the gunner&#x27;s position, allowing the gunner a better field of fire.

The RLM ordered seven A-0s initially, but then increased the order to 11. Early in 1937, the A-0 was tested with varied bomb loads. The underpowered Jumo 210A, as pointed out by von Richthofen, was insufficient, and was quickly replaced with the Jumo 210D engine.

The A-1 differed from the A-0 only slightly. As well as the installation of the Jumo 210D, the A-1 had two fuel tanks built into the inner wing, but it was not armoured or protected. The A-1 was also intended to be fitted with four MG 17 machine guns in its wings, but two of these—one per side—were omitted due to weight concerns; the pair that remained were fed a total of 500 rounds of ammunition, stored in the design&#x27;s characteristic transverse strut-braced, large-planform undercarriage &quot;trousers&quot;, not used on the Ju 87B versions and onward. The pilot relied on the Revi C 21C gun sight for the two MG 17s. The gunner had a single MG 15, with 14 drums of ammunition, each containing 75 rounds. This represented a 150-round increase in this area over the Ju 87 A-0. The A-1 was also fitted with a larger propeller.

The Ju 87 was capable of carrying a bomb, but only if not carrying the rear gunner/radio operator as, even with the Jumo 210D, the Ju 87 was still underpowered for operations with more than a bomb load. All Ju 87 As were restricted to weapons (although during the Spanish Civil War missions were conducted without the gunner).

The Ju 87 A-2 was retrofitted with the Jumo 210Da fitted with a two-stage supercharger. The only further significant difference between the A-1 and A-2 was the H-PA-III controllable-pitch propeller. By mid-1938, 262 Ju 87 As had been produced, 192 from the Junkers factory in Dessau and a further 70 from Weser Flugzeugbau (&quot;Weserflug&quot; – WFG) in Lemwerder near Bremen. The new, more powerful, Ju 87B model started to replace the Ju 87A at this time.

===Ju 87 B===
The Ju 87 B series was to be the first mass-produced variant. A total of six pre-production Ju 87 B-0 were produced, built from Ju 87 A airframes. The first production version was the Ju 87 B-1, with a considerably larger engine, its Jumo 211D generating 1,200 PS (), and completely redesigned fuselage and landing gear, replacing the twin radio masts of the &quot;A&quot; version with a single mast mounted further forward on the &quot;greenhouse&quot; canopy, and much simpler, lighter-weight wheel &quot;spats&quot; used from the -B version onwards, discarding the transverse strut bracing of the &quot;A&quot; version&#x27;s maingear design. This new design was again tested in Spain, and after proving its abilities there, production was ramped up to 60 per month. As a result, by the outbreak of World War II, the Luftwaffe had 336 Ju 87 B-1s on hand.

The B-1 was also fitted with &quot;Lärmgeräte&quot;, essentially sirens driven by propellers with a diameter of The devices caused a loss of 20–25 km/h (12–15 mph) through drag, and over time the sirens were no longer installed on many units, although they remained in use to various extent. As an alternative, some bombs were fitted with whistles on the fin to produce the noise after release. The trumpets were a suggestion from Udet, but some authors say the idea originated from Adolf Hitler.

The Ju 87 B-2s that followed had some improvements and were built in several variants that included ski-equipped versions (the B-1 also had this modification) and at the other end, with a tropical operation kit called the Ju 87 B-2 trop. Italy&#x27;s Regia Aeronautica received B-2s and named them the &quot;Picchiatello&quot;, while others went to the other members of the Axis, including Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. The B-2 also had an oil hydraulic system for closing the cowling flaps. This continued in all the later designs.

Production of the Ju 87 B started in 1937. 89 B-1s were to be built at Junkers&#x27; factory in Dessau and another 40 at the Weserflug plant in Lemwerder by July 1937. Production would be carried out by the Weserflug company after April 1938, but Junkers continued producing Ju 87 up until March 1940.

=== Ju 87 R ===
A long range version of the Ju 87 B was also built, known as the Ju 87 R, the letter being an abbreviation for &quot;Reichweite&quot;, &quot;(operational) range&quot;. They were primarily intended for anti-shipping missions. The Ju 87 R had a B-series airframe with an additional oil tank and fuel lines to the outer wing stations to permit the use of two standardised capacity under-wing drop tanks, used by a wide variety of Luftwaffe aircraft through most of the war. This increased fuel capacity to (500 litres in main fuel tank of which 480 litres were usable + 600 litres from drop tanks). To prevent overload conditions, bomb carrying ability was often restricted to a single bomb if the aircraft was fully loaded with fuel.

The Ju 87 R-1 had a B-1 airframe with the exception of a modification in the fuselage which enabled an additional oil tank. This was installed to feed the engine due to the increase in range with the extra fuel tanks.
The Ju 87 R-2 had the same airframe as the B-2, and strengthened to ensure it could withstand dives of . The Jumo 211D in-line engine was installed, replacing the R-1s Jumo 211A. Due to an increase in overall weight by , the Ju 87 R-2 was slower than the Ju 87 B-1 and had a lower service ceiling. The Ju 87 R-2 had an increased range advantage of . The R-3 and R-4 were the last R variants developed. Only a few were built. The R-3 was an experimental tug for gliders and had an expanded radio system so the crew could communicate with the glider crew by way of the tow rope. The R-4 differed from the R-2 in the Jumo 211J powerplant.

=== Ju 87 C ===
On 18 August 1937, the RLM decided to introduce the Ju 87 Tr(C). The Ju 87 C was intended to be a dive and torpedo bomber for the Kriegsmarine. The type was ordered into prototype production and available for testing in January 1938. Testing was given two months and was to begin in February and end in April 1938. The prototype V10 was to be a fixed wing test aircraft, while the following V11 would be modified with folding wings. The prototypes were Ju 87 B-0 airframes powered by Jumo 211 A engines. Owing to delays, the V10 was not completed until March 1938. It first flew on 17 March and was designated Ju 87 C-1. On 12 May, the V11 also flew for the first time. By 15 December 1939, 915 arrested landings on dry land had been made. It was found that the arresting gear winch was too weak and had to be replaced. Tests showed the average braking distance was . The Ju 87 V11 was designated C-0 on 8 October 1938. It was fitted out with standard Ju 87 C-0 equipment and better wing-folding mechanisms. The &quot;carrier Stuka&quot; was to be built at the Weserflug Company&#x27;s Lemwerder plant between April and July 1940.

Among the &quot;special&quot; equipment of the Ju 87 C was a two-seat rubber dinghy with a flare gun, signal ammunition and other emergency supplies. A quick fuel dump mechanism and two inflatable 750 L (200 US gal) bags in each wing and a further two 500 L (130 US gal) bags in the fuselage enabled the Ju 87 C to remain afloat for up to three days in calm seas. On 6 October 1939, with the war already underway, 120 of the planned Ju 87 Tr(C)s on order at that point were cancelled. Despite the cancellation, the tests continued using catapults. The Ju 87 C had a takeoff weight of and a speed of on departure. The Ju 87 could be launched with a SC bomb and four SC bombs under the fuselage. The C-1 was to have two MG 17s mounted in the wing with a MG 15 operated by the rear gunner. On 18 May 1940, production of the C-1 was switched to the R-1.

=== Ju 87 D ===
Despite the Stuka&#x27;s vulnerability to enemy fighters having been exposed during the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe had no choice but to continue its development, as there was no replacement aircraft in sight. The result was the D-series. In June 1941, the RLM ordered five prototypes, the Ju 87 V21–25. A Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplant was to be installed in the Ju 87 D-1, but it did not have the power of the Jumo 211 and performed &quot;poorly&quot; during tests and was dropped. The Ju 87 D-series featured two coolant radiators underneath the inboard sections of the wings, while the oil cooler was relocated to the position formerly occupied by the single, undernose &quot;chin&quot; coolant radiator. The D-series also introduced an aerodynamically refined cockpit with better visibility and space. Armour protection was increased and a new dual-barrel 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 81Z machine gun with an extremely high rate of fire was installed in the rear defensive position. Engine power was increased again, the Jumo 211J now delivering 1,420 PS ().
Bomb carrying ability was nearly quadrupled from in the B-version to in the D-version (max. load for short ranges, overload condition), a typical bomb load ranged from .

The internal fuel capacity of the Ju 87 D was raised to 800 L (of which 780 L were usable) by adding wing tanks while retaining the option to carry two 300 L drop tanks. Tests at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield revealed it made possible a flight duration of 2 hours and 15 minutes. With an extra two 300 L (80 US gal) fuel tanks, it could achieve four hours flight time.

The D-2 was a variant used as a glider tug by converting older D-series airframes. It was intended as the tropical version of the D-1 and had heavier armour to protect the crew from ground fire. The armour reduced its performance and caused the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe to &quot;place no particular value on the production of the D-2&quot;. The D-3 was an improved D-1 with more armour for its ground-attack role. Some Ju 87 D-3s were designated D-3N or D-3 trop and fitted with night or tropical equipment. The D-4 designation applied to a prototype torpedo-bomber version, which could carry a aerial torpedo on a PVC 1006 B rack—this setup would have had the capacity to carry the &quot;Luftorpedo&quot; LT 850, the German version of the well-proven Japanese Type 91 aerial torpedo of 848 kg (1,870 lb). The D-4 was to be converted from D-3 airframes and, in place of the carrier-specific Ju 87C series designs, operated from the aircraft carrier &quot;&quot;. Other modifications included a flame eliminator and, unlike earlier D variants, two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon, while the radio operator/rear gunner&#x27;s ammunition supply was increased by 1,000 to 2,000 rounds.
The Ju 87 D-5 was based on the D-3 design and was unique in the Ju 87 series as it had wings 0.6 metres (2 ft) longer than previous variants. The two 7.92 mm MG 17 wing guns were exchanged for more powerful 20 mm MG 151/20s to better suit the aircraft&#x27;s ground-attack role. The window in the floor of the cockpit was reinforced and four, rather than the previous three, aileron hinges were installed. Higher diving speeds were obtained of up to . The range was recorded as at ground level and at .

The D-6, according to &quot;Operating instructions, works document 2097&quot;, was built in limited numbers to train pilots on &quot;rationalised versions&quot;. Due to shortages in raw materials, it did not go into mass production. The D-7 was another ground attack aircraft based on D-1 airframes upgraded to D-5 standard (armour, wing cannons, extended wing panels), while the D-8 was similar to the D-7 but based on D-3 airframes. The D-7 and D-8 were both were fitted with exhaust flame dampers, and could conduct night operations.

Production of the D-1 variant started in 1941 with 495 ordered. These aircraft were delivered between May 1941 and March 1942. The RLM wanted 832 machines produced from February 1941. The Weserflug company was tasked with their production. From June to September 1941, 40 Ju 87 Ds were expected to be built, increasing to 90 thereafter. Various production problems were encountered. One of the planned 48 was produced in July. Of the 25 the RLM hoped for in August 1941, none were delivered. In September did the first two of the planned 102 Ju 87s came off the production lines. The shortfalls continued to the end of 1941. During this time, the WFG plant in Lemwerder moved production to Berlin. Over 165 Ju 87s had not been delivered and production was only 23 Ju 87 Ds per month out of the 40 expected. By the spring of 1942 to the end of production in 1944, 3,300 Ju 87s, mostly D-1s, D-2s and D-5s had been manufactured.

In January 1943, a variety of Ju 87 Ds became &quot;test beds&quot; for the Ju 87 G variants. At the start of 1943, the coastal Luftwaffe &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; test centre at Tarnewitz tested this combination from a static position. &quot;Oberst&quot; G. Wolfgang Vorwald noted the experiments were not successful, and suggested the cannon be installed on the Messerschmitt Me 410. Testing continued, and on 31 January 1943, Ju 87 D-1 W.Nr 2552 was tested by &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Hans-Karl Stepp near the Briansk training area. Stepp noted the increase in drag, which reduced the aircraft&#x27;s speed to . Stepp also noted that the aircraft was also less agile than the existing D variants. D-1 and D-3 variants operated in combat with the BK 37 cannon in 1943.

=== Ju 87 G ===
With the G variant, the ageing airframe of the Ju 87 found new life as an anti-tank aircraft. This was the final operational version of the Stuka, and was deployed on the Eastern Front. The reverse in German military fortunes after 1943 and the appearance of huge numbers of well-armoured Soviet tanks caused Junkers to adapt the existing design to combat this new threat. The Henschel Hs 129 had proved a potent ground attack weapon, but its large fuel tanks made it vulnerable to enemy fire, prompting the RLM to say, &quot;that in the shortest possible time a replacement of the Hs 129 type must take place.&quot; With Soviet tanks the priority targets, the development of a further variant as a successor to the Ju 87D began in November 1942. On 3 November, Milch raised the question of replacing the Ju 87, or redesigning it altogether. It was decided to keep the design as it was, but the power-plant was upgraded to a Junkers Jumo 211J, and two cannons were added. The variant was also designed to carry a free-fall bomb load. Furthermore, the armoured protection of the Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Sturmovik&quot; was copied to protect the crew from ground fire now that the Ju 87 would be required to conduct low level attacks.

Hans-Ulrich Rudel, a Stuka ace, had suggested using two 37 mm (1.46 in) Flak 18 guns, each one in a self-contained under-wing gun pod, as the &quot;Bordkanone BK 3,7&quot;, after achieving success against Soviet tanks with the 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon. These gun pods were fitted to a Ju 87 D-1, W.Nr 2552. The first flight of the machine took place on 31 January 1943, piloted by Stepp. The continuing problems with about two dozen of the Ju 88P-1 and slow development of the Henschel Hs 129 B-3, both designs using the large, 7.5 cm Pak 40-based, autoloading Bordkanone 7,5 7.5 cm (2.95 in) cannon in a conformal gun pod beneath the fuselage, meant the Ju 87G was put into production. In April 1943, the first production Ju 87 G-1s were delivered to front line units. The two 37 mm (1.46 in) &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 3,7 cannons were mounted in under-wing gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition. With these weapons, the &quot;Kanonenvogel&quot; (&quot;cannon-bird&quot;), as it was nicknamed, proved very successful in the hands of Stuka aces such as Rudel. The G-1 was converted from older D-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except for use of the extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from D-3 airframes. Only a handful of production Gs were committed in the Battle of Kursk. On the opening day of the offensive, Hans-Ulrich Rudel flew the only &quot;official&quot; Ju 87 G, although a significant number of Ju 87 D variants were fitted with the 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon, and operated as unofficial Ju 87 Gs before the battle. In June 1943, the RLM ordered 20 Ju 87Gs as production variants.

=== Night-harassment variants ===
The Ju 87 had been used in the night intruder role in 1940 and 1941 during The Blitz, but the Soviet Air Force practice of harassing German ground forces using antiquated Polikarpov Po-2 and R-5 biplanes at night to drop flares and fragmentation bombs, inspired the Luftwaffe to form its own &quot;Störkampfstaffeln&quot; (harassment squadrons). On 23 July 1942, Junkers offered the Ju 87 B-2, R-2 and R-4s with &quot;Flammenvernichter&quot; (&quot;flame eliminators&quot;). On 10 November 1943, the RLM GL/C-E2 Division finally authorised the design in directive No. 1117.

The need to equip night units and the phasing out of Ju 87s from ground attack groups in favour of the Fw 190, enabled the use of D-5 airframes awaiting repair and D-7 and 8s already in conversion units. The latter variants were either conversions or modified D-1 and D-3 air frames. Adding the necessary equipment, radios and dampeners was a requirement regardless of whether the aircraft was a production D-5 or a D-1 or 3 that had undergone wing changes. The change in designations due to conversions was not readily apparent, for with wing changes, the serial number and designation was applied to the fuselage by the manufacture which remained unaltered by wing changes. Some sub-contractors added an &quot;N&quot; designation (Nacht) for clarity on D-3 and 5s . Others added the roman numeral VII to the D-7s, perhaps to reflect that the aircraft was fitted with the FuG 7 radio. A great deal of confusion exists concerning the D-7. Its existence has been questioned, but the type is listed in Junkers company records and in the &quot;Der Reichsminister der Luftfahrt&quot; and &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe Technisches Amt&quot;. There was no production &quot;nacht stuka&quot;, and modifications could vary according to the sub-contractor and depending on what parts were available.

A Stuka repair centre was set up at Wels-Lichtenegg. From May 1940 to November 1944, 746 were repaired and flight-tested there. In the winter 1943/44, the &quot;Metal Works Lower Saxony Brinckmann und Mergell&quot; company (Menibum) converted approximately 300 Ju 87D-3 and 5s to night versions. Dive-brakes were removed there, while gun muzzles and dampers were installed to eliminate exhaust and muzzle flash. The Jumo 211P engine was installed in some cases. It took 2,170 technicians and workers to carry out the conversions. Total figures for conversions to night flying operations are unknown. The company&#x27;s equipment was seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war, and the records were lost or destroyed. A main piece of equipment, hereto not installed in the Ju 87, was the FuG 101 Electronic Radio Altimeter. This was used to measure height. Some Ju 87s also used FuG 16Z transmitter/receiver set to augment the FuG 25 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe).

Pilots were also asked to complete the new &quot;Blind Flying Certificate 3&quot;, which was especially introduced for this new type of operation. Pilots were trained at night, over unfamiliar terrain, and forced to rely on their instruments for direction. The Ju 87&#x27;s standard Revi C12D gunsight was replaced with the new &quot;Nachtrevi&quot; (&quot;Night revi&quot;) C12N. On some Ju 87s, the Revi 16D was exchanged for the Nachtrevi 16D. To help the pilot see his instrument panel, a violet light was installed.

On 15 November 1942, the Auxiliary &quot;Staffel&quot; was created. By mid-1943, &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 1 was given four &quot;Staffeln&quot; while &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4 and &quot;Luftwaffe Kommando Ost&quot; (Luftwaffe Command East) were given six and two respectively. In the first half of 1943, 12 &quot;Nachtschlachtgruppen&quot; (&quot;night battle groups&quot;—NSGr) had been formed, flying a multitude of different types of aircraft, including the Ju 87, which proved itself ideally suited to the low-level slow flying needed. NSGr 1 and 2 fought with some success on the Western Front during the Battle of Normandy and Battle of the Bulge. NSGr 7 operated in &quot;anti-partisan&quot; role from bases in Albania from July 1944, replacing their use of German trainers. The 3rd and 4th group served on the Eastern Front, the 8th in the Arctic and the 9th in Italy. NSGr 20 fought against the Western Allied invasion of Germany in 1945. Photographic evidence exists of 16 NSGr 20 Ju 87s lining up to take-off in the woods circling the Lippe airfield, Germany while under attack from Republic P-47 Thunderbolts of the USAAF IX Tactical Air Command. The unit operated against the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen.

==Production==
Despite initial production issues with the Ju 87, the RLM ordered 216 Ju 87 A-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between January 1936 and 1938. The Junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to other production facilities became necessary. The first 35 Ju 87 A-1s were therefore produced by the Weser Flugzeugbau (WFG). By 1 September 1939, 360 Ju 87 As and Bs had been built by the Junkers factories at Dessau and Weserflug factory in Lemwerder near Bremen. By 30 September 1939, Junkers had received 2,365,196 Reichsmark (RM) for Ju 87 construction orders. The RLM paid another 243,646 RM for development orders. According to audit records in Berlin, by the end of the financial year on 30 September 1941, 3,059,000 RM had been spent on Ju 87 airframes. By 30 June 1940, 697 Ju 87 B-1s and 129 B-2s alone had been produced. Another 105 R-1s and seven R-2s had been built.

The range of the B-2 was insufficient, and dropped in favor of the Ju 87 R long-range versions in the second half of 1940. The 105 R-1s were converted to R-2 status and a further 616 production R-2s were ordered. In May 1941, the development of the D-1 was planned and was ordered into production by March 1942. The expansion of the Ju 88 production lines to compensate for the withdrawal of Dornier Do 17 production delayed production of the Ju 87 D. The Weserflug plant in Lemwerder experienced production shortfalls. This prompted Milch to visit and threaten the company into meeting the RLM&#x27;s Ju 87 D-1 requirements on 23 February 1942. To meet these demands, 700 skilled workers were needed. Skilled workers had been called up for military service in the Wehrmacht. Junkers were able to supply 300 German workers to the Weserflug factory, and as an interim solution, Soviet prisoners of war and Soviet civilians deported to Germany. Working around the clock, the shortfall was made good. WFG received an official commendation. By May 1942, demand increased further. Chief of Procurement General Walter Herthel found that each unit needed 100 Ju 87s as standard strength and an average of 20 per month to cover attrition. Not until June–December 1942 did production capacity increase, and 80 Ju 87s were produced per month.

By 17 August 1942, production had climbed rapidly after Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 production was scaled down and licence work had shut down at WFG. Production now reached 150 Ju 87 D airframes per month, but spare parts were failing to reach the same production levels. Undercarriage parts were in particularly short supply. Milch ordered production to 350 Ju 87s per month in September 1942. This was not achievable due to the insufficient production capacity in the Reich.

The RLM considered setting up production facilities in Slovakia. But this would delay production until the buildings and factories could be furnished with the machine tools. These tools were also in short supply, and the RLM hoped to purchase them from Switzerland and Italy. The Slovaks could provide 3,500–4,000 workers, but no technical personnel. The move would produce only another 25 machines per month at a time when demand was increasing. In October, production plans were dealt another blow when one of WFGs plants burned down, leaving a chronic shortage of tailwheels and undercarriage parts. Junkers director and member of the Luftwaffe industry council Carl Frytag reported that by January 1943 only 120 Ju 87s could be produced at Bremen and 230 at Berlin-Tempelhof.

===Decline and end of production===
After evaluating Ju 87 operations on the Eastern Front, Göring ordered production limited to 200 per month in total. &quot;&quot; (&quot;General of Ground Attack&quot;) Ernst Kupfer decided continued development would &quot;hardly bring any further tactical value&quot;. Adolf Galland, a fighter pilot with operational and combat experience in ground attack, said that abandoning development would be premature, but 150 machines per month would be sufficient.
On 28 July 1943, strike and bomber production was to be scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. On 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should take its place. Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for a smooth transition period.
In May 1944, production wound down. 78 Ju 87s were built in May and 69 rebuilt from damaged machines. In the next six months, 438 Ju 87 Ds and Gs were added to the Ju 87 force as new or repaired aircraft. It is unknown whether any Ju 87s were built from parts unofficially after December 1944 and the end of production.

Overall, 550 Ju 87 As and B2s were completed at the Junkers factory in Dessau. Production of the Ju 87 R and D variants was transferred to the Weserflug company, which produced 5,930 of the 6,500 Ju 87s produced in total. During the course of the war, little damage was done to the WFG plant at Lemwerder. Attacks throughout 1940-45 caused little lasting damage and succeeded only in damaging some Ju 87 airframes, in contrast to the Focke-Wulf plant in Bremen. At Berlin-Tempelhof, little delay or damage was caused to Ju 87 production, despite the heavy bombings and large-scale destruction inflicted on other targets. The WFG again went unscathed. The Junkers factory at Dessau was heavily attacked, but not until Ju 87 production had ceased. The Ju 87 repair facility at the Wels aircraft works was destroyed on 30 May 1944, and the site abandoned Ju 87 links.

==Operational history==

===Spanish Civil War===
Among the many German aircraft designs that participated in the Condor Legion, and as part of other German involvement in the Spanish Civil War, a single Ju 87 A-0 (the V4 prototype) was allocated serial number 29-1 and was assigned to the VJ/88, the experimental &quot;Staffel&quot; of the Legion&#x27;s fighter wing. The aircraft was secretly loaded onto the ship &quot;Usaramo&quot; and departed Hamburg harbour on the night of 1 August 1936, arriving in Cádiz five days later. The only known information pertaining to its combat career in Spain is that it was piloted by &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Herman Beuer, and took part in the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao in 1937. Presumably the aircraft was then secretly returned to Germany.

In January 1938, three Ju 87 As from the Legion Condor arrived. Several problems became evident—the spatted undercarriage sank into muddy airfield surfaces, and the spats were temporarily removed. The maximum bomb load could only be carried if the gunner vacated his seat, therefore the bomb load was restricted to . These aircraft supported the Nationalist forces and carried out anti-shipping missions until they returned to Germany in October 1938. During the Catalonia Offensive in January 1939, the Junkers Ju 87 returned to Spain. On the morning of 21 January 1939, 34 Heinkel He 111, along with some escorts and three Ju 87B, attacked the Port of Barcelona, five days before the city was captured by the Nationalists. 29 Republican fighters were defending the city. There were more than 100 aircraft operating over the city and, while a Ju 87 was dive-bombing a ship, a Republican Polikarpov I-15 pilot, Francisco Alférez Jiménez, claimed it destroyed near El Vendrell, in Comarruga, but the Stuka was capable of landing on the beach without crashing. That was the only time a Stuka attacked the capital of Catalonia. On 24 January 1939, a group of Stukas prevented the destruction of a bridge near Barcelona by strafing the demolition engineers on Molins de Rei. During the attack the Republican ground defenders, equipped with a quadruple PM M1910 mounting, hit one pilot (Heinz Bohne) in both legs and the Stuka crashed, seriously injuring Bohne, and his machine gunner, Albert Conrad. Those two were the only Stuka casualties of the war.

As with the Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were returned discreetly to the Reich. The experience of the Spanish Civil War proved invaluable—air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had however not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.

===Second World War===
All Stuka units were moved to Germany&#x27;s eastern border in preparation for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through clouds, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling. They were unaware that the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time to pull out of the dive.

====Poland====
On 1 September 1939, the Wehrmacht invaded Poland, beginning World War II. &quot;Generalquartiermeister der Luftwaffe&quot; records indicate a total force of 366 Ju 87 A and Bs were available for operations on 31 August 1939. The first Ju 87 operation was to destroy Polish demolition charges fixed to the rail bridges over the Vistula, that linked Eastern Germany to the Danzig corridor and East Prussia as well as Polish Pomerania. To do this, Ju 87s were ordered to perform a low-level attack on the Polish Army Garrison headquarters. II. and III./StG 1 targeted the cables along the embankment, the electricity plant and signal boxes at Dirschau (now Tczew, Poland. At exactly 04:26 CET, a &quot;Kette&quot; (&quot;chain&quot; or flight of three) of Ju 87s of 3./StG 1 led by &quot;Staffelkapitän&quot; &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Bruno Dilly carried out the first bombing attack of the war. The Stukas attacked 11 minutes before the official German declaration of hostilities and hit the targets. The Ju 87s achieved complete success. The mission failed as the German Army delayed their advance allowing the Poles to carry out repairs and destroy all but one of the bridges before the Germans could reach them.

A Ju 87 achieved the first air victory during World War II on the morning of 1 September 1939, when &quot;Rottenführer&quot; &quot;Leutnant&quot; Frank Neubert of I./StG 2 &quot;Immelmann&quot; shot down a Polish PZL P.11c fighter while it was taking off from Balice airfield; its pilot, Captain Mieczysław Medwecki, was killed. In air-to-air combat, Ju 87 formations were well protected by German fighter aircraft and losses were light against the tenacious, but short lived opposition.

The Ju 87s reverted to ground attack missions for the campaign after the opening air attacks. Ju 87s were involved in the controversial but effective attacks at Wieluń. The lack of anti-aircraft artillery in the Polish Army magnified the impact of the Ju 87. At Piotrków Trybunalski I./StG 76 and I./StG 2 destroyed a Polish infantry division de-training there. Troop trains were also easy targets. StG 77 destroyed one such target at Radomsko. During the Battle of Radom six Polish divisions trapped by encircling German forces were forced to surrender after a relentless four-day bombardment by StG 51, 76 and 77. Employed in this assault were fragmentation bombs, which caused appalling casualties to the Polish ground troops. Demoralised, the Poles surrendered. The Stukas also participated in the Battle of Bzura which resulted in the breaking of Polish resistance. The dive bomber wings (&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot;) alone dropped 388 tonnes (428 tons) of bombs during this battle. During the Siege of Warsaw and the Battle of Modlin, the Ju 87 wings contributed to the defeat of well-entrenched and resolute Polish forces. IV(Stuka)./LG 1 was particularly effective in destroying the fortified Modlin.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had a few anti-shipping naval units such as 4.(St)/TrGr 186 to deal with Polish naval forces. This unit performed effectively, sinking the 1540-ton destroyer &quot;Wicher&quot; and the minelayer &quot;Gryf&quot; of the Polish Navy (both moored in a harbour). The torpedo boat &quot;Mazur&quot; (412 tons) was sunk at Oksywie; the gunboat &quot;General Haller&quot; (441 tons) was sunk in Hel Harbour on 6 September—during the Battle of Hel—along with the minesweeper &quot;Mewa&quot; (183 tons) and its sister ships &quot;Czapla&quot; and &quot;Jaskolka&quot; with several auxiliaries. The Polish naval units trapped in the Baltic were destroyed by Ju 87 operations. Once again, enemy air opposition was light, and the &quot;Stukawaffe&quot; (Stuka force) lost 31 aircraft during the campaign.

====Norway====
Operation Weserübung began on 9 April 1940 with the invasions of Norway and Denmark. Denmark capitulated within the day; Norway continued to resist with British and French help. The campaign was not a &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; of fast-moving armoured divisions supported by air power as the mountainous terrain ruled out close Panzer/Stuka cooperation. Instead, the Germans relied on paratroops transported by Junkers Ju 52s and specialised ski troops. The Ju 87s were given the role of ground attack and anti-shipping missions; they proved to be the most effective weapon in the Luftwaffe&#x27;s armoury carrying out the latter task.

On 9 April, the first Stukas took off at 10:59 from occupied airfields to destroy Oscarsborg Fortress, after the loss of the German cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot;, which disrupted the amphibious landings in Oslo through Oslofjord. The 22 Ju 87s had helped suppress the Norwegian defenders during the ensuing Battle of Drøbak Sound, but the defenders did not surrender until after Oslo had been captured. As a result, the German naval operation failed. StG 1 caught the 735 ton Norwegian destroyer &quot;Æger&quot; off Stavanger and hit her in the engine room. &quot;Æger&quot; was run aground and scuttled. The Stuka wings were now equipped with the new Ju 87 R, which differed from the Ju 87 B by having increased internal fuel capacity and two 300l underwing drop tanks for more range.

The Stukas had numerous successes against Allied naval vessels and in particular the Royal Navy which posed a formidable threat to German naval and coastal operations. The British heavy cruiser HMS &quot;Suffolk&quot; was attacked on 17 April. Her stern was virtually destroyed but she limped back to Scapa Flow with 33 dead and 38 wounded crewmen. The light cruiser squadron consisting of the sister ships &quot;Curacoa&quot; and &quot;Curlew&quot; were subjected to lengthy attacks which badly damaged the former for one Ju 87 lost. A witness later said, &quot;they threatened to take our masthead with them in every screaming nerve-racking dive&quot;. The same fate nearly befell the sloop &quot;Black Swan&quot;. On 27 April, a bomb passed through the quarterdeck, a wardroom, a water tank and 4-inch (10.2 cm) ammunition magazine and out through the hull to explode in the fjord. The muffled explosion limited the damage to her hull. &quot;Black Swan&quot; fired 1,000 rounds, but failed to shoot down any of her attackers. The sloop was sunk on 30 April. The French large destroyer &quot;Bison&quot; was sunk along with by &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 1 on 3 May 1940 during the evacuation from Namsos. &quot;Bison&quot;″s forward magazine was hit, killing 108 of the crew. &quot;Afridi&quot;, which had taken off some of &quot;Bison&quot;″s survivors, was sunk in a later attack with the loss of 63 sailors. 49 officers and men, 13 soldiers and 33 survivors from &quot;Bison&quot; were lost aboard &quot;Afridi&quot;. All ships were targeted. Armed trawlers were used under the German air umbrella in an attempt to make smaller targets. Such craft were not armoured or armed. The Ju 87s demonstrated this on 30 April when they sank the &quot;Jardine&quot; (452 tons) and &quot;Warwickshire&quot; (466 tons). On 15 May, the Polish troopship &quot;Chrobry&quot; (11,442 tons) was sunk.

The &quot;Stukas&quot; also had an operational effect, even when little damage was done. On 1 May 1940, Vice Admiral Lionel Wells commanded a Home Fleet expedition of seven destroyers, the heavy cruiser &quot;Berwick&quot;, the aircraft carriers &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, and the battleship &quot;Valiant&quot;. The carriers mounted fighter patrols over the ships evacuating troops from Andalsnes. The &quot;Stuka&quot; waves (accompanied by He 111s) achieved several near misses, but were unable to obtain a hit. Nevertheless, Wells ordered that no ship was to operate within range of the Ju 87s&#x27; Norwegian airfields. The Ju 87s had, in effect, driven British sea power from the Norwegian coast. Moreover, Victor reported to the Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Admiral Charles Forbes, that carrier operations were no longer practical under the current conditions.

In the following weeks, StG 1 continued their sea operations. Off Namsos on 5 May 1940, they caught and sank the Royal Norwegian Navy transports &quot;Aafjord&quot; (335 tons) and &quot;Blaafjeld&quot; (1,146 tons). The Ju 87s then took to bombing the town and the airstrip to support the German forces under the command of Eduard Dietl. The town fell in the first week of May. In the remaining four weeks of the campaign in Norway, the Ju 87s supported German forces in containing the Allied land forces in Narvik until they withdrew in early June.

====France and the Low Countries====
The Ju 87 units had learned lessons from the Polish and Norwegian campaigns. The failures in Poland, and of the &quot;Stukas&quot; of I./StG 1 to silence the Oscarsborg fort, ensured even more attention was paid to pin-point bombing during the Phoney War period. This was to pay off in the Western campaign.

When &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; (Case Yellow) began on 10 May 1940, the &quot;Stuka&quot; helped swiftly neutralise the fortress of Eben Emael, Belgium. The headquarters of the commander responsible for ordering the destruction of the Belgian Army-held bridges along the Albert Canal was stationed in the village of Lanaken (14 km/ mi to the north). The &quot;Stuka&quot; demonstrated its accuracy when the small building was destroyed by four direct hits. As a result, only one of the three bridges was destroyed, allowing the German Army to rapidly advance in the opening days of the Battle of Belgium. The Ju 87 proved to be a useful asset to Army Group B in the Low Countries. In pitched battles against French armoured forces at Hannut and Gembloux, Ju 87s effectively neutralised artillery and armour.

The Ju 87s also assisted German forces in the Battle of the Netherlands. The Dutch Navy in concert with the British were evacuating the Dutch royal family and Dutch gold reserves through the country&#x27;s ports. Ju 87s sank the Dutch ships &quot;Jan Van Galen&quot; (1,316 tons) and &quot;Johan Maurits Van Nassau&quot; (1,520 tons) as they provided close-shore artillery support at Waalhaven and the Afsluitdijk. The British &quot;Valentine&quot; was crippled, beached and scuttled while &quot;Winchester&quot;, &quot;Whitley&quot; and &quot;Westminster&quot; were damaged. &quot;Whitley&quot; was later beached and scuttled after an air attack on 19 May.

The Ju 87 units were also instrumental in the Battle of France. It was here that most of the Ju 87-equipped units were concentrated. They assisted in the breakthrough at Sedan, the critical and first major land battle of the war on French territory. The &quot;Stukawaffe&quot; flew 300 sorties against French positions, with StG 77 alone flying 201 individual missions. The Ju 87s benefited from heavy fighter protection from Messerschmitt Bf 109 units. When resistance was organised, the Ju 87s could be vulnerable. For example, on 12 May, near Sedan, six French Curtiss H-75s from Groupe de Chasse I/5 (Group Interception) attacked a formation of Ju 87s, claiming 11 out of 12 unescorted Ju 87s without loss (the Germans recorded six losses over Sedan entire). For the most part, Allied opposition was disorganised. During the battles of Montcornet, Arras, Bolougne, and Calais, Ju 87 operations broke up counterattacks and offered pin-point aerial artillery support for German infantry.

The Luftwaffe benefited from excellent ground-to-air communications throughout the campaign. Radio equipped forward liaison officers could call upon the Stukas and direct them to attack enemy positions along the axis of advance. In some cases the Stukas responded in 10–20 minutes. Hans Seidemann (Richthofen&#x27;s Chief of Staff) said that &quot;never again was such a smoothly functioning system for discussing and planning joint operations achieved.&quot;

During the Battle of Dunkirk, many Allied ships were lost to Ju 87 attacks while evacuating British and French troops. The French destroyer was sunk on 21 May 1940, followed by the paddle steamer &quot;Crested Eagle&quot; on 28 May. The French Channel-steamer &quot;Côte d&#x27;Arzur&quot; (3,047) followed. The Ju 87s operated to maximum effectiveness when the weather allowed. RAF fighter units were held back and Allied air cover was patchy at best. On 29 May the Royal Navy destroyer HMS &quot;Grenade&quot; was severely damaged by a Ju 87 attack within Dunkirk&#x27;s harbour, and subsequently sank. The French destroyer &quot;Mistral&quot; was crippled by bomb damage the same day. &quot;Jaguar&quot; and &quot;Verity&quot; were badly damaged while the trawlers &quot;Calvi&quot; and &quot;Polly Johnson&quot; (363 and 290 tons) disintegrated under bombardment. The merchant ship &quot;Fenella&quot; (2,376 tons) was sunk having taken on 600 soldiers. The attacks brought the evacuation to a halt for a time. The ferries &quot;Lorina&quot; and &quot;Normannia&quot; (1,564 and 1,567 tons) were sunk also. By 29 May, the Allies had lost 31 vessels sunk and 11 damaged. On 1 June the Ju 87s sank the &quot;Halcyon&quot;-class minesweeper &quot;Skipjack&quot; while the destroyer &quot;Keith&quot; was sunk and &quot;Basilisk&quot; was crippled before being scuttled by &quot;Whitehall&quot;. &quot;Whitehall&quot; was later badly damaged and along with &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, staggered back to Dover. &quot;Havant&quot;, commissioned for just three weeks, was sunk and in the evening the French destroyer &quot;Foudroyant&quot; sank after a mass-attack. Further victories against shipping were claimed before nightfall on 1 June. The steamer &quot;Pavon&quot; was lost while carrying 1,500 Dutch soldiers most of whom were killed. The oil tanker &quot;Niger&quot; was also destroyed. A flotilla of French minesweepers were also lost—&quot;Denis Papin&quot; (264 tons), the &quot;Le Moussaillon&quot; (380 tons) and &quot;Venus&quot; (264 tons).

In total, 89 merchantmen (of 126,518 grt) were lost, and of 40 RN destroyers used in the battle, eight were sunk (one to an E-boat and one to a submarine), and a further 23 damaged and out of service.
The campaign ended after the French surrender on 25 June 1940. Allied air power had been ineffective and disorganised, and as a result, &quot;Stuka&quot; losses were mainly due to ground fire. 120 machines, one-third of the Stuka force, were destroyed or damaged by all causes from 10 May to 25 June 1940.

====Battle of Britain====
For the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s order of battle included bomber wings equipped with the Ju 87. Lehrgeschwader 2&#x27;s IV.(St), Sturzkampfgeschwader 1&#x27;s III. Gruppe and Sturzkampfgeschwader 2&#x27;s III. Gruppe, Sturzkampfgeschwader 51 and Sturzkampfgeschwader 3&#x27;s I. Gruppe were committed to the battle. As an anti-shipping weapon, the Ju 87 proved a potent weapon in the early stages of the battle. On 4 July 1940, StG 2 made a successful attack on a convoy in the English Channel, sinking four freighters: &quot;Britsum&quot;, &quot;Dallas City&quot;, &quot;Deucalion&quot; and &quot;Kolga&quot;. Six more were damaged. That afternoon, 33 Ju 87s delivered the single most deadly air assault on British territory in history, when 33 Ju 87s of III./StG 51, avoiding Royal Air Force (RAF) interception, sank the 5,500 ton anti-aircraft ship in Portland Harbour, killing 176 of its 298 crew. One of &quot;Foylebank&#x27;s&quot; gunners, Leading Seaman John F. Mantle continued to fire on the Stukas as the ship sank. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for remaining at his post despite being mortally wounded. Mantle may have been responsible for the single Ju 87 lost during the raid.

During August, the Ju 87s also had some success. On 13 August the opening of the main German attacks on airfields took place; it was known to the Luftwaffe as &quot;Adlertag&quot; (&quot;Eagle Day&quot;). Bf 109s of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) were sent out in advance of the main strike and drew off RAF fighters, allowing 86 Ju 87s of StG 1 to attack RAF Detling in Kent unhindered. The attack killed the station commander, destroyed 20 RAF aircraft on the ground and a great many of the airfield&#x27;s buildings. Detling was not an RAF Fighter Command station.

The Battle of Britain proved for the first time that the Junkers Ju 87 was vulnerable in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.

Steady losses had occurred throughout their participation in the battle. On 18 August, known as the Hardest Day because both sides suffered heavy losses, the Stuka was withdrawn after 16 were destroyed and many others damaged. According to the Generalquartiermeister der Luftwaffe, 59 Stukas had been destroyed and 33 damaged to varying degrees in six weeks of operations. Over 20% of the total Stuka strength had been lost between 8 and 18 August; and the myth of the Stuka shattered. The Ju 87s did succeed in sinking six warships, 14 merchant ships, badly damaging seven airfields and three Chain Home radar stations, and destroying 49 British aircraft, mainly on the ground.

On 19 August, the units of VIII. Fliegerkorps moved up from their bases around Cherbourg-Octeville and concentrated in the Pas de Calais under Luftflotte 2, closer to the area of the proposed invasion of Britain. On 13 September, the Luftwaffe targeted airfields again, with a small number of Ju 87s crossing the coast at Selsey and heading for Tangmere. After a lull, anti-shipping operations attacks were resumed by some Ju 87 units from 1 November 1940, as part of the new winter tactic of enforcing a blockade. Over the next 10 days, seven merchant ships were sunk or damaged, mainly in the Thames Estuary, for the loss of four Ju 87s. On 14 November 19 Stukas from III./St.G 1 with escort drawn from JG 26 and JG 51 went out against another convoy; as no targets were found over the estuary, the Stukas attacked Dover, their alternative target.

Bad weather resulted in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, as part of the concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations on a small scale continued throughout the winter months into March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties made over the Channel. These attacks were resumed the following winter.

====North Africa and the Mediterranean====
After the Italian defeats in the Italo-Greek War and Operation Compass in North Africa, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ordered the deployment of German forces to these theatres. Amongst the Luftwaffe contingent deployed was the command unit StG 3, which touched down in Sicily in December 1940. In the next few days, two groups—80 Stukas—were deployed under X. Fliegerkorps.

The first task of the &quot;Korps&quot; was to attack British shipping passing between Sicily and Africa, in particular the convoys aimed at re-supplying Malta. The Ju 87s first made their presence felt by subjecting the British aircraft carrier to heavy attack. The crews were confident that they could sink it as the flight deck had an area of about . On 10 January 1941, the Stuka crews were told that four direct hits with bombs would be enough to sink the carrier. The Ju 87s delivered six and three damaging near-misses but the ship&#x27;s engines were untouched and she reached the besieged harbour of Malta.

The &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; was equipped for a while with the Stukas. In 1939, the Italian government asked the RLM to supply 100 Ju 87s. Italian pilots were sent to Graz in Austria to be trained for dive-bombing aircraft. In the spring of 1940, between 72 and 108 Ju 87 B-1s, some of them ex-Luftwaffe aircraft, were delivered to 96° &quot;Gruppo Bombardamento a Tuffo&quot;. The Italian Stuka, renamed &quot;Picchiatello&quot;, was in turn assigned to &quot;Gruppi&quot; 97°, 101° and 102°. The &quot;Picchiatelli&quot; were used against Malta, Allied convoys in Mediterranean and in North Africa (where they took part in conquering Tobruk). They were used by the Regia Aeronautica up to 1942.

Some of the &quot;Picchiatelli&quot; saw action in the opening phase of the Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940. Their numbers were low and ineffective in comparison to German operations. The Italian forces were quickly pushed back. By early 1941, the Greeks had pushed into Italian-occupied Albania. Once again, Hitler decided to send military aid to his ally. Before the Luftwaffe could intervene, the Italian Ju 87s achieved some successes. 97 &quot;Gruppo&quot; (group) and its 239 &quot;Squadriglia&quot; (squadron) sinking the Hellenic Navy freighter &quot;Susanah&quot; off Corfu on 4 April 1941 while the torpedo boat &quot;Proussa&quot; was sunk later in the day. On 21 April the Greek freighter &quot;Ioanna&quot; was sunk and they accounted for the British tanker &quot;Hekla&quot; off Tobruk on 25 May and then the Royal Australian Navy destroyer &quot;Waterhen&quot; on 20 June. The British gunboat &quot;Cricket&quot; and supply submarine &quot;Cachalot&quot; became victims. The former was crippled and later sunk by Italian warships.

In March, the pro-German Yugoslav government was toppled. A furious Hitler ordered the attack to be expanded to include Yugoslavia. Operation Marita commenced on 7 April. The Luftwaffe committed StG 1, 2 and 77 to the campaign. The Stuka once again spearheaded the air assault, with a front line strength of 300 machines, against minimal Yugoslav resistance in the air, allowing the Stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region. Operating unmolested, they took a heavy toll of ground forces, suffering only light losses to ground fire. The effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in ten days. The Stukas also took a peripheral part in Operation Punishment, Hitler&#x27;s retribution bombing of Belgrade. The dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti-aircraft gun positions as the level bombers struck civilian targets. Belgrade was badly damaged, with 2,271 people killed and 12,000 injured.

In Greece, despite British aid, little air opposition was encountered. As the Allies withdrew and resistance collapsed, the Allies began evacuating to Crete. The Stukas inflicted severe damage on Allied shipping. On 22 April, the 1,389 ton destroyers &quot;Psara&quot; and &quot;Ydra&quot; were sunk. In the next two days, the Greek naval base at Piraeus lost 23 vessels to Stuka attack.

During the Battle of Crete, the Ju 87s also played a significant role. On 21–22 May 1941, the Germans attempted to send in reinforcements to Crete by sea but lost 10 vessels to &quot;Force D&quot; under the command of Rear Admiral Irvine Glennie. The force, consisting of the cruisers , and , forced the remaining German ships to retreat. The Stukas were called upon to deal with the British naval threat. On 21 May, the destroyer was sunk and the next day the battleship was damaged and the cruiser was sunk, with the loss of 45 officers and 648 ratings. The Ju 87s also crippled the cruiser that morning, (she was later finished off by Bf 109 fighter bombers) while sinking the destroyer with one hit. As the Battle of Crete drew to a close, the Allies began yet another withdrawal. On 23 May, the Royal Navy lost the destroyers and , followed by on 26 May; &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Dido&quot; were also severely damaged. &quot;Orion&quot; had been evacuating 1,100 soldiers to North Africa; 260 of them were killed and another 280 wounded.

The dive bomber wing supported &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps in its two-year campaign in North Africa; its other main task was attacking Allied shipping. In 1941, Ju 87 operations in North Africa were dominated by the Siege of Tobruk, which lasted for over seven months. It served during the Battle of Gazala and the First Battle of El Alamein, as well as the decisive Second Battle of El Alamein, which drove Rommel back to Tunisia. As the tide turned and Allied air power grew in the autumn of 1942, the Ju 87 became very vulnerable and losses were heavy. The entry of the Americans into North Africa with the Operation Torch invasion of French North Africa made the situation far worse; the Stuka was obsolete in what was now a fighter-bomber&#x27;s war. The Bf 109 and Fw 190 could at least fight enemy fighters on equal terms after dropping their ordnance but the Stuka could not. The Ju 87&#x27;s vulnerability was demonstrated on 11 November 1942, when 15 Ju 87Ds were shot down by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Curtiss P-40Fs in minutes. According to Ring and Shores there were 15 Ju 87s on the mission, 2 Squadron SAAF shot down eight with four probable and three were shot down by 57th Fighter Group. Two South-African and one American lost shot down by German fighter escort. Three Stuka crews were captured, one was wounded.

By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air supremacy in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in &quot;Rotte&quot; strength only, often jettisoning their bombs at the first sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on takeoff, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.

The dive bombers continued operations in southern Europe; after the Italian surrender in September 1943, the Ju 87 participated in the last campaign-sized victory over the Western Allies, the Dodecanese Campaign. The Dodecanese Islands had been occupied by the British; the Luftwaffe committed 75 Stukas of StG 3 based in Megara (I./StG 3) and Argos (II.StG 3; from 17 October on Rhodes), to recover the islands. With the RAF bases away, the Ju 87 helped the German landing forces rapidly conquer the islands. On 5 October the minelayer &quot;Lagnano&quot; was sunk along with a patrol vessel, a steam ship and the auxiliary landing ship &quot;Porto Di Roma&quot;. On 24 October Ju 87s sank the landing craft LCT-115 and cargo ship &quot;Taganrog&quot; at Samos. On 31 October the light cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; was put out of action for a year. The light cruisers &quot;Penelope&quot; and &quot;Carlisle&quot; were badly damaged by StG 3 and the destroyer &quot;Panther&quot; was also sunk by Ju 87s before the capitulation of the Allied force. It proved to be the Stuka&#x27;s final victory against the British.

====Eastern front====

=====Barbarossa; 1941=====
On 22 June 1941, the Wehrmacht commenced Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. The Luftwaffe order of battle of 22 June 1941 contained four dive bomber wings. &quot;VIII. Fliegerkorps&quot; was equipped with units &quot;Stab&quot;, II. and III./StG 1. Also included were &quot;Stab&quot;, I., II. and III. of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader 2&quot; Immelmann. Attached to &quot;II. Fliegerkorps&quot;, under the command of &quot;General der Flieger&quot; Bruno Loerzer, were &quot;Stab&quot;, I., II. and III. of StG 77. &quot;Luftflotte 5&quot;, under the command of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, operating from Norway&#x27;s Arctic Circle, were allotted IV. &quot;Gruppe&quot; (St)/&quot;Lehrgeschwader 1&quot; (&quot;LG 1&quot;).

The first Stuka loss on the Soviet-German front occurred early at 03:40–03:47 in the morning of 22 June. While being escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51 to attack Brest Fortress, &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; Karl Führing of StG 77 was shot down by an I-153. The dive bomber wing suffered only two losses on the opening day of Barbarossa. As a result of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s attention, the Soviet Air Force in the western Soviet Union was nearly destroyed. The official report claimed 1,489 Soviet aircraft destroyed. Even Göring was unable to believe such a high total and ordered this checked. After picking their way through the wreckage across the front, Luftwaffe officers found that the tally exceeded 2,000. In the next two days, the Soviets reported the loss of another 1,922 aircraft.

The Ju 87 took a huge toll on Soviet ground forces, helping to break up counterattacks of Soviet armour, eliminating strongpoints and disrupting the enemy supply lines. A demonstration of the Stuka″s effectiveness occurred on 5 July, when StG 77 knocked out 18 trains and 500 vehicles. As the 1st and 2nd Panzer Groups forced bridgeheads across the Dnieper river and closed in on Kyiv, the Ju 87s again rendered invaluable support. On 13 September, Stukas from StG 1 destroyed the rail network in the vicinity as well as inflicting heavy casualties on escaping Red Army columns, for the loss of one Ju 87. On 23 September, Rudel (who was to become the most decorated serviceman in the Wehrmacht) of StG 2, helped sink the Soviet battleship &quot;Marat&quot;, during an air attack on Kronstadt harbour near Leningrad, which was struck by two bombs. During this action, &quot;Leutnant&quot; Egbert Jaeckel sank the destroyer &quot;Minsk&quot;, while the destroyer &quot;Steregushchiy&quot; and submarine &quot;M-74&quot; were also sunk. The Stukas also crippled the battleship &quot;Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Silnyy&quot; and &quot;Grozyashchiy&quot; in exchange for two Ju 87s shot down.

Elsewhere on the Eastern front, the Junkers assisted Army Group Centre in its drive toward Moscow. From 13 to 22 December 420 vehicles and 23 tanks were destroyed by StG 77, greatly improving the morale of the German infantry, who were by now on the defensive. StG 77 finished the campaign as the most effective dive bomber wing. It had destroyed 2,401 vehicles, 234 tanks, 92 artillery batteries and 21 trains for the loss of 25 Ju 87s to hostile action. At the end of Barbarossa, StG 1 had lost 60 Stukas in aerial combat and one on the ground. StG 2 lost 39 Ju 87s in the air and two on the ground, StG 77 lost 29 of their dive-bombers in the air and three on the ground (25 to enemy action). IV.(St)/LG1, operating from Norway, lost 24 Ju 87s, all in aerial combat.

=====Fall Blau to Stalingrad; 1942=====
In early 1942, the Ju 87s gave the Heer yet more valuable support. On 29 December 1941, the Soviet 44th Army landed on the Kerch Peninsula. The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (&quot;Kampfgruppen&quot;) and two dive bomber groups belonging to StG 77. With air superiority, the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were blocked by the Stukas inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping. The Ju 87&#x27;s effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. Later versions of the T-34 tank could withstand Stuka attacks in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed. During the Battle of Sevastopol, the Stukas repeatedly bombed the trapped Soviet forces. Some Ju 87 pilots flew up to 300 sorties against the Soviet defenders. StG 77 (Luftflotte 4) flew 7,708 combat sorties dropping 3,537 tonnes of bombs on the city. Their efforts help secure the capitulation of Soviet forces on 4 July.

For the German summer offensive, &quot;Fall Blau&quot;, the Luftwaffe had concentrated 1,800 aircraft into &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; making it the largest and most powerful air command in the world. The &quot;Stukawaffe&quot; strength stood at 151. During the Battle of Stalingrad, Stukas flew thousands of sorties against Soviet positions in the city. StG 1, 2 and 77 flew 320 sorties on 14 October 1942. As the German Sixth Army pushed the Soviets into a 1,000-metre enclave on the west bank of the Volga River, 1,208 Stuka sorties were flown against this small strip of land. The intense air attack, though causing horrific losses on Soviet units, failed to destroy them. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s Stuka force made a maximum effort during this phase of the war. They flew an average of 500 sorties per day and caused heavy losses among Soviet forces, losing an average of only one Stuka per day. The Battle of Stalingrad marked the high point in the fortunes of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. As the strength of the Soviet Air Forces grew, they gradually wrested control of the skies from the Luftwaffe. From this point onward, Stuka losses increased.

=====Kursk and decline; 1943=====

The Stuka was also heavily involved in Operation Citadel, the Kursk offensive. The Luftwaffe committed I, II, III./St.G 1 and III./StG 3 under the command of Luftflotte 6. I., II, III. of StGs 2 and 3 were committed under the command of &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII. Rudel&#x27;s cannon-equipped Ju 87 Gs had a devastating effect on Soviet armour at Orel and Belgorod. The Ju 87s participated in a huge aerial counter-offensive lasting from 16 to 31 July against a Soviet offensive at Khotynets and saved two German armies from encirclement, reducing the attacking Soviet 11th Guards Army to 33 tanks by 20 July. The Soviet offensive had been completely halted from the air although losses were considerable. Fliegerkorps VIII lost eight Ju 87s on 8 July, six on 9 July, six on 10 July and another eight on 11 July. The Stuka arm also lost eight of their Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross holders. StG 77 lost 24 Ju 87s in the period 5–31 July (StG had lost 23 in July–December 1942), while StG 2 lost another 30 aircraft in the same period. In September 1943, three of the Stuka units were re-equipped with the Fw 190F and G (ground attack versions) and began to be renamed &quot;Schlachtgeschwader&quot; (attack wings). In the face of overwhelming air opposition, the dive-bomber required heavy protection from German fighters to counter Soviet fighters. Some units like SG 2 &quot;Immelmann&quot; continued to operate with great success throughout 1943–45, operating the Ju 87 G variants equipped with 37 mm cannons, which became tank killers, although in increasingly small numbers.
In the wake of the defeat at Kursk, Ju 87s played a vital defensive role on the southern wing of the Eastern Front. To combat the Luftwaffe, the Soviets could deploy 3,000 fighter aircraft. As a result, the Stukas suffered heavily. SG 77 lost 30 Ju 87s in August 1943 as did SG 2 &quot;Immelmann&quot;, which also reported the loss of 30 aircraft in combat operations. Despite these losses, Ju 87s helped the XXIX Army Corps break out of an encirclement near the Sea of Azov. The Battle of Kiev also included substantial use of the Ju 87 units, although again, unsuccessful in stemming the advances. Stuka units were with the loss of air superiority, becoming vulnerable on the ground as well. Some Stuka aces were lost this way. In the aftermath of Kursk, Stuka strength fell to 184 aircraft in total. This was well below 50 per cent of the required strength. On 18 October 1943, StG 1, 2, 3, 5 and 77 were renamed &quot;Schlachtgeschwader&quot; (SG) wings, reflecting their ground-attack role, as these combat wings were now also using ground-attack aircraft, such as the Fw 190F-series aircraft. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s dive-bomber units had ceased to exist.

A few Ju 87s were also retained for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the &quot;Leningrad&quot; class destroyers &quot;Kharkov&quot;, &quot;Besposhchadny&quot; and &quot;Sposobny&quot; were caught and sunk by dive-bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass within range of German aircraft without his personal permission.

=====Operation Bagration to Berlin 1944–1945=====
Towards the end of the war, as the Allies gained air supremacy, the Stuka was being replaced by ground-attack versions of the Fw 190. By early 1944, the number of Ju 87 units and operational aircraft terminally declined. For the Soviet summer offensive, Operation Bagration, 12 Ju 87 groups and five mixed groups (including Fw 190s) were on the Luftwaffe&#x27;s order of battle on 26 June 1944. Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey, a mixed aircraft unit, which included large numbers of Stuka dive bombers, was rushed to the Finnish front in the summer of 1944 and was instrumental in halting the Soviet fourth strategic offensive. The unit claimed 200 Soviet tanks and 150 Soviet aircraft destroyed for 41 losses. By 31 January 1945, only 104 Ju 87s remained operational with their units. The other mixed &quot;Schlacht&quot; units contained a further 70 Ju 87s and Fw 190s between them. Chronic fuel shortages kept the Stukas grounded and sorties decreased until the end of the war in May 1945.

In the final months of the war the ground attack groups were still able to impose operational constraints upon the enemy. Most notably the aircraft participated in the defence of Berlin. On 12 January 1945 the 1st Belorussian Front initiated the Vistula–Oder Offensive. The offensive made rapid progress. The Soviets eventually outran their air support, which was unable to use forward, quagmire-filled, airfields. The Germans, who had fallen back on airbases with good facilities and concrete runways, were able to mount uninterrupted attacks against Soviet army columns. Reminiscent of the early years, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was able to inflict high losses largely unopposed. Over 800 vehicles were destroyed within two weeks. In the first three days of February 1945, 2,000 vehicles and 51 tanks were claimed to be lost to German air attacks. The Ju 87 participated in these intense battles in small numbers. It was the largest concentration of German air power since 1940 and even in February 1945 the Germans were able to achieve and challenge for air superiority on the Eastern Front. The air offensive was instrumental in saving Berlin, albeit only for three months. The effort exhausted German fuel reserves. The contribution of the Ju 87 was exemplified by Rudel, who claimed 13 enemy tanks on 8 February 1945.

Post-war research revealed that generally, bombing pilots were far less effective than they claimed. The German Luftwaffe, in particular, did not do a scientific analysis of the Ju 87 pilot claims in 1939–1945 but instead relied on pre-war tests and assumptions, contrary to the Allies who did such research during the war, which showed that pilots, for a number of reasons, misjudged most of their tank kills and revealed the ineffectiveness of dive-bombers as an anti-tank weapon, except for the suppression effect of the bombing.

==Surviving aircraft==
Two intact Ju 87s survive, with a third being restored:

;Ju 87 G-2, Werk Nr. &quot;494083&quot;
 A later, ground-attack variant, this is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum in London; it was captured by British forces at Eggebek, Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. It is thought to have been built in 1943–1944 as a D-5 before being rebuilt as a G-2 variant, possibly by fitting G-2 outer wings to a D-5 airframe. The wings have the hard-points for &quot;Bordkanone BK 3,7&quot; gun-pods, but these are not fitted. It was one of 12 captured German aircraft selected by the British for museum preservation and assigned to the Air Historical Branch. The aircraft was stored and displayed at various RAF sites until 1978, when it was moved to the RAF Museum. In 1967, permission was given to use the aircraft in the film &quot;Battle of Britain&quot; and it was repainted and modified to resemble a 1940 variant of the Ju 87. The engine was found to be in excellent condition and there was little difficulty in starting it, but returning the aircraft to airworthiness was considered too costly for the filmmakers and, ultimately, models were used in the film to represent Stukas. In 1998, the film modifications were removed, and the aircraft returned to the original G-2 configuration.

;Ju 87 R-2/Trop. Werk Nr. &quot;5954&quot;
This aircraft is displayed in the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. It was abandoned in North Africa and found by British forces in 1941. The Ju 87 was donated by the British government and sent to the US during the war. It was fully restored in 1974 by the EAA of Wisconsin.

One Ju 87 is under restoration:

;Ju 87 R-4, Werk Nr. &quot;6234&quot; (incorporating &quot;857509&quot;)
One aircraft is being restored to airworthy condition from two wrecks, owned by Paul Allen&#x27;s Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum. The project takes its identification from Ju 87 R-4 Werk Nr. &quot;6234&quot;, which was built in 1941 and served with Stukageschwader 5. Shot down in April 1942 on a mission to bomb Murmansk, it was recovered in 1992. The wreck was purchased by New Zealand collector Tim Wallis, who originally planned for a rebuild to airworthy status, and later went to the Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin. Parts from a second airframe, a Ju 87 R-2 &quot;Werknummer&quot; 857509 which served bearing the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; of code LI+KU from 1./St.G.5, and was recovered to the United Kingdom in 1998, have also been incorporated. The project was displayed in November 2018 and the restoration was stated to take between 18 months and two years to complete. Work will be conducted in a display hangar to allow the public to observe the work underway.

Other aircraft survive as wreckage at or recovered from crash sites:
* A ‘Stuka’ wreck was discovered in 2014 near the island of Žirje in Croatia. It belonged to JU 87R-2 group from 239 squad of the Italian Royal Air Force. On April 12, 1941, during the Balkans Campaign in World War II, it was attacking the Kingdom of Yugoslavia&#x27;s torpedo boats together with two more Stukas when it was shot down. Today the wreck is a visiting site for many scuba divers, lying at a depth of 28 meters.
* The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Berlin has the wreckage of two complete aircraft that were recovered from separate crash sites near Murmansk in 1990 and 1994. These wrecks were purchased from New Zealand collector Tim Wallis, who originally planned for the remains to be restored to airworthy, in 1996.
* The Sinsheim Auto &amp; Technik Museum displays the remains of an aircraft that crashed near Saint-Tropez in 1944 and was raised from the seabed in 1989.
* In October 2006, a Ju 87 D-3/Trop. was recovered underwater, near Rhodes. The aircraft is now in the Hellenic Air Force Museum
* Junkers Ju 87 B-2, Code 98+01, Werk Nr. 870406, is on display at the Yugoslav Aeronautical Museum, Belgrade. The parts of three others have been found (S2+?? [StG 77]; H4+?? &quot;[Luftlandegeschwader 1]&quot;; 5B+?? &quot;[Nachtschlachtgruppe 10]&quot;)
* Junkers Ju 87 B-3 Werk Nr. &quot;110757&quot; found in the village Krościenko Wyżne in Poland in October 2015.
=== Replicas ===
Replicas at 7/10 scale were built by Louis Langhurst and Richard H. Kurzenberger. Langhurst&#x27;s aircraft ended up with the Commemorative Air Force. Kurzenburger&#x27;s was written off in a crash that killed the pilot in 2000.

==Specifications (Ju 87D-1)==

== In popular culture ==
According to Richard King, the sound of the &quot;Lärmgerät&quot; (often incorrectly referred to as &quot;Jericho trumpets&quot;) &quot;is often used in movies and TV shows as the classic dive bomber sound, plane crashing sound, or for an anvil dropping on Wile E. Coyote’s head&quot;.

<text>The Book of Jarom () is the fifth book in the Book of Mormon. According to the text it was written by Jarom, who was the son of Enos and a descendant of Jacob, the brother of the prophet Nephi.

The Book of Jarom is very short, consisting of only fifteen verses. According to the Book of Mormon, Jarom was the son of Enos, the grandson of Jacob, and the great-grandson of Lehi. He kept the commandment of his father to preserve the plates, and in turn he commanded his son Omni to do the same. In the meantime, he inscribed these few verses on them. In his account, Jarom described the Lamanites and explained that the Nephites had many wars against them. He also narrated that the Nephites didn&#x27;t listen to God but still kept the Mosaic Law.

== Structure ==
In the Book of Mormon, the Book of Jarom succeeds the Book of Enos and precedes the Book of Omni; of the three, it is the shortest book.
== Narrative ==
Jarom narrates the Book of Jarom and begins his record explaining that he will not write his prophesies and revelations because he feels that similar things have been written by his forefathers. Besides which, Jarom explains, there is not enough room left on the plates to write very much. But Jarom recommends that his readers go to the large plates if they want more information; University of Vermont associate professor of English Elizabeth Fenton points out that the only available version of the large plates is Mormon&#x27;s abridgement. Jarom further states that the small plates are written for the Lamanites, though he expresses little hope for them in their present condition. The Lamanites, Jarom explains, murder and drink animal blood.

Jarom says that the laws of the land are strict and that many of the Nephites are unwilling to listen to God&#x27;s words. Meanwhile, God is merciful and protects them in their wars against the Lamanites. During these wars, their leaders are faithful to God and strengthen the cities against attacks. Despite their lack of spiritual interest, the Nephites grow in population and keep the law of Moses. After possessing the plates for 59 years, Jarom passes them to his son Omni.

== Interpretation ==

=== Literary ===
The Book of Jarom is the shortest book in the Book of Mormon text, excepting the explanatory Words of Mormon. Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Hemming, co-authors of the three-volume series &quot;The Book of Mormon for the Least of These&quot;, suggest that Jarom&#x27;s choice of audience (the Lamanites) is based on his father Enos&#x27;s covenant with God, in which the Lamanites would return to God. This impacts Jarom&#x27;s practice of record keeping, Salleh and Hemming argue.

Due to the absence of events while maintaining a &quot;narrative voice,&quot; Jarom&#x27;s account has been called an &quot;unnarration&quot; by Elizabeth Fenton, who adopted the term from Robyn Warhol. Brigham Young University professor Donald W. Parry contends that the book follows an “AabcdBABBACDEEDCBAdbca” chiasmus pattern that repeats ideas of faith, destruction, and obedience to commandments, among other things. 
=== Theological ===
Professor of scripture, Nicholas Frederick, believes that according to Jarom, the Nephites keep the Law of Moses as a way to look forward to the then-future advent of Jesus.

<text>Keanu Charles Reeves ( ; born September 2, 1964) is a Canadian actor and musician. He is the recipient of numerous accolades in a career on screen spanning four decades. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked him as the fourth-greatest actor of the 21st century, and in 2022 &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Reeves is known for his leading roles in action films, his amiable public image, and his philanthropic efforts.

Born in Beirut, Lebanon, and raised in Toronto, Canada, he made his acting debut in the Canadian television series &quot;Hangin&#x27; In&quot; (1984), before making his feature-film debut in &quot;Youngblood&quot; (1986). Reeves had his breakthrough role in the science-fiction comedies &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989) and &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; (1991). He gained praise for playing a hustler in the independent drama &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991) and established himself as an action hero with leading roles in &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991) and &quot;Speed&quot; (1994). Following several box-office disappointments, Reeves&#x27;s performance in the horror film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1997) was well received. Greater stardom came with his role as Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999); Reeves became the highest paid actor for a single production for reprising the role in its 2003 sequels &quot;Reloaded&quot; and &quot;Revolutions&quot;. He also played John Constantine in &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005). 

Reeves made his film directorial debut with &quot;Man of Tai Chi&quot; (2013). Following a period in which he enjoyed limited commercial success, he made a career comeback by playing the titular assassin in the action film series &quot;John Wick&quot; (2014–present). He voiced Duke Caboom in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019) and portrayed Johnny Silverhand in the video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; (2020) as well as its expansion. He has since reprised his roles of Ted in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot; (2020) and Neo in &quot;The Matrix: Resurrections&quot; (2021), and voiced Shadow the Hedgehog in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (2024).

In addition to acting, Reeves is a member of the musical band Dogstar, releasing albums including &quot;Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees&quot; (2023). He is the co-writer and creator of the &quot;BRZRKR&quot; franchise, which started with the original comic book (2021–2023) and since expanded to include numerous spin-offs, including &quot;The Book of Elsewhere&quot;. An avid motorcyclist, Reeves is the co-founder of the custom manufacturer ARCH Motorcycle. He also co-founded the production company Company Films.

==Early life==
Reeves was born in Beirut, Lebanon, on September 2, 1964, the son of Patricia (née Taylor), a costume designer and performer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves Jr. His mother is English, originating from Essex. His American father is from Hawaii, and is of Native Hawaiian, Chinese, English, and Portuguese descent. Reeves&#x27;s paternal grandmother is of Hawaiian and Chinese descent. His mother was working in Beirut when she met his father, who abandoned his wife and family when Reeves was three years old. Reeves last met his father on the Hawaiian island of Kauai when he was 13.

After his parents divorced in 1966, his mother moved the family to Sydney, and then to New York City, where she married Paul Aaron, a Broadway and Hollywood director, in 1970. The couple moved to Toronto and divorced in 1971. When Reeves was nine, he took part in a theatre production of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;. Aaron remained close to Reeves, offering him advice and recommending him a job at the Hedgerow Theatre in Pennsylvania. Reeves&#x27;s mother married Robert Miller, a rock music promoter, in 1976; the couple divorced in 1980. Reeves and his sisters grew up primarily in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto, with a nanny frequently caring for them. Reeves watched British comedy shows such as &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, and his mother imparted English manners that he has maintained into adulthood. Because of his grandmother&#x27;s Chinese ethnicity, Reeves grew up with Chinese art, furniture, and cuisine.

Describing himself as a &quot;private kid&quot;, Reeves attended four different high schools, including the Etobicoke School of the Arts, from which he was expelled. Reeves said he was expelled because he was &quot;just a little too rambunctious and shot my mouth off once too often ... I was not generally the most well-oiled machine in the school&quot;. Reeves has dyslexia and has said, &quot;Because I had trouble reading, I wasn&#x27;t a good student&quot;. At De La Salle College, he was a successful ice hockey goalkeeper. Reeves had aspirations to play for the Canadian Olympic team and was once considered an OHL prospect, but his hockey career ended due to injury. At the age of 15, he decided he wanted to become an actor. After leaving De La Salle College, he attended Avondale Secondary Alternative School, which allowed him to get an education while working as an actor. Reeves dropped out of high school when he was 17. He obtained a green card through his American stepfather and moved to Los Angeles three years later. Reeves holds only Canadian citizenship.

==Career==
===1984–1990: Early work===

In 1984, Reeves was a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) youth television program &quot;Going Great&quot;. That same year, he made his acting debut in an episode of the television series, called &quot;Hangin&#x27; In&quot;. In 1985, he played Mercutio in a stage production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Leah Posluns Theatre in North York, Ontario. He made further appearances on stage, including Brad Fraser&#x27;s cult hit &quot;Wolfboy&quot; in Toronto. He also appeared in a Coca-Cola commercial in 1983, and in the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) coming-of-age, short film &quot;One Step Away&quot;.

Reeves later said that, when he was looking for work in the mid-1980s, his agents advised him to go by a different name because his first name was &quot;too ethnic&quot;. He briefly initialized his first and middle name and attended auditions as &quot;K. C.&quot; or &quot;Casey&quot; Reeves before reverting to Keanu.

Reeves made a foray into television films in 1986, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;Babes in Toyland, Act of Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Brotherhood of Justice&quot;. He made his first motion picture appearances in Peter Markle&#x27;s &quot;Youngblood&quot; (1986), in which he played a goalkeeper, and in the low-budget romantic drama, &quot;Flying&quot;. He was cast as Matt in &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot;, a crime drama about a group of high school friends dealing with a murder case, loosely based on the 1981 murder of Marcy Renee Conrad. The film premiered in 1986 at the Toronto International Film Festival to a largely positive response. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes the performances of the young cast as &quot;natural and credible&quot;, with Reeves being described as &quot;affecting and sympathetic&quot;.

Towards the end of the 1980s, Reeves starred in several dramas aimed at teen audiences, including as the lead in &quot;The Night Before&quot; (1988), a comedy starring opposite Lori Loughlin, &quot;The Prince of Pennsylvania&quot; (1988) and &quot;Permanent Record&quot; (1988). Although the latter received mixed reviews, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine praised Reeves&#x27;s performance, &quot;which opens up nicely as the drama progresses&quot;. His other acting efforts included a supporting role in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), which earned seven nominations at the 61st Academy Awards, winning three: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design. This was followed by &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989), in which he portrays a slacker who travels through time with a friend (portrayed by Alex Winter), to assemble historical figures for a school presentation. The film was generally well received by critics and grossed $40.5 million at the worldwide box office. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 79% approval rating with the critical consensus: &quot;Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just charming, goofy, and silly enough to make this fluffy time-travel Adventure work&quot;.

In 1989, Reeves starred in the comedy-drama &quot;Parenthood&quot; directed by Ron Howard. Nick Hilditch of the BBC gave the film three out of five stars, calling it a &quot;feelgood movie&quot; with an &quot;extensive and entertaining ensemble cast&quot;. In 1990, Reeves gave two acting performances; he portrayed an incompetent hitman in the black comedy &quot;I Love You to Death&quot;, and played Martin, a radio station employee in the comedy &quot;Tune in Tomorrow&quot;. He also appeared in Paula Abdul&#x27;s music video for &quot;Rush Rush&quot; which featured a &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; motif, with him in the James Dean role.

===1991–1994: Breakthrough with mature roles===

In 1991, Reeves starred in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, with his co-star Alex Winter. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the sequel was &quot;more imaginative, more opulent, wilder and freer, more excitingly visualized&quot;, praising the actors for their &quot;fuller&quot; performances. Film critic Roger Ebert thought it was &quot;a riot of visual invention and weird humour that works on its chosen sub-moronic level [...] It&#x27;s the kind of movie where you start out snickering in spite of yourself, and end up actually admiring the originality that went into creating this hallucinatory slapstick&quot;. The rest of 1991 marked a significant transition for Reeves&#x27;s career as he undertook adult roles. Co-starring with River Phoenix as a street hustler in the adventure &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, the characters embark on a journey of personal discovery. The story was written by Gus Van Sant, and is loosely based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;. The film premiered at the 48th Venice International Film Festival, followed by a theatrical release in the United States on September 29, 1991. The film earned $6.4 million at the box office. &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; was positively received, with Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; describing the film as &quot;a postmodern road movie with a mood of free-floating, trance-like despair[...] a rich, audacious experience&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; complimented Reeves and Phoenix for their insightful performances.

Reeves starred alongside Patrick Swayze, Lori Petty and Gary Busey in the action thriller &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), directed by Kathryn Bigelow. He plays an undercover FBI agent tasked with investigating the identities of a group of bank robbers. To prepare for the film, Reeves and his co-stars took surfing lessons with professional surfer Dennis Jarvis in Hawaii; Reeves had never surfed before. Upon its release, &quot;Point Break&quot; was generally well-received, and a commercial success, earning $83.5 million at the box office. Reeves&#x27;s performance was praised by &quot;The New York Times&quot; for &quot;considerable discipline and range&quot;, adding, &quot;He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanour that suits a police procedural story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Hal Hinson called Reeves the &quot;perfect choice&quot; and praised the surfing scenes, but opined that &quot;the filmmakers have their characters make the most ludicrously illogical choices imaginable&quot;. At the 1992 MTV Movie Awards, Reeves won the Most Desirable Male award.

In 1991, Reeves developed an interest in a music career; he formed an alternative rock band called Dogstar, consisting of members Robert Mailhouse, Gregg Miller and Bret Domrose. Reeves played the bass guitar. A year later, he played Jonathan Harker in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s Gothic horror &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, based on Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. Starring alongside Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, the film was critically and commercially successful. It grossed $215.8 million worldwide. For his role, Reeves was required to speak with an English accent, which drew some ridicule; &quot;Overly posh and entirely ridiculous, Reeves&#x27;s performance is as painful as it is hilarious&quot;, wrote Limara Salt of Virgin Media. In a retrospective interview in 2015, director Coppola said, &quot;[Reeves] tried so hard [...] He wanted to do it perfectly and in trying to do it perfectly it came off as stilted&quot;. &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning three in Best Costume Design, Best Sound Editing and Best Makeup. The film also received four nominations at the British Academy Film Awards.

In 1993, he had a role in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s play of the same name. The film received positive reviews, although Reeves was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor. &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine thought his casting was &quot;unfortunate&quot; because of his amateur performance. In that same year, he starred in two more drama films, &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; and &quot;Little Buddha&quot;, both of which garnered a mixed-to-negative reception. &quot;The Independent&quot; critic gave &quot;Little Buddha&quot; a mixed review but opined that Reeves&#x27;s part as a prince was &quot;credible&quot;. The film also left an impression on Reeves; he later said, &quot;When I played this innocent prince who starts to suspect something when he has the first revelations about old age, sickness and death, it hit me. [...] That lesson has never left me.&quot;

He starred in the action thriller &quot;Speed&quot; (1994) alongside Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper. He plays police officer Jack Traven, who must prevent a bus from exploding by keeping its speed above 50 mph. &quot;Speed&quot; was the directorial debut of Dutch director Jan de Bont. Several actors were considered for the lead role, but Reeves was chosen because Bont was impressed with his &quot;Point Break&quot; performance. To look the part, Reeves shaved all his hair off and spent two months in the gym to gain muscle mass. During production, Reeves&#x27;s friend River Phoenix (and co-star in &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;) died, resulting in adjustments to the filming schedule to allow him to mourn. &quot;Speed&quot; was released on June 10 to a critically acclaimed response. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; lauded Reeves, calling him &quot;absolutely charismatic [...] giving a performance juiced with joy as he jumps through elevator shafts [...] and atop a subway train&quot;. David Ansen, writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, summarized &quot;Speed&quot; as, &quot;Relentless without being overbearing, this is one likely blockbuster that doesn&#x27;t feel too big for its britches. It&#x27;s a friendly juggernaut&quot;. The film grossed $350 million from a $30 million budget and won two Academy Awards in 1995Best Sound Editing and Best Sound.

===1995–1998: Career fluctuations===

Reeves&#x27;s next leading role came in the 1995 cyberpunk action thriller &quot;Johnny Mnemonic,&quot; directed by artist Robert Longo and based on the 1981 story of the same name by William Gibson. Set in 2021, it is about a man who has a cybernetic brain implant and must deliver a data package before he dies or is killed by the yakuza. The film received mainly negative reviews and critics felt Reeves was &quot;woefully miscast&quot;. Roger Ebert opined that the film is one of the &quot;great goofy gestures of recent cinema, a movie that doesn&#x27;t deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis but has a kind of idiotic grandeur that makes you almost forgive it.&quot; As part of the film studio&#x27;s marketing efforts, a CD-ROM video game was also released.

He next appeared in the romantic drama &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; (1995), which also garnered mixed-to-negative reviews. Reeves plays a young soldier returning home from World War II, trying to settle down with a woman he married impulsively just before he enlisted. Film critic Mick LaSalle opined that &quot;&quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; is for the most part a beautiful, well-acted and emotionally rich picture&quot;, whereas Hal Hinson from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;The film has the syrupy, Kodak magic-moment look of a Bo Derek movie, and pretty much the same level of substance&quot;.

Besides film work, Reeves retreated briefly to the theatre playing Prince Hamlet in a 1995 Manitoba Theatre Centre production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in Winnipeg, Manitoba. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; critic Roger Lewis believed his performance, writing he &quot;quite embodied the innocence, the splendid fury, the animal grace of the leaps and bounds, the emotional violence, that form the Prince of Denmark ... He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen, for a simple reason: he &quot;is&quot; Hamlet&quot;.

Reeves was soon drawn to science fiction roles, appearing in &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; (1996) with co-stars Morgan Freeman, Rachel Weisz, Fred Ward, Kevin Dunn and Brian Cox. He plays a researcher of a green energy project, who has to go on the run when he is framed for murder. &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; was not a critical success and gained mostly a negative reaction; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 16% and described it as &quot;a man-on-the-run thriller that mostly sticks to generic formula&quot;. Reeves&#x27;s film choices after &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; were also critical disappointments. He starred in the independent crime comedy &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; (1996), with Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio and Cameron Diaz, which was described as &quot;shoddily assembled, and fundamentally miscast&quot; by Rotten Tomatoes. In that year, he turned down an offer to star in &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, despite being offered a salary of $12 million. According to Reeves, this decision caused 20th Century Fox to sever ties with him for a decade.

Instead, Reeves toured with his band Dogstar, and appeared in the drama &quot;The Last Time I Committed Suicide&quot; (1997), based on a 1950 letter written by Neal Cassady to Jack Kerouac. Reeves&#x27;s performance gained mixed reviews; Paul Tatara of CNN called him &quot;void of talent [...] here he is again, reciting his lines as if they&#x27;re non-related words strung together as a memory exercise&quot;, whereas &quot;Empire&quot; magazine thought &quot;Reeves gives the nearest thing to a performance in his career as the enthusiastic feckless drunk&quot;. He starred in the 1997 supernatural horror &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; alongside Al Pacino and Charlize Theron; Reeves agreed to a pay cut of several million dollars so that the film studio could afford to hire Pacino. Based on Andrew Neiderman&#x27;s novel of the same name, the feature is about a successful young lawyer invited to New York City to work for a major firm, who discovers the owner of the firm is a devil. &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; attracted positive reviews from critics. Film critic James Berardinelli called the film &quot;highly enjoyable&quot; and wrote, &quot;There are times when Reeves lacks the subtlety that would have made this a more multi-layered portrayal, but it&#x27;s nevertheless a solid job&quot;.

===1999–2004: Resurgence with &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise and comedies===
In 1999, Reeves starred in the critically acclaimed science fiction film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, the first installment in what would become &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise. Reeves portrays computer programmer Thomas Anderson, a hacker using the alias &quot;Neo&quot;, who discovers humanity is trapped inside a simulated reality created by intelligent machines. To prepare for the film, which was written and directed by the Wachowskis, Reeves had read Kevin Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World&quot;, and Dylan Evans&#x27;s ideas on evolutionary psychology. The principal cast underwent months of intense training with martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping to prepare for the fight scenes. &quot;The Matrix&quot; proved to be a box office success; several critics considered it to be one of the best science fiction films of all time. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt it was a &quot;wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination&quot;, despite perceiving weaknesses in the film&#x27;s dialogue. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited Reeves for being a &quot;strikingly chic Prada model of an action hero&quot;, and thought the martial arts stunts were the film&#x27;s strongest feature. &quot;The Matrix&quot; received Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound.

After the success of &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Reeves avoided another blockbuster in favour of a lighthearted sports comedy, &quot;The Replacements&quot; (2000). He agreed to a pay cut to enable Gene Hackman to co-star in the film. Against his wishes, Reeves starred in the thriller &quot;The Watcher&quot; (2000), playing a serial killer who stalks a retired FBI agent. He said that a friend forged his signature on a contract, which he could not prove; he appeared in the film to avoid legal action. Upon its release, the film was critically panned. That year, he had a supporting role in another thriller, Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;The Gift&quot;, a story about a woman (played by Cate Blanchett) with extrasensory perception asked to help find a young woman who disappeared. The film grossed $44 million worldwide. Film critic Paul Clinton of CNN thought the film was fairly compelling, saying of Reeves&#x27;s acting: &quot;[Raimi] managed to get a performance out of Reeves that only occasionally sounds like he&#x27;s reading his lines from the back of a cereal box.&quot;

In 2001, Reeves continued to explore and accept roles in a diverse range of genres. The first was a romantic drama, &quot;Sweet November&quot;, a remake of the 1968 film of the same name. This was his second collaboration with Charlize Theron; the film was met with a generally negative reception. Desson Thompson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized it for its &quot;syrupy cliches, greeting-card wisdom and over-the-top tragicomedy&quot;, but commended Reeves for his likability factor in every performance he gives. &quot;Hardball&quot; (2001) marked Reeves&#x27;s attempt in another sports comedy. Directed by Brian Robbins, it is based on the book &quot;Hardball: A Season in the Projects&quot; by Daniel Coyle. Reeves plays Conor O&#x27;Neill, a troubled young man who agrees to coach a Little League team from the Cabrini Green housing project in Chicago as a condition of obtaining a loan. Film critic Roger Ebert noted the film&#x27;s desire to tackle difficult subjects and baseball coaching, but felt it lacked depth, and Reeves&#x27;s performance was &quot;glum and distant&quot;.

By 2002, his professional music career had come to an end when Dogstar disbanded. The band had released two albums during their decade together; &quot;Our Little Visionary&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Happy Ending&quot; in 2000. Sometime afterwards, Reeves performed in the band Becky for a year, founded by Dogstar band-mate Rob Mailhouse, but quit in 2005, citing a lack of interest in a serious music career. After being absent from the screen in 2002, Reeves returned to &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels in 2003 with &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, released in May and November, respectively. Principal photography for both films was completed back-to-back, primarily at Fox Studios in Australia. &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; garnered mostly favourable reviews; John Powers of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; praised the &quot;dazzling pyrotechnics&quot; but was critical of certain machine-like action scenes. Of Reeves&#x27;s acting, Powers thought it was somewhat &quot;wooden&quot; but felt he has the ability to &quot;exude a charmed aura&quot;. Andrew Walker, writing for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, praised the cinematography (&quot;visually it gives full value as a virtuoso workout for your senses&quot;) but he was less taken by the film&#x27;s &quot;dime-store philosophy&quot;. The film grossed $739 million worldwide.

&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, the third installment, was met with mixed reception. According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the consensus was that &quot;characters and ideas take a back seat to the special effects&quot;. Paul Clinton, writing for CNN, praised the special effects but felt Reeves&#x27;s character was unfocused. In contrast, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s Carla Meyer was highly critical of the special effects, writing, &quot;[The Wachowskis] computer-generated imagery goes from dazzling to deadening in action scenes that favor heavy, clanking weaponry over the martial-arts moves that thrilled viewers of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;.&quot; Nevertheless, the film grossed a healthy $427 million worldwide, although less than the two previous films. &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, a romantic comedy, was Reeves&#x27;s last release of 2003. He co-starred with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, and played Dr. Julian Mercer in the film. &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; received generally favourable reviews.

===2005–2013: Thrillers, documentaries and directorial debut===
In 2005, Reeves played the title role in &quot;Constantine&quot;, an occult detective film, about a man who has the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons. The film was a respectable box office hit, grossing $230 million worldwide from a $100 million budget but attracted mixed-to-positive reviews. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;″s critic wrote that &quot;&quot;Constantine&quot; isn&#x27;t bad, but it doesn&#x27;t deserve any imposing adjectives. It&#x27;s occasionally cheesy, sometimes enjoyable, intermittently scary, and constantly spiked with celestial blatherskite&quot;. He next appeared in &quot;Thumbsucker&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. A comedy adapted from the 1999 Walter Kirn novel of the same name, the story follows a boy with a thumb-sucking problem. Reeves and the cast garnered positive critical reviews, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describing it as &quot;a gently stirring symphony about emotional transition filled with lovely musical passages and softly nuanced performances&quot;.

Reeves appeared in the Richard Linklater-directed animated science fiction thriller &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot;, which premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Reeves played Bob Arctor/Fred, an undercover agent in a futuristic dystopia under high-tech police surveillance. Based on the novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick, the film was a box office failure. However, the film attracted generally favourable reviews; Paul Arendt of the BBC thought the film was &quot;beautiful to watch&quot;, but Reeves was outshone by his co-star Robert Downey Jr. His next role was Alex Wyler in &quot;The Lake House&quot; (2006), a romantic drama adaptation of the South Korean film &quot;Il Mare&quot; (2000), which reunited him with Sandra Bullock. Despite its box office success, Mark Kermode of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was highly critical, writing &quot;this syrup-drenched supernatural whimsy achieves stupidity at a genuinely international level [...] The last time Bullock and Reeves were together on screen the result was &quot;Speed&quot;. This should have been entitled Stop&quot;. Towards the end of 2006, he co-narrated &quot;The Great Warming&quot; with Alanis Morissette, a documentary about climate change mitigation.

Next in 2008, Reeves collaborated with director David Ayer on the crime thriller &quot;Street Kings&quot;. He played an undercover policeman who must clear his name after the death of another officer. Released on April 11, the film grossed a moderate $66 million worldwide. The film&#x27;s plot and Reeves&#x27; performance, however, were met with mostly unenthusiastic reviews. Paul Byrnes of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s full of twists and turns, a dead body in every reel, but it&#x27;s not difficult to work out who&#x27;s betraying whom, and that&#x27;s just not good enough&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined that &quot;Reeves is fundamentally blank and uninteresting&quot;. Reeves starred in another science fiction film, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, a loose adaptation of the 1951 film of the same name. He portrayed Klaatu, an alien sent from outer space to try to change human behaviour or eradicate humans because of their environmental impact. At the 2009 Razzie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. Many critics were unimpressed with the heavy use of special effects; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; credited Reeves&#x27; ability to engage the audience, but thought the cinematography was abysmal and the &quot;sub-Al-Gore environment lecture leaves you light-headed with tedium&quot;.

Rebecca Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Private Lives of Pippa Lee&quot; was Reeves&#x27; sole release of 2009, which premiered at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival. The romantic comedy and its ensemble received an amicable review from &quot;The Telegraph&quot;″s David Gritten; &quot;Miller&#x27;s film is a triumph. Uniformly well acted, it boasts a psychologically knowing script, clearly written by a smart, assertive human&quot;. In 2010, he starred in another romantic comedy, &quot;Henry&#x27;s Crime&quot;, about a man who is released from prison for a crime he did not commit, but then targets the same bank with his former cellmate. The film was not a box office hit. Reeves&#x27; only work in 2011 was an adult picture book titled &quot;Ode to Happiness&quot;, which he wrote, complemented by Alexandra Grant&#x27;s illustrations. Reeves co-produced and appeared in a 2012 documentary, &quot;Side by Side&quot;. He interviewed filmmakers including James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Nolan; the feature investigated digital and photochemical film creation. Next, Reeves starred in &quot;Generation Um...&quot; (2012), an independent drama which was critically panned.

In 2013, Reeves starred in his own directorial debut, the martial arts film &quot;Man of Tai Chi&quot;. The film has multilingual dialogue and follows a young man drawn to an underground fight club, partially inspired by the life of Reeves&#x27; friend Tiger Chen. Principal photography took place in China and in Hong Kong. Reeves was also assisted by Yuen Woo-ping, the fight choreographer of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Matrix&quot; films. &quot;Man of Tai Chi&quot; premiered at the Beijing Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival, and received praise from director John Woo. A wider, warm response followed suit; Bilge Ebiri of &quot;Vulture&quot; thought the fight sequences were &quot;beautifully assembled&quot;, and Reeves showed restraint with the film editing to present the fighters&#x27; motion sequences. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The brutally efficient shooting style Reeves employs to film master choreographer Yuen Woo-ping&#x27;s breathtaking fights [...] is refreshingly grounded and old-school kinetic&quot;, while Dave McGinn of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called the film &quot;ambitious but generic&quot;. At the box office, &quot;Man of Tai Chi&quot; was a commercial disappointment, grossing only $5.5 million worldwide from a budget of $25 million. Also in 2013, Reeves played Kai in the 3D fantasy &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, a Japanese fable about a group of rogue samurai. The film premiered in Japan but failed to gain traction with audiences; reviews were not positive, causing Universal Pictures to reduce advertising for the film elsewhere. &quot;47 Ronin&quot; was a box office flop and was mostly poorly received.

===2014–2022: Resurgence with &quot;John Wick&quot;===

After this series of commercial failures, Reeves&#x27; career rebounded in 2014. He played the title role in the action thriller &quot;John Wick&quot;, directed by Chad Stahelski. In the first installment of the &quot;John Wick&quot; franchise, Reeves plays a retired hitman seeking vengeance. He worked closely with the screenwriter to develop the story; &quot;We all agreed on the potential of the project. I love the role, but you want the whole story, the whole ensemble to come to life&quot;, Reeves said. Filmed on location in the New York City area, the film was eventually released on October 24 in the United States. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; was impressed by the director&#x27;s &quot;confident, muscular action debut&quot;, and Reeves&#x27; &quot;effortless&quot; performance, which marked his return to the action genre. Jeannette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Reeves&#x27; fight scenes and wrote he is &quot;always more comfortable in roles that demand cool over hot, attitude over emotion&quot;. &quot;John Wick&quot; proved to be a box office success, grossing $86 million worldwide. Next, Reeves starred in a smaller-scale horror feature, &quot;Knock Knock&quot; (2015), a remake of &quot;Death Game&quot; (1977, filmed 1974). Described as &quot;over-the-top destruction&quot; by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Reeves plays a father, home alone, when two young women show up and start a game of cat and mouse. His other releases in 2015 were the documentaries &quot;Deep Web&quot;, about crime on the dark web, and &quot;&quot;, about the life of a Japanese actor (Toshiro Mifune) famous for playing samurai characters. He narrated both films.

Reeves appeared in five film releases in 2016. The first was &quot;Exposed&quot;, a crime thriller about a detective who investigates his partner&#x27;s death and discovers police corruption along the way. The film received negative reviews for its confused plot, and Reeves was criticized for displaying limited facial expressions. His next release, the comedy &quot;Keanu&quot;, was better received. In it he voiced the eponymous kitten. Reeves then had a minor role in &quot;The Neon Demon&quot;, a psychological horror directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. He played Hank, a lustful motel owner who appears in Jesse&#x27;s (played by Elle Fanning) nightmare. In his fourth release, he played a charismatic leader of a settlement in &quot;The Bad Batch&quot;. His final release of the year was &quot;The Whole Truth&quot;, featuring Gabriel Basso, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Renée Zellweger, and Jim Belushi. He played Richard, a defence attorney. Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described it as &quot;moderately clever, reasonably entertaining courtroom drama&quot;, with a skilled cast but overall a &quot;mundane&quot; film. Reeves also appeared in &quot;Swedish Dicks&quot;, a two-season web television series.

In 2017, Reeves agreed to reprise his role for a sequel in the &quot;John Wick&quot; franchise, &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot;. The story carries on from the first film and follows &quot;John Wick&quot; as he goes on the run when a bounty is placed on him. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $171.5 million worldwide, more than its predecessor. Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine praised Reeves&#x27; performance, which complemented his previous action roles (&quot;Point Break&quot; and &quot;Speed)&quot;. However, Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the picture as &quot;a down-and-dirty B-picture with a lustrous A-picture soul&quot;. Besides this large-scale feature, Reeves starred in a drama, &quot;To the Bone&quot;, in which he plays a doctor helping a young woman with anorexia. It premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, followed by distribution on Netflix in July. Early reviews were positive, with praise for its non-glamorized portrayal of anorexia, although the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine thought it was irresponsible. That year, Reeves also made cameo appearances in the films &quot;A Happening of Monumental Proportions&quot; and &quot;SPF-18&quot;.

Reeves reunited with Winona Ryder in the 2018 comedy &quot;Destination Wedding&quot;, about wedding guests who develop a mutual affection for each other. They had worked together previously in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, &quot;A Scanner Darkly&quot; and &quot;The Private Lives of Pippa Lee&quot;. Reeves also co-produced and starred in two thrillers. &quot;Siberia&quot;, in which he plays a diamond trader who travels to Siberia to search for his Russian partner, and &quot;Replicas&quot;, which tells the story of a neuroscientist who violates laws and bioethics to bring his family back to life after they die in a car crash. &quot;Siberia&quot; was critically panned; reviewers thought the plot was nonsensical and Reeves had little chemistry with co-star Ana Ularu. &quot;Replicas&quot; did not fare well with critics either; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised Reeves&#x27; performance, but gave the film a grade D−, adding it is &quot;garbage&quot;. It was also a box office failure, earning $9.3 million from a budget of $30 million.
Returning to the &quot;John Wick&quot; franchise, Reeves starred in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&quot; (2019), the third feature in the series directed by Stahelski. The film takes place immediately after the events of &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; and features new cast members including Halle Berry. The film was another box office hit, grossing $171 million in the United States and more than $155 million internationally. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s reviewer gave the film three out of four stars, praising the fight scenes, but felt there was &quot;aesthetic overindulgence&quot; with the cinematography. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Cath Clarke questioned Reeves&#x27; acting; she wrote that &quot;he keeps his face statue-still [...] three movies in, franchise bloat is beginning to set in&quot;. Reeves was nominated for Favorite Male Movie Star of 2019 in the People&#x27;s Choice Awards, and the film itself was nominated for Best Contemporary Film in the Art Directors Guild Awards. Reeves then voiced Duke Caboom in 2019&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, the fourth installment of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise. In that same year on April 27 and 28, a film festival was held in his honour, called KeanuCon, hosted in Glasgow, Scotland. Over two days, nine of his films were screened for guests. Also in 2019, Reeves played a supporting role as himself in the Ali Wong-led romantic comedy &quot;Always Be My Maybe&quot;. In 2019, Reeves travelled to São Paulo to produce a Netflix series, &quot;Conquest&quot;. Footage shot for the project would remain in development hell for years due to creator Carl Rinsch&#x27;s erratic behaviour and mental health state, which caused him to miss several deadlines and enter litigation with Netflix over the rights to the series.

As early as 2008, Reeves and Alex Winter had shown enthusiasm for a third &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot; film, but the project went into development limbo. Finally in 2020, &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot;, the third film in the franchise was released. The critic from &quot;Salon&quot; magazine was disappointed in Reeves&#x27; performance, but praised the film for its message that &quot;music has the power to unite the world&quot;. Leah Greenblatt of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade B, and complimented the onscreen chemistry between Reeves and Winter. He also appeared in &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; as a tumbleweed named Sage. Reeves appears as Johnny Silverhand in the video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077.&quot; In December 2021, Reeves returned to the screen for the fourth film in &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise: &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;. Carrie-Anne Moss also reprised her role as Trinity. &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot; was a box office disappointment; one critic praised Reeves&#x27; and Moss&#x27; performances, but thought the film was a &quot;no game-changer&quot;.

===2023–present: Post-&quot;John Wick&quot;===
Lionsgate&#x27;s &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot; premiered on March 24, 2023; Reeves reprised his role as the title character. It received critical acclaim; several reviewers cited the film among the greatest action films ever made. He also reprised his role as Johnny Silverhand in the &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; expansion, &quot;Phantom Liberty&quot;.
A comic book series, &quot;BRZRKR&quot;, co-written by Reeves was published in three volumes starting in March 2021 and concluding in October 2023. Issue #1 sold over 615,000 copies, making it the top-selling single issue since Star Wars #1 in 2015.
After occasionally meeting up for jam sessions in the years following their dissolution, Dogstar began recording new material during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which turned into a finished album, &quot;Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees&quot; (2023). Following their first performance in 20 years at BottleRock Napa Valley music festival, Reeves and the band embarked on a 25-date tour in North America and Japan in support of the album, beginning August 10 in Hermosa Beach, California. In July, Boom! Studios published the first issue of &quot;BRZRKR: Bloodlines&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;. Reeves appeared as the featured guest for the season 6 premiere episode of &quot;Ride with Norman Reedus&quot; (2023), titled &quot;The Utah Desert with Keanu Reeves&quot;. &quot;CinemaBlend&quot;″s Nick Venable said, &quot;the installment makes for some truly heartwarming viewing for anyone who needs something to smile about&quot;. In November of that year, he appeared as the host for and executive produced the 4-part documentary series &quot;Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story&quot; for Hulu and Disney+. Jack Seale of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that Reeves was &quot;there to humanize the story&quot;, and pointed out his &quot;numerous adorable habits that most interviewers would deem unprofessional, but which don&#x27;t offend.&quot; He felt that much of the emotion in the series owed to the way &quot;he gets his interviewees to open up. He often asks an emotion-based question – how did someone feel about what they did, rather than just what did they do&quot;. At the end of that month, Boom! Studios published the second comic in the &quot;BRZRKR: Bloodlines&quot; series, entitled &quot;&quot;.

By the end of May 2024, Netflix won litigation over the rights to the Reeves-produced &quot;Conquest&quot; series, with the footage reverting to their ownership alongside being reimbursed for $8.78 million worth of creator Carl Erik Rinsch&#x27;s misused production money. That June, Reeves and Dogstar announced their Summer Vacation Tour, with shows scheduled from August to September in the US and Canada. On July 23, 2024, Reeves published a novel, &quot;The Book of Elsewhere&quot;, co-written with China Miéville, a telling of the story of &quot;BRZRKR&quot;. The first issue of the second volume of the &quot;Bloodlines&quot; series, &quot;A Faceful of Bullets&quot;, written with Jason Aaron and art by Francesco Manna was released the following day after a delay from June. Another &quot;BRZRKR&quot; &quot;Bloodlines&quot; spin-off, titled &quot;The Lost Book of B&quot; released on August 21, 2024. He joined Graham Hancock in the second season of the series &quot;Ancient Apocalypse&quot; on Netflix, where he discussed his insights into storytelling as an act of preserving culture. Reeves starred in the &quot;Armored Core&quot; episode of the animated anthology series &quot;Secret Level&quot;. In April 2024, Reeves was cast as the voice of Shadow the Hedgehog in the third installment of the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; film series, &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;, which released on December 20, 2024. He also voiced the character in a DLC for the video game &quot;Shadow Generations&quot; (2024), developed as a tie-in for the aforementioned film.

In January 2025, Reeves had an uncredited role voicing a stop-motion Lumon building in the second season of the television series &quot;Severance&quot;.

====Upcoming projects====
Reeves will star alongside Seth Rogen and Aziz Ansari in the latter&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Good Fortune&quot;. He will then star in Jonah Hill&#x27;s upcoming black comedy film &quot;Outcome&quot; on Apple TV+. In the 2025 series spin-off film &quot;From the World of John Wick: Ballerina&quot;, Reeves is set to reprise his role as the franchise&#x27;s titular character. Reeves is set to star in Ruben Östlund&#x27;s satire film &quot;The Entertainment System Is Down&quot;. Reeves will co-produce a documentary film about the life of Benny Urquidez, set for release in 2025. Reeves will make his Broadway debut in the fall of 2025, in a production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; directed by Jamie Lloyd.

A film adaptation of &quot;BRZRKR&quot; written by Mattson Tomlin and produced by and starring Reeves is being developed for Netflix, with Reeves open to the possibility of directing. After the release of the film, a two-season anime series also planned for release on Netflix and produced by Production I.G is planned to follow. A fifth sequel to &quot;John Wick&quot; was planned by distributor Lionsgate, but franchise director Chad Stahelski had said he would like to give the franchise a &quot;rest&quot; for the time being. Besides plans for a fifth film, a sequel television series titled &quot;John Wick: Under The High Table&quot; is being developed with Reeves attached as an executive producer.

==Personal life==

In 1998, Reeves met director David Lynch&#x27;s assistant Jennifer Syme at a party thrown for his band Dogstar, and they started dating. On December 24, 1999, Syme gave birth eight months into her pregnancy to the couple&#x27;s child, who was stillborn. The couple broke up several weeks afterward, but later reconciled. On April 2, 2001, Syme was killed when her vehicle collided with three parked cars on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles. Syme had been under the influence and also not belted in. Reeves told investigators that they were back together, and had brunch together in San Francisco the day before the accident. Reeves acted as a pallbearer for Syme, who was buried next to their daughter. He was scheduled to film the sequels to &quot;The Matrix&quot; the following spring, but sought &quot;peace and time&quot;, according to friend Bret Domrose of Dogstar.

Reeves has also been romantically linked to longtime friend and filmmaker Brenda Davis, to whose child he is godfather, and model-actress China Chow. Reeves also maintains a close friendship with his &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; co-star Winona Ryder; after taking part in a wedding scene with a Romanian priest for the film, they still call each other &quot;husband and wife&quot; when speaking personally. In 2009, Reeves met Alexandra Grant at a dinner party; they went on to collaborate on two books together. They went public with their relationship in November 2019.

Reeves is discreet about his spiritual beliefs, saying that it is something &quot;personal and private&quot;. When asked if he was a spiritual person, he said that he believes &quot;in God, faith, inner faith, the self, passion, and things&quot;, and that he is &quot;very spiritual&quot;. Although he does not formally practice Buddhism, the religion has left a strong impression on him, especially after filming &quot;Little Buddha&quot;. He said, &quot;Most of the things I&#x27;ve come away with from Buddhism have been human—understanding feelings, impermanence, and trying to understand other people and where they&#x27;re coming from.&quot;

In 2023, the lipopeptide keanumycin, a substance deadly to fungi, was named in honour of Reeves.

In 2024, Reeves spoke on his thoughts about mortality, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m thinking about death all the time. That&#x27;s a good thing. Hopefully it&#x27;s not crippling, but hopefully it&#x27;s sensitised [us] to an appreciation of the breath we have, and the relationships that we have the potential to have.&quot; On October 5, Reeves made his motorsport debut in the Toyota GR Cup North America where he finished in 25th on Race 1 and 24th on Race 2 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

==Business and philanthropy==

Reeves supports several charities and causes. In response to his sister&#x27;s battle with leukemia, he founded a private cancer foundation, which aids children&#x27;s hospitals and provides cancer research. In June 2020, he volunteered for Camp Rainbow Gold, an Idaho children&#x27;s cancer charity. Reeves was also recognized as one of the 100 Influential Celebrities in Oncology by OncoDaily. Reeves has said, &quot;Money is the last thing I think about. I could live on what I have already made for the next few centuries&quot;. It was rumoured that Reeves gave away a substantial portion, estimated to be $35–$125 million, of his earnings from &quot;The Matrix&quot; to the special effects and makeup crews. However, this has been significantly embellished; Reeves negotiated a smaller deal, relinquishing his contractual right to a percentage of the sequels&#x27; profits in exchange for a more extensive special effects budget. During production on that film, Reeves heard that a crew member was having &quot;family trouble&quot;, and elected to gift the man 20,000 dollars to help him with his finances. As a wrap gift for the twelve-person stunt team of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003), Reeves purchased Harley-Davidson motorcycles for each of the members, saying of the gifts, &quot;I just wanted ... to give a bigger thank-you to all these guys who helped me make this&quot;.

After filming &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot;, Reeves, Chad Stahelski and Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor Dave Camarillo, signed an exclusive training uniform that was put up for auction in March 2023 to raise money for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. Reeves also presented his personal stunt team for the film with engraved custom Rolex Submariner watches, and bought the larger &quot;Chapter 4&quot; stunt crews each personalized T-shirts indicating how many times that the various extras they portrayed &quot;died&quot; in the film. In 2024, Reeves signed a one-day contract with the Windsor Spitfires, and signed items which were auctioned off in benefit of the Canadian Mental Health Association of Windsor-Essex.

Reeves co-founded a production company, Company Films, with friend Stephen Hamel. In 2011, Reeves, an avid motorcyclist, co-founded ARCH Motorcycle Company, which builds and sells custom motorcycles, with Gard Hollinger. In 2017, Reeves, Jessica Fleischmann, and Alexandra Grant founded book publisher, X Artists&#x27; Books (also known as XAB). He has written two books with Grant: &quot;Ode to Happiness&quot; and &quot;Shadows&quot;; he provided the text to her photographs and art.

==Censorship==
In 2022, Reeves&#x27;s recitation of the Beat poem &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; for a virtual benefit concert for Tibet House US, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, stirred a negative reaction from &quot;jingoistic&quot; crowds on Chinese social media. Reeves&#x27;s films have been banned from streaming platforms in China such as iQiyi, Tencent Video and Youku.

==In the media==
In a 2005 article for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Lev Grossman called Reeves &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s ultimate introvert&quot;. He has been described as a workaholic, charming and &quot;excruciatingly shy&quot;. During the production of &quot;Constantine&quot;, director Francis Lawrence commented on his personality, calling him &quot;hardworking&quot; and &quot;generous&quot;. His co-star Shia LaBeouf said, &quot;I&#x27;ve worked with him for a year and a couple of months, but I don&#x27;t really know him that much&quot;. Erwin Stoff of 3 Arts Entertainment has served as Reeves&#x27;s agent and manager since he was 16, and produced many of his films. Stoff said Reeves &quot;is a really private person&quot; and keeps his distance from other people. In 2023, Reeves&#x27;s frequent collaborator Laurence Fishburne remarked on him, &quot;He&#x27;s kinder, yeah. He&#x27;s much kinder than people say he is. He&#x27;s a very gentle, highly intelligent man. Really thoughtful and gifted and incredibly patient. Yeah, he has a lot of grace, Keanu.&quot; Aziz Ansari, who directed and starred with Reeves in &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, joked that he &quot;actually is an angel&quot;, and that &quot;he&#x27;s been pretending to be human for all these other roles.&quot; In a 2024 interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, Hiroyuki Sanada said, &quot;He [is] so humble, very kind to others but very hard on himself&quot;. [...] He&#x27;s always trying to do his best: aim higher, move forward&quot;.

In 2010, an image of Reeves became an internet meme after photographs of him were published, sitting on a park bench with a sad facial expression. The images were posted on the 4chan discussion board and were soon distributed via several blogs and media outlets, leading to the &quot;Sad Keanu&quot; meme being spread on the internet. An unofficial holiday was created when a Facebook fan page declared June 15 as &quot;Cheer-up Keanu Day&quot;. He would later downplay the photo, saying, &quot;Man, I was eating a sandwich. I was thinking—I had some stuff going on. I was hungry.&quot;

Reeves&#x27;s casual persona and ability to establish rapport have been observed by the public, leading him to be dubbed the &quot;Internet&#x27;s boyfriend&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Vox&quot; cited Reeves&#x27;s unorthodox filmography and ability to appeal to nerd culture as the primary reasons for his internet popularity. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; assessed that Reeves is &quot;commonly considered one of the kindest, most thoughtful actors in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that he holds a reputation as &quot;one of the nicest, humblest guys on the Hollywood A-list&quot;, and the BBC wrote that he is known for his &quot;gentle, mild-mannered persona&quot;, and is often described as &quot;the nicest man in Hollywood.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; dubbed Reeves as the &quot;master of the fan encounter&quot;, and &quot;Snopes&quot; observed that he is &quot;so beloved that he&#x27;s a cultural fixture&quot;.

In March 2019, Reeves went viral after his United Airlines flight to Burbank, California was grounded in Bakersfield. Taking initiative in arranging alternate travel plans, Reeves boarded a travel van with the other passengers. Reeves read fun facts from his phone about Bakersfield to the passengers, and later used YouTube to play them 1950s American country music that was native to the town. &quot;Time&quot; said of the events, &quot;One thing&#x27;s for certain after this eventful trip: if you&#x27;re looking for a road trip buddy, Keanu Reeves should be on the top of your list&quot;.

Reeves again gained media attention in May when a clip of his guest episode on &quot;The Late Show With Stephen Colbert&quot; went viral online. Colbert asked at the end of the show about his views on death, then Reeves answered, &quot;I know that the ones who love us will miss us.&quot; The response incited an emotional reaction from the audience, and Colbert shook Reeves&#x27;s hand before wrapping up the show. &quot;Vice&quot;″s River Donaghey declared that &quot;Keanu is my new religion&quot; in response to the clip, and called the moment &quot;transcendent&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;a response so wise, so genuinely thoughtful, that it seemed like a rebuke to the usual canned blather of late-night television&quot;—staff writer Naomi Fry recounted that she &quot;felt like [she] was standing alone in a rock garden, having a koan whispered into [her] ear&quot; after watching the viral clip on Twitter. The interaction would later inspire science communicator Hank Green to end his &quot;Pissing Out Cancer&quot; comedy special, based on his experiences fighting Hodgkin&#x27;s Lymphoma, with a quote inspired by Reeves&#x27;s answer; &quot;Either way, what comes next is going to be beautiful&quot;. In choosing the ending, he felt that Reeves&#x27;s words reflected a larger understanding of the human experience.

While filming &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music&quot; in July 2019, Reeves and other cast members came across a house with a banner reading &quot;You&#x27;re Breathtaking&quot; and &quot;Mini Keanu&quot;, two memes that had come out of Reeves&#x27;s appearance at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2019 for the game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. Reeves took time to sign the banner, and talk to the family. &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that the actor&#x27;s fans were quick to praise him in response to the incident, calling him &quot;good guy Keanu&quot; and lauding him as &quot;the best human on the planet&quot;.

In August 2022, Reeves went viral for attending a fan&#x27;s wedding in Northamptonshire, United Kingdom. James and Nikki Roadnight saw Reeves at a bar at Fawsley Hall Hotel shortly before their marriage ceremony and started to chat with him, with Reeves congratulating the couple on their marriage. Later, after James had secretly asked Reeves to meet Nikki during the wedding, he turned up during the ceremony. Nikki described Reeves as &quot;a genuinely kind guy&quot; and &quot;relaxed and down to earth&quot; during the wedding, and he participated in a photoshoot with the family. Another interaction between Reeves at an October 2023 Dogstar concert in Houston gained media attention. A young fan named Elijah approached Reeves before they started their show, asking if Reeves would play catch with him. Reeves obliged, with a game ensuing between the two. Calling the game &quot;the top moment&quot; of his life, the boy stated his intent to keep the football &quot;forever and ever&quot;. Oliver Browning of &quot;The Independent&quot; called the interaction &quot;a wholesome moment&quot; for Reeves.

Reeves appeared on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ annual Celebrity 100 list in 2001 and 2002, at number 36 and 49, respectively. In 2005, Reeves received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture industry. In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calculated that Reeves had earned $250 million for &quot;The Matrix&quot; franchise, making him one of the highest-paid actors. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ranked him at number four on its list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century.

A popular meme asserts that Reeves is &quot;secretly immortal&quot; and has lived throughout the last millennia under the identities of several historical figures, including Charlemagne and French actor Paul Mounet. The meme came to media prominence in 2017 when Reeves was asked by Jimmy Fallon on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; about it. Reeves addressed his resemblance with Charlemagne, saying &quot;We have a likeness in the eyes. And the nose and the mustache and the beard and the cheekbones and the forehead&quot;. When asked in a Q&amp;A event for &quot;John Wick: Chapter 4&quot; &quot;if he ever ages&quot;, Reeves responded, &quot;Yeah man, I age. I really – I age. It&#x27;s happening, man&quot;. In 2023, a website dedicated to chronicling every time Reeves has spoken the word &quot;whoa&quot; in his film career was created by web developer Avi Mamenko to honor him. In 2022, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

==Filmography and awards==
Prolific in film since 1985, Reeves&#x27;s most acclaimed and highest-grossing films, according to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, include: &quot;River&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1987), &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; (1989), &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; (1991), &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1993), &quot;Speed&quot; (1994), &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999), &quot;John Wick&quot; (2014), &quot;John Wick: Chapter2&quot; (2017), &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3Parabellum&quot; (2019), and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019).

He was nominated twice for a People&#x27;s Choice Award: Favorite Male Movie Star and Favorite Action Movie Star, for his performance in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3Parabellum&quot; (2019).

In November 2015, &quot;People&quot; retroactively named him 1994&#x27;s Sexiest Man Alive. In September 2021, &quot;Tae Kwon Do Life Magazine&quot; deemed Reeves the &quot;#1 Martial Arts movie star in the world&quot; based upon his multiple films in the genre, their popularity, and sheer box office gross. In 2024, Gold House honored him on its Most Impactful Asians A100 list, and he was presented with the Inkpot Award for Lifetime Contributions to Movies, TV, Comics, and Books at San Diego Comic-Con.

<text>The is a Japanese plucked half-tube zither instrument, and the national instrument of Japan. It is derived from the Chinese and , and similar to the Mongolian , the Korean and , the Vietnamese , the Sundanese and the Kazakh . Koto are roughly in length, and made from Paulownia wood (&quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot;, known as ). The most common type uses 13 strings strung over movable bridges used for tuning, different pieces possibly requiring different tuning. Seventeen-string koto are also common, and act as bass in ensembles. Koto strings are generally plucked using three fingerpicks (), worn on the first three fingers of the right hand.
== Names and types ==
The character for &quot;koto&quot; is , although is often used. However, (&quot;koto&quot;) is the general term for all string instruments in the Japanese language, including instruments such as the , , , , , and so on. When read as , it indicates the Chinese instrument . The term is used today in the same way.

The term &quot;koto&quot; appears in the in reference to an ancient string instrument in this usage. Variations of the instrument were eventually created, and eventually a few of them would become the standard variations for modern day koto. The four types of koto () were all created by different subcultures, but also adapted to change the playing style.

One regional style of the koto is the &quot;Tategoto&quot; (竪琴) from the Amami Islands. Unlike other varieties of the koto, it is held upright on the lap and played with one hand, may have more strings, is shorter, and is typically strung with steel strings. 

==History==
The ancestor of the koto was the Chinese . It was first introduced to Japan from China in the 7th and 8th centuries. The first known version had five strings, which eventually increased to seven strings. The Japanese koto belongs to the Asian zither family that also comprises the Chinese (ancestral to the other zithers in the family), the Korean , and the Vietnamese . This variety of instrument came in two basic forms, a zither that had bridges and a zither without bridges.

When the koto was first imported to Japan, the native word koto was a generic term for any and all Japanese stringed instruments. As the number of different stringed instruments in Japan grew, the once-basic definition of koto could not describe the wide variety of these instruments and so the meanings changed. The or was called the , the was called the , and the ( being an older pronunciation of ) was called the or koto.

The modern koto originates from the used in Japanese court music (). It was a popular instrument among the wealthy; the instrument was considered a romantic one. Some literary and historical records indicate that solo pieces for koto existed centuries before , the music of the solo koto genre, was established. According to Japanese literature, the koto was used as imagery and other extra music significance. In one part of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, the titular character falls deeply in love with a mysterious woman whom he has never seen before, after hearing her playing the koto from a distance.

The koto of the was made for the tradition, originally intended only for blind men. Women were forbidden from playing the instrument in the professional world, nor were they allowed to teach it. When these strict rules were relieved, women began to play the koto, with the exception of the , as its design for the blind led to a decline in use; other koto proved more useful. The two main koto varieties still used today are the and . These two have relatively stayed the same, with the exception of material innovations such as the use of plastic, as well as modern material for the strings. The is the newest addition to the koto family, surfacing in the 19th century. It was purposefully created to extend the range of the instrument and advance the style of play. These were made with 17, 21, and 31 strings.

Perhaps the most important influence on the development of koto was Yatsuhashi Kengyo (1614–1685). Yatsuhashi was a gifted blind musician from Kyoto who vastly extended the limited selection of only six traditional koto songs to a brand-new style of koto music which he called . Yatsuhashi changed the tunings, which were based on the older ways of tuning; and with this change, a new style of koto was born. Yatsuhashi is now known as the &quot;Father of Modern Koto&quot;.

A smaller influence in the evolution of the koto is found in the inspiration of a woman named Keiko Nosaka. Nosaka (a musician who won Grand Prize in Music from the Japanese Ministry of Culture in 2002), felt confined by playing a koto with just 13 strings, and created new versions of the instrument with 20 or more strings.

Japanese developments in bridgeless zithers include the one-stringed koto () and two-stringed koto ( or ). Around the 1920s, Goro Morita created a new version of the two-stringed koto. On this koto, one would push down buttons above the metal strings like the western autoharp. It was named the after the Taishō period.

At the beginning of the Meiji Period (1868–1912), Western music was introduced to Japan. Michio Miyagi (1894–1956), a blind composer, innovator, and performer, is considered to have been the first Japanese composer to combine western music and traditional koto music. Miyagi is largely regarded as being responsible for keeping the koto alive when traditional Japanese arts were being forgotten and replaced by Westernization. He wrote over 300 new works for the instrument before his death in a train accident at the age of 62. He also invented the popular 17-string bass koto, created new playing techniques, advanced traditional forms, and most importantly increased the koto&#x27;s popularity. He performed abroad and by 1928 his piece for koto and , (&quot;Spring Sea&quot;) had been transcribed for numerous instruments. is even played to welcome each New Year in Japan.

Since Miyagi&#x27;s time, many composers such as Kimio Eto (1924–2012) and Tadao Sawai (1937–1997) have written and performed works that continue to advance the instrument. Sawai&#x27;s widow Kazue Sawai, who as a child was Miyagi&#x27;s favored disciple, has been the largest driving force behind the internationalization and modernization of the koto. Her arrangement of composer John Cage&#x27;s prepared piano duet &quot;Three Dances&quot; for four prepared bass koto was a landmark in the modern era of koto music.

For about 150 years after the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese shirked their isolationist ideals and began to openly embrace American and European influences, the most likely explanation for why the koto has taken on many different variations of itself.

==Construction==

A koto is typically made of Paulownia wood (known as ), although treatment of the wood varies tremendously between artisans. A koto may or may not be adorned. Adornments include inlays of ivory and ebony, tortoise shell, metal figures, etc. The wood is also cut into two patterns, (also called ), which has a swirling pattern, or straight-lined . The straight lined pattern is easier to manufacture, so the swirl raises the cost of production, and is therefore reserved for decorative and elegant models.

The body of a traditional koto is made of Paulownia wood. Every piece of the instrument comes with cultural significance, especially since the koto is the national instrument. The wood is dried and cut into precise measurements. The size of the soundboard on a standard modern koto has remained approximately , where in the past it ranged from .

The bridges () used to be made of ivory, but nowadays are typically made of plastic, and occasionally made of wood. One can alter the pitch of a string by manipulating or moving the bridge. For some very low notes, there are small bridges made, as well as specialty bridges with three different heights, depending on the need of the tuning. When a small bridge is unavailable for some very low notes, some players may, as an emergency measure, use a bridge upside down, though this is unstable and not ideal. Bridges have been known to break during playing, and with some older instruments which have the surface where the bridges rest being worn due to much use, the bridges may fall during playing, especially when pressing strings. There are, of course, various sorts of patch materials sold to fill the holes which cause the legs of a bridge to rest on an unstable area. About long and wide, the koto is traditionally placed on the floor in front of the player, who kneels.

The strings are made from a variety of materials. Various types of plastic strings are popular. Silk strings, typically yellow in color, are still made, despite their higher price and lower durability than modern strings; some musicians prefer them, perceiving a difference in sound quality to modern strings. The strings are tied with a half hitch to a roll of paper or cardboard, about the size of a cigarette butt, strung through the holes at the head of the koto, threaded through the holes at the back, tightened, and tied with a special knot. Strings can be tightened by a special machine, but often are tightened by hand, and then tied. One can tighten by pulling the string from behind, or sitting at the side of the koto, although the latter is much harder and requires much arm strength. Some instruments may have tuning pins (like a piano) installed, to make tuning easier.

The , the silk thread used in the instrument, is a pivotal part of its construction. This feature was not seen on the speculated nobility-style instruments because they used a more tension of theirs and valued the relict nature of their instruments. The commoners did all the innovations that made the koto not only a sturdy instrument, but more sonically adept. The was used in paper so the fine silk was in abundance in Japan. As of the beginning of the 19th century, an ivory called became the standard for the koto.

For every part of the koto, there is a traditional name which connects with the opinion that the body of a koto resembles that of a dragon. Thus, the top part is called the , while the bottom part is called the . One end of the koto, noticeable because of the removable colorful fabricshell, is known as the , consisting of parts such as the – the saddle of the bridge or the – , and – the space above the . The other end of the koto is called the ; the string nut is called the .

==Koto today==

The influence of Western pop music has made the koto less prominent in Japan, although it is still developing as an instrument. The 17-string bass koto () has become more prominent over the years since its development by Michio Miyagi. There are also 20-, 21-, and 25-string koto. Works are being written for 20- and 25-string koto and 17-string bass koto. Reiko Obata has also made the koto accessible to Western music readers with the publication of two books for solo koto using Western notation. The current generation of koto players, such as American performers Reiko Obata and Miya Masaoka, Japanese master Kazue Sawai, and Michiyo Yagi, are finding places for the koto in today&#x27;s jazz, experimental music and even pop music. The members of the band Rin&#x27; are popular 17-string koto players in the modern music scene.

June Kuramoto of the jazz fusion group Hiroshima was one of the first koto performers to popularize the koto in a non-traditional fusion style. Reiko Obata, founder of East West Jazz, was the first to perform and record an album of jazz standards featuring the koto. Obata also produced the first-ever English language koto instructional DVD, titled &quot;You Can Play Koto&quot;. Obata is one of the few koto performers to perform concertos with United States orchestras, having done so on multiple occasions, including with Orchestra Nova for San Diego&#x27;s KPBS in 2010.

Other solo performers outside Japan include award-winning recording artist Elizabeth Falconer, who also studied for a decade at the Sawai Koto School in Tokyo, and Linda Kako Caplan, Canadian (grandmaster) and member of Fukuoka&#x27;s Chikushi Koto School for over two decades. Another Sawai disciple, Masayo Ishigure, holds down a school in New York City. Yukiko Matsuyama leads her KotoYuki band in Los Angeles. Her compositions blend the timbres of world music with her native Japanese culture. She performed on the Grammy-winning album &quot;&quot; (2010) by the Paul Winter Consort, garnering additional exposure to Western audiences for the instrument. In November 2011, worldwide audiences were further exposed to the koto when she performed with Shakira at the Latin Grammy Awards.

In March 2010, the koto received widespread international attention when a video linked by the Grammy Award-winning hard rock band Tool on its website became a viral hit. The video showed Tokyo-based ensemble Soemon playing member Brett Larner&#x27;s arrangement of the Tool song &quot;Lateralus&quot; for six bass and two bass koto. Larner had previously played koto with John Fahey, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and members of indie rock groups including Camper Van Beethoven, Deerhoof, Jackie O Motherfucker, and Mr. Bungle.

In older pop and rock music, David Bowie used a koto in the instrumental piece &quot;Moss Garden&quot; on his album &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977). The multi-instrumentalist, founder, and former guitarist of The Rolling Stones Brian Jones played the koto in the song &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; on the album &quot;Aftermath&quot; (1966).

Paul Gilbert, a popular guitar virtuoso, recorded his wife Emi playing the koto on his song &quot;Koto Girl&quot; from the album &quot;Alligator Farm&quot; (2000). Rock band Kagrra, are well known for using traditional Japanese musical instruments in many of their songs, an example being , a song in which the koto has a prominent place. Winston Tong, the singer of Tuxedomoon, uses it on his 15-minute song &quot;The Hunger&quot; from his debut solo album &quot;Theoretically Chinese&quot; (1985).

The rock band Queen used a (toy) koto in &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; on their 1975 album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. Ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett used a koto on the instrumental song &quot;The Red Flower of Tachai Blooms Everywhere&quot; from the album &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot; (1979), and Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks sampled a koto using an Emulator keyboard for the band&#x27;s song &quot;Mama&quot;. A koto played by Hazel Payne is featured in A Taste of Honey&#x27;s 1981 English cover of the Japanese song &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;. A synthesized koto appears in their cover of The Miracles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Something New&quot;. Steve Howe used a koto in the instrumental break of Asia&#x27;s single &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, from their self-titled 1982 album. Howe also played a koto on the Yes song &quot;It Will Be a Good Day (The River)&quot;, from the 1999 album &quot;The Ladder&quot;.

Dr. Dre&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;2001&quot; prominently features a synthesized koto on two of its tracks, &quot;Still D.R.E.&quot; and &quot;The Message&quot;. A 2020 acoustic cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; by PianoRock feat. Dean McNeill also prominently features a synthesized koto.

<text>A kludge or kluge () is a workaround or makeshift solution that is clumsy, inelegant, inefficient, difficult to extend, and hard to maintain. This term is used in diverse fields such as computer science, aerospace engineering, Internet slang, evolutionary neuroscience, animation and government. It is similar in meaning to the naval term &quot;jury rig&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word has alternate spellings (&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;), pronunciations ( and , rhyming with &quot;judge&quot; and &quot;stooge&quot;, respectively), and several proposed etymologies.

=== Jackson W. Granholm ===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (2nd ed., 1989), cites Jackson W. Granholm&#x27;s 1962 &quot;How to Design a Kludge&quot; article in the American computer magazine &quot;Datamation&quot;.

&quot;OED&quot; defines these two &quot;kludge&quot; cognates as: &quot;bodge&quot; &#x27;to patch or mend clumsily&#x27; and &quot;fudge&quot; &#x27;to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner&#x27;. The &quot;OED&quot; entry also includes the verb &quot;kludge&quot; (&#x27;to improvise with a kludge or kludges&#x27;) and &quot;kludgemanship&quot; (&#x27;skill in designing or applying kludges&#x27;).

Granholm humorously imagined a fictitious source for the term:

Although &quot;OED&quot; accepts Granholm&#x27;s coinage of the term (not the fanciful pseudo-etymology quoted above), there are examples of its use before the 1960s.

=== Germanic sources ===
American Yiddish speakers use () to mean &#x27;too smart by half&#x27;, the reflected meaning of German (&#x27;clever&#x27;). This may explain the idea of &#x27;clever but clumsy and temporary&#x27;, as well as the pronunciation variation from German. A reasonable translation of &quot;kludge&quot; into German yields i.e. &#x27;crutch&#x27;.

Cf. German (&#x27;dumpling&#x27;, &#x27;clod&#x27;, diminutive ), Low Saxon , , Dutch , perhaps related to Low German diminutive (&#x27;dumpling&#x27;, &#x27;clod&#x27;), standard Danish (&#x27;mess, disorder&#x27;) and Danish Jutland dialect (&#x27;piece of bad workmanship&#x27;).

Arguments against the derivation from German :

* There is no equivalent usage in German
* Both English pronunciations contain the soft &quot;g&quot; () not present in German
* The word emerges in English only in the 20th century
* The alleged Swedish translation, , is incorrect and would properly be spelled .

An alternative etymology suggests that the &quot;kludge&quot; spelling in particular derives ultimately from a word in Scots (a language closely related to English): or meaning &#x27;toilet&#x27; (in either the room or device sense), with the &quot;kluge&quot; spelling possibly deriving from German, until the two terms were confused in the mid-20th century, as British and American (respectively) military slang. 

== Kludge vs. kluge ==
The &quot;Jargon File&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The New Hacker&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;), a glossary of computer programmer slang maintained by Eric S. Raymond, differentiates &quot;kludge&quot; from &quot;kluge&quot; and cites usage examples pre-dating 1962. &quot;Kluge&quot; seems to have the sense of &#x27;overcomplicated&#x27;, while &quot;kludge&quot; has only the sense of &#x27;poorly done&#x27;.

This &quot;Jargon File&quot; entry notes that &quot;kludge&quot; apparently derives via British military slang from Scots (&#x27;toilet&#x27;), and became confused with American &quot;kluge&quot; during or after World War II.

This entry notes &quot;kluge&quot;, which is now often spelled &quot;kludge&quot;, &quot;was the original spelling, reported around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used exclusively of hardware kluges&quot;.

&quot;Kluge&quot; &quot;was common Navy slang in the World War II era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea&quot;. A summary of a 1947 article in the &quot;New York Folklore Quarterly&quot; states:

The &quot;Jargon File&quot; further includes &quot;kluge around&quot;, &#x27;to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge&#x27;, and &quot;kluge up&quot;, &#x27;to lash together a quick hack to perform a task&#x27;.

After Granholm&#x27;s 1962 article popularized the &quot;kludge&quot; variant, both were interchangeably used and confused. The &quot;Jargon File&quot; concludes:

== Industries ==

=== Aerospace engineering ===
In aerospace, a kludge was a temporary design using separate commonly available components that were not flightworthy in order to proof the design and enable concurrent software development while the integrated components were developed and manufactured. The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.

Perhaps the ultimate kludge was the first US space station, Skylab. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the Apollo Telescope Mount, began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the S-IVB stage of the Saturn 1B and Saturn V launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the Apollo Applications Program, but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its Apollo Command/Service Module at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.

The Airlock Module&#x27;s manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, even recycled the hatch design from its Gemini spacecraft and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center, was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight. Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it &quot;the kludge&quot;.

=== Computer science ===
In modern computing terminology, a &quot;kludge&quot; (or often a &quot;hack&quot;) is a solution to a problem, the performance of a task, or a system fix which is inefficient, inelegant (&quot;hacky&quot;), or even incomprehensible, but which somehow works. It is similar to a workaround, but quick. To &quot;kludge around something&quot; is to avoid a bug or difficulty by building a kludge, perhaps exploiting properties of the bug itself. A kludge is often used to modify a working system while avoiding fundamental changes, or to ensure backwards compatibility. &quot;Hack&quot; can also be used with a positive connotation, for a quick solution to a frustrating problem.

A kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of cruft.

A solution might be a kludge if it fails in corner cases. An intimate knowledge of the problem domain and execution environment is typically required to build a corner-case kludge. More commonly, a kludge is a heuristic which was expected to work almost always, but ends up failing often.

A 1960s Soviet anecdote tells of a computer part which needed a slightly delayed signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to connect long coils of internal wires to slow the electrical signal.

Another type of kludge is the evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a computer program. Rather than continue to struggle to diagnose and fix the bug, the programmer may write additional code to compensate. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled, a kludge may be to add later code that divides by two rather than to search for the original incorrect computation.

In computer networking, use of NAT (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or PAT (Port Address Translation) to cope with the shortage of IPv4 addresses is an example of a kludge.

In FidoNet terminology, &quot;kludge&quot; refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.

=== Evolutionary neuroscience ===

The &quot;kludge&quot; or &quot;kluge&quot; metaphor has been adapted in fields such as evolutionary neuroscience, particularly in reference to the human brain.

The neuroscientist David Linden discusses how intelligent design proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy:

The research psychologist Gary Marcus&#x27;s book &quot;Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind&quot; compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like manifold vacuum-powered windshield wipers – when accelerating or driving uphill, &quot;Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether.&quot; Marcus described a biological kluge:

== Other uses ==
In John Varley&#x27;s 1985 short story &quot;Press Enter_&quot;, the antagonist, a reclusive hacker, adopts the identity Charles Kluge.

In the science fiction television series &quot;Andromeda&quot;, genetically engineered human beings called Nietzscheans use the term disparagingly to refer to genetically unmodified humans.

In a 2012 article, political scientist Steven Teles used the term &quot;kludgeocracy&quot; to criticize the complexity of social welfare policy in the United States. Teles argues that institutional and political obstacles to passing legislation often drive policy makers to accept expedient fixes rather than carefully thought out reforms.

<doc id="16616" wikidata="Q189382" url="?curid=16616" title="King Crimson">
<text>King Crimson were an English-based progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by Robert Fripp (guitars), Michael Giles (drums), Greg Lake (bass, vocals), Ian McDonald (saxophone, flute, clarinet, keyboards) and Peter Sinfield (lyrics, illumination). Fripp remained the only constant member throughout the band&#x27;s history. The band drew inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, blues, industrial, electronic, experimental music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. The band has earned a large cult following, especially in the 21st century.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release. The next two albums, &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; and &quot;Lizard&quot; (both 1970), were recorded during a period of instability in the band&#x27;s line-up, before a settled line-up of Fripp, Sinfield, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace recorded &quot;Islands&quot; in 1971. In mid-1972, Fripp disbanded this line-up, recruited new members Bill Bruford (formerly of Yes), John Wetton, David Cross and Jamie Muir, and changed the group&#x27;s musical approach, drawing from European free improvisation and developing ever more complex compositions. The band reached what some saw as a creative peak on &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; (1973), &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; (1974), and &quot;Red&quot; (1974). King Crimson disbanded at the end of 1974.

After seven years of inactivity, King Crimson was recreated in 1981 with Fripp, Bruford and new members Adrian Belew (previously a side man for Frank Zappa, David Bowie, and Talking Heads) and Tony Levin (already a prolific session musician for numerous top artists, including John Lennon and Peter Gabriel). Drawing influence from African music, gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism, this band lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums &quot;Discipline&quot; (1981), &quot;Beat&quot; (1982) and &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, they reformed in 1994, adding Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn for a sextet line-up Fripp called &quot;The Double Trio&quot;. The double trio participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the album &quot;Thrak&quot; (1995). Fripp, Belew, Mastelotto and Gunn reunited in 2000 as a quartet, called &quot;The Double Duo&quot;, releasing &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; (2003). After another hiatus, the band reformed for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation, with Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree being added, and Levin returning in place of Gunn.

Following another hiatus (2009–2012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013, this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new singer and secondary guitarist Jakko Jakszyk. This version of King Crimson toured from 2014 to 2021. After the band&#x27;s final show in 2021, Fripp commented that King Crimson had &quot;moved from sound to silence.&quot;
== History ==
=== 1967–1968: Giles, Giles and Fripp ===

In August 1967, brothers Michael and Peter Giles, drummer and singer/bassist respectively and pro musicians in working bands since their mid-teens in Dorset, England, advertised for a &quot;singing organist&quot; to join a group they were forming. Fellow Dorset musician Robert Fripp – a guitarist who neither played organ nor sang – responded, and Giles, Giles and Fripp was born. The trio recorded several quirky singles and one eclectic album, &quot;The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp&quot;. They hovered on the edge of success, and even made a television appearance, but were never able to make a commercial breakthrough.

Attempting to expand their sound, the three recruited Ian McDonald on keyboards, reeds and woodwinds. McDonald brought along two new participants: his then-girlfriend, former Fairport Convention singer Judy Dyble, whose brief tenure with the group ended when the two split, and lyricist, roadie, and art strategist Peter Sinfield, with whom he had been writing songs – a partnership initiated when McDonald had said to Sinfield (regarding his band Creation), &quot;Peter, I have to tell you that your band is hopeless, but you write some great words. Would you like to get together on a couple of songs?&quot; Fripp, meanwhile, saw Clouds at the Marquee Club in London which spurred him to incorporate classically inspired melodies into his writing, and utilise improvisation to find new ideas.

No longer interested in Peter Giles&#x27; more whimsical pop songs, Fripp recommended that his old friend, fellow guitarist and singer Greg Lake could join to replace either Peter or Fripp himself. Peter Giles later called it one of Fripp&#x27;s &quot;cute political moves&quot;. According to Michael Giles, his brother had become disillusioned with the band&#x27;s lack of success and departed before Fripp suggested Lake to fill Peter Giles&#x27; position as bassist and singer.

=== 1968–1970: Original lineup and &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; ===
The first incarnation of King Crimson—Fripp, Michael Giles, Lake, McDonald and Sinfield—was formed on 30 November 1968 with rehearsals beginning on 13 January 1969. Sinfield coined the band&#x27;s name in &quot;a moment of pressured panic&quot;. Sinfield had already used the term &quot;crimson king&quot; in a set of lyrics before his involvement with Giles, Giles and Fripp. Sinfield insisted that the name wasn&#x27;t Beelzebub, prince of demons, and that a &quot;crimson king&quot; was any ruler during whose reign there were &quot;societal rumblings&quot; and &quot;sort of the dark forces of the world&quot;. According to Fripp, King Crimson is a synonym for Beelzebub, which is an anglicised form of the Arabic phrase &quot;B&#x27;il Sabab&quot;, meaning &quot;the man with an aim&quot;, to which he related.

At this early point, McDonald was the primary composer, with vital contributions from Fripp and Lake, while Sinfield wrote all the lyrics on his own, and also designed and operated the band&#x27;s unique stage lighting, being credited with &quot;words and illumination&quot; on the album sleeve. Inspired by the Moody Blues, McDonald suggested the group purchase a Mellotron keyboard, and this became a key component of the early Crimson sound. Sinfield described the original Crimson thus: &quot;If it sounded at all popular, it was out. So it had to be complicated, it had to be more expansive chords, it had to have strange influences. If it sounded, like, too simple, we&#x27;d make it more complicated, we&#x27;d play it in 7/8 or 5/8, just to show off&quot;.
King Crimson&#x27;s first live performance was at the Speakeasy Club in London on 9 April 1969 (with Yes guitarist Peter Banks among the audience). Their big breakthrough came on 5 July 1969 by playing as a support act at the Rolling Stones&#x27; free concert in Hyde Park, London before an estimated 500,000 people.

The debut album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;, was released in October 1969 on Island Records. Fripp would later describe it as having been &quot;an instant smash&quot; and &quot;New York&#x27;s acid album of 1970&quot; (notwithstanding Fripp and Giles&#x27; assertion that the band never used psychedelic drugs). Who guitarist and composer Pete Townshend called the album &quot;an uncanny masterpiece.&quot; The album contains Sinfield&#x27;s gothic lyrics and its sound was described as having &quot;dark and doom-laden visions&quot;. Its opening track &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; was described as &quot;proto-metal&quot; and the song&#x27;s lyrics criticise the military involvement of the United States in Southeast Asia. In contrast to the blues-based hard rock of the contemporary British and American scenes, King Crimson presented a more Europeanised approach that blended antiquity and modernity. The band&#x27;s music drew on a wide range of influences provided by all five group members. These elements included classical music, the psychedelic rock spearheaded by Jimi Hendrix, folk, jazz, military music (partially inspired by McDonald&#x27;s stint as an army musician) and free improvisation.

After playing shows across England, the band toured the US with various pop and rock acts. Their first show was at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont. While the band found success and critical acclaim, creative tensions were already developing. Giles and McDonald, still striving to cope with King Crimson&#x27;s rapid success and the realities of touring life, became uneasy with their musical direction. Although he was neither the dominant composer nor the frontman, Fripp was very much the group&#x27;s driving force and spokesman, leading them into progressively darker and more intense musical areas. McDonald and Giles, now favouring a lighter and more nuanced romantic style, became increasingly uncomfortable with their position and resigned after the conclusion of the US tour in January 1970. To keep the band together, Fripp offered to resign himself, but McDonald declared that King Crimson was &quot;more (him) than them&quot; and that he and Giles should therefore be the ones to leave. McDonald later said he &quot;was probably not emotionally mature enough to handle it&quot; and made a &quot;rash decision to leave without consulting anyone&quot;. The original lineup played their last show at the Fillmore West in San Francisco on 14 December 1969, a little over one year after forming. Live recordings of the band from 1969 were released in 1997 on &quot;Epitaph&quot; and in 2010 on the &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King (1969)&quot; box set.

=== 1970–1971: &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; and &quot;Lizard&quot; ===
King Crimson spent 1970 in a state of flux with various lineup changes, thwarted tour plans, and difficulties in finding a satisfactory musical direction while Fripp was learning and developing as a songwriter during the writing process of the next three albums. As well as guitar, Fripp took on keyboard duties, while Sinfield expanded his creative role to operating synthesizers.

Following McDonald and Giles&#x27; departure, Lake, unsure of the band&#x27;s future without them, began discussions with Keith Emerson of the Nice about possibly forming a new band together. With Fripp and Sinfield planning for recording the second King Crimson album, and Lake&#x27;s position uncertain, the band&#x27;s management booked Elton John to sing the material as a session musician, but Fripp decided against this idea after listening to his &quot;Empty Sky&quot; album. Lake agreed to stay with the band until Emerson had completed remaining commitments with the Nice, at which point he left to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer. On the resulting &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; album, Lake provided all the lead vocals except on &quot;Cadence and Cascade&quot;, as he left before he was able to complete this track. Fripp&#x27;s old school friend Gordon Haskell was brought in to provide the vocal on the song. The sessions also included Michael and Peter Giles on drums and bass respectively, saxophonist Mel Collins (formerly of the band Circus) and jazz pianist Keith Tippett.

Upon its release in May 1970, &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot; reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. It received some criticism from those who thought it sounded too similar to their first album. With no set band to perform the new material, Fripp and Sinfield brought Mel Collins and Gordon Haskell on board (with Haskell doubling as lead vocalist and bassist and Collins quadrupling as saxophonist, flautist, occasional keyboard player, and backing vocalist), and Andy McCulloch joined as drummer.

Fripp and Sinfield wrote the third album, &quot;Lizard&quot;, themselves – with Haskell, Collins and McCulloch having no say in the direction of the material. In addition to the core band, several session musicians contributed to the &quot;Lizard&quot; recording, including the returning Keith Tippett, who was offered to be a member of the new lineup, but due to other commitments preferred to continue working with the band as an occasional guest musician, and two members of Tippett&#x27;s band, Mark Charig on cornet, and Nick Evans on trombone. Robin Miller (on oboe and cor anglais) also appeared, while Jon Anderson of Yes was brought in to sing a section of the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Prince Rupert Awakes&quot;, which Fripp and Sinfield considered to be outside Haskell&#x27;s natural range and style. &quot;Lizard&quot; featured stronger jazz and chamber-classical influences than previous albums. The album contains Sinfield&#x27;s &quot;phantasmagorical&quot; lyrics, including &quot;Happy Family&quot; (an allegory of the break-up of the Beatles), and the title track, a suite which took up the entire second side, describing a medieval/mythological battle and its outcome.

Released in December 1970, &quot;Lizard&quot; reached No. 29 in the UK and No. 113 in the US. Described retrospectively as an &quot;outlier&quot;, the album had been made by a group in disagreement over method and taste. The more rhythm-and-blues-oriented Haskell and McCulloch both found the music difficult to relate to, and tedious and confusing to record. Collins disliked how his parts were composed, while both Fripp and Haskell detested Sinfield&#x27;s lyrics. This lineup of the band did not survive much longer than the &quot;Lizard&quot; recording sessions. Haskell quit the band acrimoniously during initial tour rehearsals after refusing to sing live with distortion and electronic effects on his voice, and McCulloch departed soon after. With Sinfield not being a musician and Fripp having seemingly given up on the band, Collins was left to search for new members.

=== 1971–1972: &quot;Islands&quot; ===
After a search for a drummer to replace McCulloch, Ian Wallace was secured. Fripp was re-energised by the addition of a new member, and he joined Collins and Wallace to audition singers and bassists. Vocalists who tried out included Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music and even one of the band&#x27;s managers, John Gaydon. The position eventually went to Raymond &quot;Boz&quot; Burrell. John Wetton was invited to join on bass, but declined in order to join Family instead. Rick Kemp (later of Steeleye Span) rehearsed with the band, but declined the final offer to formally join. Fripp decided to teach Boz to play bass rather than continue the labored auditions. Though he had not played bass before, Burrell had played enough acoustic guitar to assist him in learning the instrument quickly. Wallace was able to further instruct Burrell in functioning on the instrument in a rhythm section.

With a lineup now complete, King Crimson began touring in May 1971, the first time they had played live since the original lineup&#x27;s last show on 14 December 1969. The concerts were well received, but the musical differences between Fripp and the rest of the group, and the somewhat wilder lifestyles of Collins, Wallace and Burrell, alienated the drug-free Fripp, who began to withdraw socially from his bandmates, creating further tension.

In 1971, the new King Crimson formation recorded &quot;Islands&quot;. Sinfield, who favoured a softer approach, took lyrical inspiration from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, musical inspiration from jazz players like Miles Davis and Ahmad Jamal, and a sun-drenched trip to Ibiza and Formentera. &quot;Islands&quot; featured the instrumental &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Tale&quot;, with a droning Mellotron and Fripp&#x27;s banjo-inspired guitar solo; the raunchy blues-rocker &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot;, a tribute to groupies which featured Wallace and Collins singing Beatles-esque backing vocals; and &quot;Song of the Gulls&quot;, which was developed from an earlier Fripp instrumental (&quot;Suite No. 1&quot; from Giles, Giles &amp; Fripp&#x27;s 1968 album), and would be the only time the band would utilize an orchestra. Burrell disliked Sinfield&#x27;s lyrics and one of the band members allegedly called &quot;Islands&quot; as &quot;an airy-fairy piece of shit&quot;.

Released in December 1971, &quot;Islands&quot; charted at No. 30 in the UK and No. 76 in the US. Following a tour of the United States in December 1971, Fripp informed Sinfield that he could no longer work with him, and asked him to leave the band. In January 1972, the remaining band broke up acrimoniously in rehearsals, owing partially to Fripp&#x27;s refusal to play a composition by Collins. He later cited this as &quot;quality control&quot;, with the idea that King Crimson would perform the &quot;right&quot; kind of music.

In order to fulfil touring contracts in the United States in 1972, King Crimson reformed with the intention of disbanding immediately after the tour. Recordings from various North American dates between January and February 1972 were released as &quot;Earthbound&quot; in June of that year. The album was noted for its playing style that occasionally veered towards funk, and Burrell&#x27;s scat singing on the improvised pieces, but was criticised for its sub-par sound quality. Further, better-quality, live recordings from this era would be released in 2002 as &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; and in 2017 on the &quot;Sailors&#x27; Tales (1970–1972)&quot; box set.

By this time, the musical rift between Fripp and the rest of the band had grown very wide. Wallace, Burrell and Collins favoured improvised blues and funk. Fripp would later describe the 1971–1972 lineup as more of a jam band than an &quot;improvising&quot; band, an opinion with which Wallace disagreed. Personal relations actually improved during the tour to the point where most of the band decided to continue on, however Fripp opted to part company with the other three, restructuring King Crimson with new musicians, as he felt the other members wouldn&#x27;t be fully engaged in the musical direction he had in mind.

=== 1972–1975: &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;, &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;, &quot;Red&quot; and hiatus ===

The next incarnation of King Crimson was radically different from the previous configurations. Fripp&#x27;s four new recruits were free-improvising percussionist Jamie Muir, drummer Bill Bruford, who left Yes at a commercial peak in their career in favour of the &quot;darker&quot; Crimson, bassist and vocalist John Wetton (who left Family), and violinist, keyboardist and flautist David Cross, whom Fripp had met when he was invited to a rehearsal of Waves, a band Cross was working in.

Most of the musical compositions were collaborations between Fripp and Wetton, who each composed segments independently and fitted together those which they found compatible. With Sinfield gone, the band recruited Wetton&#x27;s friend Richard Palmer-James (from the original Supertramp) as their new lyricist. Unlike Sinfield, Palmer-James was not an official member of King Crimson, playing no part in artistic decisions, visual ideas, or sonic directions; his sole contributions to the group were his lyrics, sent via mail from his home in Germany. Following a period of rehearsals, King Crimson resumed touring on 13 October 1972 at the Zoom Club in Frankfurt, with the band&#x27;s penchant for improvisation (and Muir&#x27;s startling stage presence) gaining them renewed press attention.
In January and February 1973, King Crimson recorded &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; in London which was released that March. The band&#x27;s new sound was exemplified by the album&#x27;s two-part title track – a significant change from what King Crimson had done before, the piece emphasised the sharp instrumental interplay of the band, and drew influence from modern classical music, noisy free improv, and even heavy metal riffing. The record displayed Muir&#x27;s unusual approach to percussion, which included a self-modified drum kit, assorted toys, a bullroarer, mbira, gongs, balloons, thunder sheet and chains. On stage, Muir also employed unpredictable, manic movements, bizarre clothing, and fake blood capsules (occasionally spit or applied to the head), becoming the sole example of such theatrical stage activity in the band&#x27;s long history. The album reached No. 20 in the UK and No. 61 in the US.

After a period of further touring, Muir departed in 1973, quitting the music industry altogether. Muir told King Crimson&#x27;s management that he had decided a musician&#x27;s life was not for him, and he had chosen to join a Scottish Buddhist monastery. He offered to serve a period of notice which the management declined. Instead of reiterating Muir&#x27;s decision, the management informed the band and the public that Muir had sustained an onstage injury caused by a gong landing on his foot.
With Muir gone, the remaining members reconvened in January 1974 to produce &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;, released in March 1974, which earned them a positive &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review. Though most of the album was recorded live during the band&#x27;s late 1973 tour, the recordings were carefully edited and overdubbed to sound like a studio record, with &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot;, &quot;Lament&quot; and the second half of &quot;The Night Watch&quot; the only tracks recorded entirely in the studio. The album reached No. 28 in the UK and No. 64 in the US.

Following the album&#x27;s release, the band began to divide once more, this time over performance. Musically, Fripp found himself positioned between Bruford and Wetton, who played with such force and increasing volume that Fripp once compared them to &quot;a flying brick wall&quot;, and Cross, whose amplified acoustic violin was consistently being drowned out by the rhythm section, leading him to concentrate more on Mellotron and an overdriven electric piano. An increasingly frustrated Cross began to withdraw both musically and personally, with the result being that he was voted out of the group following the band&#x27;s 1974 tour of Europe and America.
In July 1974, Fripp, Bruford, and Wetton began recording &quot;Red&quot;. Before recording began, Fripp, now increasingly disillusioned with the music industry, turned his attention to the works of English mystic J.G. Bennett and had a spiritual experience in which &quot;the top of my head blew off&quot;. Most of the album had been developed during live improvisations before Fripp retreated into himself and &quot;withdrew his opinion&quot;, leaving Bruford and Wetton to direct the recording sessions. The album contains one live track, &quot;Providence&quot;, recorded on 30 June 1974 with Cross playing violin. Several guest musicians (including former members Ian McDonald and Mel Collins) contributed to the album. Released on 6 October 1974, &quot;Red&quot; went to No. 45 in the UK and No. 66 in the US. AllMusic called it &quot;an impressive achievement&quot; for a group about to disband, with &quot;intensely dynamic&quot; musical chemistry between the band members.

Two months before the release of &quot;Red&quot;, King Crimson&#x27;s future looked bright (with talks regarding founder member Ian McDonald rejoining the group). However, Fripp wished not to tour as he felt increasingly disenchanted by the group and the music industry. He also felt the world was going to drastically change by 1981 and that he had to prepare for it. Despite a band meeting while touring the US in which Fripp expressed a desire to end the band, the group did not formally disband until 25 September 1974 and later Fripp announced that King Crimson had &quot;ceased to exist&quot; and was &quot;completely over for ever and ever&quot;. It was later revealed that Fripp had attempted to replace himself with McDonald and Steve Hackett of Genesis, but this idea was rejected by the managers.

Following the band&#x27;s disbanding, the live album &quot;USA&quot; was released in May 1975, formed of recordings from their 1974 North American tour. It received some positive reviews, including &quot;a must&quot; for fans of the band and &quot;insanity you&#x27;re better off having&quot;. Issues with the tapes rendered some of Cross&#x27; playing inaudible, so Eddie Jobson of Roxy Music was hired to perform violin and keyboard overdubs in a studio; further edits were also made to allow the music to fit on a single LP. More live recordings from the 1972–1974 era would be issued as &quot;The Night Watch&quot; in 1997, and as part of the box sets &quot;The Great Deceiver&quot; (1992), &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic (1972–1973)&quot; (2012), &quot;The Road to Red (1974)&quot;, and &quot;Starless (1973–1974)&quot; (both 2014). Between 1975 and 1981, King Crimson were completely inactive.

=== 1981–1984: &quot;Discipline&quot;, &quot;Beat&quot;, &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; and second hiatus ===

In the late autumn of 1980, having spent several years on spiritual pursuits and then gradually returning to music (playing guitar for David Bowie, Peter Gabriel and Daryl Hall, pursuing an experimental solo career, leading instrumental new wave band The League of Gentlemen), Fripp decided to form a new &quot;first division&quot; rock group, but had no intentions of it being King Crimson.

Having recruited Bill Bruford as drummer, Fripp asked singer and guitarist Adrian Belew to join, the first time Fripp would actively seek collaboration with another guitarist in a band and therefore indicative of Fripp&#x27;s desire to create something unlike any of his previous work. After touring with Talking Heads, Belew agreed to join and also become the band&#x27;s lyricist. Bruford&#x27;s suggestion of his bassist Jeff Berlin was rejected as Fripp thought his playing was &quot;too busy&quot;, so auditions were held in New York: on the third day, Fripp left after roughly three auditions, only to return several hours later with Tony Levin (who got the job after playing a single chorus of &quot;Red&quot;). Fripp later confessed that, had he known that Levin (whom Fripp had played with in Peter Gabriel&#x27;s group) was available and interested, he would have selected him without holding auditions. Fripp named the new quartet Discipline, and they went to England to rehearse and write new material. They made their live debut at Moles Club in Bath, Somerset on 30 April 1981, and completed a short tour supported by the Lounge Lizards. By October 1981, the band had opted to change their name to King Crimson.

In 1981, King Crimson recorded &quot;Discipline&quot; with producer Rhett Davies who had previously worked with Belew on Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Remain in Light&quot; and with Fripp on Brian Eno&#x27;s &quot;Another Green World&quot; and &quot;Before and After Science&quot;. The album displayed a very different version of the band, with newer influences including post-punk, new wave, funk, minimalism, pointillism, world music and African percussion. With a sound described in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; as having a &quot;jaw-dropping technique&quot; of &quot;knottily rhythmic, harmonically demanding workouts&quot;. The title track &quot;Discipline&quot; was described as a postminimalist rock song. Fripp intended to create the sound of a &quot;rock gamelan&quot;, with an interlocking rhythmic quality to the paired guitars that he found similar to Indonesian gamelan ensembles. Fripp concentrated on playing complex picked arpeggios, while Belew provided an arsenal of guitar sounds that &quot;often mimic animal noises&quot;. In addition to bass guitar, Levin used the Chapman Stick, a ten-string two-handed tapping, hybrid guitar and bass instrument which he played in an &quot;utterly original style&quot;. Bruford experimented with cymbal-less acoustic kits and a Simmons SDS-V electronic drum kit. The band&#x27;s songs were shorter in comparison to previous King Crimson albums, and very much shaped by Belew&#x27;s pop sensibilities and quirky approach to writing lyrics. Though the band&#x27;s previous taste for improvisation was now tightly reined in, one instrumental (&quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;) emerged from group rehearsals; while the noisy, half-spoken/half-shouted &quot;Indiscipline&quot; was a partially written, part-improvised piece created in order to give Bruford a chance to escape from the strict rhythmic demands of the rest of the album. Released in September 1981, &quot;Discipline&quot; reached No. 41 in the UK and No. 45 in the US.

In June 1982, King Crimson followed &quot;Discipline&quot; with &quot;Beat&quot;, the first King Crimson album recorded with the same band lineup as the album preceding it. &quot;Beat&quot; is the only album where Fripp had no involvement in the original mixing; Davies and Belew undertook production duties. The album had a linked theme of the Beat Generation and its writings, reflected in song titles such as &quot;Neal and Jack and Me&quot; (inspired by Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac), &quot;Heartbeat&quot; (inspired by Carolyn Cassady&#x27;s &quot;Heart Beat: My Life with Jack and Neal&quot;), &quot;The Howler&quot; (inspired by Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Howl&quot;) and &quot;Waiting Man&quot; (inspired by William Burroughs). The album contained themes of life on the road, existential angst and romanticism. While &quot;Beat&quot; was more accessible, it had the improvised &quot;Requiem&quot;, which featured Frippertronics, a guitar technique invented by Brian Eno and Robert Fripp using a tape loop system.

Recording &quot;Beat&quot; was faced with tension with Belew suffering high stress levels over his duties as front man, lead singer, and principal songwriter. On one occasion, he clashed with Fripp and ordered him out of the studio. As &quot;Beat&quot; reached No. 39 in the UK and No. 52 in the US, King Crimson resumed touring. &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was released as a single which peaked at No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. Around this time the band released the VHS &quot;The Noise: Live in Frejus&quot;, a document of a show played at the Arena, Frejus, France on 27 August 1982, co-headlining with Roxy Music (whose set from the same show was also released on VHS as &quot;The High Road&quot;). The VHS was later re-released as part of the &quot;Neal and Jack and Me&quot; DVD in 2004.

King Crimson&#x27;s next album, &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;, was recorded in 1983 and released in March 1984. Having encountered difficulty in both writing and determining a direction for the album, the band chose to record and call the album&#x27;s first half a &quot;left side&quot; – four of the band&#x27;s poppier songs plus an instrumental – and the second half a &quot;right side&quot; – experimental work, improvisations that drew influence from industrial music, plus the third part of the &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; series of compositions. The stress during the writing process and the tension between the band members manifested in both lyrical content and music, and the result is a &quot;nerve-racking&quot; album. The 2001 remaster of the album included the &quot;other side&quot;, a collection of remixes and improvisational out-takes plus Levin&#x27;s humorous song, &quot;The King Crimson Barbershop&quot;. &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; peaked at No. 30 in the UK and No. 58 in the US, with &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; and &quot;Sleepless&quot; being released as singles. A VHS document of the &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; tour, &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair: Live in Japan&quot;, was released later in 1984 (and later also included on the &quot;Neal and Jack and Me&quot; DVD). The last concert of the &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; tour, at the Spectrum in Montreal, Canada on 11 July 1984, was recorded and released in 1998 as &quot;Absent Lovers: Live in Montreal&quot;. Further live recordings of the 1980s band would be released in 2016 as part of the &quot;On (and off) The Road (1981–1984)&quot; box set. Despite their conflict, the musicians remained professional on stage.
Following the 1984 tour, Fripp dissolved King Crimson for the second time, exactly ten years after dissolving the previous group. Bruford and Belew expressed some frustration over this; Belew recalled the first he had heard of the split was when he read about it in a report in &quot;Musician&quot; magazine.

=== 1994–1999: The Double Trio, &quot;Vrooom&quot;, &quot;THRAK&quot; and the ProjeKcts ===
In the summer of 1991, Belew met with Fripp in England to express an interest in reviving King Crimson. One year later, Fripp established his Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) record label with producer David Singleton. Subsequently, DGM would be the primary home for Fripp&#x27;s work, with larger album releases distributed to bigger record companies (initially Virgin records), and smaller releases handled by DGM. This afforded Fripp and his associates greater creative freedom and more control over all aspects of their work.

In late 1991, Fripp asked former Japan singer David Sylvian to join the new King Crimson band, but Sylvian declined the offer, though the two collaborated as Sylvian/Fripp. In June 1993, Fripp began to assemble a larger version of the band, joined by Belew and Levin from the 1980s quartet, Chapman Stick player Trey Gunn (a veteran of Fripp&#x27;s Guitar Craft courses) and drummer Jerry Marotta, with whom Fripp had played with Peter Gabriel. After Sylvian/Fripp&#x27;s closing concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in December 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fripp/sylvian&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a tour that Marotta didn&#x27;t participate in, Fripp decided to ask the tour&#x27;s drummer Pat Mastelotto, formerly of Mr. Mister, to join instead of Marotta. Bruford wound up being the last of the 1980s group to return to the band. Fripp explained that he had a vision of a &quot;Double Trio&quot; with two drummers while driving along the Chalke Valley one afternoon in 1992. Bruford later said he lobbied Fripp last minute because he believed that Crimson was very much &quot;his gig&quot;, and that Fripp had come up with a philosophical explanation for utilizing both Mastelotto and himself later. One of the conditions Fripp imposed upon Bruford if he were to return was to give up all creative control to Fripp.

Following rehearsals in Woodstock, New York, the group released the EP &quot;Vrooom&quot; in October 1994. This revealed the new King Crimson sound, which featured the interlocking guitars of the 1980s mixed with the layered, heavier feel of the 1970s period. There was also a vague influence from the industrial music of that time. Many of the songs were written or finalised by Belew, and displayed stronger elements of 1960s pop than before; in particular, a Beatles influence. Bruford would refer to the band as sounding like &quot;a dissonant Shadows on steroids&quot;. As with previous lineups, new technology was utilised, including MIDI (extensively used as an effects filter by Belew and Gunn, and which Fripp used to replace Frippertronics with an upgraded digital version of itself called &quot;Soundscapes&quot;) and the versatile Warr tap guitar with which Gunn replaced his Stick in 1995. King Crimson toured the album from 28 September 1994 in Buenos Aires, Argentina; portions of these concerts were released on the double live CD set &quot;B&#x27;Boom: Live in Argentina&quot; in 1995.

In October and December 1994, King Crimson recorded their eleventh studio album, &quot;THRAK&quot;. Formed mostly of revised versions of the tracks from &quot;Vrooom&quot;, plus new tracks, the album was described by &quot;Q&quot; magazine as having &quot;jazz-scented rock structures, characterised by noisy, angular, exquisite guitar interplay&quot; and an &quot;athletic, ever-inventive rhythm section,&quot; while being in tune with the sound of alternative rock of the mid-1990s. Examples of the band&#x27;s efforts to integrate their multiple elements could be heard on the accessible (but complex) songs &quot;Dinosaur&quot; and &quot;Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream&quot;, the more straightforward ballad &quot;One Time&quot;, as well as &quot;Radio I&quot; and &quot;Radio II&quot;- a pair of Fripp&#x27;s Soundscapes instrumentals.

King Crimson resumed touring in 1995 and into 1996; dates from October and November 1995 were recorded and released on the live album &quot;THRaKaTTaK&quot; in May 1996, which is an hour of improvised music integrating sections from performances from the &quot;THRAK&quot; tour in the United States and Japan, mixed and arranged by Fripp&#x27;s DGM partner, engineer David Singleton. A more conventional live recording from the period was later made available as the double CD release &quot;Vrooom Vrooom&quot; (2001), while a full 1995 concert was released on VHS in 1996 as &quot;Live in Japan&quot; and re-released on DVD in 1999 as &quot;Déjà Vrooom&quot;. The double trio would be further honored by the &quot;THRAK (1994–1997)&quot; box set in 2015.

Writing rehearsals began in May 1997 in Nashville, Tennessee. Fripp was dissatisfied with the quality of the new music being developed by the band; Longstanding friction and disagreements between himself and Bruford led to the latter deciding to leave King Crimson for good. The resulting bad atmosphere and the lack of workable material almost broke the band up altogether. Instead, the six members opted to work in four smaller groups (or &quot;fraKctalisations&quot;, as Fripp called them) known as ProjeKcts. This enabled the group to continue developing ideas and searching for a new direction without the practical difficulty (and expense) of convening all six musicians at once. From 1997 to 1999, the first four ProjeKcts played live in the United States and the United Kingdom, and released recordings that showed a high degree of free improvisation, with influences ranging from jazz, industrial, techno and drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass. These have been collectively described by music critic J. D. Considine as &quot;frequently astonishing&quot; but lacking in melody. After Bruford had played four dates with Projekct One in December 1997, he left King Crimson to resume working with his own jazz group Earthworks.

=== 1999–2003: The Double Duo, &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot; and &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; ===
In October 1999, King Crimson reconvened. Tony Levin was busy working as a session musician and decided to take a hiatus from the group, so the remaining members (Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto) formed the &quot;Double Duo&quot; to write and record &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot; in Belew&#x27;s basement studio and garage near Nashville. Fripp was inspired by Tool&#x27;s album &quot;Undertow&quot; during the writing process of &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot;. Released in May 2000, the album reached No. 129 in the UK. Most of the pieces were metallic, harsh and industrial in sound. They featured a distinct electronic texture, a heavily processed electric drum sound from Mastelotto, Gunn taking over the bass role on Warr Guitar, and a different take on the interlocking guitar sound that the band had pioneered in the 1980s. With the exception of an industrial blues (sung by Belew through a voice changer under the pseudonym of &quot;Hooter J. Johnson&quot;), the songs were dense and complex. The album contains the fourth installment of &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;. It received a negative reception for lacking new ideas. The band recorded an album of improvised instrumentals at the same time, and released them under the name ProjeKct X, on the CD &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot;.

King Crimson toured to support both albums, including double bill shows with Tool. The tour was documented on the live album &quot;Heavy ConstruKction&quot; in 2000 and the &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth (1997–2008)&quot; box set in 2019. Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones and his band supported Crimson on some live shows.

On 9 November 2001, King Crimson released a limited edition live EP called &quot;Level Five&quot;, featuring three new pieces: &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot;, &quot;Level Five&quot; and &quot;Virtuous Circle&quot;, plus versions of &quot;The Construkction of Light&quot; and ProjeKct&#x27;s &quot;The Deception of the Thrush&quot;, followed by an unlisted track called &quot;ProjeKct 12th and X&quot; after one minute of silence. A second EP followed in October 2002, &quot;Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With&quot;. This featured eleven tracks (including a live version of &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic, Part IV&quot;). Half of the tracks were processed vocal snippets by Belew, and the songs themselves varied between Soundscapes, gamelan, heavy metal and blues.

The double duo lineup released King Crimson&#x27;s thirteenth album, &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;, in March 2003. Fripp described it as &quot;the culmination of three years of Crimsonising&quot;. The album incorporated, reworked and retitled versions of &quot;Deception of the Thrush&quot; (&quot;The Power to Believe III&quot;); tracks from their previous two EPs; and an extract from a Fripp Soundscape with added instrumentation and vocals. &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; reached No. 162 in the UK and No. 150 in the US. King Crimson toured in 2003 to support the album; recordings from it were used for the live album &quot;&quot;. 2003 also saw the release of the DVD &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s shows Live at the Shepherds Bush Empire (London, 3 July 2000) and Live in Japan (Tokyo, 16 April 2003).

In November 2003, Gunn left the group to pursue solo projects and was replaced by the returning Tony Levin. The band reconvened in early 2004 for rehearsals, but nothing developed from these sessions. They went on another hiatus. At this point, Fripp was publicly reassessing his desire to work within the music industry, often citing the unsympathetic aspects of the life of a touring musician, such as &quot;the illusion of intimacy with celebrities&quot;.

On 21 September 2006, former King Crimson member Boz Burrell died of a heart attack, followed by another former member, Ian Wallace, who died of esophageal cancer on 22 February 2007.

===2008: 40th Anniversary tour and third hiatus ===
A new King Crimson formation was announced in 2007: Fripp, Belew, Levin, Mastelotto, and a new second drummer, Gavin Harrison. In August 2008, after a period of rehearsals, the five completed the band&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Tour. The setlists featured no new material, drawing instead from the existing mid &#x27;70s era/&quot;Discipline&quot;-era/Double Trio/Double Duo repertoire. Additional shows were planned for 2009, but were cancelled due to scheduling clashes with Belew.

King Crimson began another hiatus after the 40th Anniversary Tour. Belew continued to lobby for reviving the band, and discussed it with Fripp several times in 2009 and 2010. Among Belew&#x27;s suggestions was a temporary reunion of the 1980s line-up for a thirtieth anniversary tour: an idea declined by both Fripp and Bruford, the latter commenting &quot;I would be highly unlikely to try to recreate the same thing, a mission I fear destined to failure.&quot; In December 2010, Fripp wrote that the King Crimson &quot;switch&quot; had been set to &quot;off&quot; since October 2008, citing several reasons for this decision.

In August 2012, Fripp announced his retirement from the music industry, leaving the future of King Crimson uncertain.

=== 2014–2021: The Seven-Headed Beast and Three Over Five lineups ===
Prior to Fripp&#x27;s retirement announcement, a band called Jakszyk, Fripp and Collins (and subtitled &quot;A King Crimson ProjeKct&quot;) had released an album called &quot;A Scarcity of Miracles&quot; in 2011. The band featured guitarist and singer Jakko Jakszyk (who&#x27;d previously performed King Crimson material with 21st Century Schizoid Band), Fripp and former Crimson saxophonist Mel Collins as the main players/composers, with Tony Levin playing bass and Gavin Harrison playing drums. At one point, Fripp referred to the band as &quot;P7&quot; (ProjeKct Seven). Unusually for a ProjeKct, it was based around &quot;finely crafted&quot; and &quot;mid-paced&quot; original songs derived from improvised sessions.

In September 2013, Fripp announced King Crimson&#x27;s return to activity with a &quot;very different reformation to what has gone before: seven players, four English and three American, with three drummers&quot;. He cited several reasons to make a comeback, varying from the practical to the whimsical: &quot;I was becoming too happy. Time for a pointed stick.&quot; The new line-up drew from both the previous lineup (retaining Fripp, Levin, Harrison and Mastelotto) and the &quot;Scarcity of Miracles&quot; project (Jakszyk and Collins), with Guitar Craft alumnus and former R.E.M./Ministry drummer Bill Rieflin as the seventh member. Adrian Belew was not asked to take part, thus ending his 32-year tenure in King Crimson: Jakszyk took his place as singer and second guitarist. This version of the group took on the nickname of &quot;the Seven-Headed Beast&quot;.

This drastically revamped King Crimson had no plans to record in the studio, focussing instead on playing &quot;reconfigured&quot; versions of past material in live concerts. Looking back later at this King Crimson phase, Tony Levin would comment &quot;we were instructed/advised by Robert Fripp to look at the older classic King Crimson material as if we had written it. And so we did that with a lot of older material that the band had done before the &#x27;80s. We didn&#x27;t actually cover that much of the &#x27;80s material outside of a few songs.&quot;

For the most part, this approach would remain consistent for the remainder of the band&#x27;s lifetime. In early 2014, and for the first time since 1974, the band&#x27;s repertoire included songs from the run of albums between &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; and &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; as well as reviving song material from &quot;Red&quot;. No Adrian Belew-era songs were included in the setlist, although some instrumentals from the period were played (including items from &quot;THRAK&quot; and &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;). Some material from &quot;A Scarcity of Miracles&quot; (the title track, plus &quot;The Light of Day&quot;) was also incorporated into the band&#x27;s repertoire.

After rehearsing in England, King Crimson toured North America from 9 September to 6 October. Recordings from the Los Angeles dates were released as &quot;Live at the Orpheum&quot;: this included new King Crimson instrumental music in the shape of &quot;Banshee Legs Bell Hassle&quot; and &quot;Walk On: Monk Morph Chamber Music&quot;.

Tours across Europe, Canada, and Japan followed in the later half of 2015. Brand-new songs mainly written by Fripp and Jakszyk were debuted at the concerts, as well as drum showcases. A live recording from the Canadian leg of the tour was released at the end of February 2016 as &quot;Live In Toronto&quot;, which included new songs &quot;Radical Action (To Unseat the Hold of Monkey Mind)&quot; and &quot;Meltdown&quot;. A European tour was planned for 2016. Following Rieflin&#x27;s decision to take a break from music, drummer Jeremy Stacey of Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds was called in place for dates from September.

A further live album, &quot;Radical Action to Unseat the Hold of Monkey Mind&quot;, was released in September 2016, drawing from 2015 concert dates of Japan, Canada and France preceding Rieflin&#x27;s departure and Stacey&#x27;s arrival. A 4-disc set aimed at documenting the band&#x27;s shuffling and evolving live setlist, it included one performance of every song the band presented onstage during the tour, and concert footage mostly recorded in Takamatsu, on 19 December 2015.

On 7 December 2016, founding King Crimson member Greg Lake died of cancer. Another former King Crimson member, John Wetton, died of colon cancer on 31 January 2017.

On 3 January 2017, Bill Rieflin returned to King Crimson. Since the band wished to retain Jeremy Stacey, King Crimson became an octet with four drummers, which Fripp initially referred to as the &quot;Double Quartet Formation&quot;. Later on, Rieflin shifted his group role and became King Crimson&#x27;s first full-time keyboard player, with Fripp rechristening the lineup the &quot;Three Over Five&quot; (or &quot;Five Over Three&quot;) Formation.

On 2 June 2017, King Crimson released a new live EP named &quot;Heroes&quot;, featuring a cover of the David Bowie song of the same name. The EP was intended as a tribute to Bowie, for whom Fripp had provided distinctive guitar work on the albums &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977) and &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980). The video to King Crimson&#x27;s version of &quot;Heroes&quot; won &quot;Video of the Year&quot; at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. Shortly afterwards, King Crimson embarked on the first leg of a North American tour, from 11 June until 19 July. On 3 September, Robert Fripp said that his differences with Adrian Belew had been resolved and that there were &quot;no current plans for (him) to come out with the current formation&quot; but &quot;the doors to the future are open.&quot; Belew confirmed this, adding &quot;it means I may be back in the band in the future at some point.&quot;

On 14 October 2017, King Crimson released another contemporary live album, &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;, recorded on tour in June of the same year. As had been the case with its two predecessors, it included new music in the absence of a new studio album (in this case &quot;Bellscape &amp; Orchestral Werning&quot;, &quot;The Errors&quot; and &quot;Interlude&quot;). It also documented the return to the live set of material from the long-neglected 1970 album &quot;Lizard&quot; (in the form of &quot;Cirkus&quot;, which the band had begun adding to their sets in 2016, and the second half of the title suite), as well as new arrangements of some Belew-era songs.

On 13 October 2017, it was announced that Bill Rieflin would be unable to join the Three Over Five Formation on the 2017 Autumn tour in the U.S. He was temporarily replaced by Seattle-based Crafty Guitarist Chris Gibson. During 2018, King Crimson performed the extensive 33-date Uncertain Times tour through the UK and Europe between 13 June and 16 November.

Although the band continued their &quot;no new studio album&quot; policy, April 2018 saw the full release of another live album, &quot;Live in Vienna&quot;, presenting the complete concert in Vienna on 1 December 2016. The album was originally scheduled for worldwide release in 2017, but was postponed in lieu of &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;; however, it was only released in Japan in September 2017, with a bonus disc with recordings from the band&#x27;s tour there in December 2015. The worlwide release added a performance of &quot;Fracture&quot;, plus three pieces drawn from the nightly Fripp-composed introductory soundscapes with improvisations by Collins and Levin: these pieces were arranged and realised by David Singleton, reflecting similar work he&#x27;d performed for &quot; THRaKaTTaK&quot; twenty years earlier. On 20 October 2018, a further live album/video was released, &quot;&quot;, recorded during dates in July 2017.

On 6 April 2019, it was announced at a press conference that Rieflin would take another break from King Crimson to attend to family matters, his place on keyboards for the 2019 50th anniversary tour taken by Theo Travis, better known as a saxophonist, Soft Machine member and occasional duo collaborator with Robert Fripp. Although Travis joined the band for rehearsals, Fripp said on 2 May that the band had decided that it was no longer possible to have other musicians deputising for Rieflin and for this reason were &quot;proceed(ing) as a Seven-Headed Beast&quot; without Travis. Rieflin&#x27;s parts were divided among other band members, with Fripp, Stacey, Jakszyk and Collins adding keyboards to their on-stage rigs, and Levin once again using the synthesizer he used during the &#x27;80s tours. Soon after on 11 June, King Crimson&#x27;s entire discography was made available to stream online on all the major streaming platforms, as part of the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration.

On 24 March 2020, Bill Rieflin died of cancer. In the same year, King Crimson collaborator Keith Tippett died after several years of illness on 14 June, and former bassist and singer Gordon Haskell died from lung cancer on 15 October.

King Crimson toured North America and then Japan in 2021. Recordings from dates on the American leg of the tour were released as the &quot;official bootleg&quot; live album &quot;Music Is Our Friend: Live in Washington and Albany&quot;, featuring music from across the band&#x27;s lifetime plus two new Tony Levin cadenzas.

=== 2022: &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; documentary and end of band activity ===
Following the 2021 tour dates, King Crimson ceased activity, although without expressly announcing a breakup. Reasons cited were practical ones involving the old age of several of the members plus the rising cost of services during the pandemic, with no band intentions for any more tours.

In August 2021, Jakszyk referred to the existence of &quot;about forty to fifty minutes&#x27; worth of new (King Crimson) stuff, a number of songs I&#x27;ve co-written with Robert and some instrumental things he&#x27;s written. During the lockdown Gavin suggested, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we record these things so we&#x27;ve at least got studio recordings of this material?&#x27; That doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re going to make a new album or it&#x27;s ever gonna come out, but we have started this process.&quot; Versions of two Fripp/Jakszyk songs originally intended for King Crimson (&quot;Uncertain Times&quot; and &quot;Separation&quot;) had already emerged on Jakszyk&#x27;s 2020 solo album &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot;, with participation from Fripp, Harrison, Levin and Collins.

On 9 February 2022, founding King Crimson member Ian McDonald died of cancer.

In March 2022, the documentary film &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; was premiered at the 2022 SXSW Film Festival. Directed by Toby Amies and filmed between 2019 and 2021, it covered live and backstage activity by the then-current band but also featured a historical overview plus contributions from Crimson alumni Ian McDonald, Michael Giles, Bill Bruford, Adrian Belew and Trey Gunn (as well as prolonged interview footage with the late Bill Rieflin). Amies described the film&#x27;s development as follows: &quot;What began as a traditional documentary about the legendary band King Crimson as it turned fifty, mutated into an exploration of time, death, family, and the transcendent power of music to change lives; but with jokes.&quot;

As of 2022, with the exception of archive/curatorial matters, King Crimson have ceased activity altogether, with no plans for the future. Levin said in a late 2022 interview that, &quot;the sense I got from Robert [Fripp] was that it&#x27;s over. Maybe King Crimson will speak to him in the future in some way, and will revive its head with who-knows-what line up?&quot;

At a post-screening Q&amp;A session for &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;, Fripp referred to the seven-member 2021 lineup of King Crimson as &quot;the final incarnation&quot; of the band. Asked if there could ever be a lineup that did not include him, he disagreed, stating &quot;I see the whole. I see the music. I see the musicians. I see the audience and I see the music industry [...] and you have to engage with all of that to have the overview. So that&#x27;s the quick answer&quot;.

== Musical style ==

King Crimson have been described musically as progressive rock, art rock, and post-progressive, with their earlier works being described as proto-prog. Their music was initially grounded in the rock of the 1960s, especially the acid rock and psychedelic rock movements. The band played Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Get Thy Bearings&quot; in concert, and were known to play the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; in their rehearsals. However, for their own compositions, King Crimson (unlike the rock bands that had come before them) largely stripped away the blues-based foundations of rock music and replaced them with influences derived from classical composers. The first incarnation of King Crimson played the &quot;Mars&quot; section of Gustav Holst&#x27;s suite &quot;The Planets&quot; live and later the band used &quot;Mars&quot; as a foundation for the song &quot;Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;. As a result of this influence, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; is frequently viewed as the nominal starting point of the progressive rock movements. King Crimson also initially displayed strong jazz influences, especially on its signature track &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;. The band also drew on English folk music for compositions such as &quot;Moonchild&quot; and &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot;. In the 1972 lineup, Fripp&#x27;s intention was to combine the music of Jimi Hendrix, Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók.

The 1981 reunion of the band brought in even more elements, displaying the influence of funk, post-punk, new wave, gamelan music and late 20th century classical composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. For its 1994 reunion, King Crimson reassessed both the mid-1970s and 1980s approaches in the light of new technology, intervening music forms such as electronica, drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass and techno; and further developments in industrial music, as well as expanding the band&#x27;s ambient textural content via Fripp&#x27;s Soundscapes looping approach.

The 2013 version of the band returned, for the most part, to the band&#x27;s 1960s and 1970s influences and repertoire but addressed them via current technology and rearrangements suited to a larger ensemble of more experienced musicians, while also incorporating the New Standard Tuning used by Fripp since 1984.

=== Compositional approaches ===

Several King Crimson compositional approaches remained constant throughout the band&#x27;s lifetime. These included:

* The use of a gradually building rhythmic motif. These include &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot; (an adaptation and variation on the Gustav Holst piece &quot;Mars&quot; played by the original King Crimson, based on a complex pulse in time over which a skirling melody is played on a Mellotron), 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Talking Drum&quot; (from &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;), 1984&#x27;s &quot;Industry&quot; (from &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;) and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; (from &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;).
* An instrumental piece (often embedded as a break in a song) in which the band played an ensemble passage of considerable rhythmic and polyrhythmic complexity. An early example is the band&#x27;s initial signature tune &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, but the &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; series of compositions (as well as pieces of similar intent such as &quot;THRAK&quot; and &quot;Level Five&quot;) went deeper into polyrhythmic complexity, delving into rhythms that wander into and out of general synchronisation with each other, but with all &#x27;finishing&#x27; together through polyrhythmic synchronisation. These polyrhythms were particularly abundant in the band&#x27;s 1980s work, which contained gamelan-like rhythmic layers and continual overlaid staccato patterns in counterpoint.
*The composition of difficult solo passages for individual instruments, such as the guitar break on &quot;Fracture&quot; on &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot;.
*The juxtaposition of ornate tunes and ballads with unusual, often dissonant noises (such as &quot;Cirkus&quot; from &quot;Lizard&quot;, &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; from &quot;Islands&quot; and &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; from &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;).
*The use of improvisation.
*Ascending note structure (e.g. &quot;Facts of Life&quot; and &quot;THRAK&quot;).

=== Improvisation ===
King Crimson incorporated improvisation into their performances and studio recordings from the beginning, some of which was embedded into pieces such as &quot;Moonchild&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Requiem&quot; and &quot;No Warning&quot;, including passages of restrained silence, as with Bill Bruford&#x27;s contribution to the improvised &quot;Trio&quot;. Rather than using the standard jazz or rock &quot;jamming&quot; format for improvisation (in which one soloist at a time takes centre stage while the rest of the band lies back and plays along with established rhythm and chord changes), King Crimson improvisation consisted of musicians collectively making creative decisions and contributions as the music is being played. Individual soloing was largely eschewed; each musician was to listen to each other and to the group sound, to be able to react creatively within the group dynamic. Fripp has used the metaphor of &quot;magic&quot; to describe this process, in particular when the method works particularly well.

Similarly, King Crimson&#x27;s improvised music was varied in sound and the band has been able to release several box sets and albums consisting mostly or entirely of improvised music, such as the &quot;THRaKaTTaK&quot; album, and the band&#x27;s series of ProjeKcts. Occasionally, particular improvised pieces were recalled and reworked in different forms at different shows, becoming more and more refined and eventually appearing on official studio releases.

== Influence and legacy ==
King Crimson have been influential both on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and numerous contemporary artists. Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band&#x27;s usage of the mellotron, and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Bruford in Yes; Lake in Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer; McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in U.K. and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush&#x27;s drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles as an influence on his own approach to percussion.

King Crimson&#x27;s influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album &quot;Red&quot; had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album &quot;In Utero&quot;. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: &quot;Now you know who we ripped off. Just don&#x27;t tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.&quot; Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including MGMT, the Mars Volta, Primus, Black Country, New Road, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practiced together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson&#x27;s back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; entitled &quot;Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn&quot;. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; on their single &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot; and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name on Crimson&#x27;s debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences.

King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Dream Theater, Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula&#x27;s Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson&#x27;s influence.

Other artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.

&quot;Golden Wind&quot;, the fifth part of the Japanese manga and anime franchise &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, has its main antagonist, Diavolo, possess a Stand known as King Crimson.

== Related legacy/cover bands featuring former King Crimson members ==

Since the early 2000s, several bands containing former, recent or current King Crimson members have toured and recorded, performing King Crimson music.

Active between 2002 and 2005, the 21st Century Schizoid Band reunited several former King Crimson members who had played on the band&#x27;s first four albums. The band featured Ian McDonald, Mel Collins, Peter Giles and Michael Giles (the latter subsequently replaced by Ian Wallace), and was fronted by Jakko Jakszyk, a decade prior to his own recruitment into King Crimson. The band engaged in several tours, played material from King Crimson&#x27;s &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s catalogue, and recorded several live albums. The band disbanded upon Wallace&#x27;s death in 2007.

Since 2007, Tony Levin has led the trio Stick Men, which also features Pat Mastelotto. The band was initially completed by Chapman Stick player Michael Bernier, replaced in 2010 by touch guitarist and former Fripp student Markus Reuter. This band includes (and reinterprets) King Crimson compositions in their live sets. Reuter and Mastelotto also play together as a duo (previously called &quot;Tuner&quot;), within which they have been known to rework the mid-1980s King Crimson instrumental &quot;Industry&quot; live. Starting in 2023, Reuter, Mastelotto and Trey Gunn revived the moniker &quot;Tuner&quot; (re-styled as &quot;Tu-ner&quot;) to perform music from the Double Duo era of King Crimson, plus material from each of their respective solo and combined careers.

Between 2011 and 2014, Stick Men and Adrian Belew&#x27;s Power Trio band (Belew plus drummer Tobias Ralph and bass player Julie Slick) joined forces to play and tour as The Crimson ProjeKCt, covering the music made during the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. Following the return of King Crimson in 2014, the Crimson ProjeKct name has been formally abandoned, but the Stick Men and the Power Trio have still performed together from time to time, usually under names like &quot;Belew, Levin, Mastelotto and friends&quot;.

During his solo career, including performances with the Power Trio, Adrian Belew has performed various versions of King Crimson songs.

In March 2024, a new group performing the 1980s King Crimson repertoire was announced: this featured former members Adrian Belew and Tony Levin along with guitarist Steve Vai and drummer Danny Carey. Fripp and Bruford had both declined offers to join, but gave their blessings to the group. Fripp also suggested the eventual project name, &quot;Beat&quot; (after the 1982 album of the same name). The band went on to tour the United States during the latter half of 2024.

<text>The kilogram (also spelled kilogramme) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI), having the unit symbol kg. The word &quot;kilogram&quot; is formed from the combination of the metric prefix kilo- (meaning one thousand) and gram; it is colloquially shortened to &quot;kilo&quot; (plural &quot;kilos&quot;).

The kilogram is an SI base unit, defined ultimately in terms of three defining constants of the SI, namely a specific transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, the speed of light, and the Planck constant. A properly equipped metrology laboratory can calibrate a mass measurement instrument such as a Kibble balance as a primary standard for the kilogram mass.

The kilogram was originally defined in 1795 during the French Revolution as the mass of one litre of water. The current definition of a kilogram agrees with this original definition to within 30 parts per million. In 1799, the platinum &quot;Kilogramme des Archives&quot; replaced it as the standard of mass. In 1889, a cylinder composed of platinum–iridium, the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system and remained so for 130 years, before the current standard was adopted in 2019.

== Definition ==
The kilogram is defined in terms of three defining constants: 
* a specific atomic transition frequency , which defines the duration of the second,
* the speed of light , which when combined with the second, defines the length of the metre,
* and the Planck constant , which when combined with the metre and second, defines the mass of the kilogram.
The formal definition according to the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) is:

Defined in term of those units, the kg is formulated as:


This definition is generally consistent with previous definitions: the mass remains within 30 ppm of the mass of one litre of water.

=== Timeline of previous definitions ===

* 1793: The grave (the precursor of the kilogram) was defined as the mass of 1 litre (dm3) of water, which was determined to be 18841 grains. 
* 1795: the gram (1/1000 of a kilogram) was provisionally defined as the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at the melting point of ice.
* 1799: The Kilogramme des Archives was manufactured as a prototype. It had a mass equal to the mass of 1 dm3 of water at the temperature of its maximum density, which is approximately 4 °C.
* 1875–1889: The Metre Convention was signed in 1875, leading to the production of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) in 1879 and its adoption in 1889.
* 2019: The kilogram was defined in terms of the Planck constant, the speed of light and hyperfine transition frequency of 133Cs as approved by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) on 16 November 2018.

== Name and terminology ==
The kilogram is the only base SI unit with an SI prefix (&quot;kilo&quot;) as part of its name. The word &quot;kilogramme&quot; or &quot;kilogram&quot; is derived from the French , which itself was a learned coinage, prefixing the Greek stem of &quot;a thousand&quot; to , a Late Latin term for &quot;a small weight&quot;, itself from Greek . 
The word was written into French law in 1795, in the &quot;Decree of 18 Germinal&quot;,
which revised the provisional system of units introduced by the French National Convention two years earlier, where the had been defined as weight () of a cubic centimetre of water, equal to 1/1000 of a . In the decree of 1795, the term thus replaced , and replaced .

The French spelling was adopted in Great Britain when the word was used for the first time in English in 1795, with the spelling &quot;kilogram&quot; being adopted in the United States. In the United Kingdom both spellings are used, with &quot;kilogram&quot; having become by far the more common. UK law regulating the units to be used when trading by weight or measure does not prevent the use of either spelling.

In the 19th century the French word , a shortening of , was imported into the English language where it has been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While &quot;kilo&quot; as an alternative is acceptable, to &quot;The Economist&quot; for example, the Canadian government&#x27;s Termium Plus system states that &quot;SI (International System of Units) usage, followed in scientific and technical writing&quot; does not allow its usage and it is described as &quot;a common informal name&quot; on Russ Rowlett&#x27;s Dictionary of Units of Measurement. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted the use of the word &quot;kilo&quot; as an alternative to the word &quot;kilogram&quot;, but in 1990 revoked the status of the word &quot;kilo&quot;.

The SI system was introduced in 1960 and in 1970 the BIPM started publishing the &quot;SI Brochure&quot;, which contains all relevant decisions and recommendations by the CGPM concerning units. The &quot;SI Brochure&quot; states that &quot;It is not permissible to use abbreviations for unit symbols or unit names ...&quot;.

For use with east Asian character sets, the SI symbol is encoded as a single Unicode character, in the CJK Compatibility block.

== Redefinition based on fundamental constants ==


The replacement of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) as the primary standard was motivated by evidence accumulated over a long period of time that the mass of the IPK and its replicas had been changing; the IPK had diverged from its replicas by approximately 50 micrograms since their manufacture late in the 19th century. This led to several competing efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to warrant replacing the kilogram artefact with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constants. 

The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) approved a revision in November 2018 that defines the kilogram by defining the Planck constant to be exactly , effectively defining the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. The new definition took effect on 20 May 2019.

Prior to the redefinition, the kilogram and several other SI units based on the kilogram were defined by a man-made metal artifact: the &quot;Kilogramme des Archives&quot; from 1799 to 1889, and the IPK from 1889 to 2019.

In 1960, the metre, previously similarly having been defined with reference to a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it, was redefined in terms of an invariant physical constant (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be independently reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification.

At the 94th Meeting of the CIPM in 2005, it was recommended that the same be done with the kilogram.

In October 2010, the CIPM voted to submit a resolution for consideration at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), to &quot;take note of an intention&quot; that the kilogram be defined in terms of the Planck constant, (which has dimensions of energy times time, thus mass × length / time) together with other physical constants. This resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the CGPM in October 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014. Although the Committee recognised that significant progress had been made, they concluded that the data did not yet appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition, and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting, scheduled for 2018. Such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of delineating the kilogram in terms of the Planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision, accuracy and stability. The Kibble balance is one way to do this.

As part of this project, a variety of very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. Some of these approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would enable the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, physical constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and that expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to physical constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass and therefore require precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories (gravimetry). All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.

== SI multiples ==
Because an SI unit may not have multiple prefixes (see SI prefix), prefixes are added to &quot;gram&quot;, rather than the base unit &quot;kilogram&quot;, which already has a prefix as part of its name. For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1mg (one milligram), not 1μkg (one microkilogram).


== Practical issues with SI weight names ==

* Serious medication errors have been made by confusing milligrams and micrograms when micrograms has been abbreviated. The abbreviation &quot;mcg&quot; rather than the SI symbol &quot;μg&quot; is formally mandated for medical practitioners in the US by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO). In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Scottish Palliative Care Guidelines state that &quot;micrograms&quot; and &quot;nanograms&quot; must both be written in full, and never abbreviated as &quot;mcg&quot; or &quot;μg&quot;.
* The hectogram (100 g) (Italian: &quot;ettogrammo&quot; or &quot;etto&quot;) is a very commonly used unit in the retail food trade in Italy.
* The former standard spelling and abbreviation &quot;deka-&quot; and &quot;dk&quot; produced abbreviations such as &quot;dkm&quot; (dekametre) and &quot;dkg&quot; (dekagram). the abbreviation &quot;dkg&quot; (10 g) is still used in parts of central Europe in retail for some foods such as cheese and meat.
* The unit name &quot;megagram&quot; is rarely used, and even then typically only in technical fields in contexts where especially rigorous consistency with the SI standard is desired. For most purposes, the name &quot;tonne&quot; is instead used. The tonne and its symbol, &quot;t&quot;, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879. It is a non-SI unit accepted by the BIPM for use with the SI. According to the BIPM, &quot;This unit is sometimes referred to as &#x27;metric ton&#x27; in some English-speaking countries.&quot;

<doc id="16622" wikidata="Q193188" url="?curid=16622" title="Knitting">
<text>Knitting is a method for production of textile fabrics by interlacing yarn loops with loops of the same or other yarns. It is used to create many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine.

Knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row; they can be either on straight flat needles or in &quot;the round&quot; on needles with (often times plastic) tubes connected to both ends of the needles. There are usually many &quot;active stitches&quot; on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the &quot;gaining needle so&quot; that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.

Differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, &quot;weight&quot;, uniformity and &quot;twist&quot;), needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity. A small sample of knitwork is known as a &quot;swatch&quot;.

==Etymology of the words knit and knitting==

There are several origins of the word knit and knitting which include the German derivation from the word &quot;&quot;knutten&quot; (to tie), the Old Norse word &quot;knytja&quot;, and the Old English words &quot;cnyttan&quot;&quot; (to tie a knot, bind together, fasten by tieing) and &quot;cnotta&quot; (knot).

Nålebinding (Danish: literally &quot;binding with a needle&quot; or &quot;needle-binding&quot;) is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crochet.

==History and culture==
The exact origins of knitting are unknown, the earliest known examples being cotton socks dating from the 11th century, found in the remains of the city of Fustat, now part of Cairo.

The first commercial knitting guilds appear in Western Europe in the early fifteenth century (Tournai in 1429, Barcelona in 1496). The Guild of Saint Fiacre was founded in Paris in 1527 but the archives mention an organization (not necessarily a guild) of knitters from 1268. The occupation: &quot;cap knitter&quot; describes Margaret Yeo, of London, in 1473.

With the invention in 1589 of the stocking frame, an early form of knitting machine, knitting &quot;by hand&quot; became a craft used by country people with easy access to fiber. Similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, hand knitting became a leisure activity for the wealthy. English Roman Catholic priest and former Anglican bishop, Richard Rutt, authored a history of the craft in A History of Hand Knitting (Batsford, 1987). His collection of books about knitting is now housed at the Winchester School of Art (University of Southampton).

==Differences and similarities between knitting and crocheting==

While creating knitting by hand, usually two needles are used to hold the live stitches. While crochet uses a single hook, usually creating one stitch at a time, finishing one stitch before creating the next. Knitted fabric tends to be flexible and flowing, the stitches forming a shape that is similar to a &quot;V&quot;. Crochet fabric has a more structured feel, each stitch consisting of several loops entwined. Each textile has its specialties and methods. Because of the different nature of each stitch, crochet fabric uses more yarn per stitch, is more structured, and is more flexible in the structures that can be created, not being restrained to create a stitch in the following stitch. Knitted fabric tends to be thinner, more flexible, and usually has easier-to-understand patterns because each new stitch must go into the next stitch. Because of the differences in how the fabrics are created, the first knitting machine was invented in Victorian times, while a machine that can stitch a crochet fabric has yet to be produced. Although different methods, they can create similar projects using the same fibers and yarns.

==Structure==
===Courses and wales===

Like weaving, knitting is a technique for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a &quot;course&quot;), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically above and below the mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer&#x27;s motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the &quot;bias&quot;), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body&#x27;s outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.

If they are not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; this is known as &quot;ripping out&quot;, &quot;unravelling&quot; knitting, or humorously, &quot;frogging&quot; (because you &#x27;rip it&#x27;, this sounds like a frog croaking: &#x27;rib-bit&#x27;). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured (&quot;active&quot; or &quot;live&quot;), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a &quot;wale&quot;. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.

===Weft and warp knitting===
There are two major varieties of knitting: weft knitting and warp knitting. In the more common &quot;weft knitting&quot;, the wales are perpendicular to the course of the yarn. In warp knitting, the wales and courses run roughly parallel. In weft knitting, the entire fabric may be produced from a single yarn, by adding stitches to each wale in turn, moving across the fabric as in a raster scan. By contrast, in warp knitting, one yarn is required for every wale. Since a typical piece of knitted fabric may have hundreds of wales, warp knitting is typically done by machine, whereas weft knitting is done by both hand and machine. Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.

Weft-knit fabrics may also be knit with multiple yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns. The two most common approaches are intarsia and stranded colorwork. In intarsia, the yarns are used in well-segregated regions, e.g., a red apple on a field of green; in that case, the yarns are kept on separate spools and only one is knitted at any time. In the more complex stranded approach, two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row, as seen in Fair Isle sweaters. Double knitting can produce two separate knitted fabrics simultaneously (e.g., two socks). However, the two fabrics are usually integrated into one, giving it great warmth and excellent drape.

===Knit and purl stitches===


In securing the previous stitch in a wale, the next stitch can pass through the previous loop from either below or above. If the former, the stitch is denoted as a &#x27;knit stitch&#x27; or a &#x27;plain stitch;&#x27; if the latter, as a &#x27;purl stitch&#x27;. The two stitches are related in that a knit stitch seen from one side of the fabric appears as a purl stitch on the other side.

The two types of stitches have a different visual effect; the knit stitches look like &#x27;V&#x27;s stacked vertically, whereas the purl stitches look like a wavy horizontal line across the fabric. Patterns and pictures can be created in knitted fabrics by using knit and purl stitches as &quot;pixels&quot;; however, such pixels are usually rectangular, rather than square, depending on the gauge/tension of the knitting. Individual stitches, or rows of stitches, may be made taller by drawing more yarn into the new loop (an elongated stitch), which is the basis for uneven knitting: a row of tall stitches may alternate with one or more rows of short stitches for an interesting visual effect. Short and tall stitches may also alternate within a row, forming a fish-like oval pattern.

In the simplest of hand-knitted fabrics, every row of stitches are all knit (or all purl); this creates a garter stitch fabric. Alternating rows of all knit stitches and all purl stitches creates a stockinette stitch/stocking stitch pattern. Vertical stripes (ribbing) are possible by having alternating wales of knit and purl stitches. For example, a common choice is 2x2 ribbing, in which two wales of knit stitches are followed by two wales of purl stitches, etc. Horizontal striping (welting) is also possible, by alternating &quot;rows&quot; of knit and purl stitches. Checkerboard patterns (basketweave) are also possible, the smallest of which is known as &quot;seed/moss stitch&quot;: the stitches alternate between knit and purl in every wale and along every row.

Fabrics in which each knitted row is followed by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as ribbing, garter stitch or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat. Wales of purl stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward, giving the fabric more stretchability. Thus, the purl wales in ribbing tend to be invisible, since the neighboring knit wales come forward. Conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches. This is the basis of shadow knitting, in which the appearance of a knitted fabric changes when viewed from different directions.

Typically, a new stitch is passed through a single unsecured (&#x27;active&#x27;) loop, thus lengthening that wale by one stitch. However, this need not be so; the new loop may be passed through an already secured stitch lower down on the fabric, or even between secured stitches (a dip stitch). Depending on the distance between where the loop is drawn through the fabric and where it is knitted, dip stitches can produce a subtle stippling or long lines across the surface of the fabric, e.g., the lower leaves of a flower. The new loop may also be passed between two stitches in the &#x27;present&#x27; row, thus clustering the intervening stitches; this approach is often used to produce a smocking effect in the fabric. The new loop may also be passed through &#x27;two or more&#x27; previous stitches, producing a decrease and merging wales together. The merged stitches need not be from the same row; for example, a tuck can be formed by knitting stitches together from two different rows, producing a raised horizontal welt on the fabric.

Not every stitch in a row need be knitted; some may be &#x27;missed&#x27; (unknitted and passed to the active needle) and knitted on a subsequent row. This is known as slip-stitch knitting. The slipped stitches are naturally longer than the knitted ones. For example, a stitch slipped for one row before knitting would be roughly twice as tall as its knitted counterparts. This can produce interesting visual effects, although the resulting fabric is more rigid because the slipped stitch &#x27;pulls&#x27; on its neighbours and is less deformable. Mosaic knitting is a form of slip-stitch knitting that knits alternate colored rows and uses slip stitches to form patterns; mosaic-knit fabrics tend to be stiffer than patterned fabrics produced by other methods such as Fair-Isle knitting.

In some cases, a stitch may be deliberately left unsecured by a new stitch, and its wale allowed to disassemble. This is known as drop-stitch knitting, and produces a vertical ladder of see-through holes in the fabric, corresponding to where the wale had been.

===Right- and left-plaited stitches===

Both knit and purl stitches may be twisted: usually once if at all, but sometimes twice and (very rarely) thrice. When seen from above, the twist can be clockwise (right yarn over left) or counterclockwise (left yarn over right); these are denoted as right- and left-plaited stitches, respectively. Hand-knitters generally produce right-plaited stitches by knitting or purling through the back loops, i.e., passing the needle through the initial stitch in an unusual way, but wrapping the yarn as usual. By contrast, the left-plaited stitch is generally formed by hand-knitters by wrapping the yarn in the opposite way, rather than by any change in the needle. Although they are mirror images in form, right- and left-plaited stitches are functionally equivalent. Both types of plaited stitches give a subtle but interesting visual texture, and tend to draw the fabric inwards, making it stiffer. Plaited stitches are a common method for knitting jewelry from fine metal wire.

===Edges and joins between fabrics===
The initial and final edges of a knitted fabric are known as the &quot;cast-on&quot; and &quot;bound/cast-off&quot; edges. The side edges are known as the &quot;selvages&quot;; the word derives from &quot;self-edges&quot;, meaning that the stitches do not need to be secured by anything else. Many types of selvages have been developed, with different elastic and ornamental properties.

Vertical and horizontal edges can be introduced within a knitted fabric, e.g., for button holes, by binding/casting off and re-casting on again (horizontal) or by knitting the fabrics on either side of a vertical edge separately.

Two knitted fabrics can be joined by embroidery-based grafting methods, most commonly the Kitchener stitch. New wales can be begun from any of the edges of a knitted fabric; this is known as picking up stitches and is the basis for entrelac, in which the wales run perpendicular to one another in a checkerboard pattern.

===Cables, increases, and lace===

Ordinarily, stitches are knitted in the same order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric. However, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern. Cable patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic; Aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling. Arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for a wale to move up and then down the fabric. Knitters have developed methods for giving the illusion of a circular wale, such as appear in Celtic knots, but these are inexact approximations. However, such circular wales are possible using Swiss darning, a form of embroidery, or by knitting a tube separately and attaching it to the knitted fabric.
A wale can split into two or more wales using increases, most commonly involving a yarn over. Depending on how the increase is done, there is often a hole in the fabric at the point of the increase. This is used to great effect in lace knitting, which consists of making patterns and pictures using such holes, rather than with the stitches themselves. The large and many holes in lacy knitting makes it extremely elastic; for example, some Shetland &quot;wedding-ring&quot; shawls are so fine that they may be drawn through a wedding ring.

By combining increases and decreases, it is possible to make the direction of a wale slant away from vertical, even in weft knitting. This is the basis for bias knitting, and can be used for visual effect, similar to the direction of a brush-stroke in oil painting.

===Ornamentations and additions===
Various point-like ornaments may be added to knitting for their look or to improve the wear of the fabric. Examples include various types of bobbles, sequins and beads. Long loops can also be drawn out and secured, forming a &quot;shaggy&quot; texture to the fabric; this is known as loop knitting. Additional patterns can be made on the surface of the knitted fabric using embroidery; if the embroidery resembles knitting, it is often called Swiss darning. Various closures for the garments, such as frogs and buttons can be added; usually buttonholes are knitted into the garment, rather than cut.

Ornamental pieces may also be knitted separately and then attached using applique. For example, differently colored leaves and petals of a flower could be knit separately and attached to form the final picture. Separately knitted tubes can be applied to a knitted fabric to form complex Celtic knots and other patterns that would be difficult to knit.

Unknitted yarns may be worked into knitted fabrics for warmth, as is done in tufting and &quot;weaving&quot; (also known as &quot;couching&quot;).

==Properties of fabrics==

The topology of a knitted fabric is relatively complex. Unlike woven fabrics, where strands usually run straight horizontally and vertically, yarn that has been knitted follows a looped path along its row, as with the red strand in the diagram at left, in which the loops of one row have all been pulled through the loops of the row below it.

Because there is no single straight line of yarn anywhere in the pattern, a knitted piece of fabric can stretch in all directions. This elasticity is all but unavailable in woven fabrics which only stretch along the bias. Many modern stretchy garments, even as they rely on elastic synthetic materials for some stretch, also achieve at least some of their stretch through knitted patterns.

The basic knitted fabric (as in the diagram, and usually called a &quot;stocking&quot; or &quot;stockinette&quot; pattern) has a definite &quot;right side&quot; and &quot;wrong side&quot;. On the right side, the visible portions of the loops are the verticals connecting two rows which are arranged in a grid of &quot;V&quot; shapes. On the wrong side, the ends of the loops are visible, both the tops and bottoms, creating a much more bumpy texture sometimes called &quot;reverse stockinette&quot;. (Despite being the &quot;wrong side&quot;, reverse stockinette is frequently used as a pattern in its own right.) Because the yarn holding rows together is all on the front, and the yarn holding side-by-side stitches together is all on the back, stockinette fabric has a strong tendency to curl toward the front on the top and bottom, and toward the back on the left and right side.

Stitches can be worked from either side, and various patterns are created by mixing regular knit stitches with the &quot;wrong side&quot; stitches, known as purl stitches, either in columns (ribbing), rows (garter, welting), or more complex patterns. Each fabric has different properties: a garter stitch has much more vertical stretch, while ribbing stretches much more horizontally. Because of their front-back symmetry, these two fabrics have little curl, making them popular as edging, even when their stretch properties are not desired.

The basic knitted fabrics are referred to by different names in the setting of industrial manufacture. The fabric known by hand knitters as stockinette is called plain knit or jersey, and the fabric known by hand knitters as garter is called purl knitting or links-and-links.

Different combinations of knit and purl stitches, along with more advanced techniques, generate fabrics of considerably variable consistency, from gauzy to very dense, from highly stretchy to relatively stiff, from flat to tightly curled, and so on. 
===Texture===
The most common texture for a knitted garment is that generated by the flat stockinette stitch—as seen, though very small, in machine-made stockings and T-shirts—which is worked in the round as nothing but knit stitches, and worked flat as alternating rows of knit and purl. Other simple textures can be made with nothing but knit and purl stitches, including garter stitch, ribbing, and moss and seed stitches. Adding a &quot;slip stitch&quot; (where a loop is passed from one needle to the other) allows for a wide range of textures, including heel and linen stitches as well as a number of more complicated patterns.
Some more advanced knitting techniques create a surprising variety of complex textures. Combining certain increases, which can create small eyelet holes in the resulting fabric, with assorted decreases is key to creating knitted lace, a very open fabric resembling needle or bobbin lace. Open vertical stripes can be created using the drop-stitch knitting technique. Changing the order of stitches from one row to the next, usually with the help of a cable needle or stitch holder, is key to cable knitting, producing an endless variety of cables, honeycombs, ropes, and Aran sweater patterning. Entrelac forms a rich checkerboard texture by knitting small squares, picking up their side edges, and knitting more squares to continue the piece.

Fair Isle knitting uses two or more colored yarns to create patterns and forms a thicker and less flexible fabric.

The appearance of a garment is also affected by the &quot;weight&quot; of the yarn, which describes the thickness of the spun fibre. The thicker the yarn, the more visible and apparent stitches will be; the thinner the yarn, the finer the texture.

===Color===
Plenty of finished knitting projects never use more than a single color of yarn, but there are many ways to work in multiple colors. Some yarns are dyed to be either &quot;variegated&quot; (changing color every few stitches in a random fashion) or &quot;self-striping&quot; (changing every few rows). More complicated techniques permit large fields of color (intarsia, for example), busy small-scale patterns of color (such as Fair Isle), or both (double knitting and slip-stitch color, for example).

Yarn with multiple shades of the same hue are called &quot;ombre&quot;, while a yarn with multiple hues may be known as a given &quot;colorway&quot;; a green, red and yellow yarn might be dubbed the &quot;Parrot Colorway&quot; by its manufacturer, for example. &quot;Heathered&quot; yarns contain small amounts of fibre of different colours, while &quot;tweed&quot; yarns may have greater amounts of different colored fibres.

==Hand knitting process==
There are many hundreds of different knitting stitches used by hand knitters. A piece of hand knitting begins with the process of &quot;casting on&quot;, which involves the initial creation of the stitches on the needle. Different methods of casting on are used for different effects: one may be stretchy enough for lace, while another provides a decorative edging. &quot;Provisional&quot; cast-ons are used when the knitting will continue in both directions from the cast-on. There are various methods employed to cast on, such as the &quot;thumb method&quot; (also known as &quot;slingshot&quot; or &quot;long-tail&quot; cast-ons), where the stitches are created by a series of loops that will, when knitted, give a very loose edge ideal for &quot;picking up stitches&quot; and knitting a border; the &quot;double needle method&quot; (also known as &quot;knit-on&quot; or &quot;cable cast-on&quot;), whereby each loop placed on the needle is then &quot;knitted on&quot;, which produces a firmer edge ideal on its own as a border; and many more. The number of active stitches remains the same as when cast on unless stitches are added (an increase) or removed (a decrease).

Most Western-style hand knitters follow either the English style (in which the yarn is held in the right hand) or the Continental style (in which the yarn is held in the left hand).

There are also different ways to insert the needle into the stitch. Knitting through the front of a stitch is called Western knitting. Going through the back of a stitch is called Eastern knitting. A third method, called combination knitting, goes through the front of a purl stitch and the back of a knit stitch.

Once the hand knitted piece is finished, the remaining live stitches are &quot;cast off&quot;. Casting (or &quot;binding&quot;) off loops the stitches across each other so they can be removed from the needle without unravelling the item. Although the mechanics are different from casting on, there is a similar variety of methods.

In hand knitting certain articles of clothing, especially larger ones like sweaters, the final knitted garment will be made of several knitted pieces, with individual sections of the garment hand knitted separately and then sewn together. Seamless knitting, where a whole garment is hand knit as a single piece, is also possible. Elizabeth Zimmermann is probably the best-known proponent of seamless or circular hand knitting techniques. Smaller items, such as socks and hats, are usually knit in one piece on double-pointed needles or circular needles. Hats in particular can be started &quot;top down&quot; on double pointed needles with the increases added until the preferred size is achieved, switching to an appropriate circular needle when enough stitches have been added. Care must be taken to bind off at a tension that will allow the &quot;give&quot; needed to comfortably fit on the head. (See &quot;Circular knitting&quot;.)

== Machine knitting ==

Knitting can also be performed by machines.  The first knitting machine, known as the stocking frame, was invented in England in 1589. Modern knitting machines, both domestic and industrial, are either flat-bed or circular. Flat-bed knitting machines knit back and forth, producing a flat piece of fabric.  Flat-bed machines can produce uniform-width fabric which can be cut and sewn into garments, or they can produce shaped pieces which can be seamed to make garments without cutting.  The latter is known as full-fashioned knitting. Circular knitting machines knit in a continuous circle, producing a tubular piece of fabric.  Similarly to knitted fabrics manufactured on flat-bed machines, a tube of uniform-width fabric may be cut along one side to produce flat fabric which can be cut and sewn into garments.  Fabric produced in this way can be cheaper than fabric produced on a flat-bed machine, as circular machines can operate at higher speed.  Circular knitting machines can also be used to create shaped, finished articles, such as socks.

==Materials==

===Yarn===

Yarn for hand-knitting is usually sold as balls or skeins (hanks), and it may also be wound on spools or cones. Skeins and balls are generally sold with a &quot;yarn-band&quot;, a label that describes the yarn&#x27;s weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge/tension, etc. It is common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased. Knitters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot. The dye lot specifies a group of skeins that were dyed together and thus have precisely the same color; skeins from different dye-lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible horizontal stripe when knitted together. If a knitter buys insufficient yarn of a single dye lot to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online. Otherwise, knitters can alternate skeins every few rows to help the dye lots blend together easier.

The thickness or weight of the yarn is a significant factor in determining the gauge/tension, i.e., how many stitches and rows are required to cover a given area for a given stitch pattern. Thicker yarns generally require thicker knitting needles, whereas thinner yarns may be knit with thick or thin needles. Hence, thicker yarns generally require fewer stitches, and therefore less time, to knit up a given garment. Patterns and motifs are coarser with thicker yarns; thicker yarns produce bold visual effects, whereas thinner yarns are best for refined patterns. Yarns are grouped by thickness into the following categories: lace, superfine (fingering or sock), fine (sport), light (double knit or DK), medium (worsted and aran), bulky, superbulky, and jumbo; quantitatively, thickness is measured by the number of wraps per inch (WPI). In the British Commonwealth (outside North America) yarns are measured as 1ply, 2ply, 3ply, 4ply, 5ply, 8ply (or double knit),10ply and 12ply (triple knit). The related &quot;weight per unit length&quot; is usually measured in tex or denier.
Before knitting, the knitter will typically transform a hank/skein into a ball where the yarn emerges from the center of the ball; this making the knitting easier by preventing the yarn from becoming easily tangled. This transformation may be done by hand, or with a device known as a ballwinder. When knitting, some knitters enclose their balls in jars to keep them clean and untangled with other yarns; the free yarn passes through a small hole in the jar-lid.

A yarn&#x27;s usefulness for a knitting project is judged by several factors, such as its &quot;loft&quot; (its ability to trap air), its &quot;resilience&quot; (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its &quot;hand&quot; (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its &quot;hairiness&quot; (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, so there is no one &quot;best&quot; yarn. The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. A key factor in knitting is &quot;stitch definition&quot;, corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.

Although knitting may be done with ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a &quot;worsted&quot;; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called &quot;woolen-spun&quot;. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous &quot;filament&quot; fibers such as silk and many synthetics, or they may be &quot;staples&quot; (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called &quot;worst&quot;), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a &quot;slub&quot; is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.

The spun fibers are generally divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of animals such as sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting. It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.

A single spun yarn may be knitted as is, or braided or plied with another. In plying, two or more yarns are spun together, almost always in the opposite sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns&#x27; tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, &quot;balanced&quot; yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing &quot;cabled yarns&quot; or &quot;multi-stranded yarns&quot;. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwards to give the yarn a uniform look.

The dyeing of yarns is a complex art that has a long history. However, yarns need not be dyed. They may be dyed just one color, or a great variety of colors. Dyeing may be done industrially, by hand or even hand-painted onto the yarn. A great variety of synthetic dyes have been developed since the synthesis of indigo dye in the mid-19th century; however, natural dyes are also possible, although they are generally less brilliant. The color-scheme of a yarn is sometimes called its colorway. Variegated yarns can produce interesting visual effects, such as diagonal stripes; conversely, a variegated yarn may obscure a detailed knitting design, such as a cable or lace pattern.

===Metal wire===
There are multiple commercial applications for knit fabric made of metal wire by knitting machines. Steel wire of various sizes may be used for electric and magnetic shielding due to its conductivity. Stainless steel may be used in a coffee press for its rust resistance.

Metal wire is suitable for knitting and used as jewelry. This may incorporate beads of various materials and ornaments such as seashells.

===Glass and wax===
Knitted glass combines knitting with wax strands, lost-wax casting, mold-making, and kiln-casting.

==Tools==
The process of knitting has three basic tasks:

#the active (unsecured) stitches must be held so they don&#x27;t drop
#these stitches must be released sometime after they are secured
#new bights of yarn must be passed through the fabric, usually through active stitches, thus securing them.

In very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames. Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or corkers). There is also a technique called knooking of knitting with a crochet hook that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they&#x27;re being worked. Other tools are used to prepare yarn for knitting, to measure and design knitted garments, or to make knitting easier or more comfortable.

===Needles===

There are three basic types of knitting needles (also called &quot;knitting pins&quot;). The first and most common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob at the other end to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. Although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle. Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches. The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. Needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.
The second type of knitting needles are straight, double-pointed knitting needles (also called &quot;DPNs&quot;). Double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end. DPNs are typically used for circular knitting, especially smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks; usually one needle is active while the others hold the remaining active stitches. DPNs are somewhat shorter (typically 7 inches) and are usually sold in sets of four or five.

The third needle type consists of circular needles, which are long, flexible double-pointed needles. The two tapered ends (typically long) are rigid and straight, allowing for easy knitting; however, the two ends are connected by a flexible strand (usually nylon) that allows the two ends to be brought together. Circular needles are typically 24-60 inches long, and are usually used singly or in pairs; again, the width of the knitted piece may be significantly longer than the length of the circular needle. Interchangeable needles are a subset of circular needles. They are kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords. The cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles. This also allows the knitter to change the diameter and length of the needles as needed. The needles must be screwed on tightly, otherwise yarn can snag and become damaged.

The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting. Circular needles may be used for flat or circular knitting.

Cable needles are a special case of DPNs, although they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle. Often, they have the form of a hook. When cabling a knitted piece, a hook is easier to grab and hold the yarn. Cable needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted. When in use, the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles. At specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.
Cable needles are a specific design, and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable. They are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths.

===Ancillary tools===
Various tools have been developed to make hand-knitting easier. Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and &quot;yarntainers&quot;. Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. The darning needle is used in duplicate stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools have been developed to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by &quot;point protectors&quot; that cap the tapered ends. Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.

== Knitting styles/holds ==

=== Continental/German style ===

Continental knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your left hand for both knitting and purling. Patterns are created on the outside (public-facing) side of the piece.

==== Norwegian style ====

While knit stitches are worked as in the classic Continental style, the purl is worked by leaving the yarn at back and moving the needle.

==== Russian style ====
Another variation on Continental knitting, this style is achieved by &quot;picking&quot; up the yarn by moving the needle head into it. Now wrap the yarn around the index finger on that left hand, so it is coming over the top of your finger and back around underneath it and on top of your middle finger. You will wind up with your index finger very close to the back of your left-hand needle. In Russian knitting, it is common to slip the first stitch of every row.

=== English style ===

English-style knitting is achieved by holding the yarn in your right hand. Patterns are created on the outside (public-facing) side of the piece.

=== Portuguese/Greek/Incan/Turkish style ===
This style is achieved by carrying the yarn around the neck or from a necklace-style hook, allowing the knitter to knit on the reverse (purl) side, e.g. &quot;inside out&quot; compared to Western knitting techniques. Patterns are typically created by stranding the yarn on the outside of the piece. This is an ancient style of knitting, which spread from Arabic culture to the Iberian peninsula, during its occupation by Muslims. Hence this style was taught to Indigenous South Americans, during conquest by Spanish/Portuguese colonists.

== Knitting techniques ==

=== Armenian ===
The Armenian knitting technique tacks the non-working yarn to the piece regularly to limit floats. You will tack your non-working yarn down approximately every 3 stitches.

=== Double knitting ===
A technique used to create a flat, smooth, reversible fabric that looks like stockinette or jersey on both sides, rather than having a knit face and a purl reverse side.

=== Fair Isle ===

A method by which many different yarns are used throughout the row and when not being used are floated on the wrong side of the piece.

=== Mega knitting ===
Mega knitting is a term recently coined and relates to the use of knitting needles greater than or equal to half an inch in diameter.

Mega knitting uses the same stitches and techniques as conventional knitting, except that hooks are carved into the ends of the needles. The hooked needles greatly enhance control of the work, catching the stitches and preventing them from slipping off.

It was the development of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting. The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers do not have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook toward you up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.

Mega knitting produces a chunky, bulky fabric or an open lacy weave, depending on the weight and type of yarn used.

===Micro knitting===
Micro knitting or miniature knitting uses extremely fine threads and needles. Althea Crome created 14 tiny sweaters used in the stop motion animated film &quot;Coraline&quot; and has made objects at 60 or 80 stitches per inch, making her own needles from fine surgical steel wire. She has published &quot;Bugknits: Extreme knitting for hobbyists, artists and knitters&quot; (2009, Blurb: ). Annelies de Kort has knitted on an even smaller scale and has used needles of 0.4mm.

=== Short row ===

In short row knitting, the work is turned before a row is fully knitted. There are several ways to achieve this.

==== Wrap and turn ====
Just before the work is turned, the working yarn is passed around the next unknitted stitch, forming a “wrap.” Later, this “wrap” is picked up and knitted into a stitch, concealing it from view.

==== German short row ====
In German short rows, the work is turned and the last stitch worked is slipped purlwise with yarn in front to the right needle. Finally, the working yarn is pulled over the top of the needle to the back, which rotates the stitch on the needle so that it tips backwards, forming what appears to be a double-stitch, sometimes referred to as a “German double stitch”. The working yarn stays to the back for the next stitch if it is to be knitted, or rotated below the right needle and pulled to the front, if it is to be purled, both of which maintain the proper (“tipped back”) orientation of the German double stitch. Eventually, this German double stitch is worked like a single stitch, which masks its appearance as viewed from the right side to look like a regular stitch.

==== Japanese short row ====
In Japanese short rows, a locking stitch marker is used to hold the loop of the working yarn at the turning point. Eventually, the loop is picked up (and stitch marker removed) and worked together with the stitch on the other side of the gap. Japanese short rows usually result in tidier turning points with less extraneous yarn bulk compared to German short rows and the Wrap and Turn technique.

=== Twined knitting ===

The technique, also known as two-end knitting, is a traditional Scandinavian knitting technique. It refers to knitting where two strands of yarn are knitted into the fabric alternatively and twisted once and always in the same direction before every stitch. This produces a firmer and more durable fabric with greater thermal insulation than conventional one-end knitting.

==Commercial applications==
Industrially, metal wire is also knitted into a metal fabric for a wide range of uses including the filter material in cafetieres, catalytic converters for cars and many other uses. These fabrics are usually manufactured on circular knitting machines that would be recognized by conventional knitters as sock machines.

Knitting mills are factories that produce knitted fabrics or knitted apparel.  Knitted fabrics are used in the manufacture of highly-fitted garments such as athleticwear and athleisure.  The stretch properties of knitted fabrics may be enhanced by the inclusion of fibers such as spandex. In addition to athletic-type garments, knitted fabric may be used in fashion garments.

Many fashion designers make heavy use of knitted fabric in their fashion collections. Gordana Gelhausen, who appeared in season six of the television show &quot;Project Runway&quot;, is primarily a knit designer. Other designers and labels that make heavy use of knitting include Michael Kors, Fendi, and Marc Jacobs.

Knitting mills can also produce completed knitted apparel, such as sweaters, socks, T-shirts, and underwear. Beginning in the 1990s, seamless 3-dimensional whole-garment knitting machines have increased the options of finished garments that can be produced in knitting mills. These machines have also enabled the production of knitted shoe uppers.

For individual hobbyists, websites such as Etsy, Big Cartel and Ravelry have made it easy to sell knitting patterns on a small scale, in a way similar to eBay.

==Graffiti==

In the 2000s, a practice called knitting graffiti, guerilla knitting, or yarn bombing—the use of knitted or crocheted cloth to modify and beautify one&#x27;s (usually outdoor) surroundings—emerged in the U.S. and spread worldwide. Magda Sayeg is credited with starting the movement in the US and Knit the City are a prominent group of graffiti knitters in the United Kingdom. Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification. For instance, Dave Cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in Melbourne, Australia for the Big West Arts Festival in 2009. The work was vandalized the night of its completion. A new movie, shot by a Tasmanian filmmaker on a set made almost entirely out of yarn, was partially inspired by &quot;knitted graffiti&quot;.

== Yarn crawl ==
Many major metropolitan cities across the US and Europe host annual Yarn Crawls. The event is typically a multi-day event that caters to all knitters, crochet and yarn enthusiasts that supports the local crafting community. Over the multi-day period, multiple local yarn and knit shops participate in the yarn crawl and offer up store discounts, give away free exclusive patterns, provide classes, trunk shows and conduct raffles for prizes. Participants of the crawl receive a passport and get their passport stamped at each store they visit along the crawl. Traditionally those that get their passports fully stamped are eligible to win a larger gift basket filled with yarn, knitting and crochet goodies. Some local crawls also provide a Knit-Along (KAL) or Crochet-Along (CAL) where attendees follow a specific pattern prior to the crawl and then proudly wear it during the crawl for others to see.

==Craftivism and Charity==

Hand knitting garments for free distribution to others have become a common practice among hand knitting groups. Girls and women hand-knitted socks, sweaters, scarves, mittens, gloves, and hats for soldiers in Crimea, the American Civil War, and the Boer Wars; this practice continued in World War I, World War II and the Korean War, and continues for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Australian charity &quot;Wrap with Love&quot; continues to provide blankets hand knitted by volunteers to people most in need around the world who have been affected by war.

In the historical projects, yarn companies provided knitting patterns approved by the various branches of the armed services; often they were distributed by local chapters of the American Red Cross. Modern projects usually entail the hand knitting of hats or helmet liners; the liners provided for soldiers must be of 100% worsted-weight wool and be crafted using specific colors.
Clothing and afghans are frequently made for children, the elderly, and the economically disadvantaged in various countries. Pine Ridge Indian Reservation accepts donations for the Lakota people in the United States. Prayer shawls, or shawls in which the crafter meditates or says prayers of their faith while hand knitting with the intent on comforting the recipient, are donated to those experiencing loss or stress. Many knitters today hand knit and donate &quot;chemo caps&quot;, soft caps for cancer patients who lose their hair during chemotherapy. Yarn companies offer free knitting patterns for these caps.

Penguin sweaters were hand knitted by volunteers for the rehabilitation of penguins contaminated by exposure to oil slicks. The project is now complete.

Chicken sweaters were also hand knitted to aid battery hens that had lost their feathers. The organization is not currently accepting donations, but maintains a list of volunteers.

Originally started after the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, Knitters Without Borders is a charity challenge issued by knitting personality Stephanie Pearl-McPhee that encourages hand knitters to donate to Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). Instead of hand knitting for charity, knitters are encouraged to donate a week&#x27;s worth of disposable income, including money that otherwise might have been spent on yarn. Knitted items are occasional offered as prizes to donors. As of September 2011, Knitters Without Borders donors have contributed CAD$1,062,217.

Security blankets can also be made through the Project Linus organization which helps needy children.

There are organizations that help reach other countries in need such as afghans for Afghans. This outreach is described as, &quot;afghans for Afghans is a humanitarian and educational people-to-people project that sends hand-knit and crocheted blankets and sweaters, vests, hats, mittens, and socks to the beleaguered people of Afghanistan.&quot;

The knitters of the Little Yellow Duck Project craft small yellow ducks which are left for others to find, as a random act of kindness and to raise awareness of blood donation and organ donation. The project was started in memory of a young woman who had collected plastic toy ducks and who died from cystic fibrosis while waiting for a lung transplant. Finders of the ducks are encouraged to log them on a website, which shows that 12,265 ducks have been found in 106 countries.

==Health benefits==

Studies have shown that hand knitting, along with other forms of needlework, provide several significant health benefits. These studies have found the rhythmic and repetitive action of hand knitting can help prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, which in turn strengthens the body&#x27;s immune system, as well as create a relaxation response in the body which can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, help prevent illness, and have a calming effect. Pain specialists have also found that hand knitting changes brain chemistry, resulting in an increase in &quot;feel good&quot; hormones (i.e. serotonin and dopamine) and a decrease in stress hormones.

Knitting can improve dexterity in the hands and fingers. This keeps the fingers limber and can be especially helpful for those with arthritis. Knitting can reduce the pain of arthritis if people make it a daily habit.

Hand knitting, along with other leisure activities, has been linked to reducing the risk of developing dementia by preventing memory loss. Much like physical activity strengthens the body, mental exercise makes the human brain more resilient. Knitting can be done anywhere and requires that minimal materials and props be carried around with you, making it a very pleasurable and simple hobby that gives wonderful benefits.

Knitting also helps in the area of social interaction; knitting provides people with opportunities to socialize with others and build community. One way to increase social interaction with knitting is inviting friends over to knit and chat with each other. Many public libraries and yarn stores host knitting groups where knitters can meet locally to engage with others interested in hand crafts.

Knitting has been shown to be an effective form of art therapy for coping with trauma or grief . Whether the knitting is done individually or in a knitting group, the creativity and creation process along with the repetitive physical motion has been shown to be effective.

A repository of research into the effect on health of hand knitting can be found at Stitch links, an organization founded in Bath, England.

<doc id="16623" wikidata="Q81244" url="?curid=16623" title="Karl Popper">
<text>Sir Karl Raimund Popper (28 July 1902 – 17 September 1994) was an Austrian–British philosopher, academic and social commentator. One of the 20th century&#x27;s most influential philosophers of science, Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification, and for founding the LSE&#x27;s Department of Philosophy. According to Popper, a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can (and should) be scrutinised with decisive experiments. Popper was opposed to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with &quot;the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy&quot;, namely critical rationalism.

In political discourse, he is known for his vigorous defence of liberal democracy and the principles of social criticism that he believed made a flourishing open society possible. His political thought resides within the camp of Enlightenment rationalism and humanism. He was a dogged opponent of totalitarianism, nationalism, fascism, romanticism, collectivism, and other kinds of (in Popper&#x27;s view) reactionary and irrational ideas, and identified modern liberal democracies as the best-to-date embodiment of an open society.

== Life and career ==
=== Family and training ===
Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902 to upper-middle-class parents. All of Popper&#x27;s grandparents were assimilated Jews; the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before he was born and so he received a Lutheran baptism. His father, Simon Siegmund Carl Popper (1856–1932), was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University. His mother, Jenny Schiff (1864–1938), was an accomplished pianist of Silesian and Hungarian descent. Popper&#x27;s uncle was the Austrian philosopher Josef Popper-Lynkeus. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society, as Popper&#x27;s father became a partner in the law firm of Vienna&#x27;s liberal mayor Raimund Grübl, and after Grübl&#x27;s death in 1898 took over the business. Popper received his middle name after Raimund Grübl. (In his autobiography, Popper erroneously recalls that Grübl&#x27;s first name was Carl). His parents were close friends of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s sister Rosa Graf. His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000–14,000 volumes in his personal library and took an interest in philosophy, the classics, and social and political issues. Popper inherited both the library and the disposition from him. Later, he would describe the atmosphere of his upbringing as having been &quot;decidedly bookish&quot;.

Popper left school at the age of 16 and attended lectures in mathematics, physics, philosophy, psychology and the history of music as a guest student at the University of Vienna. In 1919, Popper became attracted by Marxism and subsequently joined the Association of Socialist School Students. He also became a member of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria, which was at that time a party that fully adopted Marxism. After the street battle in the Hörlgasse on 15 June 1919, when police shot eight of his unarmed party comrades, he turned away from what he saw as the philosopher Karl Marx&#x27;s historical materialism, abandoned the ideology, and remained a supporter of social liberalism throughout his life.

Popper worked in street construction for a short time but was unable to cope with the heavy labour. Continuing to attend university as a guest student, he started an apprenticeship as a cabinetmaker, which he completed as a journeyman. He was dreaming at that time of starting a daycare facility for children, for which he assumed the ability to make furniture might be useful. After that, he did voluntary service in one of psychoanalyst Alfred Adler&#x27;s clinics for children. In 1922, he did his matura by way of a second chance education and finally joined the university as an ordinary student. He completed his examination as an elementary teacher in 1924 and started working at an after-school care club for socially endangered children. In 1925, he went to the newly founded &quot;Pädagogisches Institut&quot; and continued studying philosophy and psychology. Around that time he started courting Josefine Anna Henninger, who later became his wife.

Popper and his wife had chosen not to have children because of the circumstances of war in the early years of their marriage. Popper commented that this &quot;was perhaps a cowardly but in a way a right decision&quot;.

In 1928, Popper earned a doctorate in psychology, under the supervision of Karl Bühler—with Moritz Schlick being the second chair of the thesis committee. His dissertation was titled &quot;Zur Methodenfrage der Denkpsychologie&quot; (&quot;On Questions of Method in the Psychology of Thinking&quot;). In 1929, he obtained an authorisation to teach mathematics and physics in secondary school and began doing so. He married his colleague Josefine Anna Henninger (1906–1985) in 1930. Fearing the rise of Nazism and the threat of the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, he started to use the evenings and the nights to write his first book &quot;Die beiden Grundprobleme der Erkenntnistheorie&quot; (&quot;The Two Fundamental Problems of the Theory of Knowledge&quot;). He needed to publish a book to get an academic position in a country that was safe for people of Jewish descent. In the end, he did not publish the two-volume work; but instead, a condensed version with some new material, as &quot;Logik der Forschung&quot; (&quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;) in 1934. Here, he criticised psychologism, naturalism, inductivism, and logical positivism, and put forth his theory of potential falsifiability as the criterion demarcating science from non-science. In 1935 and 1936, he took unpaid leave to go to the United Kingdom for a study visit.

=== Academic life ===

In 1937, Popper finally managed to get a position that allowed him to emigrate to New Zealand, where he became lecturer in philosophy at Canterbury University College of the University of New Zealand in Christchurch. It was here that he wrote his influential work &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;. In Dunedin he met the Professor of Physiology John Carew Eccles and formed a lifelong friendship with him. In 1946, after the Second World War, he moved to the United Kingdom to become a reader in logic and scientific method at the London School of Economics (LSE), a constituent School of the University of London, where, three years later, in 1949, he was appointed professor of logic and scientific method. Popper was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1958 to 1959. He resided in Penn, Buckinghamshire.

Popper retired from academic life in 1969, though he remained intellectually active for the rest of his life. In 1985, he returned to Austria so that his wife could have her relatives around her during the last months of her life; she died in November that year. After the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft failed to establish him as the director of a newly founded branch researching the philosophy of science, he went back again to the United Kingdom in 1986, settling in Kenley, Surrey.

=== Death ===

Popper died of &quot;complications of cancer, pneumonia and kidney failure&quot; in Kenley at the age of 92 on 17 September 1994. He had been working continuously on his philosophy until two weeks before when he suddenly fell terminally ill, writing his last letter two weeks before his death as well.

After cremation, his ashes were taken to Vienna and buried at Lainzer cemetery adjacent to the ORF Centre, where his wife Josefine Anna Popper (called &quot;Hennie&quot;) had already been buried. Popper&#x27;s estate is managed by his secretary and personal assistant Melitta Mew and her husband Raymond. Popper&#x27;s manuscripts went to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, partly during his lifetime and partly as supplementary material after his death. The University of Klagenfurt acquired Popper&#x27;s library in 1995. The Karl Popper Archives was established within the Klagenfurt University Library, holding Popper&#x27;s library of approximately 6,000 books, including his precious bibliophilia, as well as hard copies of the original Hoover material and microfilms of the incremental material. The library as well as various other partial collections are open for researcher purposes. The remaining parts of the estate were mostly transferred to The Karl Popper Charitable Trust. In October 2008, the University of Klagenfurt acquired the copyrights from the estate.

== Honours and awards ==
Popper won many awards and honours in his field, including the Lippincott Award of the American Political Science Association, the Sonning Prize, the Otto Hahn Peace Medal of the United Nations Association of Germany in Berlin and fellowships in the Royal Society, British Academy, London School of Economics, King&#x27;s College London, Darwin College, Cambridge, Austrian Academy of Sciences and Charles University, Prague. Austria awarded him the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1986, and the Federal Republic of Germany its Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit, and the peace class of the Order Pour le Mérite. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1965, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1976. He was invested with the insignia of a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1982.

Other awards and recognition for Popper included the City of Vienna Prize for the Humanities (1965), Karl Renner Prize (1978), Austrian Decoration for Science and Art (1980), Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize of the University of Tübingen (1980), Ring of Honour of the City of Vienna (1983) and the Premio Internazionale of the Italian Federico Nietzsche Society (1988). In 1989, he was the first awarded the Prize International Catalonia for &quot;his work to develop cultural, scientific and human values all around the world&quot;. In 1992, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for &quot;symbolising the open spirit of the 20th century&quot; and for his &quot;enormous influence on the formation of the modern intellectual climate&quot;.
== Philosophy ==
=== Background to Popper&#x27;s ideas ===
Popper&#x27;s rejection of Marxism during his teenage years left a profound mark on his thought. He had at one point joined a socialist association, and for a few months in 1919 considered himself a communist. Although it is known that Popper worked as an office boy at the communist headquarters, whether or not he ever became a member of the Communist Party is unclear. During this time he became familiar with the Marxist view of economics, class conflict, and history. Although he quickly became disillusioned with the views expounded by Marxists, his flirtation with the ideology led him to distance himself from those who believed that spilling blood for the sake of a revolution was necessary. He then took the view that when it came to sacrificing human lives, one was to think and act with extreme prudence.

The failure of democratic parties to prevent fascism from taking over Austrian politics in the 1920s and 1930s traumatised Popper. He suffered from the direct consequences of this failure since events after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; (the annexation of Austria by the German Reich in 1938) forced him into permanent exile. His most important works in the field of social science—&quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; (1945)—were inspired by his reflection on the events of his time and represented, in a sense, a reaction to the prevalent totalitarian ideologies that then dominated Central European politics. His books defended democratic liberalism as a social and political philosophy. They also represented extensive critiques of the philosophical presuppositions underpinning all forms of totalitarianism.

Popper believed that there was a contrast between the theories of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, which he considered non-scientific, and Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity which set off the revolution in physics in the early 20th century. Popper thought that Einstein&#x27;s theory, as a theory properly grounded in scientific thought and method, was highly &quot;risky&quot;, in the sense that it was possible to deduce consequences from it which differed considerably from those of the then-dominant Newtonian physics; one such prediction, that gravity could deflect light, was verified by Eddington&#x27;s experiments in 1919. In contrast he thought that nothing could, even in principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories. He thus came to the conclusion that they had more in common with primitive myths than with genuine science.

This led Popper to conclude that what was regarded as the remarkable strengths of psychoanalytical theories were actually their weaknesses. Psychoanalytical theories were crafted in a way that made them able to refute any criticism and to give an explanation for every possible form of human behaviour. The nature of such theories made it impossible for any criticism or experiment—even in principle—to show them to be false. When Popper later tackled the problem of demarcation in the philosophy of science, this conclusion led him to posit that the strength of a scientific theory lies in its both being susceptible to falsification, and not actually being falsified by criticism made of it. He considered that if a theory cannot, in principle, be falsified by criticism, it is not a scientific theory.

=== Philosophy of science ===
==== Falsifiability and the problem of demarcation ====
Popper coined the term &quot;critical rationalism&quot; to describe his philosophy. Popper rejected the empiricist view (following from Kant) that basic statements are infallible; rather, according to Popper, they are descriptions in relation to a theoretical framework. Concerning the method of science, the term &quot;critical rationalism&quot; indicates his rejection of classical empiricism, and the classical observationalist-inductivist account of science that had grown out of it. Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that scientific theories are abstract in nature and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications. He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings.

Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive; it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. Popper&#x27;s account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between metaphysics and science: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it makes predictions that can be falsified. This led him to attack the claims of both psychoanalysis and contemporary Marxism to scientific status, on the basis that it is not possible to falsify the predictions that they make.

To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory)—call it &quot;T&quot;—is &quot;falsifiable&quot; does not mean that &quot;T&quot; is false. It means only that the background knowledge about existing technologies, which exists before and independently of the theory, allows the imagination or conceptualization of observations that are in contradiction with the theory. It is only required that these contradictory observations can potentially be observed with existing technologies—the observations must be inter-subjective. This is the material requirement of falsifiability. Alan Chalmers gives &quot;The brick fell upward when released&quot; as an example of an imaginary observation that shows that Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation is falsifiable.

In &quot;All Life is Problem Solving&quot;, Popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge—that is, how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time. This problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories, even the best of them, cannot be verified by scientific testing, but can only be falsified. With only falsifications being possible logically, how can we explain the growth of knowledge? In Popper&#x27;s view, the advance of scientific knowledge is an &quot;evolutionary&quot; process characterised by his formula:

formula_1

In response to a given problem situation (formula_2), a number of competing conjectures, or tentative theories (formula_3), are systematically subjected to the most rigorous attempts at falsification possible. This process, error elimination (formula_4), performs a similar function for science that natural selection performs for biological evolution. Theories that better survive the process of refutation are not more true, but rather, more &quot;fit&quot;—in other words, more applicable to the problem situation at hand (formula_2). Consequently, just as a species&#x27; biological fitness does not ensure continued survival, neither does rigorous testing protect a scientific theory from refutation in the future. Yet, as it appears that the engine of biological evolution has, over many generations, produced adaptive traits equipped to deal with more and more complex problems of survival, likewise, the evolution of theories through the scientific method may, in Popper&#x27;s view, reflect a certain type of progress: toward more and more interesting problems (formula_6). For Popper, it is in the interplay between the tentative theories (conjectures) and error elimination (refutation) that scientific knowledge advances toward greater and greater problems; in a process very much akin to the interplay between genetic variation and natural selection.

Popper also wrote extensively against the famous Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. He strongly disagreed with Niels Bohr&#x27;s instrumentalism and supported Albert Einstein&#x27;s scientific realist approach to scientific theories about the universe. He found that Bohr&#x27;s interpretation introduced subjectivity into physics, claiming later in his life that: This Popper&#x27;s falsifiability resembles Charles Peirce&#x27;s nineteenth-century fallibilism. In &quot;Of Clocks and Clouds&quot; (1966), Popper remarked that he wished he had known of Peirce&#x27;s work earlier.

==== Falsification and the problem of induction ====
Among his contributions to philosophy is his claim to have solved the philosophical problem of induction. He states that while there is no way to prove that the sun will rise, it is possible to formulate the theory that every day the sun will rise; if it does not rise on some particular day, the theory will be falsified and will have to be replaced by a different one. Until that day, there is no need to reject the assumption that the theory is true. Nor is it rational according to Popper to make instead the more complex assumption that the sun will rise until a given day, but will stop doing so the day after, or similar statements with additional conditions. Such a theory would be true with higher probability because it cannot be attacked so easily:
* to falsify the first one, it is sufficient to find that the sun has stopped rising;
* to falsify the second one, one additionally needs the assumption that the given day has not yet been reached.
Popper held that it is the least likely, or most easily falsifiable, or simplest theory (attributes which he identified as all the same thing) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer. His opposition to positivism, which held that it is the theory most likely to be true that one should prefer, here becomes very apparent. It is impossible, Popper argues, to ensure a theory to be true; it is more important that its falsity can be detected as easily as possible.

Popper agreed with David Hume that there is often a psychological belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and that there is no logical justification for the supposition that it will, simply because it always has in the past. Popper writes,
=== Rationality ===
Popper held that rationality is not restricted to the realm of empirical or scientific theories, but that it is merely a special case of the general method of criticism, the method of finding and eliminating contradictions in knowledge without ad-hoc measures. According to this view, rational discussion about metaphysical ideas, about moral values and even about purposes is possible. Popper&#x27;s student W.W. Bartley III tried to radicalise this idea and made the controversial claim that not only can criticism go beyond empirical knowledge but that everything can be rationally criticised.

To Popper, who was an anti-justificationist, traditional philosophy is misled by the false principle of sufficient reason. He thinks that no assumption can ever be or needs ever to be justified, so a lack of justification is not a justification for doubt. Instead, theories should be tested and scrutinised. It is not the goal to bless theories with claims of certainty or justification, but to eliminate errors in them. He writes,
=== Philosophy of arithmetic ===
Popper&#x27;s principle of falsifiability runs into &quot;prima facie&quot; difficulties when the epistemological status of mathematics is considered. It is difficult to conceive how simple statements of arithmetic, such as &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;, could ever be shown to be false. If they are not open to falsification they can not be scientific. If they are not scientific, it needs to be explained how they can be informative about real world objects and events.

Popper&#x27;s solution was an original contribution in the philosophy of mathematics. His idea was that a number statement such as &quot;2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples&quot; can be taken in two senses. In its pure mathematics sense, &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; is logically true and cannot be refuted. Contrastingly, in its applied mathematics sense of it describing the physical behaviour of apples, it can be falsified. This can be done by placing two apples in a container, then proceeding to place another two apples in the same container. If there are five, three, or a number of apples that is not four in said container, the theory that &quot;2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples&quot; is shown to be false. On the contrary, if there are four apples in the container, the theory of numbers is shown to be applicable to reality.

=== Political philosophy ===
In &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; and &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot;, Popper developed a critique of historicism and a defence of the &quot;Open Society&quot;. Popper considered historicism to be the theory that history develops inexorably and necessarily according to knowable general laws towards a determinate end. He argued that this view is the principal theoretical presupposition underpinning most forms of authoritarianism and totalitarianism. He argued that historicism is founded upon mistaken assumptions regarding the nature of scientific law and prediction. Since the growth of human knowledge is a causal factor in the evolution of human history, and since &quot;no society can predict, scientifically, its own future states of knowledge&quot;, it follows, he argued, that there can be no predictive science of human history. For Popper, metaphysical and historical indeterminism go hand in hand.

In his early years Popper was impressed by Marxism, whether of Communists or socialists. An event that happened in 1919 had a profound effect on him: During a riot, caused by the Communists, the police shot several unarmed people, including some of Popper&#x27;s friends, when they tried to free party comrades from prison. The riot had, in fact, been part of a plan by which leaders of the Communist party with connections to Béla Kun tried to take power by a coup; Popper did not know about this at that time. However, he knew that the riot instigators were swayed by the Marxist doctrine that class struggle would produce vastly more dead men than the inevitable revolution brought about as quickly as possible, and so had no scruples to put the life of the rioters at risk to achieve their selfish goal of becoming the future leaders of the working class. This was the start of his later criticism of historicism. Popper began to reject Marxist historicism, which he associated with questionable means, and later socialism, which he associated with placing equality before freedom (to the possible disadvantage of equality).

Popper said that he was a socialist for &quot;several years&quot;, and maintained an interest in egalitarianism, but abandoned it as a whole because socialism was a &quot;beautiful dream&quot;, but, just like egalitarianism, it was incompatible with individual liberty. Popper initially saw totalitarianism as exclusively right-wing in nature, although as early as 1945 in &quot;The Open Society&quot; he was describing Communist parties as giving a weak opposition to fascism due to shared historicism with fascism. Over time, primarily in defence of liberal democracy, Popper began to see Soviet-type communism as a form of totalitarianism, and viewed the main issue of the Cold War as not capitalism versus socialism, but democracy versus totalitarianism. In 1957, Popper would dedicate &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot; to &quot;memory of the countless men, women and children of all creeds or nations or races who fell victims to the fascist and communist belief in Inexorable Laws of Historical Destiny.&quot;

In 1947, Popper co-founded the Mont Pelerin Society, with Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Ludwig von Mises and others, although he did not fully agree with the think tank&#x27;s charter and ideology. Specifically, he unsuccessfully recommended that socialists should be invited to participate, and that emphasis should be put on a hierarchy of humanitarian values rather than advocacy of a free market as envisioned by classical liberalism.

==== The paradox of tolerance ====

Although Popper was an advocate of toleration, he also warned against unlimited tolerance. In &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, he argued:

==== The &quot;conspiracy theory of society&quot; ====
Popper criticized what he termed the &quot;conspiracy theory of society&quot;, the view that powerful people or groups, godlike in their efficacy, are responsible for purposely bringing about all the ills of society. This view cannot be right, Popper argued, because &quot;nothing ever comes off exactly as intended.&quot; According to philosopher David Coady, &quot;Popper has often been cited by critics of conspiracy theories, and his views on the topic continue to constitute an orthodoxy in some circles.&quot; However, philosopher Charles Pigden has pointed out that Popper&#x27;s argument only applies to a very extreme kind of conspiracy theory, not to conspiracy theories generally.

=== Metaphysics ===
==== Truth ====
As early as 1934, Popper wrote of the search for truth as &quot;one of the strongest motives for scientific discovery.&quot; Still, he describes in &quot;Objective Knowledge&quot; (1972) early concerns about the much-criticised notion of truth as correspondence. Then came the semantic theory of truth formulated by the logician Alfred Tarski and published in 1933. Popper wrote of learning in 1935 of the consequences of Tarski&#x27;s theory, to his intense joy. The theory met critical objections to truth as correspondence and thereby rehabilitated it. The theory also seemed, in Popper&#x27;s eyes, to support metaphysical realism and the regulative idea of a search for truth.

According to this theory, the conditions for the truth of a sentence as well as the sentences themselves are part of a metalanguage. So, for example, the sentence &quot;Snow is white&quot; is true if and only if snow is white. Although many philosophers have interpreted, and continue to interpret, Tarski&#x27;s theory as a deflationary theory, Popper refers to it as a theory in which &quot;is true&quot; is replaced with &quot;corresponds to the facts&quot;. He bases this interpretation on the fact that examples such as the one described above refer to two things: assertions and the facts to which they refer. He identifies Tarski&#x27;s formulation of the truth conditions of sentences as the introduction of a &quot;metalinguistic predicate&quot; and distinguishes the following cases:

# &quot;John called&quot; is true.
# &quot;It is true that John called.&quot;

The first case belongs to the metalanguage whereas the second is more likely to belong to the object language. Hence, &quot;it is true that&quot; possesses the logical status of a redundancy. &quot;Is true&quot;, on the other hand, is a predicate necessary for making general observations such as &quot;John was telling the truth about Phillip.&quot;

Upon this basis, along with that of the logical content of assertions (where logical content is inversely proportional to probability), Popper went on to develop his important notion of verisimilitude or &quot;truthlikeness&quot;. The intuitive idea behind verisimilitude is that the assertions or hypotheses of scientific theories can be objectively measured with respect to the amount of truth and falsity that they imply. And, in this way, one theory can be evaluated as more or less true than another on a quantitative basis which, Popper emphasises forcefully, has nothing to do with &quot;subjective probabilities&quot; or other merely &quot;epistemic&quot; considerations.

The simplest mathematical formulation that Popper gives of this concept can be found in the tenth chapter of &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot;. Here he defines it as:

: formula_7

where formula_8 is the verisimilitude of &quot;a&quot;, formula_9 is a measure of the content of the truth of &quot;a&quot;, and formula_10 is a measure of the content of the falsity of &quot;a&quot;.

Popper&#x27;s original attempt to define not just verisimilitude, but an actual measure of it, turned out to be inadequate. However, it inspired a wealth of new attempts.

==== Popper&#x27;s three worlds ====

Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (&quot;Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach&quot;, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the Second World made manifest in the materials of the First World (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind). World Three, he argued, was the product of individual human beings in exactly the same sense that an animal&#x27;s path is the product of individual animals, and thus has an existence and is evolution independent of any individually known subjects. The influence of World Three, in his view, on the individual human mind (World Two) is at least as strong as the influence of World One. In other words, the knowledge held by a given individual mind owes at least as much to the total, accumulated wealth of human knowledge made manifest as to the world of direct experience. As such, the growth of human knowledge could be said to be a function of the independent evolution of World Three.

Many contemporary philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have not embraced Popper&#x27;s Three World conjecture, mostly due to its resemblance to mind–body dualism.

==== Origin and evolution of life ====
The creation–evolution controversy raised the issue of whether creationistic ideas may be legitimately called science. In the debate, both sides and even courts in their decisions have invoked Popper&#x27;s criterion of falsifiability (see Daubert standard). In this context, passages written by Popper are frequently quoted in which he speaks about such issues himself. For example, he famously stated &quot;Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program—a possible framework for testable scientific theories.&quot; He continued:
He noted that theism, presented as explaining adaptation, &quot;was worse than an open admission of failure, for it created the impression that an ultimate explanation had been reached&quot;. Popper later said:
He explained that the difficulty of testing had led some people to describe natural selection as a tautology, and that he too had in the past described the theory as &quot;almost tautological&quot;, and had tried to explain how the theory could be untestable (as is a tautology) and yet of great scientific interest:
Popper summarised his new view as follows:
These frequently quoted passages are only a small part of what Popper wrote on evolution, however, and may give the wrong impression that he mainly discussed questions of its falsifiability. Popper never invented this criterion to give justifiable use of words like science. In fact, Popper stressed that &quot;the last thing I wish to do, however, is to advocate another dogma&quot; and that &quot;what is to be called a &#x27;science&#x27; and who is to be called a &#x27;scientist&#x27; must always remain a matter of convention or decision.&quot; He quotes Menger&#x27;s dictum that &quot;Definitions are dogmas; only the conclusions drawn from them can afford us any new insight&quot; and notes that different definitions of science can be rationally debated and compared:
Popper had his own sophisticated views on evolution that go much beyond what the frequently-quoted passages say. In effect, Popper agreed with some points of both creationists and naturalists, but disagreed with both on crucial aspects. Popper understood the universe as a creative entity that invents new things, including life, but without the necessity of something like a god, especially not one who is pulling strings from behind the curtain. He said that evolution of the genotype must, as the creationists say, work in a goal-directed way but disagreed with their view that it must necessarily be the hand of god that imposes these goals onto the stage of life.

Instead, he formulated the spearhead model of evolution, a version of genetic pluralism. According to this, living organisms have goals, and act according to these goals, each guided by a central control. In its most sophisticated form, this is the brain of humans, but controls also exist in much less sophisticated ways for species of lower complexity, such as the amoeba. This control organ plays a special role in evolution—it is the &quot;spearhead of evolution&quot;. The goals bring the purpose into the world. Mutations in the genes that determine the structure of the control may then cause drastic changes in behaviour, preferences and goals, without having an impact on the organism&#x27;s phenotype. Popper postulates that such purely behavioural changes are less likely to be lethal for the organism compared to drastic changes of the phenotype.

Popper contrasts his views with the notion of the &quot;hopeful monster&quot; that has large phenotype mutations and calls it the &quot;hopeful behavioural monster&quot;. After behaviour has changed radically, small but quick changes of the phenotype follow to make the organism fitter to its changed goals. This way it looks as if the phenotype were changing guided by some invisible hand, while it is merely natural selection working in combination with the new behaviour. For example, according to this hypothesis, the eating habits of the giraffe must have changed before its elongated neck evolved. Popper contrasted this view as &quot;evolution from within&quot; or &quot;active Darwinism&quot; (the organism actively trying to discover new ways of life and being on a quest for conquering new ecological niches), with the naturalistic &quot;evolution from without&quot; (which has the picture of a hostile environment only trying to kill the mostly passive organism, or perhaps segregate some of its groups).

Popper was a key figure encouraging patent lawyer Günter Wächtershäuser to publish his iron–sulfur world hypothesis on abiogenesis and his criticism of &quot;soup&quot; theory.

On the creation-evolution controversy, Popper initially wrote that he considered it

with a footnote to the effect that he
 In his later work, however, when he had developed his own &quot;spearhead model&quot; and &quot;active Darwinism&quot; theories, Popper revised this view and found some validity in the controversy:
==== Free will ====
Popper and John Eccles speculated on the problem of free will for many years, generally agreeing on an interactionist dualist theory of mind. However, although Popper was a body-mind dualist, he did not think that the mind is a substance separate from the body: he thought that mental or psychological properties or aspects of people are distinct from physical ones.

When he gave the second Arthur Holly Compton Memorial Lecture in 1965, Popper revisited the idea of quantum indeterminacy as a source of human freedom. Eccles had suggested that &quot;critically poised neurons&quot; might be influenced by the mind to assist in a decision. Popper criticised Compton&#x27;s idea of amplified quantum events affecting the decision. He wrote:



Popper called not for something between chance and necessity but for a combination of randomness and control to explain freedom, though not yet explicitly in two stages with random chance before the controlled decision, saying, &quot;freedom is not just chance but, rather, the result of a subtle interplay between something almost random or haphazard, and something like a restrictive or selective control.&quot;

Then in his 1977 book with John Eccles, &quot;The Self and its Brain&quot;, Popper finally formulates the two-stage model in a temporal sequence. And he compares free will to Darwinian evolution and natural selection:

=== Religion and God ===
Popper was not a religious man in the formal sense of the word. He neither maintained any link with his Jewish ancestry nor was he an observant Lutheran. However, he did consider that every person including himself, was religious in the sense of believing in something more important and beyond us through which we can transcend ourselves. Popper called this something a Third World. In an interview that Popper gave in 1969 with the condition that it should be kept secret until after his death, he summarised his position on God as follows: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether God exists or not (...) Some forms of atheism are arrogant and ignorant and should be rejected, but agnosticism—to admit that we don&#x27;t know and to search—is all right. (...) When I look at what I call the gift of life, I feel a gratitude which is in tune with some religious ideas of God. However, the moment I even speak of it, I am embarrassed that I may do something wrong to God in talking about God.&quot; Aged fifteen, after reading Spinoza (at the suggestion of his father), Popper recounts that &quot;it gave me a lifetime&#x27;s dislike of theorizing about God&quot;.

In 1936, applying to the Academic Assistance Council to leave Austria, he described himself as &quot;Protestant, namely evangelical but of Jewish origin.&quot; Responding to the question of whether he wanted religious communities
approached on his behalf, opposite the Jewish Orthodox
section he wrote &quot;NO&quot;, underlining it twice.

Popper objected to organised religion, saying &quot;it tends to use the name of God in vain&quot;, noting the danger of fanaticism because of religious conflicts: &quot;The whole thing goes back to myths which, though they may have a kernel of truth, are untrue. Why then should the Jewish myth be true and the Indian and Egyptian myths not be true?&quot;

Ethical issues always constituted an important part of the background to Popper&#x27;s philosophy. In later life he discussed ethics rarely, and religious questions hardly at all, but he sympathized with the religious stance of others, and was not prepared to endorse various “humanist and secular offensives”. For Popper religion was definitely not science, but “because something isn’t science, however, does not mean it is meaningless”.

In a letter unrelated to the interview, he stressed his tolerant attitude: &quot;Although I am not for religion, I do think that we should show respect for anybody who believes honestly.&quot;

== Influence ==
Popper helped to establish the philosophy of science as an autonomous discipline within philosophy, both through his own prolific and influential works and through his influence on his contemporaries and students. In 1946, Popper founded the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics (LSE) and there lectured and influenced both Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend, two of the foremost philosophers of science in the next generation. (Lakatos significantly modified Popper&#x27;s position, and Feyerabend repudiated it entirely, but the work of both was deeply influenced by Popper and engaged with many of the problems that Popper set.)

Although there is some dispute as to the matter of influence, Popper had a longstanding and close friendship with economist Friedrich Hayek, who was also brought to LSE from Vienna. Each found support and similarities in the other&#x27;s work, citing each other often, though not without qualification. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated, &quot;I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski.&quot; Popper dedicated his &quot;Conjectures and Refutations&quot; to Hayek. For his part, Hayek dedicated a collection of papers, &quot;Studies in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics&quot;, to Popper, and in 1982 said, &quot;ever since his &quot;Logik der Forschung&quot; first came out in 1934, I have been a complete adherent to his general theory of methodology.&quot;

Popper also had long and mutually influential friendships with art historian Ernst Gombrich, biologist Peter Medawar, and neuroscientist John Carew Eccles. The German jurist Reinhold Zippelius uses Popper&#x27;s method of &quot;trial and error&quot; in his legal philosophy. Peter Medawar called him &quot;incomparably the greatest philosopher of science that has ever been&quot;.

Popper&#x27;s influence, both through his work in philosophy of science and through his political philosophy, has also extended beyond the academy. One of Popper&#x27;s students at LSE was George Soros, who later became a billionaire investor and among whose philanthropic foundations is the Open Society Institute, a think-tank named in honour of Popper&#x27;s &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;. Soros revised his own philosophy, differing from some of Popper&#x27;s epistemological assumptions, in a lecture entitled &quot;Open Society&quot; given at Central European University on 28 October 2009:

== Criticism ==
Most criticisms of Popper&#x27;s philosophy are of the falsification, or error elimination, element in his account of problem solving. Popper presents falsifiability as both an ideal and as an important principle in a practical method of effective human problem solving; as such, the current conclusions of science are stronger than pseudo-sciences or non-sciences, insofar as they have survived this particularly vigorous selection method.

He does not argue that any such conclusions are therefore true, or that this describes the actual methods of any particular scientist. Rather, it is recommended as an essential principle of methodology that, if enacted by a system or community, will lead to slow but steady progress of a sort (relative to how well the system or community enacts the method). It has been suggested that Popper&#x27;s ideas are often mistaken for a hard logical account of truth because of the historical co-incidence of their appearing at the same time as logical positivism, the followers of which mistook his aims for their own.

The Quine–Duhem thesis argues that it is impossible to test a single hypothesis on its own, since each one comes as part of an environment of theories. Thus we can only say that the whole package of relevant theories has been collectively falsified, but cannot conclusively say which element of the package must be replaced. An example of this is given by the discovery of the planet Neptune: when the motion of Uranus was found not to match the predictions of Newton&#x27;s laws, the theory &quot;There are seven planets in the solar system&quot; was rejected, and not Newton&#x27;s laws themselves. Popper discussed this critique of naive falsificationism in Chapters 3 and 4 of &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot;.

The philosopher Thomas Kuhn writes in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962) that he places an emphasis on anomalous experiences similar to that which Popper places on falsification. However, he adds that anomalous experiences cannot be identified with falsification, and questions whether theories could be falsified in the manner suggested by Popper. Kuhn argues in &quot;The Essential Tension&quot; (1977) that while Popper was correct that psychoanalysis cannot be considered a science, there are better reasons for drawing that conclusion than those Popper provided. Popper&#x27;s student Imre Lakatos attempted to reconcile Kuhn&#x27;s work with falsificationism by arguing that science progresses by the falsification of &quot;research programs&quot; rather than the more specific universal statements of naive falsificationism.

Popper claimed to have recognised already in the 1934 version of his &quot;Logic of Discovery&quot; a fact later stressed by Kuhn, &quot;that scientists necessarily develop their ideas within a definite theoretical framework&quot;, and to that extent to have anticipated Kuhn&#x27;s central point about &quot;normal science&quot;. However, Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn&#x27;s relativism, this criticism being at the heart of the Kuhn-Popper debate. Also, in his collection &quot;Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1963), Popper writes,
Another objection is that it is not always possible to demonstrate falsehood definitively, especially if one is using statistical criteria to evaluate a null hypothesis. More generally it is not always clear, if evidence contradicts a hypothesis, that this is a sign of flaws in the hypothesis rather than of flaws in the evidence. However, this is a misunderstanding of what Popper&#x27;s philosophy of science sets out to do. Rather than offering a set of instructions that merely need to be followed diligently to achieve science, Popper makes it clear in &quot;The Logic of Scientific Discovery&quot; that his belief is that the resolution of conflicts between hypotheses and observations can only be a matter of the collective judgment of scientists, in each individual case.

In &quot;Science Versus Crime&quot;, Houck writes that Popper&#x27;s falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like &quot;for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt&quot;. The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that logical positivism&#x27;s verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel&#x27;s examples fall under this category. For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature.

An early adversary of Popper&#x27;s critical rationalism, Karl-Otto Apel attempted a comprehensive refutation of Popper&#x27;s philosophy. In &quot;Transformation der Philosophie&quot; (1973), Apel charged Popper with being guilty of, amongst other things, a pragmatic contradiction.

The philosopher Adolf Grünbaum argues in &quot;The Foundations of Psychoanalysis&quot; (1984) that Popper&#x27;s view that psychoanalytic theories, even in principle, cannot be falsified is incorrect. The philosopher Roger Scruton argues in &quot;Sexual Desire&quot; (1986) that Popper was mistaken to claim that Freudian theory implies no testable observation and therefore does not have genuine predictive power. Scruton maintains that Freudian theory has both &quot;theoretical terms&quot; and &quot;empirical content&quot;. He points to the example of Freud&#x27;s theory of repression, which in his view has &quot;strong empirical content&quot; and implies testable consequences. Nevertheless, Scruton also concluded that Freudian theory is not genuinely scientific. The philosopher Charles Taylor accuses Popper of exploiting his worldwide fame as an epistemologist to diminish the importance of philosophers of the 20th-century continental tradition. According to Taylor, Popper&#x27;s criticisms are completely baseless, but they are received with an attention and respect that Popper&#x27;s &quot;intrinsic worth hardly merits&quot;.

The philosopher John Gray argues that Popper&#x27;s account of scientific method would have prevented the theories of Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein from being accepted. However, Gray&#x27;s criticism with regards to Einstein is at odds with the fact that Popper frequently used Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity as a case study of how the principle of falsifiability works in practice.

The philosopher and psychologist Michel ter Hark writes in &quot;Popper, Otto Selz and the Rise of Evolutionary Epistemology&quot; (2004) that Popper took some of his ideas from his tutor, the German psychologist Otto Selz. Selz never published his ideas, partly because of the rise of Nazism, which forced him to quit his work in 1933 and prohibited any reference to his ideas. Popper, the historian of ideas and his scholarship, is criticised in some academic quarters for his treatment of Plato and Hegel.

<text>, officially , were a part of the Japanese Special Attack Units of military aviators who flew suicide attacks for the Empire of Japan against Allied naval vessels in the closing stages of the Pacific campaign of World War II, intending to destroy warships more effectively than with conventional air attacks. About 3,800 &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots died during the war in attacks that killed more than 7,000 Allied naval personnel, sank several dozen warships, and damaged scores more. 

&quot;Kamikaze&quot; aircraft were pilot-guided explosive missiles, either purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a &quot;body attack&quot; (&quot;tai-atari&quot;) in aircraft loaded with bombs, torpedoes, and/or other explosives. About 19 percent of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks were successful. The Japanese considered the goal of damaging or sinking large numbers of Allied ships to be a just reason for suicide attacks. By late 1944, Allied qualitative and quantitative superiority over the Japanese in both aircrew and aircraft meant that &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks were more accurate than conventional airstrikes, and often caused more damage. Some &quot;kamikazes&quot; hit their targets even after their aircraft had been crippled.

The attacks began in October 1944, at a time when the war was looking increasingly bleak for the Japanese. They had lost several decisive battles; many of their best pilots had been killed, and skilled replacements could not be trained fast enough; their aircraft were becoming outdated; and they had lost command of the air and sea. Japan was losing pilots faster than it could train quality replacements, and the nation&#x27;s industrial capacity was rapidly diminishing relative to that of the Allies. These factors, along with Japan&#x27;s unwillingness to surrender, led to the institutionalization of &quot;kamikaze&quot; tactics as a core aspect of Japanese air warfare strategy as Allied forces advanced towards the home islands.

A tradition of death instead of defeat, capture, and shame was deeply entrenched in Japanese military culture; one of the primary values in the samurai way of life and the &quot;Bushido&quot; code was loyalty and honor until death. In addition to &quot;kamikazes&quot;, the Japanese military also used or made plans for non-aerial Japanese Special Attack Units, including those involving Kairyu (submarines), Kaiten (human torpedoes), Shinyo speedboats, and Fukuryu divers.

==Definition and origin==
The Japanese word &quot;kamikaze&quot; is usually translated as &quot;divine wind&quot; (&quot;kami&quot; is the word for &quot;god&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, or &quot;divinity&quot;, and &quot;kaze&quot; for &quot;wind&quot;). The word originated from &quot;Makurakotoba&quot; of waka poetry modifying &quot;Ise&quot; and has been used since August 1281 to refer to the major typhoons that dispersed Mongol-Koryo fleets which invaded Japan under Kublai Khan in 1274 and 1281.

A Japanese monoplane that made a record-breaking flight from Tokyo to London in 1937 for the Asahi newspaper group was named &quot;Kamikaze&quot;. She was a prototype for the Mitsubishi Ki-15 (&quot;Babs&quot;).

In Japanese, the formal term used for units carrying out suicide attacks during 1944–1945 is &quot;tokubetsu kōgekitai&quot; (特別攻撃隊), which literally means &quot;special attack unit&quot;. This is usually abbreviated to &quot;tokkōtai&quot; (特攻隊). More specifically, air suicide attack units from the Imperial Japanese Navy were officially called &quot;shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai&quot; (神風特別攻撃隊, &quot;divine wind special attack units&quot;). &quot;Shinpū&quot; is the on-reading (&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; or Chinese-derived pronunciation) of the same characters as the kun-reading (&quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; or Japanese pronunciation) &quot;kamikaze&quot; in Japanese. During World War II, the pronunciation &quot;kamikaze&quot; was used only informally in the Japanese press in relation to suicide attacks, but after the war, this usage gained acceptance worldwide and was re-imported into Japan.

==History==

===Background===
Before the official formation of &quot;kamikaze&quot; units, pilots had made deliberate crashes as a last resort when their aircraft had suffered severe damage and they did not want to risk being captured or wanted to do as much damage to the enemy as possible, since they were crashing anyway. Such situations occurred in both the Axis and Allied air forces. Axell and Kase see these suicides as &quot;individual, impromptu decisions by men who were mentally prepared to die&quot;.

One example of this may have occurred on 7 December 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor. First Lieutenant Fusata Iida&#x27;s aircraft had taken a hit and had started leaking fuel when he apparently used it to make a suicide attack on Naval Air Station Kaneohe. Before taking off, he had told his men that if his aircraft were to become badly damaged he would crash it into a &quot;worthy enemy target&quot;. In late February 1942, Imperial Japanese Headquarters mentioned, for the first time, that a &quot;human bomb&quot; or &quot;Taiatari&quot;, had destroyed a US aircraft carrier. It was explained that the term, which meant &quot;thrust of body,&quot; was the practice of Japanese airmen to dive with the full load of bombs on to their target. Another possible example occurred at the Battle of Midway when a damaged American bomber flew at the &#x27;s bridge but missed. During the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal the US flagship, , was heavily damaged during a Japanese bombing raid when a large twin-engined Japanese Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; medium bomber, which was in flames from anti-aircraft fire, most likely intentionally crashed into her backup conning tower, destroying almost all of the backup command equipment for the flagship. Most of the officers and men stationed there, including the executive officer, were killed or wounded. This de facto &quot;kamikaze&quot; strike greatly changed the course of what was to happen during the infamous &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; battle 12 hours later.

The carrier battles in 1942, particularly the Battle of Midway, inflicted irreparable damage on the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS), such that it could no longer field a large number of fleet carriers with well-trained aircrews. Japanese planners had based their assumptions on a quick war and lacked comprehensive programs to replace mounting losses to ships, pilots, and sailors. Prior to the war, Japanese carrier pilots were carefully selected after undergoing years of training in specialized schools, which produced high-quality aircrew but at low volume; the Japanese military never meaningfully expanded or restructured this training pipeline. The Battle of Midway, the Solomon Islands campaign (1942–1945) and the New Guinea campaign (1942–1945)notably the naval battles of the Eastern Solomons (August 1942) and Santa Cruz Islands (October 1942)decimated the IJNAS veteran aircrews, and replacing their combat experience proved impossible. 

During 1943–1944, US forces steadily advanced toward Japan. Newer US-made aircraft, especially the Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair, outclassed and soon outnumbered Japan&#x27;s fighters. Tropical diseases, as well as shortages of spare parts and fuel, made operations more and more difficult for the IJNAS. By the Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 1944), the Japanese had to make do with obsolete aircraft and inexperienced aviators in the fight against better-trained and more experienced US Navy airmen who flew radar-directed combat air patrols. The Japanese lost over 400 carrier-based aircraft and pilots in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, effectively destroying the IJN&#x27;s carrier air arm. Allied aviators called the action the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;.

On 19 June 1944, aircraft from the carrier approached a US task group. According to some accounts, two made suicide attacks, one of which hit .

The important Japanese base of Saipan fell to the Allied forces on 15 July 1944. Its capture provided adequate forward bases that enabled US air forces using the Boeing B-29 Superfortress to strike at the Japanese home islands. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese High Command predicted that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines, strategically important to Tokyo because of the islands&#x27; location between the oilfields of Southeast Asia and Japan.

===Beginnings===
Captain Motoharu Okamura, in charge of the Tateyama Base in Tokyo, as well as the 341st Air Group Home, was, according to some sources, the first officer to officially propose &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack tactics. With his superiors, he arranged the first investigations into the plausibility and mechanisms of intentional suicide attacks on 15 June 1944.

In August 1944, it was announced by the Domei news agency that a flight instructor named Takeo Tagata was training pilots in Taiwan for suicide missions.

One source claims that the first &quot;kamikaze&quot; mission occurred on 13 September 1944. A group of pilots from the army&#x27;s 31st Fighter Squadron on Negros Island decided to launch a suicide attack the following morning. First Lieutenant Takeshi Kosai and a sergeant were selected. Two bombs were attached to two fighters, and the pilots took off before dawn, planning to crash into carriers. They never returned, but there is no record of a &quot;kamikaze&quot; hitting an Allied ship that day.

According to some sources, on 14 October 1944, was hit by a deliberately crashed Japanese aircraft.

Rear Admiral Masafumi Arima, the commander of the 26th Air Flotilla (part of the 11th Air Fleet), is sometimes credited with inventing the &quot;kamikaze&quot; tactic. Arima personally led an attack by a Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; twin-engined bomber against a large , , near Leyte Gulf, on or about 15 October 1944. Arima was killed and part of an aircraft hit &quot;Franklin&quot;. The Japanese high command and propagandas seized on Arima&#x27;s example. He was promoted posthumously to vice admiral and was given official credit for making the first &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack. 

On 17 October 1944, Allied forces assaulted Suluan Island, beginning the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s 1st Air Fleet, based at Manila, was assigned the task of assisting the Japanese ships that would attempt to destroy Allied forces in Leyte Gulf. That unit had only 41 aircraft: 34 Mitsubishi A6M Zero (&quot;Zeke&quot;) carrier-based fighters, three Nakajima B6N &quot;Tenzan&quot; (&quot;Jill&quot;) torpedo bombers, one Mitsubishi G4M (&quot;Betty&quot;) and two Yokosuka P1Y &quot;Ginga&quot; (&quot;Frances&quot;) land-based bombers, and one additional reconnaissance aircraft. The task facing the Japanese air forces seemed impossible. The 1st Air Fleet commandant, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi, decided to form a suicide offensive force, the Special Attack Unit. In a meeting on 19 October at Mabalacat Airfield (known to the US military as Clark Air Base) near Manila, Onishi told officers of the 201st Flying Group headquarters: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there would be any other certain way to carry out the operation [to hold the Philippines] than to put a 250 kg bomb on a Zero and let it crash into a US carrier, in order to disable her for a week.&quot;

===First unit===
Commander Asaichi Tamai asked a group of 23 talented student pilots, all of whom he had trained, to volunteer for the special attack force. All of the pilots raised both of their hands, volunteering to join the operation. Later, Tamai asked Lieutenant Yukio Seki to command the special attack force. Seki is said to have closed his eyes, lowered his head, and thought for ten seconds before saying: &quot;Please do appoint me to the post.&quot; Seki became the 24th &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilot to be chosen. He later said: &quot;Japan&#x27;s future is bleak if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots&quot; and &quot;I am not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire ... I am going because I was ordered to.&quot;

The names of the four subunits within the &quot;Kamikaze&quot; Special Attack Force were &quot;Unit Shikishima&quot;, &quot;Unit Yamato&quot;, &quot;Unit Asahi&quot; and &quot;Unit Yamazakura&quot;. These names were taken from a patriotic death poem, &quot;Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana&quot; by the Japanese classical scholar, Motoori Norinaga. The poem reads:

A less literal translation is:
Ōnishi, addressing this unit, told them that their nobility of spirit would keep the homeland from ruin even in defeat.

===Leyte Gulf: the first attacks===

Several suicide attacks, carried out during the invasion of Leyte by Japanese pilots from units other than the Special Attack Force, have been described as the first &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. Early on 21 October 1944, a Japanese aircraft deliberately crashed into the foremast of the heavy cruiser . This aircraft was possibly either an Aichi D3A dive bomber, from an unidentified unit of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, or a Mitsubishi Ki-51 of the 6th Flying Brigade, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. The attack killed 30 personnel, including the cruiser&#x27;s captain, Emile Dechaineux, and wounded 64, including the Australian force commander, Commodore John Collins. The Australian official history of the war claimed that this was the first &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on an Allied ship. Other sources disagree because it was not a planned attack by a member of the Special Attack Force and was most likely undertaken on the pilot&#x27;s own initiative.

The sinking of the ocean tug on 24 October is listed in some sources as the first ship lost to a &quot;kamikaze&quot; strike, but the attack occurred before the first mission of the Special Attack Force (on 25 October) and the aircraft used, a Mitsubishi G4M, was not flown by the original four Special Attack Squadrons.

On 25 October 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the &quot;Kamikaze&quot; Special Attack Force carried out its first mission. Five A6M Zeros, led by Lieutenant Seki, were escorted to the target by leading Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa where they attacked several escort carriers. One Zero attempted to hit the bridge of but instead exploded on the port catwalk and cartwheeled into the sea. Two others dived at but were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. The last two, Seki among them, ran at . Seki however, under heavy fire and trailing smoke, aborted the attack on &quot;White Plains&quot; and instead banked toward , diving into the flight deck, where his bomb caused fires that resulted in the bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier.

By 26 October day&#x27;s end, 55 &quot;kamikazes&quot; from the Special Attack Force had also damaged three large escort carriers: , , and (which had
taken a &quot;kamikaze&quot; strike forward of its aft elevator the day before); and three smaller escorts: USS &quot;White Plains&quot;, , and &quot;Kitkun Bay&quot;. In total, seven carriers were hit, as well as 40 other ships (5 sunk, 23 heavily damaged and 12 moderately damaged).

===Main wave of attacks===
Early successes—such as the sinking of —were followed by an immediate expansion of the program, and over the next few months over 2,000 aircraft made such attacks.

When Japan began to suffer intense strategic bombing by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, the Japanese military attempted to use suicide attacks against this threat. During the northern hemisphere winter of 1944–45, the IJAAF formed the 47th Air Regiment, also known as the &quot;Shinten&quot; Special Unit (&quot;Shinten Seiku Tai&quot;) at Narimasu Airfield, Nerima, Tokyo, to defend the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The unit was equipped with Nakajima Ki-44 &quot;Shoki&quot; (&quot;Tojo&quot;) fighters, whose pilots were instructed to collide with United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29s approaching Japan. Targeting the aircraft proved to be much less successful and practical than attacks against warships, as the bombers made for much faster, more maneuverable, and smaller targets. The B-29 also had formidable defensive weaponry, so suicide attacks against B-29s demanded considerable piloting skill to be successful, which worked against the very purpose of using expendable pilots. Even encouraging capable pilots to bail out before impact was ineffective because vital personnel were often lost when they mistimed their exits and were killed as a result.

On 11 March, the US carrier was hit and moderately damaged at Ulithi Atoll, in the Caroline Islands, by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; that had flown almost from Japan, in a mission called Operation Tan No. 2. On 20 March, the submarine survived a hit from an aircraft just off Japan.

Purpose-built &quot;kamikazes&quot;, opposed to converted fighters and dive-bombers, were also being constructed. Ensign Mitsuo Ohta had suggested that piloted glider bombs, carried within range of targets by a mother aircraft, should be developed. The First Naval Air Technical Bureau (&quot;Kugisho&quot;) in Yokosuka refined Ohta&#x27;s idea. Yokosuka MXY-7 &quot;Ohka&quot; rocket-powered aircraft, launched from bombers, were first deployed in &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks from March 1945. US personnel gave them the derisive nickname &quot;&quot;Baka&quot; Bombs&quot; (&quot;baka&quot; is Japanese for &quot;idiot&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;). The Nakajima Ki-115 &quot;Tsurugi&quot; was a simple, easily built propeller aircraft with a wooden airframe that used engines from existing stocks. Its non-retractable landing gear was jettisoned shortly after takeoff for a suicide mission, recovered, and reused. Obsolete aircraft such as Yokosuka K5Y biplane trainers were also converted to &quot;kamikazes&quot;. During 1945, the Japanese military began stockpiling &quot;Tsurugi&quot;, Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka, other aircraft and suicide boats for use against Allied forces expected to invade Japan. The invasion never happened, and few were ever used.

===Allied defensive tactics===
In early 1945, US Navy aviator Commander John Thach, already famous for developing effective aerial tactics against the Japanese such as the Thach Weave, developed a defensive strategy against &quot;kamikazes&quot; called the &quot;big blue blanket&quot; to establish Allied air supremacy well away from the carrier force. This recommended combat air patrols (CAP) that were larger and operated farther from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least from the main body of the fleet to provide earlier radar interception and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers. This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets. A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing Japanese runways, using delayed-action bombs making repairs more difficult.

Late in 1944, the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) used the high-altitude performance of its Supermarine Seafires (the naval version of the Spitfire) on combat air patrol duties. Seafires were involved in countering the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks during the Iwo Jima landings and beyond. The Seafires&#x27; best day was 15 August 1945, shooting down eight attacking aircraft with a single loss.

Allied pilots were more experienced, better trained and flying superior aircraft, making the poorly trained &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots easy targets. The US Fast Carrier Task Force alone could bring over 1,000 fighter aircraft into play. Allied pilots became adept at destroying enemy aircraft before they struck ships.

Allied gunners had begun to develop techniques to negate &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. Light rapid-fire anti-aircraft weapons such as the 20 mm Oerlikon autocannons were still useful though the 40 mm Bofors was preferred; their high rate of fire and quick training remained advantageous, but they lacked the punch to take down a kamikaze bearing down on the ship they defended. It was found that heavy anti-aircraft guns such as the 5&quot;/38 caliber gun (127 mm) were the most effective as they had sufficient firepower to destroy aircraft at a safe range from the ship, which was preferable since even a heavily damaged &quot;kamikaze&quot; could reach its target. The speedy &quot;Ohkas&quot; presented a very difficult problem for anti-aircraft fire, since their velocity made fire control extremely difficult. By 1945, large numbers of anti-aircraft shells with radiofrequency proximity fuzes, on average seven times more effective than regular shells, became available, and the US Navy recommended their use against &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks.

===Final phase===

The peak period of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack frequency came during April–June 1945 at the Battle of Okinawa. On 6 April 1945, waves of aircraft made hundreds of attacks in Operation Kikusui (&quot;floating chrysanthemums&quot;). At Okinawa, &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks focused at first on Allied destroyers on picket duty, and then on the carriers in the middle of the fleet. Suicide attacks by aircraft or boats at Okinawa sank or put out of action at least 30 US warships and at least three US merchant ships, along with some from other Allied forces. The attacks expended 1,465 aircraft. Many warships of all classes were damaged, some severely, but no aircraft carriers, battleships or cruisers were sunk by &quot;kamikaze&quot; at Okinawa. Most of the ships lost were destroyers or smaller vessels, especially those on picket duty. The destroyer earned the nickname &quot;The Ship That Would Not Die&quot; after surviving six &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks and four bomb hits during this battle.

American carriers, with their wooden flight decks, appeared to suffer more damage from &quot;kamikaze&quot; hits than the armored-decked carriers of the British Pacific Fleet. American carriers also suffered considerably heavier casualties from &quot;kamikaze&quot; strikes; for instance, 389 men were killed in one attack on , greater than the combined number of fatalities suffered on all six Royal Navy armored carriers from all forms of attack during the entire war. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; were both hit (in &quot;Franklin&#x27;s&quot; case, by a dive bomber, not a &quot;kamikaze&quot;) while conducting operations with fully fueled and armed aircraft spotted on deck for takeoff, an extremely vulnerable state for any carrier. Eight &quot;kamikaze&quot; hits on five British carriers resulted in only 20 deaths while a combined total of 15 bomb hits, most of weight or greater, and one torpedo hit on four carriers caused 193 fatal casualties earlier in the war—striking proof of the protective value of the armored flight deck.

The resilience of well-armored vessels was shown on 4 May, just after 11:30, when there was a wave of suicide attacks against the British Pacific Fleet. One Japanese aircraft made a steep dive from &quot;a great height&quot; at the carrier and was engaged by anti-aircraft guns. Although the &quot;kamikaze&quot; was hit by gunfire, it managed to drop a bomb that detonated on the flight deck, making a crater long, wide and deep. A long steel splinter speared down through the hangar deck and the main boiler room (where it ruptured a steam line) before coming to rest in a fuel tank near the aircraft park, where it started a major fire. Eight personnel were killed and 47 were wounded. One Corsair and ten Grumman Avengers were destroyed. The fires were gradually brought under control, and the crater in the deck was repaired with concrete and steel plate. By 17:00, Corsairs were able to land. On 9 May, &quot;Formidable&quot; was again damaged by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, as were the carrier and the battleship . The British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight operations in just hours, while their American counterparts took a few days or even months, as observed by a US Navy liaison officer on who commented: &quot;When a &quot;kamikaze&quot; hits a US carrier it means six months of repair at Pearl Harbor. When a &quot;kamikaze&quot; hits a Limey carrier it&#x27;s just a case of &#x27;Sweepers, man your brooms&#x27;.&quot;

Twin-engine aircraft were occasionally used in &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. For example, Mitsubishi Ki-67 &quot;Hiryū&quot; (&quot;Peggy&quot;) medium bombers, based on Formosa, undertook &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks on Allied forces off Okinawa, while a pair of Kawasaki Ki-45 &quot;Toryu&quot; (&quot;Nick&quot;) heavy fighters caused enough damage for the destroyer to be scuttled. The last ship in the war to be sunk, the , was on a radar picket line off Okinawa when she was struck by an obsolete wood-and-fabric Yokosuka K5Y biplane.

During the final stage of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army aviation employed numbers of kamikaze airstrikes against the Red Army during the Soviet–Japanese War in 1945. Between 9 August and 2 September 1945, several airstrikes involving kamikaze pilots were recorded. On 18 August, a Japanese Ki-45 flown by Lieutenant Yoshira Tsiohara attacked a tanker in the port of Vladivostok. The plane was shot down and the pilot was killed. He was found to have orders to attack the largest tanker in Vladivostok, and if he failed, to ram the biggest house in the city. On the same day, the Soviet minesweeper &quot;KT-152&quot; was sunk during the Battle of Shumshu. It is believed to have been attacked by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;. In the middle of August the Japanese military planned to dispatch a group of 30 &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots from Japan to Korea to attack Soviet warships, but the Japanese leadership decided to surrender and the operation was cancelled.

&quot;Kamikazes&quot; also operated against Red Army ground units. On August 10, three &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacked a tank column of the 20th Guards Tank Brigade. The paratroopers succeeded in shooting down two of the attacking aircraft, while the third crashed into a tank. During 12–13 August, 14 Japanese planes, including &quot;kamikazes&quot;, targeted tanks of the 5th Guards Tank Corps. Soviet fighter aviation, which managed to destroy three enemy aircraft and an anti-aircraft artillery which lost two planes participated in repulsing the air raids. Nine &quot;kamikazes&quot; crashed without hitting their targets. Damage from these attacks was negligible.

On 17 August, the Kwantung Army command ordered its units to surrender, but some of the pilots disobeyed and the Japanese air attacks continued. On 18 August, convoys of the 20th and 21st Armored Brigade were attacked. The kamikazes traded six of their aircraft for a tank and a couple of cars. The &quot;kamikazes&quot; also flew solo. On 18 August, several ammunition resupply vehicles carrying ammunition for BM-13 were destroyed by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; in the Tao&#x27;an area. The personnel were unharmed, as they managed to evade the raid. On 19 August, nine aircraft raided the tanks of the 21st Guards Tank Brigade. Seven were shot down, but two planes broke through; one tank was destroyed and the other damaged. About the raid, the author of the book &quot;Tanker on a foreign vehicle&quot; D. Loza recalls six Japanese aircraft attacked the convoy, which damaged one Sherman tank and destroyed a medical vehicle. Japanese commanders ordered weapons depots to be secured and the propellers of aircraft on airfields to be removed to stop these sorties. Supposedly, the &quot;kamikazes&quot; carried out more than 50 suicide attacks against the Soviet Red Army in August 1945. That is the number of aircraft the Japanese attributed to &quot;other losses&quot;. Overall, the &quot;kamikaze&quot; airstrikes proved ineffective and had little or no effect on the Red Army during the Soviet–Japanese War.

Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, the commander of the IJN 5th Air Fleet based in Kyushu, participated in one of the final &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks on American ships on 15 August 1945, hours after Japan&#x27;s announced surrender.

On 19 August 1945, 11 young officers under Second Lieutenant Hitoshi Imada, attached to the 675th Manchuria Detachment, accompanied by two women of their engagement, left the Daikosan airfield and made a final aerial suicide attack against one of the Soviet armored units that had invaded Manchuria known as the Shinshu Fumetsu Special Attack Corps (Japanese: 神州不滅特別攻撃隊), The last &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks were recorded on 20 August 1945.
Shortly afterward, the main strength of the Japanese Army began to lay down its arms in surrender per the Emperor&#x27;s broadcast. The Soviet–Japanese War, and World War II, had come to an end.

At the time of the surrender, the Japanese had more than 9,000 aircraft in the home islands available for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, and more than 5,000 had already been specially fitted for suicide attack to resist the planned either American or Soviet invasion.

==Effects==
As the end of the war approached, the Allies did not suffer more serious significant losses, despite having far more ships and facing a greater intensity of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. Although causing some of the heaviest casualties on US carriers in 1945 (particularly as &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was unlucky to get hit with fueled and armed aircraft on deck), the IJN had sacrificed 2,525 &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots and the IJAAF 1,387 without successfully sinking any fleet carriers, cruisers, or battleships. This was far more than the IJN had lost in 1942 when it sank or crippled three US fleet carriers (albeit without inflicting significant casualties). In 1942, when US Navy vessels were scarce, the temporary absence of key warships from the combat zone would tie up operational initiatives. By 1945, however, the US Navy was large enough that damaged ships could be detached back home for repair without much hampering the fleet&#x27;s operational capability. The only US surface losses were escort carriers, destroyers, and smaller ships, all of which lacked the armor protection or capability to sustain heavy damage. Overall, the &quot;kamikazes&quot; were unable to turn the tide of the war and stop the Allied invasion.

While on paper it may appear that &quot;kamikaze&quot; and &quot;kamikaze&quot;-assisted attacks at Okinawa only managed to sink smaller ships like destroyers, the reality is different. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; raids often included escort fighters and conventional bombers piloted by skilled aviators who were not intended to execute suicide strikes. These coordinated groups, such as the one that paved the way for conventional bombers to successfully strike the fleet carrier &quot;Franklin&quot;, were crucial. In fact, three large fleet carriers—&quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, and —were so heavily damaged by &quot;kamikaze&quot;-related attacks that they were knocked out for the remainder of the war.

For the Japanese this was not much different than sinking them, operationally speaking. For each of the heavily damaged aircraft carriers dozens of aircraft were destroyed that would have been impossible to be shot down by any Japanese forces via dogfights or anti-aircraft weapons at this stage of the war. &quot;Franklin&quot; lost 59 planes, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; lost 78 planes, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; lost 25 planes in the Japanese attacks that ended the war for them. There were more lost planes on these three carriers alone (not including the numerous other successful strikes on other Allied carriers during the Battle of Okinawa) than the United States lost in the entire Battle of Midway. &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; also both had the first and third largest fatalities on sunken or damaged US aircraft carriers in World War II and were the only &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers to never serve on active duty after World War II while &quot;Enterprise&quot; was mothballed soon after World War II despite all three of them receiving repairs back in the United States. Numerous other larger-than-destroyer warships were so heavily damaged that they also were knocked out for the rest of the war and decommissioned shortly after World War II.

The Japanese &quot;kamikazes&quot; were so relentless at Okinawa that United States Fifth Fleet commander Admiral Raymond A. Spruance&#x27;s flagships were struck two separate times ( was hit in March and had to retire for repairs which forced him to transfer to which was also hit in May). Fast Carrier Task Force commander Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher and his chief of staff Commodore Arleigh Burke were yards away from getting killed or wounded by &quot;kamikazes&quot; on his flagship &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, which killed three of Mitscher&#x27;s staff officers and eleven of his enlisted staff members and also destroyed his flag cabin along with all of his uniforms, personal papers, and possessions. Just three days later Mitscher&#x27;s new flagship &quot;Enterprise&quot; was also struck by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, forcing him to have to change his flagship yet again.

Spruance later wrote about the effectiveness of &quot;kamikazes&quot;:

In the immediate aftermath of &quot;kamikaze&quot; strikes, British fleet carriers with their armoured flight decks recovered more quickly compared to their US counterparts. Post-war analysis showed that some British carriers such as HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; suffered structural damage that led to them being scrapped, as being beyond economic repair. Britain&#x27;s post-war economic situation played a role in the decision to not repair damaged carriers, while even seriously damaged American carriers such as USS &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; were repaired, although they were then mothballed or sold off as surplus after World War II without re-entering service.

The exact number of ships sunk is a matter of debate. According to a wartime Japanese propaganda announcement, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195, and according to a Japanese tally, &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks accounted for up to 80% of the US losses in the final phase of the war in the Pacific. In a 2004 book, &quot;World War II&quot;, the historians Willmott, Cross, and Messenger stated that more than 70 US vessels were &quot;sunk or damaged beyond repair&quot; by &quot;kamikazes&quot;.

According to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, from October 1944 until the end of the war, 2,550 Kamikaze missions were flown with only 475 (or 18.6%) achieving a hit or a damaging near miss. Warships of all types were damaged including 12 aircraft carriers, 15 battleships, and 16 light and escort carriers. However, no ship larger than an escort carrier was sunk. Approximately 45 ships were sunk, the bulk of which were destroyers. To the United States, the losses were of such concern that more than 2,000 B-29 sorties were diverted from attacking Japanese cities and industries to striking Kamikaze air fields in Kyushu.

According to a US Air Force webpage:

Australian journalists Denis and Peggy Warner, in a 1982 book with Japanese naval historian Sadao Seno (&quot;The Sacred Warriors: Japan&#x27;s Suicide Legions&quot;), arrived at a total of 57 ships sunk by &quot;kamikazes&quot;. Bill Gordon, an American Japanologist who specializes in &quot;kamikazes&quot;, lists in a 2007 article 47 ships known to have been sunk by &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft. Gordon says that the Warners and Seno included ten ships that did not sink. He lists:
* three escort carriers: , , and 
* fourteen destroyers, including the last ship to be sunk, on 29 July 1945, off Okinawa
* three high-speed transport ships
* five Landing Ship, Tank
* four Landing Ship Medium
* three Landing Ship Medium (Rocket)
* one auxiliary tanker
* three Victory ships
* three Liberty ships
* two high-speed minesweepers
* one 
* one submarine chaser
* two PT boats
* two Landing Craft Support

==Recruitment==
It was claimed by the Japanese forces at the time that there were many volunteers for the suicidal forces. Captain Motoharu Okamura commented that &quot;there were so many volunteers for suicide missions that he referred to them as a swarm of bees&quot;, explaining: &quot;Bees die after they have stung.&quot; Okamura is credited with being the first to propose the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks. He had expressed his desire to lead a volunteer group of suicide attacks some four months before Admiral Takijiro Ohnishi, commander of the Japanese naval air forces in the Philippines, presented the idea to his staff. While Vice-Admiral Shigeru Fukudome, commander of the second air fleet, was inspecting the 341st Air Group, Captain Okamura took the chance to express his ideas on crash-dive tactics:
When the volunteers arrived for duty in the corps, there were twice as many persons as aircraft available. &quot;After the war, some commanders would express regret for allowing superfluous crews to accompany sorties, sometimes squeezing themselves aboard bombers and fighters so as to encourage the suicide pilots and, it seems, join in the exultation of sinking a large enemy vessel.&quot; Many of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots believed their death would pay the debt they owed and show the love they had for their families, friends, and emperor. &quot;So eager were many minimally trained pilots to take part in suicide missions that when their sorties were delayed or aborted, the pilots became deeply despondent. Many of those who were selected for a body crashing mission were described as being extraordinarily blissful immediately before their final sortie.&quot;

However, an evidence-based study of 2,000 pilots&#x27; uncensored letters revealed that the pilots candidly expressed myriad emotions in private. Typically, they declared their determination to die to protect the homeland and thanked their school teachers, parents, siblings, and friends for their selfless devotion. Although most pilots were unmarried (the average age was 19), some young fathers left loving instructions for their young wives and children to live well, and others expressed memories of unrequited love or the sorrow of dying young.

As time wore on, modern critics questioned the nationalist portrayal of &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots as noble soldiers willing to sacrifice their lives for the country. In 2006, Tsuneo Watanabe, editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, criticized Japanese nationalists&#x27; glorification of &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks:

It&#x27;s all a lie that they left filled with braveness and joy, crying, &quot;Long live the emperor!&quot; They were sheep at a slaughterhouse. Everybody was looking down and tottering. Some were unable to stand up and were carried and pushed into their aircraft by maintenance soldiers.

==Training==
&quot;Tokkōtai&quot; pilot training, as described by Takeo Kasuga, generally &quot;consisted of incredibly strenuous training, coupled with cruel and torturous corporal punishment as a daily routine&quot;. The training, in theory, lasted for thirty days, but because of American raids and shortage of fuel it could last up to two months.

Daikichi Irokawa, who trained at Tsuchiura Naval Air Base, recalled that he &quot;was struck on the face so hard and frequently that [his] face was no longer recognizable&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;I was hit so hard that I could no longer see and fell on the floor. The minute I got up, I was hit again by a club so that I would confess.&quot; This brutal &quot;training&quot; was justified by the idea that it would instil a &quot;soldier&#x27;s fighting spirit&quot;, but daily beatings and corporal punishment eliminated patriotism among many pilots.

Pilots were given a manual that detailed how they were supposed to think, prepare, and attack. From this manual, pilots were told to &quot;attain a high level of spiritual training&quot;, and to &quot;keep [their] health in the very best condition&quot;. These instructions, among others, were meant to make pilots mentally ready to die.

The &quot;tokkōtai&quot; pilot&#x27;s manual also explained how a pilot may turn back if he could not locate a target, and that a pilot &quot;should not waste [his] life lightly&quot;. One pilot, a graduate from Waseda University, who continually came back to base was shot after his ninth return.

The manual was very detailed in how a pilot should attack. A pilot would dive towards his target and &quot;aim for a point between the bridge tower and the smokestacks&quot;. Entering a smokestack was also said to be &quot;effective&quot;. Pilots were told not to aim at a carrier&#x27;s bridge tower but instead to target the elevators or the flight deck. For horizontal attacks, the pilot was to &quot;aim at the middle of the vessel, slightly higher than the waterline&quot; or to &quot;aim at the entrance to the aircraft hangar, or the bottom of the stack&quot; if the former was too difficult.

The &quot;tokkōtai&quot; pilot&#x27;s manual told pilots to never close their eyes, as this would lower the chances of hitting their targets. In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to yell &quot;hissatsu&quot; (必殺) at the top of his lungs, which translates to &quot;certain kill&quot; or &quot;sink without fail&quot;.

==Cultural background==
In 1944–45, US military leaders invented the term &quot;State Shinto&quot; as part of the Shinto Directive to differentiate the Japanese state&#x27;s ideology from traditional Shinto practices. As time went on, Americans claimed, Shinto was used increasingly in the promotion of nationalist sentiment. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was passed, under which students were required to ritually recite its oath to offer themselves &quot;courageously to the state&quot; as well as protect the Imperial family. The ultimate offering was to give up one&#x27;s life. It was an honour to die for Japan and the Emperor. Axell and Kase pointed out: &quot;The fact is that innumerable soldiers, sailors and pilots were determined to die, to become &quot;eirei&quot;, that is &#x27;guardian spirits&#x27; of the country. ... Many Japanese felt that to be enshrined at Yasukuni was a special honour because the Emperor visited the shrine to pay homage twice a year. Yasukuni is the only shrine deifying common men which the Emperor would visit to pay his respects.&quot; Young Japanese people were indoctrinated from an early age with these ideals.

Following the commencement of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; tactic, newspapers and books ran advertisements, articles and stories regarding the suicide bombers to aid in recruiting and support. In October 1944, the &quot;Nippon Times&quot; quoted Lieutenant Sekio Nishina: &quot;The spirit of the Special Attack Corps is the great spirit that runs in the blood of every Japanese ... The crashing action which simultaneously kills the enemy and oneself without fail is called the Special Attack ... Every Japanese is capable of becoming a member of the Special Attack Corps.&quot; Publishers also played up the idea that the &quot;kamikaze&quot; were enshrined at Yasukuni and ran exaggerated stories of &quot;kamikaze&quot; bravery – there were even fairy tales for little children that promoted the &quot;kamikaze&quot;. A Foreign Office official named Toshikazu Kase said: &quot;It was customary for GHQ [in Tokyo] to make false announcements of victory in utter disregard of facts, and for the elated and complacent public to believe them.&quot;

While many stories were falsified, some were true, such as that of Kiyu Ishikawa, who saved a Japanese ship when he crashed his aircraft into a torpedo that an American submarine had launched. The sergeant-major was posthumously promoted to second lieutenant by the emperor and was enshrined at Yasukuni. Stories like these, which showed the kind of praise and honour death produced, encouraged young Japanese to volunteer for the Special Attack Corps and instilled a desire in the youth to die as a &quot;kamikaze&quot;.

Ceremonies were carried out before &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots departed on their final mission. The &quot;kamikaze&quot; shared ceremonial cups of sake or water known as &quot;mizu no sakazuki&quot;. Many &quot;kamikaze&quot; Army officers took their swords along, while the Navy pilots (as a general rule) did not. The &quot;kamikaze&quot;, along with all Japanese aviators flying over unfriendly territory, were issued (or purchased, if they were officers) a Nambu pistol with which to end their lives if they risked being captured. Like all Army and Navy servicemen, the &quot;kamikaze&quot; would wear their &quot;senninbari&quot;, a &quot;belt of a thousand stitches&quot; given to them by their mothers. They also composed and read a death poem, a tradition stemming from the samurai, who did so before committing &quot;seppuku&quot;. Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations. The &quot;kamikaze&quot; were escorted by other pilots whose function was to protect them en route to their destination and report on the results. Some of these escort pilots, such as Zero pilot Toshimitsu Imaizumi, were later sent out on their own &quot;kamikaze&quot; missions.

While it is commonly perceived that volunteers signed up in droves for &quot;kamikaze&quot; missions, it has also been contended that there was extensive coercion and peer pressure involved in recruiting soldiers for the sacrifice. Their motivations in &quot;volunteering&quot; were complex and not simply about patriotism or bringing honour to their families. Firsthand interviews with surviving &quot;kamikaze&quot; and escort pilots has revealed that they were motivated by a desire to protect their families from perceived atrocities and possible extinction at the hands of the Allies. They viewed themselves as the last defense.

At least one of these pilots was a conscripted Korean with a Japanese name, adopted under the pre-war &quot;Soshi-kaimei&quot; ordinance that compelled Koreans to take Japanese personal names. Eleven of the 1,036 IJA &quot;kamikaze&quot; pilots who died in sorties from Chiran and other Japanese air bases during the Battle of Okinawa were Koreans.

It is said that young pilots on &quot;kamikaze&quot; missions often flew southwest from Japan over the Mount Kaimon. The mountain is also called &quot;Satsuma Fuji&quot; (meaning a mountain like Mount Fuji but located in the Satsuma Province region). Suicide-mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see the mountain, the southernmost on the Japanese mainland, said farewell to their country and saluted the mountain. Residents on Kikaishima Island, east of Amami Ōshima, say that pilots from suicide-mission units dropped flowers from the air as they departed on their final missions.

&quot;Kamikaze&quot; pilots who were unable to complete their missions (because of mechanical failure, interception, etc.) were stigmatized in the years following the war. This stigma began to diminish some 50 years after the war as scholars and publishers began to distribute the survivors&#x27; stories.

Some Japanese military personnel were critical of the policy. Officers such as Minoru Genda, Tadashi Minobe and Yoshio Shiga, refused to obey the policy. They said that the commander of a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack should engage in the task first. Some persons who obeyed the policy, such as Kiyokuma Okajima, Saburo Shindo and Iyozo Fujita, were also critical of the policy. Saburō Sakai said: &quot;We never dared to question orders, to doubt authority, to do anything but immediately carry out all the commands of our superiors. We were automatons who obeyed without thinking.&quot; Tetsuzō Iwamoto refused to engage in a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack because he thought the task of fighter pilots was to shoot down aircraft.
