<text>Kirk Lee Hammett (born November 18, 1962) is an American musician who has been the lead guitarist of heavy metal band Metallica since 1983. Prior to joining Metallica, he co-formed the thrash metal band Exodus in 1979. In 2003, Hammett, along with bandmate James Hetfield, was ranked 23rd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2009, Hammett was ranked number 15 in Joel McIver&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot;.

== Early life ==

Hammett was born on November 18, 1962, in San Francisco, California, and raised in the town of El Sobrante. He is the son of Teofila &quot;Chefela&quot; (born Oyao) and Dennis L. Hammett (a Merchant Mariner). His mother is of Filipino descent and his father was of English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He attended De Anza High School in Richmond, California. While attending De Anza High School, he met Les Claypool of Primus, and they remain close friends.

Hammett has a well-known passion for horror movies that stretches back to the late 1960s. After spraining his arm in a fight with his sister at age five, Hammett&#x27;s parents placed him in front of the television. It was during this time that he first watched &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. After that, Hammett found himself drawn to his brother&#x27;s Frankenstein figures and began spending his milk money on horror magazines. For the better part of the next decade, Hammett dove deep into the horror scene.

Hammett began showing an interest in music after listening to his brother Rick&#x27;s extensive record collection (which included Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and UFO). He began selling his horror magazines to buy music records, which led him to properly picking up the guitar at age 15. Hammett&#x27;s first guitar was (in his own words) a &quot;wholly unglamorous&quot; Montgomery Ward catalog special, which was accompanied by a shoebox (with a four-inch speaker) for an amp. After purchasing a 1978 Fender Stratocaster copy, Hammett attempted to customize his sound with various guitar parts before eventually buying a 1974 Gibson Flying V.

==Career==
===Exodus (1979–1983)===
Hammett&#x27;s musical interests eventually drew him into the fledgling thrash metal genre. In 1979, he formed the band Exodus at the age of sixteen, along with vocalist Paul Baloff, guitarist Tim Agnello, bassist Geoff Andrews, and drummer Tom Hunting. Hammett named Exodus after the Leon Uris novel of the same name, and played on the band&#x27;s &quot;1982 Demo&quot; and its successor &quot;Die By His Hand&quot; from 1983. Exodus was an influential band in the Bay Area thrash movement. During the Exodus phase Hammett took lessons from Joe Satriani who was based in Berkeley, California at the time.

=== Metallica (1983–present) ===

In 1983, Metallica traveled to the east coast to record its debut album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;. Due to lead guitarist Dave Mustaine&#x27;s substance abuse and violent tendencies, he was fired shortly after their arrival, and would eventually form the band Megadeth. Hammett received a phone call from Metallica on April 1, and flew out to New York for an audition on April 11, the same day Mustaine was let go. Vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield said: &quot;The first song we played was &quot;Seek and Destroy&quot;, and Kirk pulled off this solo, and it was like ... things are going to be alright!&quot;. Hammett was instantly asked to join the band.
Hammett has written a number of riffs for Metallica since &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; (the band&#x27;s second album). One of his riffs was used on &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; - which went on to become one of Metallica&#x27;s most popular songs. It was the first track and the first single on the band&#x27;s self-titled album (also known as &quot;The Black Album&quot;), and was ranked 399th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The bridge for &quot;Creeping Death&quot; was originally an Exodus riff that Hammett took with him to Metallica.

In 1986, during the band&#x27;s European leg of their tour to support &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, the group had a dispute over sleeping arrangements on their tour bus. The outcome of the dispute was decided by a card draw, which Cliff Burton won by picking the Ace of Spades. Once the draw was completed, Burton looked at Hammett and said &quot;I want your bunk&quot;, to which Hammett complied, saying that he might be able to sleep better in the front of the bus anyway. In the early hours of the following morning, Metallica&#x27;s tour bus slid off the road and overturned in Sweden. Burton was thrown through the window of the bus, which fell on top of Burton and subsequently killed him. Hammett has stated in an interview that he once thought that it easily could have been him who was killed instead, since Burton was sleeping in what was considered to be Hammett&#x27;s bunk. In Kirk&#x27;s own words: &quot;You know to this day I just think, it could have been me or it couldn&#x27;t have been me but ... it&#x27;s never left me to this day.&quot;

Between the end of touring (and promoting) the &quot;Black Album&quot; and the start of touring in promotion of &quot;Load&quot;, he studied at San Francisco State University, focusing on film and Asian arts. Hammett went through a &quot;blues period&quot; around this time - which had some influence on Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; albums. He also began listening to a lot of jazz music. Hammett described this period of his life as &quot;great education&quot;, because he was able to discover where all of his own rock influences had gotten their own guitar licks. However, even though jazz music had a profound effect on his improvisation skills and solos, Hammett felt that he was delving too deep into the genre. Since &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;, Hammett has gone back to being &quot;primarily&quot; a metal guitarist, but some of his influences of jazz and blues music still remain.

Hammett wanted to have guitar solos on Metallica&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;St. Anger&quot;, but drummer Lars Ulrich and producer Bob Rock thought that the solos did not sound right in the songs. He later admitted himself, &quot;We tried to put in solos but they sounded like an afterthought so we left them out&quot;. Recording for &quot;St. Anger&quot; was halted in 2001 so that Metallica frontman James Hetfield could enter rehab for alcohol abuse. Due to tensions within the band (which were well-documented in the Metallica documentary &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot;) at the time, Hammett expressed interest in working on a solo album. According to Hammett, if he ever worked on a solo album, it wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;super-duty&quot; heavy metal, and may include some classical guitarists. When he was asked about his experiences of recording &quot;St. Anger&quot;, Hammett said:

On April 4, 2009, Hammett, along with Metallica bandmates Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield, and Robert Trujillo and former Metallica bandmates Jason Newsted and the deceased Cliff Burton, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2009, Hammett provided the foreword to British author Joel McIver&#x27;s book &quot;To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica&#x27;s Cliff Burton&quot;.

In April 2015, Hammett admitted to losing his phone - which contained 250 new &quot;ideas&quot; for Metallica&#x27;s upcoming studio release. The incident happened about six months prior to the admission (around November 2014). The phone was not backed up and Hammett can only remember eight out of the 250 &quot;ideas&quot; he had. On the subject, Hammett said:

In 2016, Hammett provided the foreword to author Greg Prato&#x27;s book &quot;German Metal Machine: Scorpions in the &#x27;70s&quot;.

On February 8, 2022, it was announced that Hammett would release an extended play entitled &quot;Portals&quot;. Said to be inspired by &quot;classical music, soundtracks, horror movies and maybe a little Ennio Morricone&quot;, the EP is his solo debut and was released on April 23, 2022.

===Other appearances===
He also appeared on the &quot;Kichigai&quot; EP by punk band Septic Death. He played additional lead guitar on the title track.

Hammett can be seen in the background in Primus&#x27; &quot;John the Fisherman&quot; video fishing off of Les Claypool&#x27;s boat. Hammett has been friends with Primus bassist and lead vocalist Les Claypool since childhood. Claypool even auditioned for Metallica after the tragic death of Cliff Burton.

Hammett played guitar on the track &quot;Satan&quot; with Orbital for the &quot;Spawn: The Album&quot; soundtrack released in July 1997.

Hammett plays a guitar solo on Pansy Division&#x27;s song &quot;Headbanger&quot; which appears on the EP &quot;For Those About to Suck Cock&quot;.

In 2005, Hammett was featured playing the guitar roles on the Carlos Santana track &quot;Trinity&quot; alongside steel-pedal guitarist Robert Randolph. Santana personally asked Hammett to contribute to his then-upcoming album &quot;All That I Am&quot;. Hammett previously worked with Santana in 2001 at a live show benefit in San Francisco. Metallica had also invited Santana into the studio while recording &quot;St. Anger&quot;.

In 2006, Hammett voiced himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer&quot;). He also provided various voices on the Adult Swim show &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, including a two fingered fan (&quot;The Curse of Dethklok&quot;), The Queen of Denmark (&quot;Happy Dethday&quot;), and a Finnish barkeep (&quot;Dethtroll&quot;).

Hammett also appeared as a guest in an episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; titled &quot;Jacksonville&quot;, alongside fellow Metallica member James Hetfield.

He appeared as a guest guitarist on K&#x27;Naan&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;If Rap Gets Jealous&quot; off of the &quot;Troubadour&quot; album.

After performing a set with Metallica at Bonnaroo in June 2008, Hammett played one song with My Morning Jacket and a couple songs with the annual Superjam collaboration, which also included Les Claypool and members of Gogol Bordello playing primarily Tom Waits songs.

Hammett is one of the main characters in &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;, along with the rest of the current line-up of Metallica.

In 2011, Hammett appeared in an episode of &quot;Jon Benjamin Has a Van&quot; as an actor and guitarist.

Hammett collaborated with Cindy Blackman Santana and Vernon Reid from Living Colour on &quot;Evolution Revolution&quot;, a track from the former&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Give the Drummer Some.&quot;

Hammett has appeared as himself, representing the character Kevin&#x27;s conscience, in the 2022 American teen comedy-drama Metal Lords.

In May 2023, Hammett performed at the Jeff Beck tribute concerts held at the Royal Albert Hall in London, sharing the stage with Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, Billy Gibbons and Johnny Depp among others.

==Book==
On October 1, 2012, Abrams Image published Hammett&#x27;s first book, &quot;Too Much Horror Business&quot; (a collection of photos detailing Hammett&#x27;s lifelong love of monster movies and horror memorabilia). Hammett has said that the book is &quot;basically&quot; all of the horror memorabilia he has managed to amass over the last 30 years. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot;, Hammett said that he has such a huge horror collection and thought it was the right time to share it with everyone. The 228 page hardcover features more than 300 images of Hammett&#x27;s horror collection. Among these images are the costumes from the Bela Lugosi movies &quot;White Zombie&quot; and &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (which also starred Boris Karloff), original movie posters (ranging from &quot;Nosferatu&quot; to &quot;Hellraiser&quot;), rare horror-themed toys (including the &#x27;Great Garloo&#x27; and &#x27;Frankenstein Tricky Walkers&#x27;), movie props (including the &#x27;Dr. Tongue&#x27; zombie from George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;), original Basil Gogos &quot;Famous Monsters&quot; art, and fantasy paintings by Frank Frazetta. In addition to the images from Hammett&#x27;s horror collection, &quot;Too Much Horror Business&quot; contains three conversations with the guitarist about his childhood, the nature of his horror collection, and the connection between Metallica&#x27;s music and horror movies. On the book, Hammett has been quoted saying:

==&quot;Kirk Von Hammett&#x27;s Fear FestEvil&quot;==
&quot;Kirk Von Hammett&#x27;s Fear FestEvil&quot; is an annual horror convention created by Kirk Hammett. The first &quot;Fear FestEvil&quot; took place at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco - over a three-day period (from February 6–8, 2014). Hammett was inspired to create his own horror convention after experiencing the enjoyment of making his &quot;crypt&quot; at the &quot;Orion Music + More&quot; festival. The convention features live music, signings, interactive displays, vending, live talks, and guest appearances. At the 2014 event, guests included Sara Karloff (daughter of actor Boris Karloff), Bela G. Lugosi (son of actor Bela Lugosi), make-up artist Gregory Nicotero (who worked on George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;), actor Tom Savini (who portrayed &quot;Sex Machine&quot; in From Dusk Till Dawn and worked on many of George A. Romero&#x27;s movies), Heather Langenkamp (who portrayed Nancy in Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;), Kane Hodder (who portrayed Jason Voorhees in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film series), and Haruo Nakajima (of Godzilla fame). Other guests in attendance included Hammett&#x27;s former band Exodus, Death Angel, Orchid, Metallica band member Robert Trujillo, Richard Christy, Stephen Perkins, Slash, and Scott Ian. Exodus played on-stage with Carcass on the Friday, whilst Death Division and Orchid played before Death Angel on the Saturday. Hammett joined Exodus and Death Angel on-stage for their encores.

The second annual &quot;Fear FestEvil&quot; took place between April 10–12, 2015, at the &quot;Rockbar Theater&quot; in San Jose, California. Meshuggah headlined the event, whilst High on Fire, Blues Pills, Agnostic Front, and Asada Messiah also made appearances. Orchid also made a second appearance at the &quot;Fear FestEvil&quot;. On April 10, VIPs were able to attend the &quot;Dinner and Murder Mystery&quot; - along with Hammett - at the Winchester Mystery House.

==Personal life==
Hammett has been married twice. His first marriage to Rebecca lasted three years, having ended in 1990, during the recording of &quot;Metallica&quot;. Hammett has been married to his second wife Lani since 1998. They have two sons, Angel (b. September 29, 2006) and Vincenzo (b. June 28, 2008). He resides in Sonoma, California, and Hawaii.

In addition to playing guitar and collecting horror memorabilia, Hammett&#x27;s hobbies include reading comic books and surfing.

===Substance abuse===
At one point in his life, Hammett spent a &quot;lot of money&quot; on drugs. Hammett has said that he used drugs because he thought they would be fun. During the Damaged Justice tour, he had a cocaine addiction. Hammett eventually pulled out of the addiction because cocaine made him feel depressed, but he relapsed during the &quot;Load&quot; era. One of the reasons Hammett said he spent a lot of money on comic books is because he finds them to be a more enjoyable and healthier alternative to drugs. He also smoked heroin a few times but &quot;didn&#x27;t like it&quot;.

=== Politics and environmentalism ===
Although the other members of Metallica do not speak publicly about their politics, Hammett has expressed his disagreement with statements by former president Donald Trump. In an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in December 2016 (one month after Trump&#x27;s election), Hammett said that he was &quot;just waiting to get into a personal Twitter war with (Trump).&quot; In the same interview, Hammett stressed the importance of the fight against global warming, which Trump has claimed is a hoax.

==Equipment and techniques==
Hammett is known for consistently taping sections of his right (picking) hand in order to protect his skin from abrasions from his use of palm muting and fast picking techniques over lengthy tour cycles.

===Guitars===
Hammett&#x27;s touring guitars over the years have included:

* ESP MM-250/MM-270 &quot;Zorlac&quot; – Hammett&#x27;s first custom-made instrument by ESP Guitars was the precursor to the whole KH series. Featuring vertical skulls and crossbones as opposed to the horizontal ones featured on today&#x27;s KHs, and an upside down Jackson Guitars style headstock which is what Hammett originally intended. The threat of potential lawsuits from Jackson Guitars over this model meant it was withdrawn as a custom shop option forever. As a result, the headstock was changed to the typical modern era ESP style, but flipped upside down, the inlays were rotated 90 degrees and those became the modern -day KH series.
* ESP KH-2 MM-290 &quot;Skully&quot; – Hammett&#x27;s main touring guitar and first modern-era KH model. This signature model is based upon the modifications he made to his original ESP custom model.
* ESP M-II Standard – with EMG and Seymour Duncan pickups. Hammett used this a lot in the studio and live.
* ESP KH-2 &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; – New for 2009.
* ESP KH-4 Chrome – New for 2009. A remake of his former KH-4 guitar, with a chrome pickguard, chrome hardware, and chrome EMG pickups.
* ESP MII-NT – New for 2009. It is custom finished with Occult-themed graphics.
* ESP KH-2 M-II &quot;Boris Karloff Mummy&quot; #I – This has been Hammett&#x27;s favourite guitar for many years. It features the Boris Karloff Mummy I graphic of which Hammett owns the rights to. It will not be released by ESP. Hammett has two of these guitars, one with &quot;Eye of Horus&quot; inlays and the other with hieroglyphics inlays.
* ESP KH-2 M-II &quot;Ouija&quot; – This guitar contains two spelling errors. It sports the words &quot;WILLIAM FUED TALKING BAARD SET&quot; but it in fact should say &quot;WILLIAM FULD TALKING BOARD SET&quot;. Hammett also now plays a white version of this guitar on tour.
* ESP KH-2 M-II &quot;Greenburst&quot; A standard KH-2 with a custom green sunburst finish, green inlays, and green logo.
* ESP KH-3 Eclipse – Pushead Spider graphic. It is taken from a classic Les Paul Jr. shape with a Floyd Rose vibrato and EMG pickups.
* ESP Flying V copy – Cherry Red with white pickguard and gold hardware. Hammett uses this live mostly for the song &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot;.
* ESP Michael Schenker Flying V
* ESP VIPER Baritone – Used for performances of &quot;The Unnamed Feeling&quot;.
* Gibson 1968 Les Paul Custom – Mostly on ballads such as &quot;Fade to Black&quot; and &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;.
* Gibson Les Paul Standard – Used on songs from &quot;St. Anger&quot;.
* Ibanez RG – Used during the Wherever We May Roam American and European tour. It was used as a stunt guitar and for Deep Purple covers.
* Jackson Randy Rhoads Model RR1T – Custom made specifically for Hammett. It is usually tuned one step down from standard tuning, and used for songs like &quot;Sad but True&quot; and &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;.
* TC Customs Death Magnetic Flying V – Used on the World Magnetic Tour.
* Teuffel Birdfish – Designed and produced by German guitar designer/builder, Ulrich Teuffel. The model is limited (500 made) and is made to amplify sound using various pickups. This guitar is used live for &quot;The Judas Kiss&quot;.
* Teuffel Tesla

On the 25th anniversary of Metallica&#x27;s debut album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, Hammett appears on the cover of Feb. 2008&#x27;s &quot;Guitar World&quot; sporting his new custom ESP. This model is the KH20, the 20th anniversary model from ESP.

In 2014, Hammett purchased &quot;Greeny&quot;, a 1959 Les Paul formerly used by Gary Moore and Peter Green; using it on tour when playing a cover of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s version of &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;.

===Amplifiers and cabinets===
Throughout Metallica&#x27;s career, Hammett has used a range of different amplifiers. For the first two albums, he used Marshall amplifiers and cabinets, with occasional effects. For the recording of Metallica&#x27;s third album, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; (1986), he and James Hetfield bought a Mesa/Boogie MarkIIC+ amplifier, and used Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier heads. Even when he made his move to Randall Amplifiers in 2007, he still used Mesa/Boogie amplifiers in his setup, and still does to this day. He currently uses two rackmounted Dual Rectifier 2-channel heads in tandem with his Randalls.

In September 2007, Randall Amplifiers announced a partnership with Hammett to design a line of signature amplifiers, heads, combos and preamp modules.

In December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with Randall to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Hammett is currently using a prototype of the amplifier that he used for the Big 4 show at Yankee Stadium and for all of the shows in India and Asia, and was recently sent a second prototype.

* Randall RM100KH Signature Model (x1)
* Randall/Fortin Prototype head (x2)

* Randall 4x12 Cabinets (x4)
* Randall/Fortin 4x12 Cabinet
===Effects===
To avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hammett keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers. His guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage. The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers.

Around the release of The Black Album, the use of wah-wah pedals became more prominent in Hammett&#x27;s playing. This has become a running gag amongst fans, with many referring to him as &quot;Kirk Wahmett&quot;. In 2008, Jim Dunlop started working in partnership with Hammett to create a signature Wah-wah pedal, the KH95. In 2022 on an interview with Rick Beato, he claimed to own &quot;around 200&quot; wah-wah pedals, citing his favorite one to be the Dunlop Dimebag Cry Baby From Hell.

Hammett said that the Ibanez Tube Screamer has been an essential part of his sound since he was a teenager, but it was not versatile enough, which started him searching for a better pedal. In 2012, he co-founded KHDK Electronics with sound designer David Karon, hiring Antonin Salva as chief engineer, based in Prague. The company makes guitar pedals in Paducah, Kentucky. They began developing pedals and trying out prototypes. In September 2015, the company launched its first series of pedals, surprising the industry.

<text>Kul Tigin ( , Pinyin: Quètèqín, Wade–Giles: chüeh-t&#x27;e-ch&#x27;in, AD 684–731) was a general and a prince of the Second Turkic Khaganate.

== Etymology ==
Necip Asım (1921) initially gave his name as &quot;köl&quot;, based on the etymology of Mahmud al-Kashgari, meaning &quot;lake, sea&quot;. Radloff rendered this word as &quot;kül&quot;, and Thomsen (1896), Malov (1951) and Tekin (1968) adopted this reading. Bazin (1956) and Hamilton (1962) rejected Radloff&#x27;s reading and preferred the form &quot;köl&quot;. However, Chinese sources used the Chinese character 闕 (&quot;què&quot;). Therefore, this word should be read as &quot;kül&quot;, not &quot;köl&quot;.

== Early years ==
He was a second son of Ilterish Qaghan, the Second Turkic Khaganate&#x27;s founder, and the younger brother of Bilge Kaghan, the fourth kaghan. He was seven when his father died.

During the reign of Qapagan Khaghan, Kul Tigin and his older brother earned reputation for their military prowess. They defeated Yenisei Kirghiz, Turgesh, and the Karluks, extending the Kaganate territory all the way to the Iron Gate south of Samarkand. They also subjugated all nine of the Tokuz Oguz tribes.

In 705, Tujue forces commanded by Mojilian entered Lingwu, defeating Shazha Chongyi (沙吒忠义). Kul Tigin commanded a unit in battle, in which he lost three horses.

In 711, he participated in Battle of Bolchu, which was disastrous for Turgesh.

In 713 he participated in subjugation of Karluk tribes with his brother and uncle.

== As supreme commander ==
Upon the death of Qapagan Khaghan, his son Inel Qaghan attempted to illegally ascend to the throne, defying the traditional Lateral succession law, but Kül Tigin refused to recognize the takeover. He raised an army, attacked, and killed Inel, Ashina Duoxifu and his trusted followers. He placed his elder brother Bilge Khagan on the throne, and took the title of Shad, an equivalent of commander-in-chief of the army, for himself.

== Death ==
He died suddenly on 27 February 731. A stele in memory of Kül Tigin, which included inscriptions in both Turkic and Chinese, was erected at his memorial complex of Khoshoo Tsaidam (more images from the site here), at the present site of the Orkhon inscriptions. Kül-Tegin is also mentioned in the inscription erected in memory of his older brother Bilge Qaghan at the neighbouring site of Khöshöö-Tsaidam-1.

His burial ceremony took place in 1 November 731. He was posthumously renamed Inanču Apa Yarğan Tarqan () by Bilge Qaghan.

The head of the Kül Tigin sculpture in the Khöshöö-Tsaidam enclave in (Orkhon, in northern Mongolia) carries a bird with wings spread like an eagle, personifying a raven. The head was found by the Czech archeologist Lumir Jisl during his 1957–1958 expedition to Mongolia.

== Popular culture ==
He was portrayed by Ham Suk Hun (함석훈) in Korean TV Series &quot;Dae Jo-yeong.&quot;

<text>Richard Samet &quot;Kinky&quot; Friedman (November 1, 1944 – June 27, 2024) was an American singer, songwriter, novelist, humorist, politician, and columnist for &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, who styled himself in the mold of popular American satirists Will Rogers and Mark Twain.

Friedman was one of two independent candidates in the 2006 Texas gubernatorial election. Receiving 12.6% of the vote, Friedman placed fourth in the six-person race.

==Biography==
Richard Samet Friedman was born in Chicago on November 1, 1944, to Jewish parents, Dr. S. Thomas Friedman and his wife Minnie (Samet) Friedman. Both of his parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants. When Friedman was young, his family moved to the Texas Hill Country where they opened a summer camp called Echo Hill Ranch.

Friedman had an early interest in both pop music and chess, and was chosen at age seven as one of 50 local players to challenge U.S. grandmaster Samuel Reshevsky to simultaneous games in Houston. Reshevsky won all 50 games, but Friedman was, by far, the youngest competitor.

Friedman graduated from Austin High School in Austin, Texas, in 1962. He subsequently earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Texas at Austin in 1966, majoring in psychology. He took part in the Plan II Honors program and was a member of the Tau Delta Phi fraternity. During his first year, Chinga Chavin gave Friedman the nickname &quot;Kinky&quot; because of his curly hair.

Friedman served two years in the United States Peace Corps, teaching in Borneo, Malaysia with John Gross. During his service in the Peace Corps, he met future road manager Dylan Ferrero, with whom he worked for the remainder of his life. Friedman lived at Echo Hill Ranch, his family&#x27;s summer camp near Kerrville, Texas. He founded Utopia Animal Rescue Ranch, also located near Kerrville, whose mission is to care for stray, abused and aging animals; to date, the ranch has saved more than 1,000 dogs from animal euthanasia. 

On June 27, 2024, it was announced that Friedman had died at his home at Echo Hill Ranch, Medina, Bandera County, Texas, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was 79.

==Music career==
Friedman formed his first band, King Arthur &amp; the Carrots, while a student at the University of Texas at Austin. The band, which poked fun at surf music, recorded only one single in 1966 (&quot;Schwinn 24/Beach Party Boo Boo&quot;).

By 1973, Friedman had formed his second band, Kinky Friedman and The Texas Jewboys, which many took to be a play on the name of the famous band Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. In keeping with the band&#x27;s satirical nature, each member had a comical name: in addition to Kinky there were Little Jewford, Big Nig, Panama Red, Wichita Culpepper, Sky Cap Adams, Rainbow Colours, and Snakebite Jacobs. More conventionally named roadie Jack Slaughter and road manager Dylan Ferrero rounded out the crew and provided most of the driving of the &quot;tour bus&quot;, a Cadillac with 10-year-old expired license plates and a propensity to break down (but, according to Friedman, her talent lay in her ability to stop on a dime and pick up the change).

Friedman&#x27;s father objected to the name of the band, calling it a &quot;negative, hostile, peculiar thing&quot;, which gave Kinky even more reason to choose the name.

Arriving on the wave of country rock following on from Gram Parsons, The Band, and Eagles, Friedman originally found cult fame as a country and western singer. His break came in 1973 thanks to Commander Cody of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen, who contacted Vanguard Music on his behalf. Friedman released &quot;Kinky Friedman&quot; in 1974 for ABC Records, then toured with Bob Dylan in 1975–1976. His repertoire mixed social commentary (&quot;We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service to You&quot;) and maudlin ballads (&quot;Western Union Wire&quot;) with raucous humor (such as &quot;Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed&quot;). His &quot;Ride &#x27;Em Jewboy&quot; was an extended tribute to the victims of the Holocaust.

One of his most famous songs is &quot;They Ain&#x27;t Makin&#x27; Jews Like Jesus Anymore,&quot; a song in which Kinky verbally and physically beats up a drunken white racist who berates blacks, Jews, Italians, Greeks, and Sigma Nus in a bar, with lyrics such as,

&lt;poem&gt;
Oh, they ain&#x27;t makin&#x27; Jews like Jesus anymore,
They ain&#x27;t makin&#x27; carpenters that know what nails are for
&lt;/poem&gt;

Other Friedman tunes include &quot;The Ballad of Charles Whitman,&quot; in which Friedman lampooned Charles Whitman&#x27;s sniper attack from the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s Main Building tower on August 1, 1966. He also covered Chinga Chavin&#x27;s &quot;Asshole from El Paso&quot;, a parody of Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot;.

One of Friedman&#x27;s most infamous concerts was a 1973 performance in Buffalo, New York; upon performing &quot;Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed&quot; (a song that lampoons feminism), a group of what Friedman described as &quot;cranked-up lesbians&quot; entered into a fight with the band and forced the concert to end early while Friedman and the band were escorted off stage. The National Organization for Women awarded Friedman the &quot;Male Chauvinist Pig Award&quot; later that year, an award Friedman took with pride. Friedman would not return to Buffalo until 2012. Another was at The Boarding House in early-March 1975 when an offended Buffy Sainte-Marie rushed on stage and snatched the war bonnet that Friedman was wearing while he and his band were performing &quot;Miss Nickelodeon,&quot; a composition that spoofs the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Friedman and his band taped an &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; show on November 11, 1975, which was never aired. According to the show&#x27;s executive producer, Terry Lickona, this is the first and only time in the show&#x27;s long history that an episode went unaired. Lickona told the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve seen it many times – it&#x27;s a very popular party tape among friends. I think it was a great show, and it might be as offensive today as it was back then.&quot;

In early 1976, he joined Bob Dylan on the second leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue tour.

Friedman was the musical guest on the Season 2 fifth episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; which aired on October 23, 1976. He performed his own composition &quot;Dear Abbie&quot;.

Although hard to verify, given the number of Jewish-origin entertainers in country/hillbilly-tour circles (e.g. Gilbert Maxwell &quot;Broncho Billy&quot; Anderson), Friedman claims to have been the first full-blooded Jew to take the stage at the Grand Ole Opry.

In February 2007, Sustain Records released a compilation of the songs of Kinky Friedman sung by other artists called &quot;Why the Hell Not ...&quot; The compilation includes contributions by Dwight Yoakam, Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett, and Kelly Willis.

On July 20, 2007, Friedman hosted the Concert to Save Town Lake to honor the memory of Lady Bird Johnson and her efforts to protect and preserve the shores of Town Lake in Austin, Texas.

On April 27, 2011, Friedman launched his Springtime for Kinky Tour (cf. &quot;Springtime for Hitler&quot;) in Kansas City, Missouri, at Knuckleheads Saloon; it included dates in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky before heading towards the East Coast. This was followed by a tour of Australia with Van Dyke Parks.

==Writing career==
After his music career stalled in the 1980s, Friedman shifted his creative focus to writing detective novels. His books have similarities to his song lyrics, featuring a fictionalized version of himself solving crimes in New York City and dispensing jokes, wisdom, recipes, charm, and Jameson&#x27;s whiskey in equal measure. They are written in a straightforward style which owes a debt to Raymond Chandler. The Kinky character views himself as a latter-day Sherlock Holmes and he is aided in his investigations by his close friend Larry Sloman aka Ratso who assumes the role of Dr. Watson.

He authored two novels that do not star the Kinky Friedman character: &quot;Kill Two Birds and Get Stoned&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Pig.&quot;

Friedman also wrote a regular column for the magazine &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; from April 2001 to March 2005 which was suspended during his run for governor of Texas. In 2008, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; brought his column back on a bimonthly basis.

Two books have been published collecting some of these nonfiction writings, as well as previously unpublished ones: &quot;Scuse Me While I Whip This Out&quot; and &quot;Texas Hold&#x27;em&quot;. He has also published a travelog (&quot;The Great Psychedelic Armadillo Picnic&quot;) and an etiquette guide.

Friedman&#x27;s early books have been republished by Friedman&#x27;s own Vandam Press as ebooks. During March and April 2011, Vandam released seven of Friedman&#x27;s early titles including: &quot;Greenwich Killing Time, A Case of Lone Star, Musical Chairs, When The Cat&#x27;s Away, Frequent Flyer, Roadkill&quot; and the rarely seen &quot;Curse of the Missing Puppet Head&quot;. &quot;Elvis Jesus and Coca-Cola, God Bless John Wayne, Blast From The Past, Armadillos and Old Lace&quot;, and two nonfiction books, &quot;Drinker With A Writing Problem&quot; and &quot;Heroes of A Texas Childhood&quot; were released in 2011. E-book releases are announced on Friedman&#x27;s X (Twitter) feed and Facebook page, &quot;TheRealKinkster&quot;.

Friedman also announced (via Jim Bessman&#x27;s column at examiner.com) the upcoming release of all Vandam Press titles as unabridged audio books &quot;read by the author&quot;.

The recurring character &quot;Rambam&quot;, a New York private investigator and friend of the Friedman character in the books, is based on the real-life investigator Steven Rambam, who acts as a technical advisor for the real Friedman. Old Peace Corps friend and long time road manager Dylan Ferrero is also a recurring character in Kinky&#x27;s mystery novels; his character is known for only speaking in rock and roll quotes, a trait taken from real life.

==Politics==

In 1986, Friedman ran for Justice of the Peace in Kerrville, Texas, as a Republican but lost the election.

In 2004, Friedman began an ostensibly serious, though colorful, campaign to become the Governor of Texas in 2006. One of his stated goals is the &quot;dewussification&quot; of Texas. Among his campaign slogans were &quot;How Hard Could It Be?&quot;, &quot;Why The Hell Not?&quot;, &quot;My Governor is a Jewish Cowboy&quot;, and &quot;He ain&#x27;t Kinky, he&#x27;s my Governor&quot; (cf. &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;).

Friedman had hoped to follow in the footsteps of other entertainers-turned-governors, including Jimmie Davis, Jesse Ventura, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Ronald Reagan. Jesse Ventura even campaigned with Friedman for his election. When the campaign finance reports came out after the second quarter had ended, Friedman had raised more funds than the Democratic nominee, former Congressman Chris Bell.

On election day, Friedman was defeated, receiving 12.6% of the votes in the six-candidate matchup.

Friedman released a statement on October 15, 2013, announcing his intent to again run for Texas agriculture commissioner as a Democrat. Friedman previously ran for the post in 2010, losing in the Democratic primary.

===Issues and positions===
Friedman supported the full legalization and cultivation of hemp and marijuana, declaring that the end of the prohibition is a health, education funding, prison reduction, border security, and state&#x27;s rights issue.

On education, he supported higher pay for teachers and working to lower Texas&#x27;s dropout rate. He supported more investment in harnessing Texas&#x27;s alternative fuel resources such as wind and biodiesel. Friedman was opposed to the Trans-Texas Corridor since it relies on toll road construction.

Friedman supported capital punishment reform. He previously summed up his position, &quot;I am not anti-death penalty, but I&#x27;m damn sure anti-the-wrong-guy-getting-executed.&quot; More recently, he clarified his position: &quot;The system is not perfect. Until it&#x27;s perfect, let&#x27;s do away with the death penalty.&quot;

On illegal immigration, Friedman wanted to increase the number of Texas National Guard troops on the border (from the current 1,500 to 10,000), impose $25,000 and $50,000 fines on companies that hire illegal immigrants, and require foreign nationals seeking employment to purchase a foreign taxpayer ID card once they have passed a criminal background check. &quot;Texas can no longer wait for our federal government to solve our illegal immigration problem,&quot; Friedman said. &quot;These are steps that Texas can immediately take to help stem the tide of illegal immigrants penetrating our border.&quot; Had he been elected, he had promised to meet regularly with Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona to develop a coordinated border state plan to supplement federal efforts to curb illegal immigration. Previously, Kinky put forth the &quot;Five Mexican Generals&quot; Plan, to pay Mexican officials to halt immigration on their side of the border. Although he originally stated &quot;When I talk about the five Mexican generals, people think I&#x27;m joking but I&#x27;m dead serious&quot;, Friedman later told the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; that the plan, never meant to be carried out, was a joke with an element of seriousness.

According to his official website, Friedman&#x27;s answer to the question &quot;How does Kinky feel about abortion?&quot; was &quot;Kinky believes in a woman&#x27;s right to choose.&quot; In person, he hedged his bets, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not pro-life, and I&#x27;m not pro-choice. I&#x27;m pro-football.&quot; On social issues, he supported gay marriage, answering an Associated Press reporter&#x27;s question on the subject on February 3, 2005, by saying, &quot;I support gay marriage. I believe they have a right to be as miserable as the rest of us.&quot; (Friedman himself never married.)

According to &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot; magazine, Friedman planned to roll back &quot;any and all smoking bans&quot; if elected. One of his favorite quotes came from Mark Twain: &quot;If smoking is not allowed in heaven, I shall not go.&quot; Friedman supported the decriminalization of marijuana, though he did not advocate making its sale legal. &quot;I&#x27;m not talking about like Amsterdam,&quot; he noted, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to clear some of the room out of the prisons so we can put the bad guys in there, like the pedophiles and the politicians.&quot;

===Further political activities===

On August 9, 2007, the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; reported that Friedman was considering another run for governor of Texas in 2010. &quot;I&#x27;m open to running&quot;, Friedman said, adding that he would not make a final decision until after the 2008 elections. On February 10, 2009, Friedman confirmed to the Associated Press that he was still interested in running.

In an August 23, 2007 interview with the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; and a February 10, 2009 interview with the Associated Press, Friedman stated that if he did run in 2010, he would run as a Democrat, citing that &quot;God probably couldn&#x27;t have won as an independent&quot; and that he was a Democrat all his life.

On April 14, 2009, Friedman announced in an email to supporters that he intended to make a second gubernatorial run, this time as a Democrat. Friedman then announced on December 14, 2009, that he was leaving the gubernatorial race and would instead seek the party nomination in March 2010 for Texas Agriculture Commissioner. He lost the nomination to rancher Hank Gilbert in the primary held on March 2, 2010.

==Other work and references in popular culture==
Friedman appeared in the 2004 documentary film &quot;Barbecue: A Texas Love Story&quot; by Austin-based director Chris Elley. In the film, narrated by Governor Ann Richards, Kinky exclaims that &quot;Jesus loved Barbecue&quot; and analyzes the speech patterns of Texans versus New Yorkers. Raw footage from Friedman&#x27;s interview appears in the 2005 DVD release of the film. He appeared in other movies as well including &quot;Loose Shoes&quot; and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;.

Friedman&#x27;s persona as a politically incorrect raconteur has been likened to that of movie critic and commentator John Irving Bloom, better known in print as Joe Bob Briggs, with whom he appeared in the B movie &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;.

Friedman preferred to smoke Montecristo No. 2 Cigars, the same brand once smoked by Fidel Castro. However, he also smoked Bolivars, noting that &quot;Simón Bolívar is the only person in history to be exiled from a country named after him.&quot; Friedman later made eponymous cigars under the name Kinky Friedman Cigars.

Friedman was given brief praise in Joseph Heller&#x27;s 1976 novel, &quot;Good as Gold&quot;, in which a governor (meant to satirize Lyndon B. Johnson), tells the main character, Bruce Gold: &quot;Gold, I like you. You remind me a lot of this famous country singer from Texas I&#x27;m crazy about, a fellow calls himself Kinky Friedman, the Original Texas Jewboy. Kinky&#x27;s smarter, but I like you more.&quot;

Friedman was friends with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and he visited both at the White House. He wrote about his friendships with them in his November 2001 column (&quot;Hail to the Kinkster&quot;) for &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;.

The play &quot;Becoming Kinky: The World According to Kinky Friedman&quot;, directed by Ted Swindley (&quot;Always...Patsy Cline&quot;), starring Jesse Dayton, Little Jewford, Alan Lee, and Andross Bautsch, premiered in Houston, Texas on March 28, 2011.

Friedman was responsible for the quote &quot;you&#x27;ve got to find what you love and let it kill you,&quot; which is often falsely attributed to the poet and novelist Charles Bukowski.

Friedman hosted the live concert music television show &quot;Texas Roadhouse Live&quot; around 2011, which would air on over-the-air network television late Saturday night (or midnight Sunday morning) in some Texas markets.

On the 2017 album entitled &quot;Out of All This Blue&quot;, Mike Scott of The Waterboys composed a song called &quot;Kinky&#x27;s History Lesson&quot; where the singer attempts to correct Friedman on a number of false statements he has allegedly made.

<text>Kurt Friedrich Gödel ( ; ; April 28, 1906 – January 14, 1978) was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher. Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gödel profoundly influenced scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century (at a time when Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the foundations of mathematics), building on earlier work by Frege, Richard Dedekind, and Georg Cantor.

Gödel&#x27;s discoveries in the foundations of mathematics led to the proof of his completeness theorem in 1929 as part of his dissertation to earn a doctorate at the University of Vienna, and the publication of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems two years later, in 1931. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any ω-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example, Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms. To prove this, Gödel developed a technique now known as Gödel numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. The second incompleteness theorem, which follows from the first, states that the system cannot prove its own consistency.

Gödel also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, assuming that its axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic.

== Early life and education ==

=== Childhood ===
Gödel was born April 28, 1906, in Brünn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic), into the German-speaking family of Rudolf Gödel (1874–1929), the managing director and part owner of a major textile firm, and Marianne Gödel (née Handschuh, 1879–1966). At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents. His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised as Protestants. The ancestors of Kurt Gödel were often active in Brünn&#x27;s cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Gödel was a famous singer in his time and for some years a member of the (Men&#x27;s Choral Union of Brünn).

Gödel automatically became a citizen of Czechoslovakia at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed following its defeat in the First World War. According to his classmate , like many residents of the predominantly German , &quot;Gödel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia&quot;. In February 1929, he was granted release from his Czechoslovak citizenship and then, in April, granted Austrian citizenship. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gödel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. In 1948, after World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.

In his family, the young Gödel was nicknamed (&quot;Mr. Why&quot;) because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven, Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Gödel suffered from &quot;frequent episodes of poor health&quot;, which would continue for his entire life.

Gödel attended the , a Lutheran school in Brünn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Gödel had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna, where he attended medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, Gödel studied Gabelsberger shorthand, and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.

=== Studies in Vienna ===

At the age of 18, Gödel joined his brother at the University of Vienna. He had already mastered university-level mathematics. Although initially intending to study theoretical physics, he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. During this time, he adopted ideas of mathematical realism. He read Kant&#x27;s , and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap. Gödel then studied number theory, but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell&#x27;s book &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&quot;, he became interested in mathematical logic. According to Gödel, mathematical logic was &quot;a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences.&quot;

Attending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency in mathematical systems may have set Gödel&#x27;s life course. In 1928, Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published (&quot;Principles of Mathematical Logic&quot;), an introduction to first-order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed: &quot;Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?&quot;

This problem became the topic that Gödel chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, aged 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn&#x27;s supervision. In it, he established his eponymous completeness theorem regarding first-order logic. He was awarded his doctorate in 1930, and his thesis (accompanied by additional work) was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.

== Career ==
=== Incompleteness theorems ===
In 1930 Gödel attended the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences, held in Königsberg, 5–7 September. There, he presented his completeness theorem of first-order logic, and, at the end of the talk, mentioned that this result does not generalise to higher-order logic, thus hinting at his incompleteness theorems.

Gödel published his incompleteness theorems in (called in English &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot;). In that article, he proved for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (e.g., the Peano axioms or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice), that:

#If a (logical or axiomatic formal) system is omega-consistent, it cannot be syntactically complete.
#The consistency of axioms cannot be proved within their own system.
These theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of Gottlob Frege and culminating in and Hilbert&#x27;s program, to find a non-relatively consistent axiomatization sufficient for number theory (that was to serve as the foundation for other fields of mathematics).

Gödel constructed a formula that claims it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false. Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement. That is, for any computably enumerable set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but not provable in that system. To make this precise, Gödel had to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this by a process known as Gödel numbering.

In his two-page paper (1932), Gödel refuted the finite-valuedness of intuitionistic logic. In the proof, he implicitly used what has later become known as Gödel–Dummett intermediate logic (or Gödel fuzzy logic).

=== Mid-1930s: further work and U.S. visits ===
Gödel earned his habilitation at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna&#x27;s mathematicians. In June 1936, Moritz Schlick, whose seminar had aroused Gödel&#x27;s interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students, Johann Nelböck. This triggered &quot;a severe nervous crisis&quot; in Gödel. He developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases.

In 1933, Gödel first traveled to the U.S., where he met Albert Einstein, who became a good friend. He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society. During this year, Gödel also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using Gödel numbering.

In 1934, Gödel gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, titled &quot;On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems&quot;. Stephen Kleene, who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published.

Gödel visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The travelling and the hard work had exhausted him and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory.

He married (née Porkert, 1899–1981), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938. Gödel&#x27;s parents had opposed their relationship because she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was.

Subsequently, he left for another visit to the United States, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and publishing &quot;Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory,&quot; a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the constructible universe, a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gödel showed that both the axiom of choice (AC) and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the Hahn–Banach theorem. Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory.

Gödel spent the spring of 1939 at the University of Notre Dame.

=== Princeton, Einstein, U.S. citizenship ===
After the Anschluss on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany. Germany abolished the title , so Gödel had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down.

His predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939. Before the year was up, Gödel and his wife left Vienna for Princeton. To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the Gödels took the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco (which they reached on March 4, 1940), then crossed the US by train to Princeton. During this trip, Gödel was supposed to be carrying a secret letter from Viennese physicist Hans Thirring to Albert Einstein to alert Franklin D. Roosevelt of the possibility of Hitler making an atom bomb. Gödel never conveyed that letter to Einstein, although they did meet, because he was not convinced Hitler could achieve this feat. In any case, Leo Szilard had already conveyed the message to Einstein, and Einstein had already warned Roosevelt.

In Princeton, Gödel accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), which he had visited during 1933–34. 

Einstein was also living in Princeton during this time. Gödel and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist Oskar Morgenstern recounts that toward the end of Einstein&#x27;s life, Einstein confided that his &quot;own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with Gödel&quot;.

Gödel and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in Blue Hill, Maine, at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. Gödel was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using [volume 15] of Gödel&#x27;s still-unpublished [working notebooks], John W. Dawson Jr. conjectures that Gödel discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. Gödel&#x27;s close friend Hao Wang supports this conjecture, noting that Gödel&#x27;s Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem.

On December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied Gödel to his U.S. citizenship exam, where they acted as witnesses. Gödel had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the U.S. Constitution that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship; this has since been dubbed Gödel&#x27;s Loophole. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend&#x27;s unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. The judge turned out to be Phillip Forman, who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein&#x27;s own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gödel if he thought a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U.S. Gödel then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut Gödel off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.

Gödel became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work. He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976.

During his time at the institute, Gödel&#x27;s interests turned to philosophy and physics. In 1949, he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving closed timelike curves, to Einstein&#x27;s field equations in general relativity. He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday. His &quot;rotating universes&quot; would allow time travel to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. His solutions are known as the Gödel metric (an exact solution of the Einstein field equation).

He studied and admired the works of Gottfried Leibniz, but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibniz&#x27;s works to be suppressed. To a lesser extent he studied Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl. In the early 1970s, Gödel circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz&#x27;s version of Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s ontological proof of God&#x27;s existence. This is now known as Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof.

== Awards and honours ==
Gödel was awarded (with Julian Schwinger) the first Albert Einstein Award in 1951, and was also awarded the National Medal of Science, in 1974. Gödel was elected a resident member of the American Philosophical Society in 1961 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1968. He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Later life and death ==

Later in his life, Gödel suffered periods of mental instability and illness. Following the assassination of his close friend Moritz Schlick, Gödel developed an obsessive fear of being poisoned, and would eat only food prepared by his wife Adele. Adele was hospitalized beginning in late 1977, and in her absence Gödel refused to eat; he weighed when he died of &quot;malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance&quot; in Princeton Hospital on January 14, 1978. He was buried in Princeton Cemetery. Adele died in 1981.

== Religious views ==
Gödel believed that God was personal, and called his philosophy &quot;rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological&quot;. He formulated a formal proof for the existence of God known as Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof.

Gödel believed in an afterlife, saying, &quot;Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today&#x27;s science and received wisdom haven&#x27;t any inkling of. But I am convinced of this [the afterlife], independently of any theology.&quot; It is &quot;possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning&quot; that it &quot;is entirely consistent with known facts.&quot; &quot;If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing [as an afterlife].&quot;

In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gödel described his religion as &quot;baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is &quot;theistic&quot;, not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza.&quot; Of religion(s) in general, he said: &quot;Religions are for the most part bad, but not religion itself.&quot; According to his wife Adele, &quot;Gödel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning&quot;, while of Islam, he said, &quot;I like Islam: it is a consistent [or consequential] idea of religion and open-minded.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Douglas Hofstadter wrote the 1979 book to celebrate the work and ideas of Gödel, M. C. Escher and Johann Sebastian Bach. It partly explores the ramifications of the fact that Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem can be applied to any Turing-complete computational system, which may include the human brain. In 2005 John Dawson published a biography, &quot;Logical Dilemmas: The Life and Work of Kurt Gödel&quot;. Stephen Budiansky&#x27;s book about Gödel&#x27;s life, &quot;Journey to the Edge of Reason: The Life of Kurt Gödel&quot;, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Critics&#x27; Top Book of 2021. Gödel was one of four mathematicians examined in David Malone&#x27;s 2008 BBC documentary &quot;Dangerous Knowledge&quot;.

The Kurt Gödel Society, founded in 1987, is an international organization for the promotion of research in logic, philosophy, and the history of mathematics. The University of Vienna hosts the Kurt Gödel Research Center for Mathematical Logic. The Association for Symbolic Logic has held an annual Gödel Lecture since 1990. The Gödel Prize is given annually to an outstanding paper in theoretical computer science. Gödel&#x27;s philosophical notebooks are being edited at the Kurt Gödel Research Centre at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Five volumes of Gödel&#x27;s collected works have been published. The first two include his publications; the third includes unpublished manuscripts from his , and the final two include correspondence.

In the 1994 film &quot;I.Q.&quot;, Lou Jacobi portrays Gödel. In the 2023 movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, Gödel, played by James Urbaniak, briefly appears walking with Einstein in the gardens of Princeton.

<text>Karl Marx (; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German-born philosopher, political theorist, economist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. He is best-known for the 1848 pamphlet &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (written with Friedrich Engels), and his three-volume (1867–1894), a critique of classical political economy which employs his theory of historical materialism in an analysis of capitalism, in the culmination of his life&#x27;s work. Marx&#x27;s ideas and their subsequent development, collectively known as Marxism, have had enormous influence on modern intellectual, political and economic history.

Born in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, Marx studied at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Jena, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the latter in 1841. A Young Hegelian, he was influenced by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel&#x27;s ideas in works such as &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (written 1846) and the &quot;Grundrisse&quot; (written 1857–1858). While in Paris in 1844, Marx wrote his &quot;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts&quot; and met Engels, who became his closest friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the Communist League, and in 1848 they wrote &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, which expresses Marx&#x27;s ideas and lays out a programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London, where he wrote &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot; (1852) and . From 1864, Marx was involved in the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (First International), in which he fought the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his &quot;Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot; (1875), Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.

Marx&#x27;s critiques of history, society and political economy hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing his historical materialist approach, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class&#x27;s development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.

Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures of the modern era, and his work has been both lauded and criticised. Marxism has exerted major influence on socialist thought and political movements, with Marxist schools of thought such as Marxism–Leninism and its offshoots becoming the guiding ideologies of revolutionary governments that took power in many countries during the 20th century, known as communist states. Marx&#x27;s work in economics has had a strong influence on modern heterodox theories of labour and capital, and he is often cited as one of the principal architects of modern sociology.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood and early education: 1818–1836 ===
Karl Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Marx and Henriette Pressburg. He was born at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, an ancient city then part of the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s Province of the Lower Rhine. Marx&#x27;s family was originally non-religious Jewish but had converted formally to Christianity before his birth. His maternal grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while his paternal line had supplied Trier&#x27;s rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx. His father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. He became a lawyer with a comfortably upper middle class income and the family owned a number of Moselle vineyards, in addition to his income as an attorney. Prior to his son&#x27;s birth and after the abrogation of Jewish emancipation in the Rhineland, Herschel converted from Judaism to join the state Evangelical Church of Prussia, taking on the German forename Heinrich over the Yiddish Herschel.

Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the Enlightenment, interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, which was then an absolute monarchy. In 1815, Heinrich Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra. His wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jew from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both Gerard and Anton Philips and great-grandmother to Frits Philips. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and Jenny Marx would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.

Little is known of Marx&#x27;s childhood. The third of nine children, he became the eldest son when his brother Moritz died in 1819. Marx and his surviving siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie, and Caroline, were baptised into the Lutheran Church on 28 August 1824, and their mother in November 1825. Marx was privately educated by his father until 1830 when he entered Trier High School (), whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was a friend of his father. By employing many liberal humanists as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Marx&#x27;s attendance.

In October 1835 at the age of 16, Marx travelled to the University of Bonn wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field. Due to a condition referred to as a &quot;weak chest&quot;, Marx was excused from military duty when he turned 18. While at the University at Bonn, Marx joined the Poets&#x27; Club, a group containing political radicals that were monitored by the police. Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society () where many ideas were discussed and at one point he served as the club&#x27;s co-president. Additionally, Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 he took part in a duel with a member of the university&#x27;s Borussian Korps. Although his grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic University of Berlin.

=== Hegelianism and early journalism: 1836–1843 ===

Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Marx became more serious about his studies and his life. He became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated member of the petty nobility who had known Marx since childhood. As she had broken off her engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Marx befriended her father Ludwig von Westphalen (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated his doctoral thesis to him. Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843, they married in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.

In October 1836, Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university&#x27;s faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse. During the first term, Marx attended lectures of Eduard Gans (who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasising particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question) and of Karl von Savigny (who represented the Historical School of Law). Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that &quot;without philosophy nothing could be accomplished&quot;. Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles. During a convalescence in Stralau, he joined the Doctors Club (), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas, and through them became involved with a group of radical thinkers known as the Young Hegelians in 1837. They gathered around Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, with Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel&#x27;s metaphysical assumptions but adopted his dialectical method to criticise established society, politics and religion from a left-wing perspective. Marx&#x27;s father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family. Marx had been emotionally close to his father and treasured his memory after his death.

By 1837, Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, &quot;Scorpion and Felix&quot;; a drama, &quot;Oulanem&quot;; as well as a number of love poems dedicated to his wife. None of this early work was published during his lifetime. The love poems were published posthumously in the &quot;Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1&quot;. Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, art history and the translation of Latin classics. He began co-operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Religion&quot; in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature&quot;, which he completed in 1841. It was described as &quot;a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy&quot;. The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal University of Jena, whose faculty awarded him his Ph.D. in April 1841. As Marx and Bauer were both atheists, in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled (&quot;Atheistic Archives&quot;), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.

Marx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government&#x27;s growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians. Marx moved to Cologne in 1842, where he became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper (&quot;Rhineland News&quot;), expressing his early views on socialism and his developing interest in economics. Marx criticised right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements, whom he thought ineffective or counter-productive. The newspaper attracted the attention of the Prussian government censors, who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, which Marx lamented: &quot;Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear&quot;. After the published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar Nicholas I requested it be banned and Prussia&#x27;s government complied in 1843.

=== Paris: 1843–1845 ===
In 1843, Marx became co-editor of a new, radical left-wing Parisian newspaper, the (&quot;German-French Annals&quot;), then being set up by the German activist Arnold Ruge to bring together German and French radicals. Therefore Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 Rue Vaneau, they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844. Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian anarchist collectivist Mikhail Bakunin. Marx contributed two essays to the paper, &quot;Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot; and &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot;, the latter introducing his belief that the proletariat were a revolutionary force and marking his embrace of communism. Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of Heinrich Heine&#x27;s satirical odes on King Ludwig of Bavaria, leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down). After the paper&#x27;s collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, (&quot;Forward!&quot;). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the League of the Just, a utopian socialist secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings but did not join. In , Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.

On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, beginning a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844&quot;, convincing Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx&#x27;s former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as &quot;The Holy Family&quot;. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.

During the time that he lived at 38 Rue Vaneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845), Marx engaged in an intensive study of political economy (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, &quot;etc.&quot;)&quot;,&quot; the French socialists (especially Claude Henri St. Simon and Charles Fourier) and the history of France. The study of, and critique, of political economy is a project that Marx would pursue for the rest of his life and would result in his major economic workthe three-volume series called &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. Marxism is based in large part on three influences: Hegel&#x27;s dialectics, French utopian socialism and British political economy. Together with his earlier study of Hegel&#x27;s dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of &quot;Marxism&quot; were in place by the autumn of 1844. Marx was constantly being pulled away from his critique of political economynot only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still, Marx was always drawn back to his studies where he sought &quot;to understand the inner workings of capitalism&quot;.

An outline of &quot;Marxism&quot; had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world had been worked out in great detail, but Marx needed to write down all of the details of his world view to further clarify the new critique of political economy in his own mind. Accordingly, Marx wrote &quot;The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts&quot;. These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx&#x27;s concept of alienated labour. By the spring of 1845, his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new critique of political economy he was espousing—that of scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.

The &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot; had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Marx recognised that the &quot;Manuscripts&quot; had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach&#x27;s philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven &quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot;. The &quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot; are best known for Thesis 11, which states that &quot;philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it&quot;. This work contains Marx&#x27;s criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory), and, overall, philosophy (for putting abstract reality above the physical world). It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx&#x27;s historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice. In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down , with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Marx from France.

=== Brussels: 1845–1848 ===
Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium he had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics. In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels. Later, Mary Burns, Engels&#x27; long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.

In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the Chartists, a working-class movement in Britain. This was Marx&#x27;s first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844. Not only did Engels already know the English language, but he had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders. Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers. Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.

In collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of historical materialism, &quot;The German Ideology&quot;. In this work, Marx broke with Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while he also broke with Karl Grün and other &quot;true socialists&quot; whose philosophies were still based in part on &quot;idealism&quot;. In &quot;German Ideology&quot;, Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history. &quot;German Ideology&quot; is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of his, &quot;German Ideology&quot; would not be published in Marx&#x27;s lifetime and was published only in 1932.

After completing &quot;German Ideology&quot;, Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding &quot;the theory and tactics&quot; of a truly &quot;revolutionary proletarian movement&quot; operating from the standpoint of a truly &quot;scientific materialist&quot; philosophy. This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx&#x27;s own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend, on most occasions, to act in accordance with their own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class&#x27;s best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors he called the book &quot;The Poverty of Philosophy&quot; (1847) and offered it as a response to the &quot;petty-bourgeois philosophy&quot; of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in his book &quot;The Philosophy of Poverty&quot; (1840).

These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels&#x27;s most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just. As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working-class revolution. However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the League had to cease its &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;underground&quot; orientation and operate in the open as a political party. Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the League was reorganised by its membership into a new open &quot;above ground&quot; political society that appealed directly to the working classes. This new open political society was called the Communist League. Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League.

In late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work – a programme of action for the Communist League. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; was first published on 21 February 1848. &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had been doing. The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: &quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles&quot;. It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie (the wealthy capitalist class) and the proletariat (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.

Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolutions of 1848. In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic. Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father (withheld by his uncle Lionel Philips since his father&#x27;s death in 1838) of either 6,000 or 5,000 francs he allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action. Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed, the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Marx of it, subsequently arresting him and he was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power he believed that he would be safe.

=== Cologne: 1848–1849 ===

Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a German Workers&#x27; Club with various German socialists living there. Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the &quot;Demands of the Communist Party in Germany&quot;, in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;, believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the feudal monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie. On 1 June, Marx started the publication of a daily newspaper, the , which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the Communist League, according to Friedrich Engels it remained &quot;a simple dictatorship by Marx&quot;.

Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting, although each time he was acquitted. Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counterrevolutionary measures to expunge left-wing and other revolutionary elements from the country. Consequently, the was soon suppressed, and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May 1849. Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counterrevolution and a cholera epidemic, and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and with Marx not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.

=== Move to London and further writing: 1850–1860 ===
Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in the city for the rest of his life. The headquarters of the Communist League also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850, a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Willich and Karl Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise &quot;spontaneously&quot; to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was &quot;adventuristic&quot; and would be suicide for the Communist League. Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the Communist League itself, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men. They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (&quot;circa&quot; 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 he felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working-class agenda and a working-class revolution.

After a long struggle that threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx&#x27;s opinion prevailed and eventually, the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers&#x27; Educational Society. The Society held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London&#x27;s entertainment district. This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League, but Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers&#x27; Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.

=== &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; and journalism ===
In the early period in London, Marx committed himself almost exclusively to his studies, such that his family endured extreme poverty. His main source of income was Engels, whose own source was his wealthy industrialist father. In Prussia as editor of his own newspaper, and contributor to others ideologically aligned, Marx could reach his audience, the working classes. In London, without finances to run a newspaper themselves, he and Engels turned to international journalism. At one stage they were being published by six newspapers from England, the United States, Prussia, Austria, and South Africa. Marx&#x27;s principal earnings came from his work as European correspondent, from 1852 to 1862, for the &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot;, and from also producing articles for more &quot;bourgeois&quot; newspapers. Marx had his articles translated from German by , until his proficiency in English had become adequate.

The &quot;New-York Daily Tribune&quot; had been founded in April 1841 by Horace Greeley. Its editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among them George Ripley and the journalist Charles Dana, who was editor-in-chief. Dana, a fourierist and an abolitionist, was Marx&#x27;s contact. The &quot;Tribune&quot; was a vehicle for Marx to reach a transatlantic public, such as for his &quot;hidden warfare&quot; against Henry Charles Carey. The journal had wide working-class appeal from its foundation; at two cents, it was inexpensive; and, with about 50,000 copies per issue, its circulation was the widest in the United States. Its editorial ethos was progressive and its anti-slavery stance reflected Greeley&#x27;s. Marx&#x27;s first article for the paper, on the British parliamentary elections, was published on 21 August 1852.

On 21 March 1857, Dana informed Marx that due to the economic recession only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, the &quot;Tribune&quot; discharged all its correspondents in Europe except Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Marx resumed contributions from September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform him that there was no longer space in the &quot;Tribune&quot; for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs. In 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, at which he was editor-in-chief. In April 1857, Dana invited Marx to contribute articles, mainly on military history, to the &quot;New American Cyclopedia&quot;, an idea of George Ripley, Dana&#x27;s friend and literary editor of the &quot;Tribune&quot;. In all, 67 Marx-Engels articles were published, of which 51 were written by Engels, although Marx did some research for them in the British Museum. By the late 1850s, American popular interest in European affairs waned and Marx&#x27;s articles turned to topics such as the &quot;slavery crisis&quot; and the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 in the &quot;War Between the States&quot;. Between December 1851 and March 1852, Marx worked on his theoretical work about the French Revolution of 1848, titled &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon&quot;. In this he explored concepts in historical materialism, class struggle, dictatorship of the proletariat, and victory of the proletariat over the bourgeois state.

The 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the young Marx&#x27;s Hegelian idealism and the more mature Marx&#x27;s scientific ideology associated with structural Marxism. However, not all scholars accept this distinction. For Marx and Engels, their experience of the Revolutions of 1848 to 1849 were formative in the development of their theory of economics and historical progression. After the &quot;failures&quot; of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Marx and his fellow communists, whom he denounced as &quot;adventurists&quot;. Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that &quot;will power&quot; could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite. The recession in the United States&#x27; economy in 1852 gave Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity, yet this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America&#x27;s western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by their national borders. When the so-called Panic of 1857 in the United States spread globally, it broke all economic theory models, and was the first truly global economic crisis.

=== First International and &quot;Das Kapital&quot; ===
Marx continued to write articles for the &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot; as long as he was sure that the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the &quot;Tribune&quot; to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

In 1864, Marx became involved in the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (also known as the First International), to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864. In that organisation, Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876). Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International. The most important political event during the existence of the International was the Paris Commune of 1871 when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, &quot;The Civil War in France&quot;, a defence of the Commune.

Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers&#x27; revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand and provide a critique suitable for the capitalist mode of production, and hence spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state, and foreign trade, and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939, under the title &quot;Grundrisse der Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie&quot; ().

In 1859, Marx published &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot;, his first serious critique of political economy. This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (English title: &quot;Capital: Critique of Political Economy&quot;), which he intended to publish at a later date. In &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot;, Marx began to critically examine axioms and categories of economic thinking. The work was enthusiastically received, and the edition sold out quickly.

The successful sales of &quot;A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy&quot; stimulated Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life&#x27;s work – and the &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot;, which discussed and critiqued the theoreticians of political economy, particularly Adam Smith and David Ricardo. &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; is often referred to as the fourth volume of and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the history of economic thought. In 1867, the first volume of was published, a work which critically analysed capital. proposes an explanation of the &quot;laws of motion&quot; of the mode of production from its origins to its future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, with topics such as the growth of wage labour, the transformation of the workplace, capital accumulation, competition, the banking system, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and land-rents, as well as how waged labour continually reproduce the rule of capital. Marx proposes that the driving force of capital is in the exploitation of labour, whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of surplus value.

Demand for a Russian language edition of soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German-language edition of had been sold out and a second edition was published.

Volumes II and III of remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life. Both volumes were published by Engels after Marx&#x27;s death. Volume II of was prepared and published by Engels in July 1893 under the name &quot;Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital&quot;. Volume III of was published a year later in October 1894 under the name &quot;Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole&quot;. &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; derived from the sprawling &quot;Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863&quot;, a &quot;second&quot; draft for , the latter spanning volumes 30–34 of the &quot;Collected Works of Marx and Engels&quot;. Specifically, &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; runs from the latter part of the &quot;Collected Works&#x27;&quot; thirtieth volume through the end of their thirty-second volume; meanwhile, the larger &quot;Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863&quot; run from the start of the &quot;Collected Works&quot;&#x27; thirtieth volume through the first half of their thirty-fourth volume. The latter half of the Collected Works&#x27; thirty-fourth volume consists of the surviving fragments of the &quot;Economic Manuscripts of 1863–1864&quot;, which represented a &quot;third&quot; draft for , and a large portion of which is included as an appendix to the Penguin edition of , volume I. A German-language abridged edition of &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of &quot;Theories of Surplus Value&quot; was published as the &quot;fourth volume&quot; of in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.

During the last decade of his life, Marx&#x27;s health declined, and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work. He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His &quot;Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot; opposed the tendency of his followers Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel to compromise with the state socialist ideas of Ferdinand Lassalle in the interests of a united socialist party. This work is also notable for another famous Marx quote: &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;.

In a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia&#x27;s bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village &quot;mir&quot;. While admitting that Russia&#x27;s rural &quot;commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia&quot;, Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it &quot;would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it [the rural commune] from all sides&quot;. Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed that &quot;normal conditions of spontaneous development&quot; of the rural commune could exist. However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that &quot;at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production&quot;. In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that &quot;the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type – collective production and appropriation&quot;. He added that &quot;the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies&quot;. Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot;.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
Marx and von Westphalen had seven children together, but partly owing to the poor conditions in which they lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood. Their children were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy (&quot;Guido&quot;; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances (&quot;Franziska&quot;; 1851–1852); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). According to his son-in-law, Paul Lafargue, Marx was a loving father. In 1962, there were allegations that Marx fathered a son, Freddy, out of wedlock by his housekeeper, Helene Demuth, but the claim is disputed for lack of documented evidence.

Helene Demuth was also largely entrusted as a confidante. In her obituary, penned by Friedrich Engels, her role is revealed as: &quot;Marx took counsel of Helena Demuth, not only in difficult and intricate party matters, but even in respect of his economical writings&quot;. 

Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. While in Paris, he used that of &quot;Monsieur Ramboz&quot;, whilst in London, he signed off his letters as &quot;A. Williams&quot;. His friends referred to him as &quot;Moor&quot;, owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him &quot;Old Nick&quot; and &quot;Charley&quot;. He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family, referring to Friedrich Engels as &quot;General&quot;, his housekeeper Helene as &quot;Lenchen&quot; or &quot;Nym&quot;, while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as &quot;Qui Qui, Emperor of China&quot; and another, Laura, was known as &quot;Kakadou&quot; or &quot;the Hottentot&quot;.

=== Health ===
Marx drank heavily after joining the Trier Tavern Club drinking society in the 1830s, and continued to do so until his death.

Marx was afflicted by poor health, what he himself described as &quot;the wretchedness of existence&quot;, and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterward free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head, and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics.

The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, &quot;none of which are good for liver patients&quot;, but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount &quot;and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars&quot;. From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: &quot;These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes&quot;. The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx&#x27;s irritability is often found in liver patients:

The illness emphasised certain traits in his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence ... There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this ... not even Engels was an exception.

According to Princeton historian Jerrold Seigel, in his late teens, Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on (which he never completed), Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, a bad diet, and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, &quot;was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx&#x27;s style of life – alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep – all contributed. Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime&quot;. In Seigel&#x27;s thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.

In 2007, a retrodiagnosis of Marx&#x27;s skin disease was made by dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University and for Shuster, the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from hidradenitis suppurativa, a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of apocrine ducts opening into hair follicles. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx&#x27;s physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions.

To arrive at his retrodiagnosis, Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the &quot;Marx/Engels Collected Works&quot;. There, &quot;although the skin lesions were called &#x27;furuncles&#x27;, &#x27;boils&#x27; and &#x27;carbuncles&#x27; by Marx, his wife, and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis&quot;. The sites of the persistent &#x27;carbuncles&#x27; were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, perianal, genital (penis and scrotum) and suprapubic regions and inner thighs, &quot;favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa&quot;. Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis &quot;can now be made definitively&quot;.

Shuster went on to consider the potential psychosocial effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood, and well-being, feelings for which Shuster found &quot;much evidence&quot; in the Marx correspondence. Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx&#x27;s work and even helped him to develop his theory of alienation.

=== Death ===
Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883, when he died a stateless person at age 64. Family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists. For example, George Eliot&#x27;s grave is nearby. According to Francis Wheen, there were between nine and eleven mourners at his funeral. Research from contemporary sources identifies thirteen named individuals attending the funeral: Friedrich Engels, Eleanor Marx, Edward Aveling, Paul Lafargue, Charles Longuet, Helene Demuth, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Gottlieb Lemke, Frederick Lessner, G Lochner, Sir Ray Lankester, Carl Schorlemmer and Ernest Radford. A contemporary newspaper account claims that twenty-five to thirty relatives and friends attended the funeral. 

A writer in &quot;The Graphic&quot; noted: &#x27;By a strange blunder ... his death was not announced for two days, and then as having taken place at Paris. The next day the correction came from Paris; and when his friends and followers hastened to his house in Haverstock Hill, to learn the time and place of burial, they learned that he was already in the cold ground. But for this secresy [sic] and haste, a great popular demonstration would undoubtedly have been held over his grave&#x27;.

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including Wilhelm Liebknecht and Friedrich Engels. Engels&#x27; speech included the passage: 

Marx&#x27;s surviving daughters Eleanor and Laura, as well as Charles Longuet and Paul Lafargue, Marx&#x27;s two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance. He had been predeceased by his wife and his eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German, and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French. Two telegrams from workers&#x27; parties in France and Spain were also read out. Together with Engels&#x27;s speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral. Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne Communist Trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as &quot;an old member of the Communist League&quot;; and Carl Schorlemmer, a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the Royal Society, and a communist activist involved in the 1848 Baden revolution. Another attendee of the funeral was Ray Lankester, a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.

Marx left a personal estate valued for probate at £250, equivalent to £38,095 in 2024. Upon his own death in 1895, Engels left Marx&#x27;s two surviving daughters a &quot;significant portion&quot; of his considerable estate, valued in 2024 at US$6.8 million.

Marx and his family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The tomb at the new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956, bears the carved message: &quot;Workers of All Lands Unite&quot;, the final line of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;; and, from the 11th &quot;Thesis on Feuerbach&quot; (as edited by Engels), &quot;The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various waysthe point however is to change it&quot;. The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) had the monument with a portrait bust by Laurence Bradshaw erected and Marx&#x27;s original tomb had only humble adornment. Black civil rights leader and CPGB activist Claudia Jones was later buried beside Karl Marx&#x27;s tomb.

The Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm remarked: &quot;One cannot say Marx died a failure.&quot; Although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the left-wing movements in Germany and Russia. Within twenty-five years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx&#x27;s influence on their politics had contributed to significant gains in their representative democratic elections.

== Thought ==
=== Influences ===

Marx&#x27;s thought demonstrates influence from many sources, including but not limited to:
* Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s philosophy
* The classical political economy (economics) of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, as well as Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi&#x27;s critique of laissez-faire economics and analysis of the precarious state of the proletariat
* French socialist thought, in particular the thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Henri de Saint-Simon, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Charles Fourier
* Earlier German philosophical materialism among the Young Hegelians, particularly that of Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, as well as the French materialism of the late 18th century, including Diderot, Claude Adrien Helvétius and d&#x27;Holbach
* Friedrich Engels&#x27; analysis of the working class, as well as the early descriptions of class provided by French liberals and Saint-Simonians such as François Guizot and Augustin Thierry
* Marx&#x27;s Judaic legacy has been identified as formative to both his moral outlook and his materialist philosophy.

Marx&#x27;s view of history, which came to be called historical materialism (controversially adapted as the philosophy of dialectical materialism by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel&#x27;s claim that one should view reality (and history) dialectically. However, whereas Hegel had thought in idealist terms, putting ideas in the forefront, Marx sought to conceptualise dialectics in materialist terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea. 

Where Hegel saw the &quot;spirit&quot; as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world. He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet. Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used Gothic language in several of his works: in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; he proclaims &quot;A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre&quot;, and in &quot;The Capital&quot; he refers to capital as &quot;necromancy that surrounds the products of labour&quot;.

Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought, Marx criticised utopian socialists, arguing that their favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the economic system could bring about real change.

Other important contributions to Marx&#x27;s revision of Hegelianism came from Engels&#x27;s book, &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844&quot;, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution, as well as from the social democrat Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz, who in described the movement of society as &quot;flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production&quot;.

Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically, discerning tendencies of history and thereby predicting the outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx, therefore, concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his &quot;Theses on Feuerbach&quot; that &quot;philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it&quot; and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.

Marx&#x27;s theories inspired several theories and disciplines of future, including but not limited to:
* Contemporary critique of political economy
* Kondratiev wave and Kuznets swing
* Theory of Underconsumption
* Creative destruction
* Crisis theory
* Quantitative Economic History
* World-systems theory

=== Philosophy and social thought ===
Marx has been called &quot;the first great user of critical method in social sciences&quot;, a characterisation stemming from his frequent use of polemics throughout his work to effect critiques of other thinkers. He criticised speculative philosophy, equating metaphysics with ideology. By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases. This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.

==== Human nature ====
Like Tocqueville, who described a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot, Marx also broke with classical thinkers who spoke of a single tyrant and with Montesquieu, who discussed the nature of the single despot. Instead, Marx set out to analyse &quot;the despotism of capital&quot;. Fundamentally, Marx assumed that human history involves transforming human nature, which encompasses both human beings and material objects. Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves. 

For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal alienation stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a subjective agent, renders its potential counterpart an object to be apprehended. Marx further argues that by moulding nature in desired ways the subject takes the object as its own and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human. For Marx, the human nature – , or species-being – exists as a function of human labour. 

Fundamental to Marx&#x27;s idea of meaningful labour is the proposition that for a subject to come to terms with its alienated object it must first exert influence upon literal, material objects in the subject&#x27;s world. Marx acknowledges that Hegel &quot;grasps the nature of work and comprehends objective man, authentic because actual, as the result of his &quot;, but characterises Hegelian self-development as unduly &quot;spiritual&quot; and abstract. 

Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that &quot;the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has actual, sensuous objects for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only express his life in actual sensuous objects&quot;. Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian &quot;work&quot; into material &quot;labour&quot; and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term &quot;labour power&quot;.

==== Labour, class struggle and false consciousness ====


Marx had a special concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of alienation. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one&#x27;s own labour – one&#x27;s capacity to transform the world – is tantamount to being alienated from one&#x27;s own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.

Commodity fetishism provides an example of what Engels called &quot;false consciousness&quot;, which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By &quot;ideology&quot;, Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal. Marx and Engels&#x27;s point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production include not only the production of food or manufactured goods but also the production of ideas (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests). An example of this sort of analysis is Marx&#x27;s understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface to his 1843 &quot;Contribution to the Critique of Hegel&#x27;s Philosophy of Right&quot;: 

Whereas his Gymnasium senior thesis at the argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of solidarity, here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic &quot;status quo&quot; and inequality.

Marx was an outspoken opponent of child labour, saying that British industries &quot;could but live by sucking blood, and children&#x27;s blood too&quot;, and that U.S. capital was financed by the &quot;capitalized blood of children&quot;.

==== Critique of political economy, history and society ====
Marx&#x27;s thoughts on labour and its function in reproducing capital were related to the primacy he gave to social relations in determining the society&#x27;s past, present and future. Critics have called this economic determinism. Labour is the precondition for the existence of, and accumulation of capital, which both shape the social system. For Marx, social change was driven by conflict between opposing interests, by parties situated in the historical situation of their mode of production. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. 

In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative activities that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, but rather due to the immanent logic of the current mode of production which demands more human labour (abstract labour) to reproduce the social relationships of capital.

The organisation of society depends on means of production. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources, and technology but not human labour. The relations of production are the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, where the base (or substructure) is the economic system and superstructure is the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.

Despite Marx&#x27;s stress on the critique of capitalism and discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudalism). Marx never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, but scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.
Marx&#x27;s view of capitalism was two-sided. On one hand, in the 19th century&#x27;s deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system he noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical depressions leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, he characterised capitalism as &quot;revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity&quot; (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, technological progress, increased productivity and growth, rationality, and scientific revolution) that are responsible for progress, at in contrast to earlier forms of societies. 

Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of feudalism. Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and capital equipment.

According to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference &quot;surplus value&quot; and argued that it was based on surplus labour, the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive, and what they can produce. Although Marx describes capitalists as vampires sucking worker&#x27;s blood, he notes that drawing profit is &quot;by no means an injustice&quot; since Marx, according to Allen W. Wood &quot;excludes any trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment&quot; on the morals of such particular arrangements. Marx also noted that even the capitalists themselves cannot go against the system. The problem is the &quot;cancerous cell&quot; of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the social relations between workers and owners, (the selling and purchasing of labour power) – the societal system, or rather mode of production, in general.

At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to periodic crises. He suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour. Since Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows. Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this cycle of growth and collapse. Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and empower the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat. In section one of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, Marx describes feudalism, capitalism, and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:

Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop class consciousness, in time realising that they can and must change the system. Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing the exploiting class and introducing a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises. Marx argued in &quot;The German Ideology&quot; that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: 

In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by selling their labour. It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population. In such a utopian world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation. Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of dictatorship of the proletariat – where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production. As he wrote in his &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;, &quot;between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;. While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot &quot;attain their goal by peaceful means&quot; the &quot;lever of our revolution must be force&quot;.

=== International relations ===
Marx viewed Russia as the main counter-revolutionary threat to European revolutions. During the Crimean War, Marx backed the Ottoman Empire and its allies Britain and France against Russia. He was absolutely opposed to Pan-Slavism, viewing it as an instrument of Russian foreign policy. Marx had considered the Slavic nations except Poles as &#x27;counter-revolutionary&#x27;. Marx and Engels published in the &quot;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&quot; in February 1849:

Marx and Engels sympathised with the Narodnik revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the Russian revolutionaries assassinated Tsar Alexander II of Russia, Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed &#x27;the formation of a Russian commune&#x27;. Marx supported the Polish uprisings against tsarist Russia. He said in a speech in London in 1867:

Marx supported the cause of Irish independence. In 1867, he wrote Engels: &quot;I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think it inevitable. The English working class will never accomplish anything until it has got rid of Ireland. ... English reaction in England had its roots ... in the subjugation of Ireland.&quot;

Marx spent some time in French Algeria, which had been invaded and made a French colony in 1830, and had the opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. He wrote about the colonial justice system, in which &quot;a form of torture has been used (and this happens &#x27;regularly&#x27;) to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the &#x27;police&#x27;; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it.&quot; Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many European settlers in Algiers and wrote in a letter: &quot;when a European colonist dwells among the &#x27;lesser breeds,&#x27; either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the &#x27;lesser breeds,&#x27; the British and Dutch outdo the French.&quot;

According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;: &quot;Marx&#x27;s analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. His account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that he shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. He argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India.&quot;

Marx discussed British colonial rule in India in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in June 1853:

== Legacy ==


Marx&#x27;s ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought, in particular in the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution. Followers of Marx have often debated among themselves over how to interpret Marx&#x27;s writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx&#x27;s thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx&#x27;s most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include political theories such as Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism, libertarian Marxism, and Open Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical materialism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism, and Hegelian Marxism.

From an academic perspective, Marx&#x27;s work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been cited as one of the 19th century&#x27;s three masters of the &quot;school of suspicion&quot;, alongside Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud, and as one of the three principal architects of modern social science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. In contrast to other philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method. 

Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in an attempt to develop a &quot;science of society&quot;. Karl Löwith considered Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest philosophical successors of Hegel. 

In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology &quot;in so far as anyone can claim the title&quot;. Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts, and the humanities.
Social theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx. One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as analytical Marxism. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx&#x27;s social theory and emphasise the &quot;relative autonomyworking-class agenda&quot; of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx&#x27;s central narrative of interaction between the development of the &quot;forces of production&quot; and the succession of &quot;modes of production&quot;. This has been the neo-Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx&#x27;s social theory such as E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists such as Antonio Gramsci who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory. Marx&#x27;s ideas had a profound influence on subsequent artists and art history, with avant-garde movements across literature, visual art, music, film, and theatre.

Politically, Marx&#x27;s legacy is more complex. Throughout the 20th century, revolutions in dozens of countries labelled themselves &quot;Marxist&quot;most notably the Russian Revolution, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Major world leaders including Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Salvador Allende, Josip Broz Tito, Kwame Nkrumah, Jawaharlal Nehru, Nelson Mandela, Xi Jinping and Thomas Sankara have all cited Marx as an influence. Beyond where Marxist revolutions took place, Marx&#x27;s ideas have informed political parties worldwide. 

In countries associated with Marxism, some events have led political opponents to blame Marx for millions of deaths, while others argue for a distinction between the legacy and influence of Marx specifically, and the legacy and influence of those who have shaped his ideas for political purposes. Arthur Lipow describes Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels as &quot;the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism.&quot;

The cities of Marks, Russia and Karl-Marx-Stadt, Germany, now known as Chemnitz, were named after Marx. In May 2018, to mark the bicentenary of his birth, a 4.5m statue of him by leading Chinese sculptor Wu Weishan and donated by the Chinese government was unveiled in his birthplace of Trier, Germany. The then-European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker defended Marx&#x27;s memory, saying that today Marx &quot;stands for things which he is not responsible for and which he didn&#x27;t cause because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite&quot;.

In 2017, a feature film, titled &quot;The Young Karl Marx&quot;, featuring Marx, his wife Jenny Marx, and Engels, among other revolutionaries and intellectuals prior to the Revolutions of 1848, received good reviews for both its historical accuracy and its brio in dealing with intellectual life.

<text>Keno is a lottery-like gambling game often played at modern casinos, and also offered as a game in some lotteries.

Players wager by choosing numbers ranging from 1 through (usually) 80. After all players make their wagers, 20 numbers (some variants draw fewer numbers) are drawn at random, either with a ball machine similar to ones used for lotteries and bingo, or with a random number generator.

Each casino sets its own series of payouts, called &quot;paytables&quot;. The player is paid based on how many numbers were chosen (either player selection, or the terminal picking the numbers), the number of matches out of those chosen, and the wager.

There are a wide variety of keno paytables depending on the casino, usually with a larger &quot;house edge&quot; than other games, ranging from less than 4 percent to over 35 percent in online play, and 20-40% in in-person casinos. By way of comparison, the typical house edge for non-slot casino games is under 5%.

==History==

The word &quot;keno&quot; has French or Latin roots (Fr. &quot;quine&quot; &quot;five winning numbers&quot;, L. &quot;quini&quot; &quot;five each&quot;), but by all accounts the game originated in China. Legend has it that Zhang Liang invented the game during the Chu-Han Contention to raise money to defend an ancient city, and its widespread popularity later helped raise funds to build the Great Wall of China. In modern China, the idea of using lotteries to fund a public institution was not accepted before the late 19th century.

Chinese lottery is not documented before 1847, when the Portuguese government of Macao decided to grant a licence to lottery operators. According to some, results of keno games in great cities were sent to outlying villages and hamlets by carrier pigeons, resulting in its Chinese name 白鸽票 &quot;báigē piào&quot;, with the literal reading &quot;white dove tickets&quot; in Mandarin, but in Southern varieties of Chinese spoken in Guangdong simply meaning &quot;pigeon tickets&quot;, and pronounced &quot;baak6-gaap3-piu3&quot; in Cantonese (on which the Western spelling &#x27;pak-ah-pu&#x27; / &#x27;pakapoo&#x27; was based).
The Chinese played the game using sheets printed with Chinese characters, often the first 80 characters of the &quot;Thousand Character Classic&quot;, from which the winning characters were selected. Eventually, Chinese immigrants introduced keno to the West when they sailed across the Pacific Ocean to work on construction of the First transcontinental railroad in the 19th century, where the name was Westernized into &quot;boc hop bu&quot; and &quot;puck-apu&quot;. There were also other, earlier games called Keno, but these were played in the same way as the game now known as &quot;Bingo&quot;, not the modern game of Keno.

==Probabilities==
Keno payouts are based on how many numbers the player chooses and how many of those numbers are &quot;hit&quot;, multiplied by the proportion of the player&#x27;s original wager to the &quot;base rate&quot; of the paytable. Typically, the more numbers a player chooses and the more numbers hit, the greater the payout, although some paytables pay for hitting a lesser number of spots. For example, it is not uncommon to see casinos paying $500 or even $1,000 for a “catch” of 0 out of 20 on a 20 spot ticket with a $5.00 wager. Payouts vary widely by casino. Most casinos allow paytable wagers of 1 through 20 numbers, but some limit the choice to only 1 through 10, 12 and 15 numbers, or &quot;spots&quot; as keno aficionados call the numbers selected.

The probability of a player hitting all 20 numbers on a 20 spot ticket is approximately 1 in 3.5 quintillion (1 in 3,535,316,142,212,174,320).

Even though it is highly improbable to hit all 20 numbers on a 20 spot ticket, the same player would typically also get paid for hitting “catches” 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7 through 19 out of 20, often with the 17 through 19 catches paying the same as the solid 20 hit. Some of the other paying &quot;catches&quot; on a 20 spot ticket or any other ticket with high &quot;solid catch&quot; odds are in reality very possible to hit:

Probabilities change significantly based on the number of spots and numbers that are picked on each ticket.

=== Probability calculation ===

Keno probabilities come from a hypergeometric distribution.

For Keno, one calculates the probability of hitting exactly formula_1 spots on an formula_2-spot ticket by the formula:
:P(hitting formula_1 spots) formula_4 for an formula_2-spot ticket. 

To calculate the probability of hitting 4 spots on a 6-spot ticket, the formula is:
:formula_6
where formula_7 is calculated as formula_8, where X! is notation for X factorial. Spreadsheets have the function to calculate 
formula_7.

To calculate &quot;odds-to-1&quot;, divide the probability into 1.0 and subtract 1 from the result.

<text>Kenyanthropus is a genus of extinct hominin identified from the Lomekwi site by Lake Turkana, Kenya, dated to 3.3 to 3.2 million years ago during the Middle Pliocene. It contains one species, K. platyops, but may also include the 2 million year old &quot;Homo rudolfensis&quot;, or K. rudolfensis. Before its naming in 2001, &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; was widely regarded as the only australopithecine to exist during the Middle Pliocene, but &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; evinces a greater diversity than once acknowledged. &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; is most recognisable by an unusually flat face and small teeth for such an early hominin, with values on the extremes or beyond the range of variation for australopithecines in regard to these features. Multiple australopithecine species may have coexisted by foraging for different food items (niche partitioning), which may be reason why these apes anatomically differ in features related to chewing.

The Lomekwi site also yielded the earliest stone tool industry, the Lomekwian, characterised by the rudimentary production of simple flakes by pounding a core against an anvil or with a hammerstone. It may have been manufactured by &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot;, but it is unclear if multiple species were present at the site or not. The knappers were using volcanic rocks collected no more than from the site. &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; seems to have lived on a lakeside or floodplain environment featuring forests and grasslands. 

==Taxonomy==
===Discovery===

In August 1998, field technician Blasto Onyango discovered a hominin partial left maxilla (upper jaw), specimen KNM-WT 38350, on the Kenyan Lomekwi dig site by Lake Turkana, overseen by prominent paleoanthropologists Louise and Meave Leakey. In August 1999 at the Lomekwi site, research assistant Justus Erus discovered an uncharacteristically flat-faced australopithecine skull, specimen KNM-WT 40000. The 1998–1999 field season subsequently uncovered 34 more craniodental hominin specimens, but the research team was unable to determine if these can be placed into the same species as the former two specimens (that is, if multiple species were present at the site).

===Age===
The specimens were recovered near the Nabetili tributary of the Lomekwi river in a mudstone layer of the Nachukui Formation. KNM-WT 40000 was recovered from the Kataboi Member, below the 3.4 million year old Tulu Bor Tuff, and above the 3.57 million year old Lokochot Tuff. By linear interpolation, KNM-WT 40000 is approximately 3.5 million years old, dating back to the Middle Pliocene. Only three more specimens were recovered from the Kataboi Member at around the same level, the deepest KNM-WT 38341 probably sitting on 3.53 million year old sediments. KNM-WT 38350 was recovered from the Lomekwi Member above Tulu Bor, and is approximately 3.3 million years old. The other specimens from this member sit above Tulu Bor, roughly 3.3 million years old as well. The highest specimens—KNM-WT 38344, -55, and -56—may be around 3.2 million years old.

===Classification===
In 2001, Meave Leakey and colleagues assigned the Lomekwi remains to a new genus and species, &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot;, with KNM-WT 40000 the holotype, and KNM-WT 38350 a paratype. The genus name honours Kenya where Lomekwi and a slew of other major human-ancestor sites have been identified. The species name derives from Ancient Greek &quot;platus&quot; &quot;flat&quot; and &quot;opsis&quot; &quot;face&quot; in reference to the unusually flat face for such an early hominin.

The classification of early hominins with their widely varying anatomy has been a difficult subject matter. The 20th century generated an overabundance of hominin genera plunging the field into taxonomic turmoil, until German evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, surveying a &quot;bewildering diversity of names&quot;, decided to recognise only a single genus, &quot;Homo&quot;, containing a few species. Though other genera and species have since become popular, his more conservative view of hominin diversity has become the mainstay, and the acceptance of further genera is usually met with great resistance. Since Mayr, hominins are classified into &quot;Australopithecus&quot; which gave rise to &quot;Homo&quot; (which includes modern humans) and the robust &quot;Paranthropus&quot; (which is sometimes not recognised as its own genus), which by definition leaves &quot;Australopithecus&quot; polyphyletic (a non-natural group which does not comprise a common ancestor and all of its descendants). In addition to &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot;, the 1990s saw the introduction of &quot;A. bahrelghazali&quot;, &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;, &quot;Orrorin&quot;, and &quot;Sahelanthropus&quot;, which has complicated discussions of hominin diversity, though the latter three have not been met with much resistance on account of their greater age (all predating &quot;Australopithecus&quot;).

At the time &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; was discovered, &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; was the only recognised australopithecine to have existed between 4 and 3 million years ago, aside from its probable ancestor &quot;A. anamensis&quot;, making &quot;A. afarensis&quot; the likely progenitor of all other australopithecines as they diversified in the late Pliocene and into the Pleistocene. Leakey and colleagues considered &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; to be evidence of a greater diversity of Pliocene australopithecines than previously acknowledged. In 2015, Ethiopian palaeoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie and colleagues erected a new species, &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot;, which lived in the same time and region as &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; and &quot;A. afarensis&quot;.
Meave Leakey and colleagues drew attention to namely the flat face and small cheek teeth, in addition to several other traits, to distinguish the genus from earlier &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;, contemporary and later &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, and later &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; lacks any of the derived traits seen in &quot;Homo&quot;. They conceded &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; could be subsumed into &quot;Australopithecus&quot; if the widest definition of the latter is used, but this conservative approach to hominin diversity leaves &quot;Australopithecus&quot; a grade taxon, a non-natural grouping of similar-looking species whereby it effectively encompasses all hominins not classifiable into &quot;Ardipithecus&quot; or &quot;Homo&quot; regardless of how they may be related to each other. Leakey and colleagues further drew parallels with KNM-WT 40000 and the 2 million year old KNM-ER 1470 assigned to &quot;Homo rudolfensis&quot;, attributing differences in braincase and nasal anatomy to archaicness. They suggested &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; may be better classified as &quot;K. rudolfensis&quot;.

In 2003, American palaeoanthropologist Tim D. White was concerned that KNM-WT 40000 was far too distorted to obtain any accurate metrics for classification purposes, especially because the skull was splintered into over 1,100 pieces often measuring less than across. Because such damage is rarely even seen, he argues that it cannot be reliably reconstructed. Because the skulls of modern ape species vary widely, he suggested further fossil discoveries in the region may prove the Lomekwi hominins to be a local variant of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; rather than a distinct genus or species. In response, anthropologist Fred Spoor and Meave and Louise Leakey produced much more detailed digital topographical scans of the KNM-WT 40000 maxilla in 2010, permitting the comparison of many more anatomical landmarks on the maxillae of all other early hominins, modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, in order to more accurately correct the distortion. The new reconstruction more convincingly verifies the distinctness of &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot;.

In 2003, Spanish writer Camilo José Cela Conde and evolutionary biologist Francisco J. Ayala proposed resurrecting the genus &quot;&quot;Praeanthropus&quot; to house all australopithecines which are not &quot;Ardipithecus&quot;, &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, or &quot;A. africanus&quot;, though they opted to synonymise &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; with &quot;Homo&quot; as &quot;H. platyops&quot;&quot;. Their recommendations have been largely rejected.

== Anatomy ==

KNM-WT 40000 has been heavily distorted during the fossilisation process, the braincase shifted downwards and backwards, the nasal region to the right, and the mouth and cheek region forward. It is unclear if the specimen represents a male or a female.

&quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; has a relatively flat face, including subnasally, between the nose and the mouth (the nasoalveolar clivus). The clivus inclines at 45° (there is relaxed sub-nasal prognathism), steeper than almost all other australopithecine specimens (on the upper end of variation for &quot;Paranthropus&quot;), more comparable to &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot;. This is the earliest example of a flat face in the hominin fossil record. Unlike &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; lacks the anterior pillars, bony columns running down from the nasal aperture (nose hole). It is also one of the longest early hominin clivi discovered at . The nasal aperture (nose hole) is narrow compared to that of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. The cheekbones are tall and steep, and the anterior surface (where the cheeks juts out the most) is positioned above the premolars, more frequently seen in &quot;Paranthropus&quot; than other hominins. The zygomaticoalveolar crest (stretching between the cheek and the teeth) is low and curved. Overall, the face resembles &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, though has longer nasal bones, a narrower nasal aperture, a shorter postcanine (the molars and premolars) tooth row, and a less steeply inclined (less flat, more prognathic) midfacial region. Much later &quot;Paranthropus&quot; are also characterised by relatively flat faces, but this is generally considered to be an adaptation to maximise bite force through enormous teeth, which &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; enigmatically does not have.

Among all the specimens, only the M2 (2nd upper left molar) and the tooth sockets of the left side of the mouth of KNM-WT 40000 are preserved well enough to measure and study. With dimensions of , a surface area of , it is the smallest M2 ever discovered for an early hominin. For comparison, those of &quot;A. afarensis&quot; in the comparative sample Leakey and colleagues used ranged from about , &quot;H. habilis&quot; and &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot; , and the robust &quot;P. boisei&quot; (with the largest molars among hominins) about . The reconstructed dimensions of KNM-WT 38350&#x27;s M1 are for a surface area of , which is on the lower end of variation for &quot;A. anamensis&quot;, &quot;A. afarensis&quot; and &quot;H. habilis&quot;. The thick molar enamel is on par with that of &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and &quot;A. afarensis&quot;. KNM-WT40000 retains the ancestral ape premolar tooth root morphology, with a single lingual root (on the tongue side) and two buccal roots (towards the cheeks), though the P4 of KNM-WT 38350 may only have a single buccal root; the ancestral pattern is frequent in &quot;Paranthropus&quot; and variable in &quot;Australopithecus&quot;. Individuals of more derived species typically have single-rooted premolars. The canine jugum is not visible (a line of bone in the maxilla corresponding to the canine tooth root), which may mean the canines were not that large. The cross-sectional area of the I2 (2nd upper incisor) is 90% the size of that of I1, whereas it is usually 50 to 70% in other great apes. The tooth roots of the incisors do not appear to be orientated out (there was probably no alveolar prognathism, the front teeth did not jut forward).

Brain volume is uncalculable due to distortion of the braincase, but it was probably similar to that of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Paranthropus&quot;. A sample of five &quot;A. afarensis&quot; averaged 445 cc. Like &quot;Paranthropus&quot;, there is no frontal trigon (a triangle formed by the conjunction of the temporal lines behind the brow ridge). Unlike &quot;H. habilis&quot; but like &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, there is no sulcus (trench) behind the brow ridge. The degree of postorbital constriction, the narrowing of the braincase in the frontal lobe region, is on par with that of &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, &quot;H. rudolfensis&quot;, and &quot;H. habilis&quot;, but less than &quot;P. boisei&quot;. Like the earlier &quot;A. anamensis&quot; and &quot;Ar. ramidus&quot;, the tympanic bone retains the ancestral hominin ear morphology, lacking the petrous crest, and bearing a narrow ear canal with a small opening. The foramen magnum, where the skull connects to the spine, was probably oval shaped as opposed to the heart-shaped one of &quot;P. boisei&quot;.

==Technology==
In 2015, French archaeologist Sonia Harmand and colleagues identified the Lomekwian stone-tool industry at the Lomekwi site. The tools are attributed to &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; as it is the only hominin identified at the site, but in 2015, anthropologist Fred Spoor suggested that at least some of the indeterminate specimens may be assignable to &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot; as the two species have somewhat similar maxillary anatomy. At 3.3 million years old, it is the oldest proposed industry. The assemblage comprises 83 cores, 35 flakes, 7 possible anvils, 7 possible hammerstones, 5 pebbles (which may have also been used as hammers), and 12 indeterminant fragments, of which 52 were sourced from basalt, 51 from phonolite, 35 from trachyphonolite (intermediate composition of phonolite and trachyte), 3 from vesicular basalt, 2 from trachyte, and 6 indeterminant. These materials could have originated at a conglomerate only from the site.

The cores are large and heavy, averaging and . Flakes ranged in length, normally shorter than later Oldowan industry flakes. Anvils were heavy, up to . Flakes seem to have been cleaved off primarily using the passive hammer technique (directly striking the core on the anvil) and/or the bipolar method (placing the core on the anvil and striking it with a hammerstone). They produced both unifaces (the flake was worked on one side) and bifaces (both sides were worked). Though they may have been shaping cores beforehand to make them easier to work, the knappers more often than not poorly executed the technique, producing incomplete fractures and fissures on several cores, or requiring multiple blows to flake off a piece. Harmand and colleagues suggested such rudimentary skills may place the Lomekwian as an intermediate industry between simple pounding techniques probably used by earlier hominins, and the flaking Oldowan industry developed by &quot;Homo&quot;.

It is typically assumed that early hominins were using stone tools to cut meat in addition to other organic materials. Wild chimpanzees and black-striped capuchins have been observed to make flakes by accident while using hammerstones to crack nuts on anvils, but the Lomekwi knappers were producing multiple flakes from the same core, and flipped over flakes to work the other side, which speak to the intentionality of their production. In 2016, Spanish archaeologists Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo and Luis Alcalá argued Harmand and colleagues did not convincingly justify that the tools were discovered &quot;in situ&quot;, that is, the tools may be much younger and were reworked into an older layer. If the date of 3.3 million years is accepted, then there is a 700,000 year gap between the next solid evidence of stone tools, at Ledi-Geraru associated with the earliest &quot;Homo&quot; LD 350-1, the Oldowan industry, reported by American palaeoanthropologist David Braun and colleagues in 2019. This gap can either be interpreted as the loss and reinvention of stone tool technology, or preservation bias (that tools from this time gap either did not preserve for whatever reason, or sit undiscovered), the latter implying the Lomekwian evolved into the Oldowan.

==Palaeoecology==

From 4.5 to 4 million years ago, Lake Turkana may have swelled to upwards of , in comparison to today&#x27;s ; the lake at what is now the Koobi Fora site possibly sat at minimum below the surface. Volcanic hills by Lomekwi pushed basalt into the lake sediments. The lake broke up and from 3.6 to 3.2 million years ago, the region was probably characterised by a series of much smaller lakes, each covering no more than . Similarly, the bovid remains at Lomekwi are suggestive of a wet mosaic environment featuring both grasslands and forests on a lakeside or floodplain. &quot;Theropithecus brumpti&quot; is the most common monkey at the site as well as the rest of the Turkana Basin at this time; this species tends to live in more forested and closed environments. At the fossiliferous &quot;A. afarensis&quot; Hadar site in Ethiopia, &quot;Theropithecus darti&quot; is the most common monkey, which tends to prefer drier conditions conducive to wood- or grassland environments. Leakey and colleagues argued this distribution means &quot;Kenyanthropus&quot; was living in somewhat more forested environments than more northerly &quot;A. afarensis&quot;.

&quot;Kenyanthropus&quot;, &quot;A. afarensis&quot;, and &quot;A. deyiremeda&quot; all coexisted in the same time and region, and, because their anatomy largely diverges in areas relevant to chewing, they may have practised niche partitioning and foraged for different food items.

<doc id="16746" wikidata="Q11419" url="?curid=16746" title="Karate">
<text>(; ; ), also , is a martial art developed in the Ryukyu Kingdom. It developed from the indigenous Ryukyuan martial arts (called , &quot;hand&quot;; &quot;tī&quot; in Okinawan) under the influence of Chinese martial arts. While modern karate is primarily a striking art that uses punches and kicks, traditional karate training also employs throwing and joint locking techniques. A karate practitioner is called a .

Beginning in the 1300s, early Chinese martial artists brought their techniques to Okinawa. Despite the Ryukyu Kingdom being turned into a puppet state by Japanese samurai in 1609, after the Invasion of Ryukyu, its cultural ties to China remained strong. Since Ryukyuans were banned from carrying swords under samurai rule, groups of young aristocrats created unarmed combat methods as a form of resistance, combining Chinese and local styles of martial arts. Training emphasized self-discipline. This blend of martial arts became known as kara-te , which translates to &quot;Chinese hand.&quot; Initially, there were no uniforms, colored belts, ranking systems, or standardized styles. Many elements essential to modern karate were actually incorporated a century ago.

The Ryukyu Kingdom had been conquered by the Japanese Satsuma Domain and had become its vassal state since 1609, but was formally annexed to the Empire of Japan in 1879 as Okinawa Prefecture. The Ryukyuan samurai (Okinawan: &quot;samurē&quot;) who had been the bearers of karate lost their privileged position, and with it, karate was in danger of losing transmission. However, karate gradually regained popularity after 1905, when it began to be taught in schools in Okinawa. During the Taishō era (1912–1926), karate was introduced to mainland Japan by Gichin Funakoshi and Motobu Chōki. The ultranationalistic sentiment of the 1930s affected every aspect of Japanese culture. To make the imported martial art more relatable, Funakoshi incorporated elements from judo, such as the training uniforms, colored belts, and ranking systems. Karate&#x27;s popularity was initially sluggish with little exposition but when a magazine reported a story about Motobu defeating a foreign boxer in Kyoto, karate rapidly became well known throughout Japan.

In this era of escalating Japanese militarism, the name was changed from (&quot;Chinese hand&quot; or &quot;Tang hand&quot;) to (&quot;empty hand&quot;) – both of which are pronounced &quot;karate&quot; in Japanese – to indicate that the Japanese wished to develop the combat form in Japanese style. After World War II, Okinawa became (1945) an important United States military site and karate became popular among servicemen stationed there. The martial arts movies of the 1960s and 1970s served to greatly increase the popularity of martial arts around the world, and English-speakers began to use the word &quot;karate&quot; in a generic way to refer to all striking-based Asian martial arts. Karate schools (&quot;dōjōs&quot;) began appearing around the world, catering to those with casual interest as well as those seeking a deeper study of the art.

Karate, like Japanese martial arts, is considered to be not only about fighting techniques, but also about spiritual cultivation. Many karate schools and &quot;dōjōs&quot; have established rules called &quot;dōjō kun&quot;, which emphasize the perfection of character, the importance of effort, and respect for courtesy. Karate featured at the 2020 Summer Olympics after its inclusion at the Games was supported by the International Olympic Committee. Web Japan (sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs) claims that karate has 50 million practitioners worldwide, while the World Karate Federation claims there are 100 million practitioners around the world.

==Etymology==
Originally in Okinawa during the Ryukyu Kingdom period, there existed an indigenous Ryukyuan martial art called &quot;te&quot; (Okinawan:&quot;tī&quot;, ). Furthermore, in the 19th century, a Chinese-derived martial art called &quot;tōde&quot; (Okinawan: &quot;tōdī&quot;, ) emerged. According to Gichin Funakoshi, a distinction between &quot;Okinawan-te&quot; and &quot;tōde&quot; existed in the late 19th century. With the emergence of &quot;tōde&quot;, it is thought that &quot;te&quot; also came to be called &quot;Okinawa-te&quot; (Okinawan:&quot;Uchinādī&quot;, ). However, this distinction gradually became blurred with the decline of &quot;Okinawa-te&quot;.

Around 1905, when &quot;karate&quot; began to be taught in public schools in Okinawa, &quot;tōde&quot; was read kun’yomi and called &quot;karate&quot; (, ) in the Japanese style. Both &quot;tōde&quot; and &quot;karate&quot; are written in the same Chinese characters meaning &quot;Tang/China hand,&quot; but the former is on&#x27;yomi (Chinese reading) and the latter is kun&#x27;yomi (Japanese reading). Since the distinction between &quot;Okinawa-te&quot; and &quot;tōde&quot; was already blurred at that time, karate was used to encompass both. &quot;Kara (から)&quot; is a kun’yomi for the character &quot;唐&quot; (tō/とう in on&#x27;yomi) which is derived from &quot;Gaya Confederacy (加羅)&quot; and later included things deriving from China (specifically from the Tang dynasty). Therefore, &quot;tōde&quot; and &quot;karate&quot; (Tang hand) differ in the scope of meaning of the words. 

Japan sent envoys to the Tang dynasty and introduced much Chinese culture. Gichin Funakoshi proposed that &quot;tōde&quot;/karate may have been used instead of &quot;te&quot;, as Tang became a synonym for luxury imported goods.

According to Gichin Funakoshi, the word pronounced existed in the Ryukyu Kingdom period, but it is unclear whether it meant or .

The Chinese origins of karate were increasingly viewed with suspicion due to rising tensions between China and Japan and as well as the looming threat of a full-scale war between the two countries. In 1933, the Japanese character for karate was altered to a homophone— a word pronounced identically but with a different meaning. Thus, &quot;Chinese hand&quot; was replaced with &quot;empty hand.&quot;

But this name change did not immediately spread among Okinawan karate practitioners. There were many karate practitioners, such as Chōjun Miyagi, who still used &quot;te&quot; in everyday conversation until World War II.

When karate was first taught in mainland Japan in the 1920s, Gichin Funakoshi and Motobu Chōki used the name &quot;karate-jutsu&quot; (, ) along with karate. The word &quot;jutsu&quot; () means art or technique, and in those days it was often used as a suffix to the name of each martial art, as in &quot;jujutsu&quot; and &quot;kenjutsu&quot; (swordsmanship).

The first documented use of a homophone of the logogram pronounced &quot;kara&quot; by replacing the Chinese character meaning &quot;Tang dynasty&quot; with the character meaning &quot;empty&quot; took place in &quot;Karate Kumite&quot; () written in August 1905 by Chōmo Hanashiro (1869–1945). In mainland Japan, karate (, empty hand) gradually began to be used from the writings of Gichin Funakoshi and Motobu Chōki in the 1920s.

In 1929 the Karate Study Group of Keio University (Instructor Gichin Funakoshi) used this term in reference to the concept of emptiness in the Heart Sutra, and this terminology was later popularized, especially in Tokyo. There is also a theory that the background for this name change was the worsening of Japan-China relations at the time.

On 25 October 1936 a roundtable meeting of karate masters was held in Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, and it was officially resolved to use the name karate (empty hand) in the sense of &quot;kūshu kūken&quot; (, ). To commemorate this day, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly passed a resolution in 2005 to decide 25 October as &quot;Karate Day.&quot;

Another nominal development is the addition of &quot;dō&quot; (; ) to the end of the word karate. &quot;Dō&quot; is a suffix having numerous meanings including road, path, route and way. It is used in many martial arts that survived Japan&#x27;s transition from feudal culture to modern times. It implies that these arts are not just fighting systems but contain spiritual elements when promoted as disciplines. In this context &quot;dō&quot; is usually translated as &quot;the way of …&quot;. Examples include aikido, judo, kyūdō and kendo. Thus karatedō is more than just empty hand techniques. It is &quot;the way of the empty hand&quot;.

Since the 1980s the term karate () has been written in katakana instead of Chinese characters, mainly by Kyokushin Karate (founder: Masutatsu Oyama). In Japan, katakana is mainly used for foreign words, giving Kyokushin Karate a modern and new impression.

==History==
=== Origin ===
There are several theories regarding the origins of karate, but the main ones are as follows.

==== Theory of development from &quot;mēkata&quot; ====
In Okinawa there was an ancient martial dance called &quot;mēkata&quot; (). The dancers danced to the accompaniment of songs and &quot;sanshin&quot; music, similar to karate kata. In the Okinawan countryside, &quot;mēkata&quot; remained until the early 20th century. There is a theory that from this &quot;mēkata&quot; with martial elements, &quot;te&quot; (Okinawan:&quot;tī&quot;, hand) was born and developed into karate. This theory is advocated by Ankō Asato and his student Gichin Funakoshi.

==== Theory of introduction by thirty-six families from Min ====
It is said that in 1392 a group of professional people known as the &quot;Thirty-six families from Min&quot; migrated to Kume Village (now Kume, Naha City) in Naha from Fujian Province in the Ming Dynasty at that time. They brought with them advanced learning and skills to Ryukyu, and there is a theory that Chinese kenpō, the origin of karate, was also brought to Ryukyu at this time.

There is also the &quot;Keichō import theory,&quot; which states that karate was brought to Ryukyu after the invasion of Ryukyu by the Satsuma Domain (Keichō 14, 1609), as well as the theory that it was introduced by Kōshōkun (Okinawan: Kūsankū) based on the description in &quot;Ōshima Writing&quot;.

==== Other theories ====
There are also other theories, such as that it developed from Okinawan sumo (&quot;shima&quot;) or that it originated from jujutsu, which had been introduced from Japan.

===Okinawa===
==== 15th–17th centuries ====

The reason for the development of unarmed combat techniques in Ryukyu has conventionally been attributed to a policy of banning weapons, which is said to have been implemented on two occasions. The first was during the reign of King Shō Shin (1476–1526; r. 1477–1527), when weapons were collected from all over the country and strictly controlled by the royal government. The second time was after the invasion of Ryukyu by the Satsuma Domain in 1609. Through the two policies, the popular belief that Ryukyuan samurai, who were deprived of their weapons, developed karate to compete with Satsuma&#x27;s samurai has traditionally been referred to as if it were a historical fact.

But in recent years many researchers have questioned the causal relationship between the policy of banning weapons and the development of karate. For example, as the basis for King Shō Shin&#x27;s policy of banning weapons, an inscription on the parapet of the main hall of Shuri Castle (, 1509), which states that &quot;swords, bows and arrows are to be piled up exclusively as weapons of national defense,&quot; has been conventionally interpreted as meaning &quot;weapons were collected and sealed in a warehouse.&quot; However, in recent years, researchers of Okinawan studies have pointed out that the correct interpretation is that &quot;swords, bows and arrows were collected and used as weapons of the state.&quot;

It is also known that the policy of banning weapons (a 1613 notice to the Ryukyu royal government), which is said to have been implemented by the Satsuma Domain, only prohibited the carrying of swords and other weapons, but not their possession, and was a relatively lax regulation. This notice stated, &quot;(1) The possession of guns is prohibited. (2) The possession of weapons owned privately by princes, three magistrates, and samurai is permitted. (3) Weapons must be repaired in Satsuma through the magistrate&#x27;s office of Satsuma. (4) Swords must be reported to the magistrate&#x27;s office of Satsuma for approval.&quot; It did not prohibit the possession of weapons (except guns) or even their practice. In fact, even after subjugation to the Satsuma Domain, a number of Ryukyuan masters of swordsmanship, spearmanship, archery, and other arts are known. Therefore, some researchers criticize the theory that karate developed due to the policy of banning weapons as &quot;a rumor on the street with no basis at all.&quot;

Karate began as a common fighting system known as &quot;te&quot; (Okinawan: &quot;tī&quot;) among the Ryukyuan samurai class. There were few formal styles of &quot;te,&quot; but rather many practitioners with their own methods. One surviving example is Motobu Udundī (), which has been handed down to this day in the Motobu family, one of the branches of the former Ryukyu royal family. In the 16th century, the Ryukyuan history book &quot;Kyūyō&quot; (, established around 1745) mentions that , a favored retainer of King Shō Shin, used a martial art called &quot;karate&quot; (, ) to smash both legs of an assassin. This karate is thought to refer to &quot;te&quot;, not today&#x27;s karate, and Ankō Asato introduces Kyō Ahagon as a &quot;prominent martial artist.&quot;

==== 18th century ====
However, some believe that Kyō Ahagon&#x27;s anecdote is a half-legend and that it is unclear whether he was actually a &quot;te&quot; master. In the 18th century, the names of Nishinda &quot;Uēkata&quot;, Gushikawa &quot;Uēkata&quot;, and Chōken Makabe are known as masters of &quot;te&quot;.

Nishinda &quot;Uēkata&quot; and Gushikawa &quot;Uēkata&quot; were martial artists active during the reign of King Shō Kei (reigned 1713–1751). Nishinda &quot;Uēkata&quot; was good at spear as well as &quot;te&quot;, and Gushikawa &quot;Uēkata&quot; was also good at wooden sword (swordsmanship).

Chōken Makabe was a man of the late 18th century. His light stature and jumping ability gave him the nickname &quot;Makabe &quot;Chān-gwā&quot;&quot; (), as he was like a &quot;chān&quot; (fighting cock). The ceiling of his house is said to have been marked by his kicking foot.

It is known that in &quot;Ōshima Writing&quot; (1762), written by Yoshihiro Tobe, a Confucian scholar of the Tosa Domain, who interviewed Ryukyuan samurai who had drifted to Tosa (present-day Kōchi Prefecture), there is a description of a martial art called &quot;kumiai-jutsu&quot; () performed by Kōshōkun (Okinawan:Kūsankū). It is believed that Kōshōkun may have been a military officer on a mission from Qing that visited Ryukyu in 1756, and some believe that karate originated with Kōshōkun.

In addition, the will (Part I: 1778, Part II: 1783) of Ryukyuan samurai Aka Pēchin Chokushki (1721–1784) mentions the name of a martial art called &quot;karamutō&quot; (), along with Japanese Jigen-ryū swordsmanship and jujutsu, indicating that Ryukyuan samurai practiced these arts in the 18th century.

In 1609, the Japanese Satsuma Domain invaded Ryukyu and Ryukyu became its vassal state, but it continued to pay tribute to the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China. At the time, China had implemented a policy of sea ban and only traded with tributary countries, so the Satsuma Domain wanted Ryukyu to continue its tribute to benefit from it.

The envoys of the tribute mission were chosen from among the samurai class of Ryukyu, and they went to Fuzhou in Fujian and stayed there for six months to a year and a half. Government-funded and privately funded foreign students were also sent to study in Beijing or Fuzhou for several years. Some of these envoys and students studied Chinese martial arts in China. The styles of Chinese martial arts they studied are not known for certain, but it is assumed that they studied Fujian White Crane and other styles from Fujian Province.

Sōryo Tsūshin (monk Tsūshin), active during the reign of King Shō Kei, was a monk who went to the Qing Dynasty to study Chinese martial arts and was reportedly one of the best martial artists of his time in Ryukyu.

==== 19th and early 20th century ====
It is not known when the name &quot;tōde&quot; (, ) first came into use in the Ryukyu Kingdom, but according to Ankō Asato, it was popularized from Kanga Sakugawa (1786–1867), who was nicknamed &quot;Tōde Sakugawa.&quot; Sakugawa was a samurai from Shuri who traveled to Qing China to learn Chinese martial arts. The martial arts he mastered were new and different from te. As &quot;tōde&quot; was spread by Sakugawa, traditional &quot;te&quot; became distinguished as &quot;Okinawa-te&quot; (, ), and gradually faded away as it merged with &quot;tōde&quot;.

It is generally believed that today&#x27;s karate is a result of the synthesis of &quot;te&quot; (&quot;Okinawa-te&quot;) and &quot;tōde&quot;. Funakoshi writes, &quot;In the early modern era, when China was highly revered, many martial artists traveled to China to practice Chinese kenpo, and added it to the ancient kenpo, the so-called &#x27;Okinawa-te&#x27;. After further study, they discarded the disadvantages of both, adopted their advantages, and added more subtlety, and karate was born.&quot;

Early styles of karate are often generalized as Shuri-te, Naha-te, and Tomari-te, named after the three cities from which they emerged. Each area and its teachers had particular kata, techniques, and principles that distinguished their local version of &quot;te&quot; from the others.
Around the 1820s, Matsumura Sōkon (1809–1899) began teaching &quot;Okinawa-te&quot;. Matsumura was, according to one theory, a student of Sakugawa. Matsumura&#x27;s style later became the origin of many Shuri-te schools.

Itosu Ankō (1831–1915) studied under Matsumura and Bushi Nagahama of Naha-te. He created the &quot;Pin&#x27;an&quot; forms (&quot;Heian&quot; in Japanese) which are simplified kata for beginning students. In 1905, Itosu helped to get karate introduced into Okinawa&#x27;s public schools. These forms were taught to children at the elementary school level. Itosu&#x27;s influence in karate is broad. The forms he created are common across nearly all styles of karate. His students became some of the most well-known karate masters, including Motobu Chōyū, Motobu Chōki, Yabu Kentsū, Hanashiro Chōmo, Gichin Funakoshi and Kenwa Mabuni. Itosu is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Grandfather of Modern Karate.&quot;
In 1881, Higaonna Kanryō returned from China after years of instruction with Ryu Ryu Ko and founded what would become Naha-te. One of his students was the founder of Gojū-ryū, Chōjun Miyagi. Chōjun Miyagi taught such well-known karateka as Seko Higa (who also trained with Higaonna), Meitoku Yagi, Miyazato Ei&#x27;ichi, and Seikichi Toguchi, and for a very brief time near the end of his life, An&#x27;ichi Miyagi (a teacher claimed by Morio Higaonna).

In addition to the three early &quot;te&quot; styles of karate a fourth Okinawan influence is that of Uechi Kanbun (1877–1948). At the age of 20 he went to Fuzhou in Fujian Province, China, to escape Japanese military conscription. While there he studied under Shū Shiwa (Chinese: &quot;Zhou Zihe&quot; 周子和 1874–1926). He was a leading figure of Chinese Nanpa Shorin-ken style at that time. He later developed his own style of Uechi-ryū karate based on the Sanchin, Seisan, and Sanseiryu kata that he had studied in China.

=== Japan ===
When Shō Tai, the last king of the Ryūkyū Kingdom, was ordered to move to Tokyo in 1879, he was accompanied by prominent karate masters such as Ankō Asato and Chōfu Kyan (father of Chōtoku Kyan). It is unknown if they taught karate to the Japanese in Tokyo, although there are records that Kyan taught his son karate.

In 1908, students from the Okinawa Prefectural Middle School gave a karate demonstration at Butokuden in Kyoto, which was also witnessed by Kanō Jigorō (founder of judo).

In May 1922, Gichin Funakoshi (founder of Shotokan) presented pictures of karate on two hanging scrolls at the first Physical Education Exhibition in Tokyo. The following June, Funakoshi was invited to the Kodokan to give a karate demonstration in front of Jigoro Kano and other judo experts. This was the beginning of the full-scale introduction of karate in Tokyo.
In November 1922, Motobu Chōki (founder of Motobu-ryū) participated in a judo versus boxing match in Kyoto, defeating a foreign boxer. The match was featured in Japan&#x27;s largest magazine &quot;,&quot; which had a circulation of about one million at the time, and karate and Motobu&#x27;s name became instantly known throughout Japan.

In 1922, Funakoshi published the first book on karate, and in 1926 Motobu published the first technical book on kumite. As karate&#x27;s popularity grew, karate clubs were established one after another in Japanese universities with Funakoshi and Motobu as instructors.

In the Showa era (1926–1989), other Okinawan karate masters also came to mainland Japan to teach karate. These included Kenwa Mabuni, Chōjun Miyagi, Kanken Tōyama, and Kanbun Uechi.

With the rise of militarism in Japan, some karate masters gradually came to consider the name karate (, ) undesirable. The name karate (, ) had already been used by Chōmo Hanashiro in Okinawa in 1905, and Funakoshi decided to use this name as well. In addition, the name &quot;karatedō&quot; (, ), which was already used by the karate club of Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) in 1929 by adding the suffix &quot;dō&quot; (, way) to karate, was also used by Funakoshi, who decided to use the name &quot;karatedō&quot; (, ) in the same way.

The &quot;dō&quot; suffix implies that &quot;karatedō&quot; is a path to self-knowledge, not just a study of the technical aspects of fighting. Like most martial arts practised in Japan, karate made its transition from -&quot;jutsu&quot; to -&quot;dō&quot; around the beginning of the 20th century. The &quot;dō&quot; in &quot;karate-dō&quot; sets it apart from karate-&quot;jutsu&quot;, as aikido is distinguished from aikijutsu, judo from jujutsu, kendo from kenjutsu and iaido from iaijutsu.

In 1933, karate was officially recognized as a Japanese martial art by the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, but initially belonged to the jujutsu division and title examinations were conducted by jujutsu masters.

In 1935, Funakoshi changed the names of many kata and karate itself. Funakoshi&#x27;s motivation was that the names of many of the traditional kata were unintelligible, and that it would be inappropriate to use the Chinese style names to teach karate as a Japanese martial art. He also said that the kata had to be simplified to spread karate as a form of physical education, so some of the kata were modified. He always referred to what he taught as simply karate, but in 1936 he built a dōjō in Tokyo and the style he left behind is usually called Shotokan after this dōjō. &quot;Shoto&quot;, meaning &quot;pine wave&quot;, was Funakoshi&#x27;s pen name and &quot;kan&quot; meaning &quot;hall&quot;.
On 25 October 1936, a roundtable meeting of karate masters was held in Naha, Okinawa Prefecture, where it was officially decided to change the name of karate from karate (Tang hand) to karate (empty hand). In attendance were Chōmo Hanashiro, Chōki Motobu, Chōtoku Kyan, Jūhatsu Kyoda, Chōjun Miyagi, Shinpan Gusukuma, and Chōshin Chibana. In 2005, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly passed a resolution to commemorate this decision by designating 25 October as &quot;Karate Day.&quot;

The modernization and systemization of karate in Japan also included the adoption of the white uniform that consisted of the &quot;dogi&quot; or &quot;keikogi&quot;—mostly called just karategi—and coloured belt ranks. Both of these innovations were originated and popularized by Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo and one of the men Funakoshi consulted in his efforts to modernize karate.

At that time, there was almost no kumite training in karate, and kata training was the main focus. There were also no matches. However, at that time, judo and kendo matches were already being held in mainland Japan, and practice was also being actively practiced, the young people in mainland Japan gradually became dissatisfied with kata-only practice.

In pre–World War II Okinawa, karateka practiced &quot;iri kumi&quot; (Okinawan for kumite) allowing all kinds of techniques (strikes, choke holds, joint locks, etc.) but in a controlled manner to not injure the opponent when aiming to vital areas. Despite sparring was originally an unnoticed form of practice for senior students, there were no &quot;contests&quot; until Western-style competitions were introduced to Japan.

Gichin Funakoshi stated, &quot;There are no contests in karate.&quot; Shigeru Egami relates that, during his visit to Okinawa in 1940, he heard some karateka were ousted from their &quot;dōjō&quot; because they adopted sparring after having learned it in Tokyo. In the early 1930s, pre-arranged sparring was introduced and developed, and finally a few years later free sparring was permitted for Shotokan students.

According to Yasuhiro Konishi, kata-only training was often criticized by the leading judo practitioners of the time, such as Shuichi Nagaoka and Hajime Isogai, who said, &quot;The karate you do cannot be understood from kata alone, so why don&#x27;t you try a little more so that the general public can understand it?&quot; Against the backdrop of these complaints and criticisms, young people such as Hironori Ōtsuka and Konishi devised their own kumite and kumite matches, which are the prototypes of today&#x27;s kumite. Motobu&#x27;s emphasis on kumite attracted Ōtsuka and Konishi, who later studied Okinawan kumite under him.

After World War II, karate activities were temporarily stalled due to the &quot;Notice Banning Judo, Kendo, and Other Martial Arts&quot; issued by the Ministry of Education under the directive of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. However, because this notice did not include the word &quot;karate,&quot; it was interpreted by the Ministry of Education that karate was not prohibited, and karate was able to resume its activities earlier than other martial arts.

A new form of karate called Kyokushin was formally founded in 1957 by Masutatsu Oyama (who was born a Korean, Choi Yeong-Eui 최영의). Kyokushin is largely a synthesis of Shotokan and Gōjū-ryū. It teaches a curriculum that emphasizes aliveness, physical toughness, and full contact sparring. Because of its emphasis on physical, full-force sparring, Kyokushin is now often called &quot;full contact karate&quot;, or &quot;Knockdown karate&quot; (after the name for its competition rules). Many other karate organizations and styles are descended from the Kyokushin curriculum.

==Practice==

Karate can be practiced as an art (budō), self defense or as a combat sport. Traditional karate places emphasis on self-development (budō). Modern Japanese style training emphasizes the psychological elements incorporated into a proper &quot;kokoro&quot; (attitude) such as perseverance, fearlessness, virtue, and leadership skills. Sport karate places emphasis on exercise and competition. Weapons are an important training activity in some styles of karate.

Karate training is commonly divided into &quot;kihon&quot; (basics or fundamentals), &quot;kata&quot; (forms), and &quot;kumite&quot; (sparring).

===Kihon===

Kihon means basics and these form the base for everything else in the style including stances, strikes, punches, kicks and blocks. Karate styles place varying importance on kihon. Typically this is training in unison of a technique or a combination of techniques by a group of karateka. Kihon may also be prearranged drills in smaller groups or in pairs.

===Kata===

Kata (:かた) means literally &quot;shape&quot; or &quot;model.&quot; Kata is a formalized sequence of movements which represent various offensive and defensive postures. These postures are based on idealized combat applications. The applications when applied in a demonstration with real opponents is referred to as a Bunkai. The Bunkai shows how every stance and movement is used. Bunkai is a useful tool to understand a kata.

To attain a formal rank the karateka must demonstrate competent performance of specific required kata for that level. The Japanese terminology for grades or ranks is commonly used. Requirements for examinations vary among schools.

===Kumite===
Sparring in Karate is called kumite (組手:くみて). It literally means &quot;meeting of hands.&quot; Kumite is practiced both as a sport and as self-defense training.
Levels of physical contact during sparring vary considerably. Full contact karate has several variants. Knockdown karate (such as Kyokushin) uses full power techniques to bring an opponent to the ground. Sparring in armour, &quot;bogu kumite&quot;, allows full power techniques with some safety. Sport kumite in many international competition under the World Karate Federation is free or structured with light contact or semi contact and points are awarded by a referee.

In structured kumite (&quot;yakusoku&quot;, prearranged), two participants perform a choreographed series of techniques with one striking while the other blocks. The form ends with one devastating technique (&quot;hito tsuki&quot;).

In free sparring (Jiyu Kumite), the two participants have a free choice of scoring techniques. The allowed techniques and contact level are primarily determined by sport or style organization policy, but might be modified according to the age, rank and sex of the participants. Depending upon style, take-downs, sweeps and in some rare cases even time-limited grappling on the ground are also allowed.

Free sparring is performed in a marked or closed area. The bout runs for a fixed time (2 to 3 minutes.) The time can run continuously (&quot;iri kume&quot;) or be stopped for referee judgment. In light contact or semi contact kumite, points are awarded based on the criteria: good form, sporting attitude, vigorous application, awareness/&quot;zanshin&quot;, good timing and correct distance.
In full contact karate kumite, points are based on the results of the impact, rather than the formal appearance of the scoring technique.

===Dōjō Kun===

In the bushidō tradition &quot;dōjō kun&quot; is a set of guidelines for karateka to follow. These guidelines apply both in the &quot;dōjō&quot; (training hall) and in everyday life.

===Conditioning===
Okinawan karate uses supplementary training known as &quot;hojo undo&quot;. This uses simple equipment made of wood and stone. The &quot;makiwara&quot; is a striking post. The &quot;nigiri game&quot; is a large jar used for developing grip strength. These supplementary exercises are designed to increase strength, stamina, speed, and muscle coordination. Sport Karate emphasizes aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise, power, agility, flexibility, and stress management. All practices vary depending upon the school and the teacher.

== Sport ==

Karate is divided into style organizations. These organizations sometimes cooperate in non-style specific sport karate organizations or federations. Examples of sport organizations include AAKF/ITKF, AOK, TKL, AKA, WKF, NWUKO, WUKF and WKC. Organizations hold competitions (tournaments) from local to international level. Tournaments are designed to match members of opposing schools or styles against one another in kata, sparring and weapons demonstration. They are often separated by age, rank and sex with potentially different rules or standards based on these factors. The tournament may be exclusively for members of a particular style (closed) or one in which any martial artist from any style may participate within the rules of the tournament (open).

The World Karate Federation (WKF) is the largest sport karate organization and is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as being responsible for karate competition in the Olympic Games. The WKF has developed common rules governing all styles. The national WKF organizations coordinate with their respective National Olympic Committees.

WKF karate competition has two disciplines: sparring (&quot;kumite&quot;) and forms (&quot;kata&quot;). Competitors may enter either as individuals or as part of a team. Evaluation for kata and kobudō is performed by a panel of judges, whereas sparring is judged by a head referee, usually with assistant referees at the side of the sparring area. Sparring matches are typically divided by weight, age, gender, and experience.

WKF only allows membership through one national organization/federation per country to which clubs may join. The World Union of Karate-do Federations (WUKF) offers different styles and federations a world body they may join, without having to compromise their style or size. The WUKF accepts more than one federation or association per country.

Sport organizations use different competition rule systems. Light contact rules are used by the WKF, WUKO, IASK and WKC. Full contact karate rules used by Kyokushinkai, Seidokaikan and other organizations. Bogu kumite (full contact with protective shielding of targets) rules are used in the World Koshiki Karate-Do Federation organization. Shinkaratedo Federation use boxing gloves. Within the United States, rules may be under the jurisdiction of state sports authorities, such as the boxing commission.

=== Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) ===
Karate, although not widely used in mixed martial arts, has been effective for some MMA practitioners. Various styles of karate are practiced in MMA: Lyoto Machida and John Makdessi practice Shotokan; Bas Rutten and Georges St-Pierre train in Kyokushin; Michelle Waterson holds a black belt in American Free Style Karate; Stephen Thompson practices American Kenpo Karate; and both Gunnar Nelson and Robert Whittaker practiced Gōjū-ryū. Additionally, John Kavanagh has been successful as coach with a Kenpo Karate pedigree.

=== Olympic Games ===

In August 2016, the International Olympic Committee approved karate as an Olympic sport beginning at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Karate also debuted at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. During this debut of Karate in the Summer Olympics, sixty competitors from around the world competed in the Kumite competition, and twenty competed in the Kata competition. In September 2015, karate was included in a shortlist along with baseball, softball, skateboarding, surfing, and sport climbing to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics; and in June 2016, the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that they would support the proposal to include all of the shortlisted sports in the 2020 Games. Finally, on 3 August 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program.

Karate was not included in the 2024 Olympic Games, although it has made the shortlist for inclusion, alongside nine others, in the 2028 Summer Olympics.

== Dan Rank system ==

In 1924, Gichin Funakoshi, founder of Shotokan Karate, adopted the Dan system from the judo founder Jigoro Kano using a rank scheme with a limited set of belt colors. Other Okinawan teachers also adopted this practice. In the Kyū/Dan system the beginner grades start with a higher numbered kyū (&quot;e.g.&quot;, 10th Kyū or Jukyū) and progress toward a lower numbered kyū. The Dan progression continues from 1st Dan (Shodan, or &#x27;beginning dan&#x27;) to the higher dan grades. Kyū-grade karateka are referred to as &quot;color belt&quot; or mudansha (&quot;ones without dan/rank&quot;). Dan-grade karateka are referred to as &quot;yudansha&quot; (holders of dan/rank). Yudansha typically wear a black belt. Normally, the first five to six dans are given by examination by superior dan holders, while the subsequent (7 and up) are honorary, given for special merits and/or age reached. Requirements of rank differ among styles, organizations, and schools. Kyū ranks stress Karate stances, Equilibrioception, and motor coordination. Speed and power are added at higher grades.

Minimum age and time in rank are factors affecting promotion. Testing consists of demonstration of techniques before a panel of examiners or senseis. This will vary by school, but testing may include everything learned at that point, or just new information. The demonstration is an application for new rank (shinsa) and may include basics, kata, bunkai, self-defense, routines, tameshiwari (breaking), and kumite (sparring).

==Philosophy==
In &quot;Karate-Do Kyohan,&quot; Funakoshi quoted from the Heart Sutra, which is prominent in Shingon Buddhism: &quot;Form is emptiness, emptiness is form itself&quot; (&quot;shiki zokuze kū kū zokuze shiki&quot;).
He interpreted the &quot;kara&quot; of Karate-dō to mean &quot;to purge oneself of selfish and evil thoughts ... for only with a clear mind and conscience can the practitioner understand the knowledge which he receives.&quot; Funakoshi believed that one should be &quot;inwardly humble and outwardly gentle.&quot; Only by behaving humbly can one be open to Karate&#x27;s many lessons. This is done by listening and being receptive to criticism. He considered courtesy of prime importance. He said that &quot;Karate is properly applied only in those rare situations in which one really must either down another or be downed by him.&quot; Funakoshi did not consider it unusual for a devotee to use Karate in a real physical confrontation no more than perhaps once in a lifetime. He stated that Karate practitioners must &quot;never be easily drawn into a fight.&quot; It is understood that one blow from a real expert could mean death. It is clear that those who misuse what they have learned bring dishonor upon themselves. He promoted the character trait of personal conviction. In &quot;time of grave public crisis, one must have the courage ... to face a million and one opponents.&quot; He taught that indecisiveness is a weakness.

==Styles==

Karate is divided into many styles, each with their different training methods, focuses, and cultures; though they mainly originate from the historical Okinawan parent styles of Naha-te, Tomari-te and Shuri-te.

However some of the schools&#x27; founders have been sceptical with the separation of karate into many styles. Gichin Funakoshi simply stated that there are as many styles as instructors in the world while Kenwa Mabuni explained that the notion of different variations of karate came from outsiders. During karate popularization in mainland Japan, it was spread the idea that karate was divided into two branches: Shōrin-ryū (derived from Itosu&#x27;s teachings) and Shōrei-ryū (derived from Higaonna&#x27;s teachings); but Chōjun Miyagi believed that was just a wrong perception. Mas Oyama was actively opposed to the idea of the break-down into several karate schools. He believed that making karate a combat sport, as well keeping it as a martial art, could be a possible approach to unify all schools.

In the modern era the major four styles of karate are considered to be Gōjū-ryū, Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, and Wadō-ryū. These four styles are those recognised by the World Karate Federation for international kata competition. Some widespread styles often accepted for kata competition include Kyokushin, Shōrin-ryū, Uechi-Ryū or Isshin-ryū among others.

==World==

===Africa===
Karate has grown in popularity in Africa, particularly in South Africa and Ghana.

===Americas===

====Canada====
Karate began in Canada in the 1930s and 1940s as Japanese people immigrated to the country. Karate was practised quietly without a large amount of organization. During the Second World War, many Japanese-Canadian families were moved to the interior of British Columbia. Masaru Shintani, at the age of 13, began to study Shorin-Ryu karate in the Japanese camp under Kitigawa. In 1956, after 9 years of training with Kitigawa, Shintani travelled to Japan and met Hironori Otsuka (Wado Ryu). In 1958, Otsuka invited Shintani to join his organization Wado Kai, and in 1969 he asked Shintani to officially call his style Wado.

In Canada during this same time, karate was also introduced by Masami Tsuruoka who had studied in Japan in the 1940s under Tsuyoshi Chitose. In 1954, Tsuruoka initiated the first karate competition in Canada and laid the foundation for the National Karate Association.

In the late 1950s Shintani moved to Ontario and began teaching karate and judo at the Japanese Cultural Centre in Hamilton. In 1966, he began (with Otsuka&#x27;s endorsement) the Shintani Wado Kai Karate Federation. During the 1970s Otsuka appointed Shintani the Supreme Instructor of Wado Kai in North America. In 1979, Otsuka publicly promoted Shintani to hachidan (8th dan) and privately gave him a kudan certificate (9th dan), which was revealed by Shintani in 1995. Shintani and Otsuka visited each other in Japan and Canada several times, the last time in 1980 two years prior to Otsuka&#x27;s death. Shintani died 7 May 2000.

====United States====

After World War II, members of the United States military learned karate in Okinawa or Japan and then opened schools in the US. In 1945, Robert Trias opened the first &quot;dōjō&quot; in the United States in Phoenix, Arizona, a Shuri-ryū karate &quot;dōjō&quot;. In the 1950s, William J. Dometrich, Ed Parker, Cecil T. Patterson, Gordon Doversola, Harold G. Long, Donald Hugh Nagle, George Mattson and Peter Urban all began instructing in the US.

Tsutomu Ohshima began studying karate under Shotokan&#x27;s founder, Gichin Funakoshi, while a student at Waseda University, beginning in 1948. In 1957, Ohshima received his godan (fifth-degree black belt), the highest rank awarded by Funakoshi. He founded the first university karate club in the United States at California Institute of Technology in 1957. In 1959, he founded the Southern California Karate Association (SCKA) which was renamed Shotokan Karate of America (SKA) in 1969.

In the 1960s, Anthony Mirakian, Richard Kim, Teruyuki Okazaki, John Pachivas, Allen Steen, Gosei Yamaguchi (son of Gōgen Yamaguchi), Michael G. Foster and Pat Burleson began teaching martial arts around the country.

In 1961, Hidetaka Nishiyama, a co-founder of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) and student of Gichin Funakoshi, began teaching in the United States. He founded the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). Takayuki Mikami was sent to New Orleans by the JKA in 1963.

In 1964, Takayuki Kubota relocated the International Karate Association from Tokyo to California.

===Asia===

====Korea====

Due to past conflict between Korea and Japan, most notably during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century, the influence of karate in Korea is a contentious issue. From 1910 until 1945, Korea was annexed by the Japanese Empire. It was during this time that many of the Korean martial arts masters of the 20th century were exposed to Japanese karate. After regaining independence from Japan, many Korean martial arts schools that opened up in the 1940s and 1950s were founded by masters who had trained in karate in Japan as part of their martial arts training.

Won Kuk Lee, a Korean student of Funakoshi, founded the first martial arts school after the Japanese occupation of Korea ended in 1945, called the Chung Do Kwan. Having studied under Gichin Funakoshi at Chuo University, Lee had incorporated taekkyon, kung fu, and karate in the martial art that he taught which he called &quot;Tang Soo Do&quot;, the Korean transliteration of the Chinese characters for &quot;Way of Chinese Hand&quot; (唐手道). In the mid-1950s, the martial arts schools were unified under President Rhee Syngman&#x27;s order, and became taekwondo under the leadership of Choi Hong Hi and a committee of Korean masters. Choi, a significant figure in taekwondo history, had also studied karate under Funakoshi. Karate also provided an important comparative model for the early founders of taekwondo in the formalization of their art including hyung and the belt ranking system. The original taekwondo &quot;hyung&quot; were identical to karate &quot;kata&quot;. Eventually, original Korean forms were developed by individual schools and associations. Although the World Taekwondo Federation and International Taekwon-Do Federation are the most prominent among Korean martial arts organizations, &quot;tang soo do&quot; schools that teach Japanese karate still exist as they were originally conveyed to Won Kuk Lee and his contemporaries from Funakoshi.

====Soviet Union====
Karate appeared in the Soviet Union in the mid-1960s, during Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s policy of improved international relations. The first Shotokan clubs were opened in Moscow&#x27;s universities. In 1973, however, the government banned karate—together with all other foreign martial arts—endorsing only the Soviet martial art of sambo. Failing to suppress these uncontrolled groups, the USSR&#x27;s Sport Committee formed the Karate Federation of USSR in December 1978. On 17 May 1984, the Soviet Karate Federation was disbanded and all karate became illegal again. In 1989, karate practice became legal again, but under strict government regulations, only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 did independent karate schools resume functioning, and so federations were formed and national tournaments in authentic styles began.

====Philippines====
===Europe===

In the 1950s and 1960s, several Japanese karate masters began to teach the art in Europe, but it was not until 1965 that the Japan Karate Association (JKA) sent to Europe four well-trained young Karate instructors Taiji Kase, Keinosuke Enoeda, Hirokazu Kanazawa and Hiroshi Shirai. Kase went to France, Enoeada to England and Shirai in Italy. These Masters maintained always a strong link between them, the JKA and the others JKA masters in the world, especially Hidetaka Nishiyama in the US

====France====
France Shotokan Karate was created in 1964 by Tsutomu Ohshima. It is affiliated with another of his organizations, Shotokan Karate of America (SKA). However, in 1965 Taiji Kase came from Japan along with Enoeda and Shirai, who went to England and Italy respectively, and karate came under the influence of the JKA.

====Italy====
Hiroshi Shirai, one of the original instructors sent by the JKA to Europe along with Kase, Enoeda and Kanazawa, moved to Italy in 1965 and quickly established a Shotokan enclave that spawned several instructors who in their turn soon spread the style all over the country. By 1970 Shotokan karate was the most spread martial art in Italy apart from Judo. Other styles such as Wado Ryu, Goju Ryu and Shito Ryu, are present and well established in Italy, while Shotokan remains the most popular.

====United Kingdom====

Vernon Bell, a 3rd Dan Judo instructor who had been instructed by Kenshiro Abbe introduced Karate to England in 1956, having attended classes in Henry Plée&#x27;s Yoseikan &quot;dōjō&quot; in Paris. Yoseikan had been founded by Minoru Mochizuki, a master of multiple Japanese martial arts, who had studied Karate with Gichin Funakoshi, thus the Yoseikan style was heavily influenced by Shotokan. Bell began teaching in the tennis courts of his parents&#x27; back garden in Ilford, Essex and his group was to become the British Karate Federation. On 19 July 1957, Vietnamese Hoang Nam 3rd Dan, billed as &quot;Karate champion of Indo China&quot;, was invited to teach by Bell at Maybush Road, but the first instructor from Japan was Tetsuji Murakami (1927–1987) a 3rd Dan Yoseikan under Minoru Mochizuki and 1st Dan of the JKA, who arrived in England in July 1959. In 1959, Frederick Gille set up the Liverpool branch of the British Karate Federation, which was officially recognised in 1961. The Liverpool branch was based at Harold House Jewish Boys Club in Chatham Street before relocating to the YMCA in Everton where it became known as the Red Triangle. One of the early members of this branch was Andy Sherry who had previously studied Jujutsu with Jack Britten. In 1961, Edward Ainsworth, another blackbelt Judoka, set up the first Karate study group in Ayrshire, Scotland having attended Bell&#x27;s third &#x27;Karate Summer School&#x27; in 1961.

Outside of Bell&#x27;s organisation, Charles Mack traveled to Japan and studied under Masatoshi Nakayama of the Japan Karate Association who graded Mack to 1st Dan Shotokan on 4 March 1962 in Japan. Shotokai Karate was introduced to England in 1963 by another of Gichin Funakoshi&#x27;s students, Mitsusuke Harada. Outside of the Shotokan stable of karate styles, Wado Ryu Karate was also an early adopted style in the UK, introduced by Tatsuo Suzuki, a 6th Dan at the time in 1964.

Despite the early adoption of Shotokan in the UK, it was not until 1964 that JKA Shotokan officially came to the UK. Bell had been corresponding with the JKA in Tokyo asking for his grades to be ratified in Shotokan having apparently learnt that Murakami was not a designated representative of the JKA. The JKA obliged, and without enforcing a grading on Bell, ratified his black belt on 5 February 1964, though he had to relinquish his Yoseikan grade. Bell requested a visitation from JKA instructors and the next year Taiji Kase, Hirokazu Kanazawa, Keinosuke Enoeda and Hiroshi Shirai gave the first JKA demo at the old Kensington Town Hall on 21 April 1965. Hirokazu Kanazawa and Keinosuke Enoeda stayed and Murakami left (later re-emerging as a 5th Dan Shotokai under Harada).

In 1966, members of the former British Karate Federation established the Karate Union of Great Britain (KUGB) under Hirokazu Kanazawa as chief instructor and affiliated to JKA. Keinosuke Enoeda came to England at the same time as Kanazawa, teaching at a &quot;dōjō&quot; in Liverpool. Kanazawa left the UK after 3 years and Enoeda took over. After Enoeda&#x27;s death in 2003, the KUGB elected Andy Sherry as Chief Instructor. Shortly after this, a new association split off from KUGB, JKA England.
An earlier significant split from the KUGB took place in 1991 when a group led by KUGB senior instructor Steve Cattle formed the English Shotokan Academy (ESA). The aim of this group was to follow the teachings of Taiji Kase, formerly the JKA chief instructor in Europe, who along with Hiroshi Shirai created the World Shotokan Karate-do Academy (WKSA), in 1989 to pursue the teaching of &quot;Budo&quot; karate as opposed to what he viewed as &quot;sport karate&quot;. Kase sought to return the practice of Shotokan Karate to its martial roots, reintroducing among other things open hand and throwing techniques that had been side lined as the result of competition rules introduced by the JKA. Both the ESA and the WKSA (renamed the Kase-Ha Shotokan-Ryu Karate-do Academy (KSKA) after Kase&#x27;s death in 2004) continue following this path today.
In 1975, Great Britain became the first team ever to take the World male team title from Japan after being defeated the previous year in the final.

=== Oceania ===
The World Karate Federation was first introduced to Oceania as the Oceania Karate Federation 1973.

==== Australia ====
The Australian Karate Federation, under the World Karate Federation, was first introduced in 1970. In 1972 Frank Novak became the first fully qualified Shotokan instructor to arrive in Australia and teach in the country, establishing the first Shotokan Karate dojo in Australia. At karate&#x27;s debut in the Olympics at the 2020 Summer Olympics, Tsuneari Yahiro became Australia&#x27;s first Karate Olympian.

==In film and popular culture==

Karate spread rapidly in the West through popular culture. In 1950s popular fiction, karate was at times described to readers in near-mythical terms, and it was credible to show Western experts of unarmed combat as unaware of Eastern martial arts of this kind. Following the inclusion of judo at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, there was growing mainstream Western interest in Japanese martial arts, particularly karate, during the 1960s. By the 1970s, martial arts films (especially kung fu films and Bruce Lee flicks from Hong Kong) had formed a mainstream genre and launched the &quot;kung fu craze&quot; which propelled karate and other Asian martial arts into mass popularity. However, mainstream Western audiences at the time generally did not distinguish between different Asian martial arts such as karate, kung fu and tae kwon do.

In the film series 007 (1953–present), the main protagonist James Bond is exceptionally skillful in martial arts. He is an expert in various types of martial arts including Karate, as well as Judo, Aikido, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Filipino Eskrima and Krav Maga.

During the late 20th century, specifically during the 80s and 90s, karate saw a rise in mainstream popularity. America in the 80s took hold of the martial arts craze and began to produce more homegrown films in the martial arts genre. Films weren&#x27;t the only popular visual representation of Karate in the 80s, just as arcades grew in popularity, so did Karate in arcade fighting games. The first video game to feature fist fighting was &quot;Heavyweight Champ&quot; in 1976, but it was &quot;Karate Champ&quot; that popularized the one-on-one fighting game genre in arcades in 1984. In 1987, Capcom released &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, featuring multiple Karateka characters.

&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984) and its sequels &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II&quot; (1986), &quot;The Karate Kid, Part III&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994) are films relating the fictional story of an American adolescent&#x27;s introduction into karate. Its television sequel, &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (2018), has led to similar growing interest in karate. The success of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; further popularized karate (as opposed to Asian martial arts more generally) in mainstream American popular culture. &quot;Karate Kommandos&quot; is an animated children&#x27;s show, with Chuck Norris appearing to reveal the moral lessons contained in every episode.
&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1984–present) is a Japanese media franchise (Anime) whose characters use a variety and hybrid of east Asian martial arts styles, including Karate and Wing Chun (Kung fu). &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films, with influences of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.
In the film series &quot;The Matrix&quot;, Neo uses a variety of martial arts styles. Neo&#x27;s skill in martial arts was shown having downloaded into his brain, which granted combat abilities equivalent to a martial artist with decades of experience. Kenpo Karate is one of the many styles Neo learns as part of his computerised combat training. As part of the preparation for the movie, Yuen Woo-ping had Keanu Reeves undertake four months of martial arts training in a variety of different styles.

Many other film stars such as Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Jet Li come from a range of other martial arts.

<text>Kickboxing ( ) is a full-contact hybrid martial art and boxing type based on punching and kicking. Kickboxing originated in the 1950s to 1970s. The fight takes place in a boxing ring, normally with boxing gloves, mouth guards, shorts, and bare feet to favor the use of kicks. Kickboxing is practiced for self-defense, general fitness, or for competition. Some styles of kickboxing include: full contact karate, Muay Thai, Japanese kickboxing, Lethwei, Sanda, and Savate.

Although since the dawn of humanity people have faced each other in hand-to-hand combat, the first documentation on the use of kicking and punching in sports combat is from ancient Greece and ancient India. But nevertheless, the term kickboxing originated in Japan, in the 1960s, and developed in the late 1950s from karate mixed with boxing, having some influence, with competitions held since then. American kickboxing originated in the 1970s and was brought to prominence in September 1974, when the Professional Karate Association (PKA) held the first World Championships. Historically, kickboxing can be considered a hybrid martial art formed from the combination of elements of various traditional styles. This approach became increasingly popular since the 1970s, and since the 1990s, kickboxing has contributed to the emergence of mixed martial arts via further hybridization with ground fighting techniques from Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and folk wrestling.

There is no single international governing body, although some international governing bodies include the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations (also known as WAKO), World Kickboxing Association, the Professional Kickboxing Association (PKA), International Sport Karate Association, International Kickboxing Federation, and WKN - World Kickboxing Network, among others. Consequently, there is no single kickboxing world championship, and champion titles are issued by individual promotions, such as Glory, K-1 and ONE Championship among others. Bouts organized under different governing bodies apply different rules, such as allowing the use of knees or clinching etc.

== Terminology ==

The term can be used in a narrow and in a broad sense.
* The narrow use is restricted to the styles that self-identify as kickboxing, i.e., Japanese kickboxing (with its spin-off styles or rules such as shootboxing and K-1), Dutch kickboxing, and American kickboxing.
* In the wider sense, it includes all modern stand-up combat sports that allow both punching and kicking, including those mentioned above, Sanda, Muay Thai, Lethwei, Savate, Adithada, Musti-yuddha, and certain styles of karate (especially full contact karate).

The term itself was introduced in the 1960s as a Japanese anglicism by Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi for a hybrid martial art combining Muay Thai and karate which he had introduced in 1958. The term was later also adopted by the American variant. Since there has been a lot of cross-fertilization between these styles, with many practitioners training or competing under the rules of more than one style, the history of the individual styles cannot be seen in isolation from one another.

The French term &quot;Boxe pieds-poings&quot; (literally &quot;feet-fists-boxing&quot;) is also used in the sense of &quot;kickboxing&quot; in the general meaning, including French boxing (Savate) as well as American, Dutch and Japanese kickboxing, and Burmese and Thai boxing, any style of full contact karate, etc.

===Styles and descendant arts===
Arts labelled as &quot;kickboxing&quot; in the general sense include:
* Japanese Kickboxing — combat style created in Japan, and origin of the term &quot;kickboxing&quot;.
* Any style of Full contact karate
* Sanda (Chinese kickboxing) — The applicable component of wushu/kung fu of which takedowns and throws are legal in competition as well as all other sorts of striking (use of arms and legs).
* Shootboxing — A Japanese form of kickboxing which allows throwing and submission while standing, similar to Sanda.
* American Kickboxing — a style originating in the United States.
* Dutch Kickboxing — incorporate from four combat arts — Japanese Kickboxing, Muay Thai, Boxing, and Kyokushin style of Karate.
* French Savate — a historical sport which developed in the 19th century. It is mostly known for its foot-kicking techniques.
* Ukrainian Combat Hopak is mostly built around punching and kicking techniques.
* Indian Musti yuddha (also known as Muki boxing) and Adithada, a form of kickboxing that uses knee, elbow and forehead strikes in Southern kalaripayattu.
* Korean Kickboxing - Also Known as Kun Gek Do, it&#x27;s a martial art created in South Korea which is a mixture of Boxing and Taekwondo.
* The Southeast Asian family of kickboxing sports (also known as the ethnic neutral term of &quot;muay&quot; at the Southeast Asian Games) including:
** Thai Muay Boran (Ancient boxing) — Predecessor of Muay Thai, allows the use of headbutts.
** Thai kickboxing or Muay Thai — a modern Thai martial art that allows punching, kicking, knee and elbow strikes.
** Burmese Lethwei — a traditional Burmese martial art of which has now grown into a popular kickboxing event that allows headbutts, knees and elbow strikes. It bears resemblance to neighboring Muay Thai, but Lethwei uses more punches and less kicks. Head butt, choking and throwing techniques are also used. The fighting intensity and momentum is also considered faster. No boxing gloves are used. There is also no scoring system and knockout is the only way to win a match.
** Laotian Muay Lao — Laotian boxing which is similar to Muay Thai
** Filipino Yaw-Yan — Sayaw ng Kamatayan (Dance of Death) is the proper name for Yaw-Yan, a Filipino martial art developed by Napoleon Fernandez. The art resembles Muay Thai in a sense, but differs in the hip torquing motion as well as downward-cutting nature of its kicks and with strong emphasis on delivering attacks from long range.

== History ==
=== Overview ===

Since kickboxing is a broad term, understanding the history can be somewhat difficult, since combat is an inherent part of being human. Kicking and punching as an act of human aggression have probably existed throughout the world since prehistory.

The earliest known depiction of any type of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BC. Forms of kickboxing existed in ancient India. The earliest references to musti-yuddha come from classical Vedic epics such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Rig Veda,&quot; compiled in the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts. Mushti Yuddha has travelled along the Indosphere and has been a preceder and a strong influence in many famous martial arts of Southeast Asia such as Muay Thai and Muay Laos.

In the Pankration, a mixed martial art from ancient Greece, a form of kickboxing was used in its Anō Pankration modality, being able to use any extremity to hit. In addition, it is debated whether kicks were allowed in ancient Greek boxing, and while there is some evidence of kicks, this is the subject of debate among scholars.
The French were the first to include boxing gloves into a sport that included kicking and boxing techniques. In 1743, modern boxing gloves were invented by Englishman Jack Broughton. Frenchman Charles Lecour added English boxing gloves to la boxe française. Charles Lecour was a pioneer of modern savate or la boxe française. He created a form where both kicking and punching was used. Lecour was the first to view savate as a sport and self-defense system. The French colonists introduced European boxing gloves into the native Asian martial arts in French Indochina. The use of European boxing gloves spread to neighboring Siam.

It was during the 1950s that a Japanese karateka named Tatsuo Yamada first established an outline of a new sport that combined karate and Muay Thai. This was further explored during the early 1960s, when competitions between karate and Muay Thai began, which allowed for rule modifications to take place. In the middle of the decade, the first events with the term kickboxing were held in Osaka.

By the 1970s and 1980s, kickboxing expanded beyond Japan and had reached North America and Europe. It was during this time that many of the most prominent governing bodies were formed.

* In Japan the sport was widely popular and was regularly broadcast on television before going into a dark period during the 1980s.
* In North America the sport had unclear rules so kickboxing and full contact karate were essentially the same thing.
* In Europe the sport found marginal success but did not thrive until the 1990s.

Since the 1990s kickboxing has been mostly dominated by the Japanese K-1 promotion, with some competition coming from other promotions and mostly pre-existing governing bodies.

Along with the growing popularity in competition, there has been an increased amount of participation and exposure in the mass media, fitness, and self-defense.

=== Japan ===

On December 20, 1959, a Muay Thai match among Thai fighters was held at Asakusa town hall in Tokyo. Tatsuo Yamada, who established &quot;Nihon Kempo Karate-do&quot;, was interested in Muay Thai because he wanted to perform karate matches with full-contact rules since practitioners are not allowed to hit each other directly in karate matches. He had already announced his plan which was named &quot;The draft principles of project of establishment of a new martial art and its industrialization&quot; in November 1959, and he proposed the tentative name of &quot;karate-boxing&quot; for this new art. It is still unknown whether Nak Muay was invited by Yamada, but it is clear that Yamada was the only karateka who was really interested in Muay Thai. Yamada invited a champion Nak Muay (and formerly his son Kan Yamada&#x27;s sparring partner), and started studying Muay Thai. At this time, the Thai fighter was taken by Osamu Noguchi who was a promoter of boxing and was also interested in Muay Thai. The Thai fighter&#x27;s photo was on the magazine &quot;The Primer of Nihon Kempo Karate-do, the first number&quot; which was published by Yamada.

There were &quot;Karate vs. Muay Thai fights&quot; on February 12, 1963. The three karate fighters from &quot;Oyama dojo&quot; (kyokushin later) went to the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Thailand and fought against three Muay Thai fighters. The three kyokushin karate fighters&#x27; names are Tadashi Nakamura, Kenji Kurosaki and Akio Fujihira (also known as Noboru Osawa). The Muay Thai team were composed of only one Thai-born fighter. Japan won by 2–1: Tadashi Nakamura and Akio Fujihira both KOed opponents by punch while Kenji Kurosaki, who fought the Thai, was KOed by elbow. The only Japanese loser Kenji Kurosaki was then a kyokushin instructor rather than a contender and temporarily designated as a substitute for the absent chosen fighter. On June of the same year, karateka and future kickboxer Tadashi Sawamura faced against top Thai fighter Samarn Sor Adisorn, in which Sawamura was knocked down 16 times and defeated. Sawamura would use what he learned in that fight to incorporate in the evolving kickboxing tournaments.

Noguchi studied Muay Thai and developed a combined martial art which Noguchi named &quot;kick boxing&quot;, which absorbed and adopted more rules than techniques from Muay Thai. The main techniques of kickboxing are still derived from a form of Japanese full contact karate where kicks to the legs are allowed, kyokushin. In early competitions, throwing and butting were allowed to distinguish it from Muay Thai. This was later repealed. The &quot;Kickboxing Association&quot;, the first kickboxing sanctioning body, was founded by Osamu Noguchi in 1966 soon after that. Then the first kickboxing event was held in Osaka on April 11, 1966.

Tatsu Yamada died in 1967, but his dojo changed its name to &quot;Suginami Gym&quot;, and kept sending kickboxers off to support kickboxing.

Kickboxing boomed and became popular in Japan as it began to be broadcast on TV. By 1970, kickboxing was telecast in Japan on three different channels three times weekly. The fight cards regularly included bouts between Japanese (kickboxers) and Thai (Muay Thai) boxers. Tadashi Sawamura was an especially popular early kickboxer. In 1971 the All Japan Kickboxing Association (AJKA) was established and it registered approximately 700 kickboxers. The first AJKA Commissioner was Shintaro Ishihara, the longtime Governor of Tokyo. Champions were in each weight division from fly to middle. Longtime Kyokushin practitioner Noboru Osawa won the AJKA bantamweight title, which he held for years. Raymond Edler, an American university student studying at Sophia University in Tokyo, took up kickboxing and won the AJKC middleweight title in 1972; he was the first non-Thai to be officially ranked in the sport of Thai boxing, when in 1972 Rajadamnern ranked him no. 3 in the Middleweight division. Edler defended the All Japan title several times and abandoned it. Other popular champions were Toshio Fujiwara and Mitsuo Shima. Most notably, Fujiwara was the first non-Thai to win an official Thai boxing title, when he defeated his Thai opponent in 1978 at Rajadamnern Stadium winning the lightweight championship bout.

By 1980, due to poor ratings and then infrequent television coverage, the golden-age of kickboxing in Japan was suddenly finished.
Kickboxing had not been seen on TV until K-1 was founded in 1993.

In 1993, as Kazuyoshi Ishii (founder of Seidokaikan karate) produced K-1 under special kickboxing rules (no elbow and neck wrestling) in 1993, kickboxing became famous again.
In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, before the first k-1, Kazuyoshi Ishii also partook in the formation of glove karate as an amateur sport in Japan. Glove karate is based on knockdown karate rules, but wearing boxing gloves and allowing punches to the head. In effect, it is oriental rules kickboxing with scoring based on knockdowns and aggression rather than the number of hits. As K-1 grew in popularity, Glove karate for a while became the fastest-growing amateur sport in Japan.

=== North America ===

Count Dante, Ray Scarica and Maung Gyi held the United States&#x27; earliest
cross-style full-contact style martial arts tournaments as early as 1962.
Between 1970 and 1973 a handful of kickboxing promotions were staged across the US. The first recognized bout of this kind occurred on January 17, 1970, and came about when Joe Lewis, a Shorin Ryu stylist who had also studied Jeet Kune Do with the legendary Bruce Lee, and noted champion in the Karate tournament circuit, grew disillusioned with the point-sparring format and sought to create an event that would allow martial artists to fight to the knock out. Enlisting the help of promoter Lee Faulkner, training in boxing and combining the techniques of boxing and Karate for the first time in America, Lewis arranged the bout to be held at the 1st Pro Team Karate Championships. Lewis faced Kenpo stylist Greg &quot;Om&quot; Baines, who had defeated two opponents in years pasts. Lewis won the fight by knockout in the second round. The event was advertised as &quot;Full contact&quot; but the announcers referred to it as Kickboxing, and rules included knees, elbows and sweeps. Lewis would defend his U.S. Heavyweight champion title 10 times, remaining undefeated until he came back from his retirement. In the early days, the rules were never clear; one of the first tournaments had no weight divisions, and all the competitors fought off until one was left. During this early time, kickboxing and full contact karate are essentially the same sport.

The institutional separation of American full-contact karate from kickboxing occurred with the formation of the Professional Karate Association (PKA) in 1974 and of the World Kickboxing Association (WKA) in 1976.
They were the first organised body of martial arts on a global scale to sanction fights, create ranking systems, and institute a development programme.

The International Kickboxing Federation (IKF) and the International Sport Kickboxing Association (ISKA) have been the only organizations to have thrived in the modern era.

The International Kickboxing Federation (IKF) was founded in 1992 by Steve Fossum and Dan Stell. Stell eventually stepped down to go back to fighting while Fossum continued with the organization. In 1999 Fossum and Joe Taylor of Ringside Products created the first amateur open North American tournament for Kickboxing and Muay Thai, now the IKF World Classic.

After ending its venture with K-1 in 2006, ISKA co-operated the World Combat League with Chuck Norris, and Strikeforce MMA in partnership with Silicon Valley Entertainment (SVE), an investor group who also own the San Jose Sharks. Norris passed the WCL to his son-in-law Damien Diciolli in 2007, and it has since become inactive. Strikeforce MMA was sold to UFC in 2011.

The ISKA expanded into sport (tournament) martial arts about 15 years ago, and is a co-operator along with WAKO and Global Marketing Ventures (GMV) in the global Open World Tour (OWT) the first worldwide pro circuit of sport karate professional competitors. It sanctions and assists in the annual US Open &amp; ISKA World Championships that anchors the OWT and the North American-based NASKA Tour. The US Open &amp; ISKA World Championships is broadcast live on ESPN2 and ESPN3 each year.

Other kickboxing sanctioning bodies include World Association of Kickboxing Organizations (primarily amateurs) and KICK International.

=== Europe ===
In West Germany, American-styled kickboxing was promulgated from its inception in the 1970s by Georg F. Bruckner, who in 1976 was the co-founder of the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations. The term &quot;kickboxing&quot; as used in German-speaking Europe is therefore mostly synonymous with American kickboxing. The low-kick and knee techniques allowed in Japanese kickboxing, by contrast, were associated with Muay Thai, and Japanese kickboxing went mostly unnoticed in German-speaking Europe before the launch of K-1 in 1993.

By contrast, in the Netherlands kickboxing was introduced in its Japanese form, by Jan Plas and Thom Harinck who founded NKBB (The Dutch Kickboxing Association) in 1976.
Harinck also founded the MTBN (Dutch Muay Thai Association) in 1983, and the WMTA (World Muay Thai Association) and the EMTA (European Muay Thai Association) in 1984.
The most prominent kickboxing gyms in the Netherlands, Mejiro Gym, Chakuriki Gym and Golden Glory, were all derived from or were significantly influenced by Japanese kickboxing and kyokushin karate.

Dutch athletes have been very successful in the K-1 competitions.
Out of the 19 K-1 World Grand Prix championship titles issued from 1993 to 2012, 15 went to Dutch participants (Peter Aerts, Ernesto Hoost, Remy Bonjasky, Semmy Schilt and Alistair Overeem). The remaining four titles were won by Branko Cikatić of Croatia in 1993, Andy Hug of Switzerland in 1996, Mark Hunt of New Zealand in 2001 and Mirko Filipović of Croatia in 2012.

== Kickboxing styles and rulesets ==

Kickboxing has a number of different rulesets. For example, Oriental/K-1 rules allow punches, high and low kicks and even knee strikes, while American kickboxing is limited to punches and kicks only above the belt (high kicks).

In the first two decades of the 21st century, several larger kickboxing promotions such as Glory, One Championship and Bellator Kickboxing have adopted the k1/oriental rule set, which allows knee strikes, kicking and punching.

=== Japanese Kickboxing ===

Oriental rules (also known as K-1 rules or unified rules, and sometimes referred to as Japanese kickboxing) was the first combat sport that adopted the name of &quot;kickboxing&quot; in 1966, later termed &quot;Japanese kickboxing&quot; as a retronym. Since the 1990s, many of the largest kickboxing promotions such as K-1, ONE Championship, Glory and Bellator Kickboxing adopted this ruleset. Oriental rules began to be developed by the Japanese boxing promoter Osamu Noguchi and Karate practitioner Tatsuo Yamada, and it was initially intended as a mix of Karate and Muay Thai, but it was later affected also by the Dutch rules, which were first formalised in the Netherlands in the 1970s. The primary difference between Muay Thai and Oriental Kickboxing was the prohibition of elbow strikes and throws. In addition, the amount of clinch fighting is drastically decreased. These changes were aimed at reducing injuries and making bouts more accessible to TV viewers. Oriental rules bouts were traditionally fought over 5, 3-minute rounds but 3 round bouts have since become popular. The male kickboxers are bare-chested wearing shorts (although trousers and karate gis have been worn) and protective gear including: mouth-guard, hand-wraps, shin-wraps, gloves.

Notable fighters under K-1 rules include Semmy Schilt, Badr Hari, Ernesto Hoost, Albert Kraus, Masato, Peter Aerts, Remy Bonjasky, Giorgio Petrosyan, Buakaw and Andy Souwer.

Rules:
* Fighters are allowed to strike their opponent with punches, kicks, including kicks below the waist, except for the groin, sweeps and knees (only to the body).
* Elbow strikes are forbidden.
* Very limited or no clinch fighting is allowed (in some competitions clinching is completely illegal, in others only one single strike is allowed before the clinch has to be released, in other promotions just a few seconds of clinch are allowed).
* Throws and headbutts are not allowed.
* Bouts are 3 to 5 rounds (lasting 3 minutes each) with a 1-minute rest in between rounds.

===Korean Kickboxing===
Gwon Gyokdo, also known as Kun Gek Do and Kyuk Too Ki is a style of Kickboxing from Korea which was founded by Jung Mo-Do.
It is a hybrid style which is composed by Taekwondo, Western Boxing and Muay Thai rules and techniques.
Korean Kickboxing uses the basic kicking style of Taekwondo, but also adds typical Muay Thai techniques, as well as footwork and dodging tactics of Western Boxing.

Rules:


*Punches and kicks are allowed.
*Elbow strikes and knee strikes are allowed.
*Throwing and clinching is allowed.
*Spinning techniques are allowed.

=== American Kickboxing ===

Full Contact (also referred to as American Kickboxing) is essentially a mixture of Western boxing and traditional karate. The male kickboxers are bare-chested wearing kickboxing trousers and protective gear including: mouth-guard, hand-wraps, boxing gloves, groin-guard, shin-pads, and kick-boots and protective helmet (for amateurs and those under 16). Female kickboxers will wear a sports bra and chest protection in addition to the male clothing/protective gear.

Notable fighters under full contact rules include, Dennis Alexio, Joe Lewis, Rick Roufus, Jean-Yves Thériault, Benny Urquidez, Bill Wallace, Demetrius Havanas, Billy Jackson, Akseli Saurama, Pete Cunningham, and Don &quot;The Dragon&quot; Wilson

Rules:
* Opponents are allowed to hit each other with punches and kicks, striking above the waist.
* Elbows and knees are forbidden.
* Clinch fighting and grappling are forbidden, sweeps are legal boot-to-boot.
* Bouts are usually 3 to 10 rounds (lasting 2 minutes each) with a 1-minute rest in between rounds.
* The Referee is responsible for fighter safety and keeping to the rules; judges count legal techniques and note the points on the scoring card or with the help of the electronic system.

==== Semi Contact ====

Semi Contact or Points Fighting, is the variant of American kickboxing most similar to karate, since it consists in fighting for the purpose of scoring points with an emphasis on delivery, speed, and technique. Under such rules, fights are held on the tatami, presenting the belts to classify the fighters in order of experience and ability. The male kickboxers wear shirts and kickboxing trousers as well as protective gear including: mouth-guard, hand-wraps, . boxing gloves, groin-guard, shin-pads, kick-boots, and headgear. The female kickboxers will wear a sports bra and chest protection in addition to the male clothing/protective gear.

Notable fighters under semi-contact rules include Raymond Daniels, Michael Page, Stephen Thompson and Gregorio Di Leo.

Rules:
* Fighters can score through punches or kicks, striking above the waist, and foot sweeps, executed below the ankle.
* Punches, kicks and foot sweeps are awarded 1 point. Kicks to the head or jumping kicks to the body are awarded 2 points. Jumping kicks to the head are awarded 3 points.
* Hook kicks and Axe kicks are allowed but must be executed with the sole of the foot.
* The use of the shins is seldom allowed, save for jumping and spinning techniques.
* Elbows, knees and spinning backfists are forbidden.
* Clinch fighting, throws and sweeps (with the exception of foot sweeps) are forbidden.
* Bouts are usually 3 rounds (lasting 2–3 minutes each) with a 1-minute rest in between rounds.

===Dutch Kickboxing===

Dutch rules (sometimes referred to as Dutch Kickboxing) came about when Japanese kickboxing and Muay Thai were first introduced in Holland in the 1970s. European rules began to be developed by the Netherland Kick Boxing Bond in the 1970s when the late Jan Plas brought the sport from Japan to his native country. 
The primary difference between Dutch rules and full Muay Thai rules was the prohibition of elbow strikes and the limited knees strikes (only to the body). However, elbows were allowed when both parties agree to it. These changes were aimed at reducing injuries and making bouts more accessible to TV viewers. Like the Thai counterpart, the fights are accompanied with the traditional Thai music during a battle. The Dutch kickboxing rules were instrumental to the development of the K-1 rules.

Notable fighters under Dutch rules include Alistair Overeem, Bas Rutten, Melvin Manhoef, Gegard Mousasi, Remy Bonjasky and Peter Aerts.

Rules:
*Rounds are up to 3 and they last 3 minutes.
*Punches and kicks are allowed.

*Clinching is allowed for 5 seconds at best and it&#x27;s only legal if it&#x27;s used to cause damage to the opponent.

=== Freestyle Kickboxing ===

The male kickboxers are bare-chested, wearing kickboxing trousers or shorts and protective gear, including mouth-guard, hand wraps, Boxing gloves, shin guards, and groin guard. The female kickboxers will wear a sports bra and chest protection in addition to the male clothing/protective gear.

=== Muay Thai ===
Muay Thai, or Thai boxing, rules usually sees bouts contested over 5, 3 minute rounds and male fighters bare-chested wearing shorts and protective gear including: mouth-guard, hand-wraps, shin-wraps, boxing gloves, groin-guard and sometimes &quot;prajioud&quot; arm bands. 4oz MMA-style, open-finger gloves are sometimes used. The female Thaiboxers will wear a sports bra and chest protection in addition to the male clothing/protective gear. Muay Thai is unique in that it is the only style of kickboxing that allows elbows, knees, clinch fighting, throws, sweeps and low kicks. Groin strikes were allowed until the 1980s in international Muay Thai and are still partially allowed in Thailand itself (though the boxers wear cups to lessen the impact). Kicking to mid-body and head are scored highly generating a large number of points on judges&#x27; scorecards. Moreover, kicking is still judged highly even if the kick was blocked. In contrast, punching is worth fewer points.

Notable fighters under Muay Thai rules include Apidej Sit Hrun, Buakaw Por. Pramuk, Changpuek Kiatsongrit, Rob Kaman, Ramon Dekkers, Coban Lookchaomaesaitong, Dieselnoi Chor Thanasukarn, Saenchai P.K. Saenchaimuaythaigym, Samart Payakaroon and Yodsanklai Fairtex.

Rules:

Lethwei is a type of kickboxing originating from Myanmar that features minimal rules and protective equipment. Lethwei not only allows the use of headbutts but actually emphasizes it, and fighters wear no gloves. Bouts can only be won with a knockout, either a proper or a technical. Uniquely, after one knockout and two minutes rest, the knocked out fighter may still choose to continue the fight once, unless they are knocked out in the final round. There are no points; if no knockout happens before the end of the fifth round, the fight is declared a draw. Male fighters are bare-chested and wear shorts. Protective gear consists of a mouth-guard, groin-guard, and wraps around hands and feet. Female fighters wear a sports bra and chest protection in addition to the male clothing and protective gear.

== Techniques ==
=== Punching ===
Punching techniques are very much identical to boxing punches, including
* Jab – straight punch from the front hand. The arm extends from the side of the torso which is quickly turned concurrently with this action. A jab may be directed at an opponent&#x27;s head or body, and is often used in conjunction with the cross.
* Cross – straight punch from the back hand
* Hook – rounded punch to either the head or body in an arching motion, usually not scored in points scoring
* Uppercut – rising punch striking to the chin
* Backfist usually from the front hand, reverse-back fist and spinning back-fist both usually from the back hand – are strikes to the head, raising the arm and bending the arm at the elbow and then straightening the arm quickly to strike to the side of the head with the rear of the knuckles.
* Flying-punch struck usually from the rear hand, the combatant hops on the front foot, kicking back with the rear foot and simultaneously extending the rear hand as a punch, in the form of &quot;superman&quot; flying through the sky.
* Overhand (&quot;overcut&quot; or &quot;drop&quot;) – a semi-circular and vertical punch thrown with the rear hand. It is usually performed when the opponent is bobbing or slipping. The strategic utility of the drop relying on body weight can deliver a great deal of power.
* Bolo punch – a combination of a wide uppercut/right cross/swing that was delivered seemingly from the floor.
*Haymaker - The Haymaker is a wide angle punch similar to a hook, but instead of getting power from body rotation, it gets its power from its large loop. It is considered an unsophisticated punch, and leaves one open to a counter.

=== Kicking ===

The standard kicking techniques are:
* Roundhouse kick or &quot;circle kick&quot; – Striking with the front of the foot or the shin to the head or the body in a &quot;chopping&quot; motion
* Front kick or &quot;push Kick/high Kick&quot; – Striking face or chest on with the balls of the foot
* Side kick – Striking with the heel of the foot with leg parallel to the ground, can be performed to either the head, leg or body
* Semi-circular kick or &quot;forty five degree roundhouse kick&quot;

There are a large number of special or variant kicking techniques, including spinning kicks, jumping kicks, and other variants such as
* Hook kick (heel kick) – Extending the leg out to the side of the body, and hooking the leg back to strike the head with either the heel or sole
* Crescent kick and &quot;forward crescent kick&quot;
* Axe kick – is a &quot;stomp out kick&quot; or &quot; axe kick&quot;. The stomp kick normally travels downward, striking with the side or base heel (typically the base heel)
* Back kick – is delivered with the base heel of the foot.
* Sweeping – One foot or both feet of an opponent may be swept depending upon their position, balance and strength.
Spinning versions of the back, side, hook and axe kicks can also be performed along with jumping versions of all kicks.

=== Knee ===
The knee techniques in Japanese kickboxing, indicative of its Muay Thai heritage, are the main difference that separates this style from other kickboxing rules.
See &quot;ti khao&quot; for details.
* Straight knee (long-range knee kick or front heel kick). This knee strike is delivered with the back or reverse foot against an opponent&#x27;s stomach, groin, hip or spine an opponent forward by the neck, shoulder or arm.
* Flying knee – can be delivered with the front or back foot. It makes an explosive snap upwards to strike an opponent&#x27;s face, chin, throat or chest.
* Hook knee – can be delivered with the front or back foot. It makes a half circle spin and strikes the sides of an opponent.
* Side knee – is a highly-deceptive knee technique used in close-range fighting. The knee is lifted to the toes or lifted up, and is snapped to left and right, striking an opponent&#x27;s sensitive knee joints, insides of thighs, groin.

=== Defense ===
There are three main defensive positions (guards or styles) used in kickboxing. Within each style, there is considerable variation among fighters, as some fighters may have their guard higher for more head protection while others have their guard lower to provide better protection against body punches. Many fighters vary their defensive style throughout a bout in order to adapt to the situation of the moment, choosing the position best suited to protect them.

* Slip – Slipping rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent&#x27;s punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to &quot;slip&quot; past. Muhammad Ali was famous for extremely fast and close slips.
* Bob and weave – bobbing moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent&#x27;s punch arrives, the kickboxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the kickboxer &quot;weaves&quot; back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent&#x27;s still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent&#x27;s extended arm is called &quot;bobbing to the outside&quot;. To move inside the opponent&#x27;s extended arm is called &quot;bobbing to the inside&quot;.
*Blocking – defender&#x27;s hard blocks to stop a strike in its path so preventing it reaching its target (e.g. the shin block described in more detail below)
* Parry/Block – Parrying or blocking uses the kickboxer&#x27;s hands as defensive tools to deflect incoming attacks. As the opponent&#x27;s punch arrives, the boxer delivers a sharp, lateral, open-handed blow to the opponent&#x27;s wrist or forearm, redirecting the punch.
* The cover-up – Covering up is the last opportunity to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the kickboxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches &quot;roll&quot; off the guard. To protect the head, the kickboxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.
* The clinch – Clinching is a form of standing grappling and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the kickboxer attempts to hold or &quot;tie up&quot; the opponent&#x27;s hands or enter neck wrestling position. In one way to perform a clinch, the kickboxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent&#x27;s shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent&#x27;s arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent&#x27;s arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. Other forms of clinch involve getting control of opponents neck by collar tie or upper body by underhooks, overhooks and body lock. It is often in the clinch where knee, elbow, sweep and throw techniques are used.

== Brain injury and CTE==

Knocking a person unconscious or even causing a concussion may cause permanent brain damage. There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person. Also, contact sports, especially combat sports, are directly related to a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This disease begins to develop during the life of the athlete, and continues to develop even after sports activity has ceased. In addition, repetitive and subconcussive blows to the head, and not just concussions, cause CTE.

<text>Korea is a peninsular region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and smaller islands. Since the end of World War II in 1945, it has been politically divided at or near the 38th parallel between North Korea (Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea; DPRK) and South Korea (Republic of Korea; ROK). Both countries proclaimed independence in 1948, and the two countries fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. The region is bordered by China to the north and Russia to the northeast, across the Amnok (Yalu) and Duman (Tumen) rivers, and is separated from Japan to the southeast by the Korea Strait.

Known human habitation of the Korean peninsula dates to 40,000 BC. The kingdom of Gojoseon, which according to tradition was founded in 2333 BC, fell to the Han dynasty in 108 BC. It was followed by the Three Kingdoms period, in which Korea was divided into Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. In 668 AD, Silla conquered Baekje and Goguryeo with the aid of the Tang dynasty, forming Unified Silla; Balhae succeeded Goguryeo in the north. In the late 9th century, Unified Silla collapsed into three states, beginning the Later Three Kingdoms period. In 918, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which achieved what has been called a &quot;true national unification&quot; by Korean historians, as it unified both the Later Three Kingdoms and the ruling class of Balhae after its fall. Goryeo, whose name developed into the modern exonym &quot;Korea&quot;, was highly cultured and saw the invention of the first metal movable type. During the 13th century, Goryeo became a vassal state of the Mongol Empire. Goryeo overthrew Mongol rule before falling to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established the Joseon dynasty in 1392. The first 200 years of Joseon were marked by peace; the Korean alphabet was created and Confucianism became influential. This ended with Japanese and Qing invasions, which brought devastation to Joseon and led to Korean isolationism. After the invasions, an isolated Joseon experienced another nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, along with cultural and technological development. In the final years of the 19th century, Japan forced Joseon to open up and Joseon experienced turmoil such as the Gapsin Coup, Donghak Peasant Revolution, and the assassination of Empress Myeongseong. In 1895, Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War and China lost suzerainty over Korea and Korea was placed under further Japanese influence. In 1897, the centuries old Joseon was replaced by the Korean Empire with the Joseon&#x27;s last king, Gojong, becoming the Emperor of the Korean Empire. Japan&#x27;s further victory in the 1904–1905 Russo-Japanese War, expelled Russian influence in Korea and Manchuria. In 1905, the Korean Empire became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan. In 1910, the Empire of Japan officially annexed the Korean peninsula.

Korea under Japanese rule was marked by industrialization and modernization, economic exploitation, and brutal suppression of the Korean independence movement, as reflected in the 1919 March First Movement. The Japanese suppressed Korean culture, and during World War II forcefully mobilized millions of Koreans to support its war effort. In 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allies, and the Soviet Union and United States agreed to divide Korea into two military occupation zones divided by the 38th parallel, with the Soviet zone in the north and American zone in the south. The division was meant to be temporary, with plans for Korea to be reunited under a single government. In 1948, the DPRK and ROK were established with the backing of each power, and ongoing tensions led to the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, which came to involve U.S.-led United Nations and communist Chinese forces. The war ended in stalemate in 1953, but without a peace treaty. A demilitarized zone was created between the countries, approximating the original partition.

This status contributes to the high tensions that divide the peninsula, and both states claim to be the sole legitimate government of Korea. South Korea is a regional power and a developed country, with its economy ranked as the world&#x27;s fourteenth-largest by GDP (PPP). Its armed forces are one of the world&#x27;s strongest militaries, with the world&#x27;s second-largest standing army by military and paramilitary personnel. South Korea has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture, particularly in music (K-pop) and cinema, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean Wave. North Korea follows &quot;Songun&quot;, a &quot;military first&quot; policy which prioritizes the Korean People&#x27;s Army in state affairs and resources. It possesses nuclear weapons, and is the country with the highest number of military personnel, with a total of 7.8 million active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel, or approximately of its population. Its active duty army of 1.3 million soldiers is the fourth-largest in the world, consisting of of its population. North Korea is widely considered to have the worst human rights record in the world.

==Etymology==

&quot;Korea&quot; is the modern spelling of &quot;Corea&quot;, a name attested in English as early as 1614. &quot;Corea&quot; is derived from the name of the ancient kingdom of Goryeo. Korea was transliterated as &quot;Cauli&quot; in &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot;, of the Chinese (: &quot;Kawlej&quot;, &quot;Gāolì&quot;). This was the Hanja for the Korean kingdom of Goryeo (), which ruled most of the Korean peninsula during the 12th century. Korea&#x27;s introduction to the West resulted from trade and contact with merchants from Arabic lands, with some records dating back as far as the 9th century. Goryeo&#x27;s name was a continuation of Goguryeo (Koguryŏ) the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which was officially known as Goryeo beginning in the 5th century. The original name was a combination of the adjectives (&quot;high, lofty&quot;) with the name of a local Yemaek tribe, whose original name is thought to have been either &quot;Guru&quot; (, inferred from some toponyms in Chinese historical documents) or &quot;Gauri&quot; (). With expanding British and American trade following the opening of Korea in the late 19th century, the spelling &quot;Korea&quot; appeared and gradually grew in popularity. The name Korea is now commonly used in English contexts by both North and South Korea.

In South Korea, Korea as a whole is referred to as (, ). The name references &quot;Samhan&quot;, referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula. Although written in Hanja as , , or , this &quot;Han&quot; has no relation to the Chinese place names or peoples who used those characters but was a phonetic transcription (: *&quot;Gar&quot;, : &quot;Han&quot; or &quot;Gan&quot;) of a native Korean word that seems to have had the meaning &quot;big&quot; or &quot;great&quot;, particularly in reference to leaders. It has been tentatively linked with the title &quot;khan&quot; used by the nomads of Manchuria and Central Asia.

In North Korea, Korea as a whole is referred to as (, ). is the modern Korean pronunciation of the Hanja , which is also the basis of the word for Korea as a whole in Japan (), China (), and Vietnam (). &quot;Great Joseon&quot; was the name of the kingdom ruled by the Joseon dynasty from 1392 until their declaration of the short-lived Great Korean Empire in 1897. King Taejo had named them for the earlier Gojoseon (), who ruled northern Korea from its legendary prehistory until their conquest in 108 BCE by China&#x27;s Han Empire. The &quot;Go-&quot; in Gojoseon is the Hanja word and simply means &quot;ancient&quot; or &quot;old&quot;; it is a modern usage to distinguish the ancient Joseon from the later dynasty. It is unclear whether was a transcription of a native Korean name ( *&quot;T[r]awser&quot;, &quot;Trjewsjen&quot;) or a partial translation into Chinese of the Korean capital Asadal (), whose meaning has been reconstructed as &quot;Morning Land&quot; or &quot;Mountain&quot;.

==History==

===Prehistory===

The Korean Academy claimed ancient hominid fossils originating from about 100,000 BCE in the lava at a stone city site in Korea. Fluorescent and high-magnetic analyses indicate the volcanic fossils may be from as early as 300,000 BCE. The best preserved Korean pottery goes back to the paleolithic times around 10,000 BCE and the Neolithic period begins around 6000 BCE.

Beginning around 300 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people from the Korean Peninsula entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the original Jōmon inhabitants. The linguistic homeland of Proto-Koreans is located somewhere in Southern Siberia / Manchuria, such as the Liao river area or the Amur region. Proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the Yayoi migration.

===Gojoseon===

According to Korean legend, Dangun, a descendant of Heaven, established Gojoseon in 2333 BCE. In 108 BCE, the Han dynasty defeated Gojoseon and installed four commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the Lelang Commandery remained as a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive Chinese dynasties for four centuries. By 313, Goguryeo annexed all of the Chinese commanderies.

===Proto–Three Kingdoms===
The Proto–Three Kingdoms period, sometimes called the Multiple States Period, is the earlier part of what is commonly called the Three Kingdoms Period, following the fall of Gojoseon but before Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla fully developed into kingdoms.

This time period saw numerous states spring up from the former territories of Gojoseon, which encompassed northern Korea and southern Manchuria. With the fall of Gojoseon, southern Korea entered the Samhan period.

Located in the southern part of Korea, Samhan referred to the three confederacies of Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan. Mahan was the largest and consisted of 54 states. Byeonhan and Jinhan both consisted of twelve states, bringing a total of 78 states within the Samhan. These three confederacies eventually developed into Baekje, Silla, and Gaya.

===Three Kingdoms===

The Three Kingdoms of Korea consisted of Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje. Silla and Baekje controlled the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, maintaining the former Samhan territories, while Goguryeo controlled the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria and the Liaodong Peninsula, uniting Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and other states in the former Gojoseon territories.

Goguryeo was a highly militaristic state, and a large empire in East Asia, reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of Manchuria to the north, parts of Inner Mongolia to the west, parts of Russia to the east, and the Seoul region to the south. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu, who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their times, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to contesting for control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo–Sui War, in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men. In 642, the powerful general Yeon Gaesomun led a coup and gained complete control over Goguryeo. In response, Emperor Tang Taizong of China led a campaign against Goguryeo, in which the Gorguryeo forces were decimated by the Tang at the Battle of Mount Jupil. Taizong was later defeated at the Battle of Ansi and withdrew his forces from Goguryeo. After the death of Tang Taizong, his son Emperor Tang Gaozong allied with the Korean kingdom of Silla and invaded Goguryeo again, but were forced to withdraw in 662. However, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla. The Tang-Silla alliance conquered Goguryeo in 668. After the collapse of Goguryeo, Tang and Silla ended their alliance and fought over control of the Korean Peninsula. Silla succeeded in gaining control over most of the Korean Peninsula, while Tang gained control over Goguryeo&#x27;s northern territories. However, 30 years after the fall of Goguryeo, a Goguryeo general by the name of Dae Joyeong founded the Korean-Mohe state of Balhae and successfully expelled the Tang presence from much of the former Goguryeo territories.
The southwestern Korean kingdom of Baekje was founded around modern-day Seoul by a Goguryeo prince, a son of the founder of Goguryeo. Baekje absorbed all of the Mahan states and subjugated most of the western Korean peninsula (including the modern provinces of Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeolla, as well as parts of Hwanghae and Gangwon) to a centralised government; during the expansion of its territory, Baekje acquired Chinese culture and technology through maritime contacts with the Southern Dynasties. Baekje was a great maritime power; its nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan. Historic evidence suggests that Japanese culture, art, and language were influenced by the kingdom of Baekje and Korea itself; Baekje also played an important role in transmitting advanced Chinese culture to the Japanese archipelago. Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, most notably in the 4th century during the rule of Geunchogo when its influence extended across the sea to Liaoxi and Shandong in China, taking advantage of the weakened state of Former Qin, and Kyushu in the Japanese archipelago; however, Baekje was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.
Although later records claim that Silla was the oldest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, it is now believed to have been the last kingdom to develop. By the 2nd century, Silla existed as a large state in the southeast, occupying and influencing its neighbouring city-states. In 562, Silla annexed the Gaya confederacy, which was located between Baekje and Silla. The Three Kingdoms of Korea often warred with each other and Silla was often dominated by Baekje and Goguryeo. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage. In 660, King Muyeol ordered his armies to attack Baekje. General Kim Yu-shin, aided by Tang forces, conquered Baekje after defeating General Gyebaek at the Battle of Hwangsanbeol. In 661, Silla and Tang attacked Goguryeo but were repelled. King Munmu, son of Muyeol and nephew of General Kim Yu-shin, launched another campaign in 667 and Goguryeo fell in the following year.

Beginning in the 6th century, Silla&#x27;s power gradually extended across the Korean Peninsula. Silla first annexed the adjacent Gaya confederacy in 562. By the 640s, Silla formed an alliance with the Tang dynasty of China to conquer Baekje and later Goguryeo. After conquering Baekje and Goguryeo, Silla repulsed Tang China from the Korean peninsula in 676. Even though Silla unified most of the Korean Peninsula, most of the Goguryeo territories to the north of the Korean Peninsula were ruled by Balhae. Former Goguryeo general or chief of Sumo Mohe Dae Jo-yeong led a group of Goguryeo and Mohe refugees to the Jilin and founded the kingdom of Balhae, 30 years after the collapse of Goguryeo, as the successor to Goguryeo. At its height, Balhae&#x27;s territories extended from southern Manchuria down to the northern Korean peninsula. Balhae was called the &quot;Prosperous Country in the East&quot;.
Later Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River. Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world. Later Silla experienced a golden age of art and culture, as evidenced by the Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and Emille Bell. Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists and contributed to Chinese Buddhism, including: Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak, a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.

Later Silla fell apart in the late 9th century, giving way to the tumultuous Later Three Kingdoms period (892–935), and Balhae was destroyed by the Khitans in 926. Goryeo unified the Later Three Kingdoms and received the last crown prince and much of the ruling class of Balhae, thus bringing about a unification of the two successor nations of Goguryeo.

===Goryeo dynasty===

Goryeo was founded in 918 and replaced Silla as the ruling dynasty of Korea. Goryeo&#x27;s land was at first what is now South Korea and about 1/3 of North Korea, but later on managed to recover most of the Korean peninsula. Momentarily, Goryeo advanced to parts of Jiandao while conquering the Jurchens, but returned the territories due to the harsh climate and difficulties in defending them. The name &quot;Goryeo&quot; (高麗) is a short form of &quot;Goguryeo&quot; (高句麗) and was first used during the time of King Jangsu. Goryeo regarded itself as the successor of Goguryeo, hence its name and efforts to recover the former territories of Goguryeo. Wang Geon, the founder of Goryeo, was of Goguryeo descent and traced his ancestry to a noble Goguryeo clan. He made Kaesong, his hometown, the capital.

During this period, laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula. The development of celadon industries flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries. The publication of the Tripitaka Koreana onto more than 80,000 wooden blocks and the invention of the world&#x27;s first metal movable type in the 13th century attest to Goryeo&#x27;s cultural achievements.
Goryeo had to defend frequently against attacks by nomadic empires, especially the Khitans and the Mongols. Goryeo had a hostile relationship with the Khitans, because the Khitan Empire had destroyed Balhae, also a successor state of Goguryeo. In 993, the Khitans, who had established the Liao dynasty in 907, invaded Goryeo, demanding that it make amity with them. Goryeo sent the diplomat Sŏ Hŭi to negotiate, who successfully persuaded the Khitans to let Goryeo expand to the banks of the Amnok (Yalu) River, citing that in the past the land belonged to Goguryeo, the predecessor of Goryeo. During the Goryeo–Khitan War, the Khitan Empire invaded Korea twice more in 1009 and 1018, but was defeated.

After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed, and there were great developments in printing and publishing, promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science; by 1100, there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.

Goryeo was invaded by the Mongols in seven major campaigns from the 1230s until the 1270s, but was never conquered. Exhausted after decades of fighting, Goryeo sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to the Mongols; Kublai Khan accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince, and the dynastic line of Goryeo continued to survive under the overlordship of the Mongol Yuan dynasty as a semi-autonomous vassal state and compulsory ally. The two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses, and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean princess.

In the 1350s, King Gongmin was free at last to reform the Goryeo government when the Yuan dynasty began to crumble. Gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with, which included the removal of pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officials, the question of land holding, and quelling the growing animosity between the Buddhists and Confucian scholars. During this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered Liaoyang in 1356, repulsed two large invasions by the Red Turbans in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan to dominate Goryeo when General Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng defeated a Mongol tumen in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its attention to the Wokou threat and used naval artillery created by Ch&#x27;oe Mu-sŏn to annihilate hundreds of pirate ships.

===Joseon dynasty===

In 1392, the general Yi Seong-gye overthrew the Goryeo dynasty after he staged a coup and defeated General Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng. Yi Seong-gye named his new dynasty Joseon and moved the capital from Kaesong to Hanseong (formerly Hanyang; modern-day Seoul) and built the Gyeongbokgung palace. In 1394, he adopted Confucianism as the country&#x27;s official ideology, resulting in much loss of power and wealth by the Buddhists. The prevailing philosophy of the Joseon dynasty was Neo-Confucianism, which was epitomised by the seonbi class, scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.

Joseon was a nominal tributary state of China but exercised full sovereignty, and maintained the highest position among China&#x27;s tributary states, which also included countries such as the Ryukyu Kingdom, Vietnam, Burma, Brunei, Laos, Thailand, and the Philippines, among others. In addition, Joseon received tribute from Jurchens and Japanese until the 17th century, and had a small enclave in the Ryukyu Kingdom that engaged in trade with Siam and Java.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, Joseon enjoyed many benevolent rulers who promoted education and science. Most notable among them was Sejong the Great (r. 1418–50), who personally created and promulgated Hangul, the Korean alphabet. This golden age saw great cultural and scientific advancements, including in printing, meteorological observation, astronomy, calendar science, ceramics, military technology, geography, cartography, medicine, and agricultural technology, some of which were unrivaled elsewhere. Joseon implemented a class system that consisted of &quot;yangban&quot; the noble class, &quot;jungin&quot; the middle class, &quot;yangin&quot; the common class, and &quot;cheonin&quot; the lowest class, which included occupations such as butchers, tanners, shamans, entertainers, and &quot;nobi&quot;, the equivalent of slaves, bondservants, or serfs.

In 1592 and again in 1597, the Japanese invaded Korea; the Korean military at the time was unprepared and untrained, due to two centuries of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Toyotomi Hideyoshi intended to conquer China and India through the Korean Peninsula, but was defeated by strong resistance from the Righteous Army, the naval superiority of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his turtle ships, and assistance from Wanli Emperor of Ming China. However, Joseon experienced great destruction, including a tremendous loss of cultural sites such as temples and palaces to Japanese pillaging, and the Japanese brought back to Japan an estimated 100,000–200,000 noses cut from Korean victims. Less than 30 years after the Japanese invasions, the Manchus took advantage of Joseon&#x27;s war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637, and then went on to conquer the destabilised Ming dynasty.

After normalising relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.

In the 19th century, the royal in-law families gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state, with severe poverty and peasant rebellions spreading throughout the country. Furthermore, the Joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy, earning the nickname &quot;the hermit kingdom&quot;, but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders, beginning an era leading into Japanese imperial rule.

===Korean Empire===
Beginning in 1871, Japan began to exert more influence in Korea, forcing it out of China&#x27;s traditional sphere of influence. As a result of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the Qing dynasty had to give up such a position according to Article 1 of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which was concluded between China and Japan in 1895. That same year, Empress Myeongseong of Korea was assassinated by Japanese agents.

In 1897, the Joseon dynasty proclaimed the Korean Empire (1897–1910). King Gojong became emperor. During this brief period, Korea had some success in modernising the military, economy, real property laws, education system, and various industries. Russia, Japan, France, and the United States all invested in the country and sought to influence it politically.

The Russians were pushed out of the fight for Korea following the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). Korea became a protectorate of Japan shortly afterwards. In Manchuria on 26 October 1909, An Jung-geun assassinated the former Resident-General of Korea, Itō Hirobumi, for his role in trying to force Korea into occupation.

===Japanese annexation and occupation of Korea===

In 1910, an already militarily occupied Korea was a forced party to the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty. The treaty was signed by Lee Wan-Yong, who was given the General Power of Attorney by the Emperor. However, the Emperor is said to have not actually ratified the treaty according to Yi Tae-jin. There is a long dispute whether this treaty was legal or illegal due to its signing under duress, threat of force and bribes.

Korean resistance to the brutal Japanese occupation was manifested in the nonviolent March First Movement of 1919, during which 7,000 demonstrators were killed by Japanese police and military. The Korean liberation movement also spread to neighbouring Manchuria and Siberia.

Over five million Koreans were conscripted for labour beginning in 1939, and tens of thousands of men were forced into Japan&#x27;s military. Nearly 400,000 Korean labourers died. Approximately 200,000 girls and women, mostly from China and Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military. In 1993, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono acknowledged the terrible injustices faced by these euphemistically named &quot;comfort women&quot;.

During the Japanese annexation, the Korean language was suppressed in an effort to eradicate Korean national identity. Koreans were forced to take Japanese surnames, known as Sōshi-kaimei. Traditional Korean culture suffered heavy losses, as numerous Korean cultural artefacts were destroyed or taken to Japan. To this day, valuable Korean artefacts can often be found in Japanese museums or among private collections. One investigation by the South Korean government identified 75,311 cultural assets that were taken from Korea, 34,369 in Japan and 17,803 in the United States. However, experts estimate that over 100,000 artefacts actually remain in Japan. Japanese officials considered returning Korean cultural properties, but to date this has not occurred. Both Koreas and Japan still dispute the ownership of the Dokdo islets, located east of the Korean Peninsula.

There was significant emigration to the overseas territories of the Empire of Japan during the Japanese occupation period, including Korea. By the end of World War II, there were over 850,000 Japanese settlers in Korea. After World War II, most of these overseas Japanese repatriated to Japan. Migrants who remained squatted in informal settlements.

===Division and conflict===
In 1945, with the surrender of Japan, the United Nations developed plans for a trusteeship administration, the Soviet Union administering the peninsula north of the 38th parallel and the United States administering the south. The politics of the Cold War resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate governments, North Korea and South Korea.

The aftermath of World War II left Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel on 2 September 1945, with the north under Soviet occupation and the south under US occupation supported by other allied states. Consequently, North Korea, a Soviet-style socialist republic was established in the north, and South Korea, a Western-style regime, was established in the south.

North Korea is a one-party state, now centred on Kim Il Sung&#x27;s &quot;Juche&quot; ideology, with a centrally planned industrial economy. South Korea is a multi-party state with a capitalist market economy, alongside membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty. The two states have greatly diverged both culturally and economically since their partition, though they still share a common traditional culture and pre-Cold War history.

Since the 1960s, the South Korean economy has grown enormously and the economic structure was radically transformed. In 1957, South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana, and by 2008 it was 17 times as high as Ghana&#x27;s.

According to R. J. Rummel, forced labour, executions, and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in North Korea from 1948 to 1987; others have estimated 400,000 deaths in concentration camps alone. Estimates based on the most recent North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the 1990s famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008. In South Korea, as guerrilla activities expanded, the South Korean government used strong measures against peasants, such as forcefully moving their families from guerrilla areas. According to one estimate, these measures resulted in 36,000 people killed, 11,000 people wounded, and 432,000 people displaced.

===Korean War===

The Korean War broke out when Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, though neither side gained much territory as a result. The Korean Peninsula remained divided, the Korean Demilitarized Zone being the &quot;de facto&quot; border between the two states.

In June 1950 North Korea invaded the South, using Soviet tanks and weaponry. During the Korean War (1950–53) more than 1.2 million people died and the three years of fighting throughout the nation effectively destroyed most cities. The war ended with an armistice agreement at approximately the Military Demarcation Line, but the two governments are officially still at war.

===North and South Korea===
In 2018, the leaders of North Korea and South Korea officially signed the Panmunjom Declaration, announcing that they will work to end the conflict.

In November 2020, South Korea and China agreed to work together to mend South Korea&#x27;s relationship with North Korea. During a meeting between President Moon and China&#x27;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, Moon expressed his gratitude to China for its role in helping to foster peace in the Korean Peninsula. Moon was quoted telling Wang during their meeting that &quot;[the South Korean] government will not stop efforts to put an end (formally) to war on the Korean Peninsula and achieve complete denuclearization and permanent peace together with the international community, including China.&quot;

==Geography==


Korea consists of a peninsula and nearby islands located in East Asia. The peninsula extends southwards for about from continental Asia into the Pacific Ocean and is surrounded by the Sea of Japan to the east and the Yellow Sea (West Sea) to the west, the Korea Strait connecting the two bodies of water. To the northwest, the Amnok River separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River separates it from China and Russia. Notable islands include Jeju Island, Ulleung Island, Dokdo.

The southern and western parts of the peninsula have well-developed plains, while the eastern and northern parts are mountainous. The highest mountain in Korea is Mount Paektu (2,744 m), through which runs the border with China. The southern extension of Mount Paektu is a highland called Gaema Heights. This highland was mainly raised during the Cenozoic orogeny and partly covered by volcanic matter. To the south of Gaema Gowon, successive high mountains are located along the eastern coast of the peninsula. This mountain range is named Baekdu-daegan. Some significant mountains include Mount Sobaek or Sobaeksan (1,439 m), Mount Kumgang (1,638 m), Mount Seorak (1,708 m), Mount Taebaek (1,567 m), and Mount Jiri (1,915 m). There are several lower, secondary mountain series whose direction is almost perpendicular to that of Baekdu-daegan. They are developed along the tectonic line of Mesozoic orogeny and their directions are basically northwest.

Unlike most ancient mountains on the mainland, many important islands in Korea were formed by volcanic activity in the Cenozoic orogeny. Jeju Island, situated off the southern coast, is a large volcanic island whose main mountain, Mount Halla or Hallasan (1,950 m), is the highest in South Korea. Ulleung Island is a volcanic island in the Sea of Japan, the composition of which is more felsic than Jeju. The volcanic islands tend to be younger, the more westward.

Because the mountainous region is mostly on the eastern part of the peninsula, the main rivers tend to flow westwards. Two exceptions are the southward-flowing Nakdong River and Seomjin River. Important rivers running westward include the Amnok River, the Chongchon River, the Taedong River, the Han River, the Geum River, and the Yeongsan River. These rivers have vast flood plains and provide an ideal environment for wet-rice cultivation.

The southern and southwestern coastlines of the peninsula form a well-developed ria coastline, known as &quot;Dadohae-jin&quot; in Korean. This convoluted coastline provides mild seas, and the resulting calm environment allows for safe navigation, fishing, and seaweed farming. In addition to the complex coastline, the western coast of the Korean Peninsula has an extremely high tidal amplitude (at Incheon, around the middle of the western coast, the tide can get as high as 9 m). Vast tidal flats have been developing on the south and west coastlines.

===Climate===
Korea has a temperate climate with comparatively fewer typhoons than other countries in East Asia. Due to the peninsula&#x27;s position, it has a unique climate influenced by Siberia in the north, the Pacific Ocean in the east and the rest of Eurasia in the west. The peninsula has four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.

====Spring====
As influence from Siberia weakens, temperatures begin to increase while the high pressure begins to move away. If the weather is abnormally dry, Siberia will have more influence on the peninsula leading to wintry weather such as snow.

====Summer====
During June at the start of the summer, there tends to be a lot of rain due to the cold and wet air from the Sea of Okhotsk and the hot and humid air from the Pacific Ocean combining. When these fronts combine, it leads to a so-called rainy season with often cloudy days with rain, which is sometimes very heavy. The hot and humid winds from the south west blow causing an increasing amount of humidity and this leads to the fronts moving towards Manchuria in China and thus there is less rain and this is known as midsummer; temperatures can exceed daily at this time of year.

====Autumn====
Usually, high pressure is heavily dominant during autumn leading to clear conditions. Furthermore, temperatures remain high but the humidity becomes relatively low.

====Winter====
The weather becomes increasingly dominated by Siberia during winter and the jet stream moves further south causing a drop in temperature. This season is relatively dry with some snow falling at times.

===Biodiversity===

Animal life of the Korean Peninsula includes a considerable number of bird species and native freshwater fish. Native or endemic species of the Korean Peninsula include Korean hare, Korean water deer, Korean field mouse, Korean brown frog, Korean pine and Korean spruce. The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with its forest and natural wetlands is a unique biodiversity spot, which harbours eighty-two endangered species. Korea once hosted many Siberian tigers, but as the number of people affected by the tigers increased, the tigers were killed in the Joseon dynasty and the Siberian tigers in the South Korea became extinct during the Japanese colonial era period. It has been confirmed that Siberian tigers are only on the side of North Korea now.

There are also approximately 3,034 species of vascular plants throughout the peninsula.

==Economy==
===Science and technology===

One of the best known artefacts of Korea&#x27;s history of science and technology is the Cheomseongdae, a 9.4-meter high astronomical observatory built in 634.

The earliest known surviving Korean example of woodblock printing is The Great Dharani Sutra. It is believed to have been printed in Korea in 750–51, which if correct, would make it older than the Diamond Sutra.
During the Goryeo period, metal movable type printing was invented by Ch&#x27;oe Yun-ŭi in 1234. This invention made printing easier, more efficient and also increased literacy, which observed by Chinese visitors was seen to be so important where it was considered to be shameful to not be able to read. The Mongol Empire later adopted Korea&#x27;s movable type printing and spread as far as Central Asia. There is conjecture as to whether or not Ch&#x27;oe&#x27;s invention had any influence on later printing inventions such as Gutenberg&#x27;s Printing press. When the Mongols invaded Europe they inadvertently introduced different kinds of Asian technology.

During the Joseon period, the Turtle Ship was invented, which were covered by a wooden deck and iron with thorns, as well as other weapons such as the bigyeokjincheolloe cannon (비격진천뢰, ) and the hwacha.

The Korean alphabet hangul was also invented during this time by King Sejong the Great.

==Demographics==

, the combined population of the Koreas is about 77.9 million (South Korea: 51.7 million, North Korea: 26.1 million). Korea is chiefly populated by a highly ethnic group, the Koreans, who speak the Korean language. The number of foreigners living in Korea has also steadily increased since the late 20th century, particularly in South Korea, where more than 1 million foreigners reside. It was estimated in 2006 that only 26,700 of the old Chinese community now remain in South Korea. However, in recent years, immigration from mainland China has increased; 624,994 persons of Chinese nationality have immigrated to South Korea, including 443,566 of ethnic Korean descent. Small communities of ethnic Chinese and Japanese are also found in North Korea.

===Language===

Korean is the official language of both North and South Korea, and (along with Mandarin) of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, China. Worldwide, there are up to 80 million speakers of the Korean language. South Korea has around 50 million speakers while North Korea around 25 million. Other large groups of Korean speakers through Korean diaspora are found in China, the United States, Japan, former Soviet Union and elsewhere.

Modern Korean is written almost exclusively in the script of the Korean alphabet (known as Hangul in South Korea and Chosungul in China and North Korea), which was invented in the 15th century. Korean is sometimes written with the addition of some Chinese characters called Hanja; however, this is only occasionally seen nowadays.

===Religion===


Confucian tradition has dominated Korean thought, along with contributions by Buddhism, Taoism, and Korean Shamanism. Since the middle of the 20th century, however, Christianity has competed with Buddhism in South Korea, while religious practice has been suppressed in North Korea. Throughout Korean history and culture, regardless of separation; the influence of traditional beliefs of Korean Shamanism, Mahayana Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism have remained an underlying religion of the Korean people as well as a vital aspect of their culture; all these traditions have coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years up to today despite strong Westernisation from Christian missionary conversions in the South or the pressure from the Juche government in the North.

According to 2005 statistics compiled by the South Korean government, about 46% of citizens profess to follow no particular religion. Christians account for 29.2% of the population (of which are Protestants 18.3% and Catholics 10.9%) and Buddhists 22.8%. In North Korea, around 71.3% claim to be non-religious or atheists, 12.9% follow Cheondoism and 12.3% Korean Folk Religion, while Christians count for 2% of the population, and Buddhists as 1.5%.

Islam in South Korea is practised by about 45,000 natives (about 0.09% of the population) in addition to some 100,000 foreign workers from Muslim countries. While in North Korea it&#x27;s estimated to be around 3000 Muslims, which is around 0.01% of the popultation. The Ar-Rahman Mosque is the only mosque in DPRK, and it is located at the Iranian Embassy grounds in Pyongyyang.

In 1993, the Korean Overseas Culture and Information Service estimated that around 1,600,000 people practice Korean new religions in both Korean countries.

===Education===

The modern South Korean school system consists of six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school. Students are required to go to elementary and middle school, and do not have to pay for their education, except for a small fee called a &quot;School Operation Support Fee&quot; that differs from school to school. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranks South Korea&#x27;s science education as the third best in the world and being significantly higher than the OECD average.

Although South Korean students often rank high on international comparative assessments, the education system is criticised for emphasising too much upon passive learning and memorisation. The South Korean education system is rather notably strict and structured as compared to its counterparts in most Western societies.

The North Korean education system consists primarily of universal and state funded schooling by the government. The national literacy rate for citizens 15 years of age and above is over 99 per cent. Children go through one year of kindergarten, four years of primary education, six years of secondary education, and then on to universities. The most prestigious university in the DPRK is Kim Il Sung University. Other notable universities include Kim Chaek University of Technology, which focuses on computer science, Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, which trains working level diplomats and trade officials, and Kim Hyong Jik University of Education, which trains teachers.

==Culture==


In ancient Chinese texts, Korea is referred to as &quot;Rivers and Mountains Embroidered on Silk&quot; () and &quot;Eastern Nation of Decorum&quot; (). Individuals are regarded as one year old when they are born, as Koreans reckon the pregnancy period as one year of life for infants, and age increments increase on New Year&#x27;s Day rather than on the anniversary of birthdays. Thus, one born immediately before New Year&#x27;s Day may only be a few days old in western reckoning, but two years old in Korea. Accordingly, a Korean person&#x27;s stated age (at least among fellow Koreans) will be one or two years more than their age according to western reckoning. However, western reckoning is sometimes applied with regard to the concept of legal age; for example, the legal age for purchasing alcohol or cigarettes in the Republic of Korea is 19, which is measured according to western reckoning.

===Literature===
===Music===

Traditional Korean music includes combinations of the folk, vocal, religious and ritual music styles of the Korean people. Korean music has been practised since prehistoric times. Korean music falls into two broad categories. The first, Hyangak, literally means &quot;The local music&quot; or &quot;Music native to Korea&quot;, a famous example of which is Sujechon, a piece of instrumental music often claimed to be at least 1,300 years old. The second, &quot;yangak&quot;, represents a more Western style.

===Cuisine===

Koreans traditionally believe that the taste and quality of food depend on its spices and sauces, the essential ingredients to making a delicious meal. Therefore, soybean paste, soy sauce, &quot;gochujang&quot; or red pepper paste and kimchi are some of the most important staples in a Korean household.

Korean cuisine was greatly influenced by the geography and climate of the Korean Peninsula, which is known for its cold autumns and winters, therefore there are many fermented dishes and hot soups and stews.

Korean cuisine is probably best known for kimchi, a side dish which uses a distinctive fermentation process of preserving vegetables, most commonly cabbage. Kimchi is said to relieve the pores on the skin, thereby reducing wrinkles and providing nutrients to the skin naturally. It is also healthy, as it provides necessary vitamins and nutrients. Gochujang, a traditional Korean sauce made of red pepper is also commonly used, often as pepper (chilli) paste, earning the cuisine a reputation for spiciness.

Bulgogi (roasted marinated meat, usually beef), galbi (marinated grilled short ribs), and samgyeopsal (pork belly) are popular main courses. Fish is also a popular commodity, as it is the traditional meat that Koreans eat. Meals are usually accompanied by a soup or stew, such as galbitang (stewed ribs) or doenjang jjigae (fermented bean paste soup). The center of the table is filled with a shared collection of sidedishes called banchan.

Other popular dishes include &quot;bibimbap&quot;, which literally means &quot;mixed rice&quot; (rice mixed with meat, vegetables, and red pepper paste), and naengmyeon (cold noodles).

Instant noodles, or &quot;ramyeon&quot;, is a popular snack food. Koreans also enjoy food from &quot;pojangmachas&quot; (street vendors), which serve tteokbokki, rice cake and fish cake with a spicy gochujang sauce; &quot;gimbap&quot;, made of steamed white rice wrapped in dried green laver seaweed; fried squid; and glazed sweet potato. Soondae, a sausage made of cellophane noodles and pork blood, is widely eaten.

Additionally, some other common snacks include &quot;Choco Pie&quot;, shrimp crackers, &quot;bbeongtwigi&quot; (puffed rice grains), and &quot;nurungji&quot; (slightly burnt rice). Nurungji can be eaten as it is or boiled with water to make a soup. Nurungji can also be eaten as a snack or a dessert.

Korea is unique among Asian countries in its use of metal chopsticks. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in archaeological sites belonging to the ancient Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla.

===Sports===

North Korea and South Korea usually compete as two separate nations in international events. There are, however, a few examples of them having competed as one entity, under the name Korea.

While association football remains one of the most popular sports in South Korea, the martial art of taekwondo is considered to be the national sport. Baseball and golf are also popular. The board game Go, known in Korea as &quot;baduk&quot;, has also been popular for over a millennium, first arriving from China in the 5th century CE; &quot;baduk&quot; is played both casually and competitively.

====Martial arts====
=====Taekwon-Do=====

Taekwon-Do is Korea&#x27;s most famous martial art and sport. It combines combat techniques, self-defence, sport and exercise. Taekwon-Do has become an official Olympic sport, starting as a demonstration event in 1988 (when South Korea hosted the Games in Seoul) and becoming an official medal event in 2000. The two major Taekwon-Do federations were founded in Korea. The two are the International Taekwon-Do Federation and the World Taekwondo Federation.

=====Hapkido=====

Hapkido is a modern Korean martial art with a grappling focus that employs joint locks, throws, kicks, punches and other striking attacks like attacks against pressure points. Hapkido emphasises circular motion, non-resisting movements and control of the opponent. Practitioners seek to gain advantage through footwork and body positioning to employ leverage, avoiding the pure use of strength against strength.

=====Ssireum=====

Ssireum is a traditional form of wrestling that has been practised in Korea for thousands of years, with evidence discovered from Goguryeo of Korea&#x27;s Three Kingdoms Period (57 BCE to 688). Ssireum is the traditional national sport of Korea. During a match, opponents grip each other by sash belts wrapped around the waist and the thigh, attempting to throw their competitor to the sandy ground of the ring. The first opponent to touch the ground with any body part above the knee or to lose hold of their opponent loses the round.

Ssireum competitions are traditionally held twice a year, during the Dano Festival (the 5th day of the fifth lunar month) and Chuseok (the 15th day of the 8th lunar month). Competitions are also held throughout the year as a part of festivals and other events.

=====Taekkyon=====

Taekkyon is a traditional martial art, considered the oldest form of fighting technique of Korea. Practiced for centuries and especially popular during the Joseon period, two forms co-existed: one for practical use, the other for sport. This form was usually practised alongside Ssireum during festivals and competitions between villages. Nonetheless, Taekkyon almost disappeared during the Japanese Occupation and the Korean War.

Though lost in North Korea, Taekkyon has enjoyed a spectacular revival from the 1980s in South Korea. It is the only martial art in the world (with Ssireum) recognised as a National Treasure of South Korea and a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.

<text>In mathematical logic and computer science, the Kleene star (or Kleene operator or Kleene closure) is a unary operation, either on sets of strings or on sets of symbols or characters. In mathematics,
it is more commonly known as the free monoid construction. The application of the Kleene star to a set formula_1 is written as &quot;formula_2&quot;. It is widely used for regular expressions, which is the context in which it was introduced by Stephen Kleene to characterize certain automata, where it means &quot;zero or more repetitions&quot;.

# If formula_1 is a set of strings, then &quot;formula_2&quot; is defined as the smallest superset of formula_1 that contains the empty string formula_6 and is closed under the string concatenation operation.
# If formula_1 is a set of symbols or characters, then &quot;formula_2&quot; is the set of all strings over symbols in formula_1, including the empty string formula_6.

The set &quot;formula_2&quot; can also be described as the set containing the empty string and all finite-length strings that can be generated by concatenating arbitrary elements of formula_1, allowing the use of the same element multiple times. If formula_1 is either the empty set ∅ or the singleton set formula_14, then formula_15; if formula_1 is any other finite set or countably infinite set, then &quot;formula_2&quot; is a countably infinite set. As a consequence, each formal language over a finite or countably infinite alphabet formula_18 is countable, since it is a subset of the countably infinite set formula_19.

The operators are used in rewrite rules for generative grammars.

== Definition and notation ==
Given a set formula_1,
define
:formula_21 (the language consisting only of the empty string),
:formula_22,
and define recursively the set
:formula_23 for each formula_24.

If formula_1 is a formal language, then formula_26, the formula_27-th power of the set formula_1, is a shorthand for the concatenation of set formula_1 with itself formula_27 times. That is, &quot;formula_26&quot; can be understood to be the set of all strings that can be represented as the concatenation of formula_27 strings in formula_1.

The definition of Kleene star on formula_1 is

:formula_35

This means that the Kleene star operator is an idempotent unary operator: formula_36 for any set formula_1 of strings or characters, as formula_38 for every formula_39.

== Kleene plus ==
In some formal language studies, (e.g. AFL theory) a variation on the Kleene star operation called the &quot;Kleene plus&quot; is used. The Kleene plus omits the formula_40 term in the above union. In other words, the Kleene plus on formula_1 is

:formula_42

or

:formula_43

== Examples ==
Example of Kleene star applied to set of strings:
: {&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;c&quot;}* = { ε, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;abab&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;cab&quot;, &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;ababab&quot;, &quot;ababc&quot;, &quot;abcab&quot;, &quot;abcc&quot;, &quot;cabab&quot;, &quot;cabc&quot;, &quot;ccab&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot;, ...}.

Example of Kleene plus applied to set of characters:
: {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}+ = { &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;, &quot;cb&quot;, &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;aab&quot;, ...}.
Kleene star applied to the same character set:
: {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;}* = { ε, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;, &quot;cb&quot;, &quot;cc&quot;, &quot;aaa&quot;, &quot;aab&quot;, ...}.

Example of Kleene star applied to the empty set:
:∅* = {ε}.

Example of Kleene plus applied to the empty set:
where concatenation is an associative and noncommutative product.

Example of Kleene plus and Kleene star applied to the singleton set containing the empty string:
:If formula_44, then also formula_45 for each formula_27, hence formula_47.

== Generalization ==

Strings form a monoid with concatenation as the binary operation and ε the identity element. The Kleene star is defined for any monoid, not just strings.
More precisely, let (&quot;M&quot;, ⋅) be a monoid, and &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;M&quot;. Then &quot;S&quot;* is the smallest submonoid of &quot;M&quot; containing &quot;S&quot;; that is, &quot;S&quot;* contains the neutral element of &quot;M&quot;, the set &quot;S&quot;, and is such that if &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;*, then &quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;*.

Furthermore, the Kleene star is generalized by including the *-operation (and the union) in the algebraic structure itself by the notion of complete star semiring.

<text>Korean is the native language for about 81 million people, mostly of Korean descent. It is the national language of both North Korea and South Korea. In the north, the language is known as &#x27; () and in the south, its known as &#x27; (). Since the turn of the 21st century, aspects of Korean popular culture have spread to other countries through globalization and cultural exports.

Beyond Korea, the language is recognized as a minority language in parts of China, namely Jilin, and specifically Yanbian Prefecture, and Changbai County. It is also spoken by Sakhalin Koreans in parts of Sakhalin, the Russian island just north of Japan, and by the in parts of Central Asia. The language has a few extinct relatives which—along with the Jeju language (Jejuan) of Jeju Island and Korean itself—form the compact Koreanic language family. Even so, Jejuan and Korean are not mutually intelligible. The linguistic homeland of Korean is suggested to be somewhere in contemporary Manchuria. The hierarchy of the society from which the language originates deeply influences the language, leading to a system of speech levels and honorifics indicative of the formality of any given situation.

Modern Korean is written in the Korean script ( in South Korea, in North Korea), a system developed during the 15th century for that purpose, although it did not become the primary script until the mid 20th century (Hanja and mixed script were the primary script until then). The script uses 24 basic letters (&quot;jamo&quot;) and 27 complex letters formed from the basic ones.

Interest in Korean language acquisition (as a foreign language) is also generated by longstanding alliances, military involvement, and diplomacy, such as between South Korea–United States and China–North Korea since the end of World War II and the Korean War. Along with other languages such as Chinese and Arabic, Korean is ranked at the top difficulty level for English speakers by the United States Department of Defense.

==History==
Modern Korean descends from Middle Korean, which in turn descends from Old Korean, which descends from the Proto-Koreanic language, which is generally suggested to have its linguistic homeland somewhere in Manchuria. Whitman (2012) suggests that the proto-Koreans, already present in northern Korea, expanded into the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC and coexisted with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families.

Since the establishment of two independent governments, North–South differences have developed in standard Korean, including variations in pronunciation and vocabulary chosen. While there tends to be strong political conflict between North and South Korea regarding these linguistic &quot;differences,&quot; regional dialects within each country actually display greater linguistic variations than those found between North and South Korean standards. Nevertheless, these dialects remain largely mutually intelligible.

=== Writing systems ===

The Chinese language, written with Chinese characters and read with Sino-Xenic pronunciations, was first introduced to Korea in the 1st century BC, and remained the medium of formal writing and government until the late 19th century. Korean scholars adapted Chinese characters (known in Korean as Hanja) to write their own language, creating scripts known as idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. These systems were cumbersome, due to the fundamental disparities between the Korean and Chinese languages, and accessible only to those educated in classical Chinese. Most of the population was illiterate.

In the 15th century King Sejong the Great personally developed an alphabetic featural writing system, known today as Hangul, to promote literacy among the common people. Introduced in the document , it was called (&#x27;colloquial script&#x27;) and quickly spread nationwide to increase literacy in Korea.

The Korean alphabet was denounced by the aristocracy, who looked down upon it for being too easy to learn. However, it gained widespread use among the common class and was widely used to print popular novels which were enjoyed by the common class. Since few people could understand official documents written in classical Chinese, Korean kings sometimes released public notices entirely written in Hangul as early as the 16th century for all Korean classes, including uneducated peasants and slaves. By the 17th century, the had exchanged Hangul letters with slaves, which suggests a high literacy rate of Hangul during the Joseon era.

In the context of growing Korean nationalism in the 19th century, the Gabo Reform of 1894 abolished the Confucian examinations and decreed that government documents would be issued in Hangul instead of literary Chinese. Some newspapers were published in Hangul, but other publications used Korean mixed script, with Hanja for Sino-Korean vocabulary and Hangul for other elements. North Korea abolished Hanja in writing in 1949, but continues to teach them in schools. Their usage in South Korea is mainly reserved for specific circumstances such as newspapers, scholarly papers and disambiguation. Today Hanja is largely unused in everyday life but is still important for historical and linguistic studies.

==Names==
The Korean names for the language are based on the names for Korea used in both South Korea and North Korea. The English word &quot;Korean&quot; is derived from Goryeo, which is thought to be the first Korean dynasty known to Western nations. Korean people in the former USSR refer to themselves as or (literally, &#x27;Koryo/Goryeo people&#x27;), and call the language . Some older English sources also use the spelling &quot;Corea&quot; to refer to the nation, and its inflected form for the language, culture and people, &quot;Korea&quot; becoming more popular in the late 1800s.

In South Korea the Korean language is referred to by many names including (&#x27;Korean language&#x27;), (&#x27;Korean speech&#x27;) and (&#x27;our language&#x27;); &quot; is taken from the name of the Korean Empire (). The &quot; () in and is derived from Samhan, in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea (not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula), while &quot; and &quot; mean &quot;language&quot; and &quot;speech&quot;, respectively. Korean is also simply referred to as , literally &quot;national language&quot;. This name is based on the same Han characters ( &#x27;nation&#x27; + &#x27;language&#x27;) that are also used in Taiwan and Japan to refer to their respective national languages.

In North Korea and China, the language is most often called , or more formally, . This is taken from the North Korean name for Korea (Joseon), a name retained from the Joseon dynasty until the proclamation of the Korean Empire, which in turn was annexed by the Empire of Japan.

In mainland China, following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term or the short form &quot;Cháoyǔ&quot; has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and Yanbian, whereas &quot;Hánguóyǔ&quot; or the short form &quot;Hányǔ&quot; is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.

==Classification==
Korean is a member of the Koreanic family along with the Jeju language. Some linguists have included it in the Altaic family, but the core Altaic proposal itself has lost most of its prior support. The Khitan language has several vocabulary items similar to Korean that are not found in other Mongolian or Tungusic languages, suggesting a Korean influence on Khitan.

The hypothesis that Korean could be related to Japanese has had some supporters due to some overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as Samuel E. Martin and Roy Andrew Miller. Sergei Starostin (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese–Korean 100-word Swadesh list.
Some linguists concerned with the issue between Japanese and Korean, including Alexander Vovin, have argued that the indicated similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a &quot;sprachbund&quot; effect and heavy borrowing, especially from Ancient Korean into Western Old Japanese. A good example might be Middle Korean &quot;sàm&quot; and Japanese &quot;asá&quot;, meaning &quot;hemp&quot;. This word seems to be a cognate, but although it is well attested in Western Old Japanese and Northern Ryukyuan languages, in Eastern Old Japanese it only occurs in compounds, and it is only present in three dialects of the Southern Ryukyuan language group. Also, the doublet &quot;wo&quot; meaning &quot;hemp&quot; is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryukyuan languages. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term. (See Classification of the Japonic languages or Comparison of Japanese and Korean for further details on a possible relationship.)

Hudson &amp; Robbeets (2020) suggested that there are traces of a pre-Nivkh substratum in Korean. According to the hypothesis, ancestral varieties of Nivkh (also known as &quot;Amuric&quot;) were once distributed on the Korean Peninsula before the arrival of Koreanic speakers.

==Phonology==

Korean syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), consisting of an optional onset consonant, glide and final coda surrounding a core vowel.

===Consonants===

====Assimilation and allophony====
The IPA symbol () is used to denote the tensed consonants . Its official use in the extensions to the IPA is for &quot;strong&quot; articulation, but is used in the literature for faucalized voice. The Korean consonants also have elements of stiff voice, but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted glottis and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.

 is aspirated and becomes an alveolo-palatal before or for most speakers (but see North–South differences in the Korean language). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, changes to (example: beoseot () &#x27;mushroom&#x27;).

 may become a bilabial before or , a palatal before or , a velar before , a voiced between voiced sounds, and a elsewhere.

 become voiced between voiced sounds.

 frequently denasalize at the beginnings of words.

 becomes alveolar flap between vowels, and or at the end of a syllable or next to another . A written syllable-final &quot;, when followed by a vowel or a glide (&quot;i.e.&quot;, when the next character starts with &quot;), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes .

Traditionally, was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before , and otherwise became . However, the inflow of western loanwords changed the trend, and now word-initial (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either or .

All obstruents (plosives, affricates, fricatives) at the end of a word are pronounced with no audible release, .

Plosive sounds become nasals before nasal sounds.

Hangul spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical morphology. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.

The traditional prohibition of word-initial became a morphological rule called &quot;initial law&quot; () in the pronunciation standards of South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial in the pronunciation standards of North Korea. For example,
* &quot;labor&quot; (勞動) – north: rodong&quot; (), south: nodong&quot; ()
* &quot;history&quot; (歷史) – north: ryeoksa&quot; (), south: yeoksa&quot; ()
* &quot;female&quot; (女子) – north: nyeoja&quot; (), south: yeoja&quot; ()

===Vowels===

The standard Korean monophthongs and their pronunciation principles are as follows:

 is closer to a near-open central vowel (), though is still used for tradition.

 ㅓ is generally pronounced as [ə] when it becomes long vowel.

However, in Korea, with the exception of older generations in certain regions, most people neither pronounce nor distinguish clearly between the two monophthongs &#x27;ㅐ&#x27; (ae) and &#x27;ㅔ&#x27; (e). Similarly, &#x27;ㅟ&#x27; and &#x27;ㅚ&#x27; are sometimes pronounced as [wi] and [we] respectively. The demographic that maintains monophthongal realizations of &#x27;ㅟ&#x27; and &#x27;ㅚ&#x27; is reportedly limited to elderly speakers in the Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Chungcheong provinces. The official standard pronunciation guidelines acknowledge this variation by permitting both monophthongal and diphthongal pronunciations of these vowels.

In South Korea, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between the pronunciations of &#x27;내&#x27; (nae) and &#x27;네&#x27; (ne), the phrase &#x27;네가&#x27; (nega), which consists of the second-person pronoun &#x27;네&#x27; (ne) combined with the nominative particle &#x27;가&#x27; (ga), is sometimes pronounced as &#x27;니가&#x27; (niga) in colloquial speech, while maintaining the same grammatical function.

===Morphophonemics===

Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include &quot;-eun/-neun&quot; () and &quot;-i/-ga&quot; ().

Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include &quot;-eul/-reul&quot; (), &quot;-euro/-ro&quot; (), &quot;-eseo/-seo&quot; (), &quot;-ideunji/-deunji&quot; () and &quot;-iya/-ya&quot; ().

* However, &quot;-euro/-ro&quot; is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a ㄹ (rieul consonant).

Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.

==Grammar==
Korean is an agglutinative language. The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The sentence structure or basic form of a Korean sentence is subject–object–verb (SOV), but the &quot;verb&quot; is the only required and immovable element and word order is highly flexible, as in many other agglutinative languages.

Question

Response
The relationship between a speaker/writer and their subject and audience is paramount in Korean grammar. The relationship between the speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in &quot;honorifics&quot;, whereas that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in &quot;speech level&quot;.

===Honorifics===

When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject&#x27;s superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if they are an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if they are a younger stranger, student, employee, or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences, and both honorific or normal sentences.

Honorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those used today. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status, such as older people, teachers, and employers.

===Speech levels===

There are seven verb paradigms or &quot;speech levels&quot; in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation. Unlike honorifics—which are used to show respect towards the referent (the person spoken of)—&quot;speech levels&quot; are used to show respect towards a speaker&#x27;s or writer&#x27;s audience (the person spoken to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific imperative form of the verb (&quot;hada&quot;, &quot;do&quot;) in each level, plus the suffix (&quot;che&quot;, Hanja: ), which means &quot;style&quot;.

The three levels with high politeness (very formally polite, formally polite, casually polite) are generally grouped together as &quot;jondaesmal&quot; (), whereas the two levels with low politeness (formally impolite, casually impolite) are &quot;banmal&quot; () in Korean. The remaining two levels (neutral formality with neutral politeness, high formality with neutral politeness) are neither polite nor impolite.

Nowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with &quot;banmal&quot;. This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today&#x27;s rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.

===Gender===
In general, Korean lacks grammatical gender. As one of the few exceptions, the third-person singular pronoun has two different forms: 그 &quot;geu&quot; (male) and 그녀 &quot;geunyeo&quot; (female). Before 그녀 was invented in need of translating &#x27;she&#x27; into Korean, 그 was the only third-person singular pronoun and had no grammatical gender. Its origin causes 그녀 never to be used in spoken Korean but appearing only in writing.

To have a more complete understanding of the intricacies of gender in Korean, three models of language and gender that have been proposed: the deficit model, the dominance model, and the cultural difference model. In the deficit model, male speech is seen as the default, and any form of speech that diverges from that norm (female speech) is seen as lesser than. The dominance model sees women as lacking in power due to living within a patriarchal society. The cultural difference model proposes that the difference in upbringing between men and women can explain the differences in their speech patterns. It is important to look at the models to better understand the misogynistic conditions that shaped the ways that men and women use the language. Korean&#x27;s lack of grammatical gender makes it different from most European languages. Rather, gendered differences in Korean can be observed through formality, intonation, word choice, etc.

However, one can still find stronger contrasts between genders within Korean speech. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) the softer tone used by women in speech; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone&#x27;s mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a &quot;sajang&quot; is a company president, and &quot;yŏsajang&quot; is a female company president); (4) females sometimes using more tag questions and rising tones in statements, also seen in speech from children.

Between two people of asymmetric status in Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms, rather than any other terms of reference. In traditional Korean society, women have long been in disadvantaged positions. Korean social structure traditionally was a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasized the maintenance of family lines. That structure has tended to separate the roles of women from those of men.

Cho and Whitman (2019) explore how categories such as male and female and social context influence Korean&#x27;s features. For example, they point out that usage of &quot;jagi&quot; (자기 you) is dependent on context. Among middle-aged women, &quot;jagi&quot; is used to address someone who is close to them, while young Koreans use &quot;jagi&quot; to address their lovers or spouses regardless of gender.

Korean society&#x27;s prevalent attitude towards men being in public (outside the home) and women living in private still exists today. For instance, the word for &quot;husband&quot; is &quot;bakkannyangban&quot; (바깥양반 &#x27;outside nobleman&#x27;), but a husband introduces his wife as &quot;ansaram&quot; (안사람 an &#x27;inside&#x27; &#x27;person&#x27;). Also in kinship terminology, &quot;oe&quot; (외 &#x27;outside&#x27; or &#x27;wrong&#x27;) is added for maternal grandparents, creating &quot;oeharabeoji&quot; and &quot;oehalmeoni&quot; (외할아버지, 외할머니 &#x27;grandfather and grandmother&#x27;), with different lexicons for males and females and patriarchal society revealed. Further, in interrogatives to an addressee of equal or lower status, Korean men tend to use &quot;haennya&quot; (했냐? &#x27;did it?&#x27;)&#x27; in aggressive masculinity, but women use &quot;haenni&quot; (했니? &#x27;did it?&#x27;)&#x27; as a soft expression. However, there are exceptions. Korean society used the question endings &quot;-ni&quot; () and &quot;-nya&quot; (), the former prevailing among women and men until a few decades ago. In fact, &quot;-nya&quot; () was characteristic of the Jeolla and Chungcheong dialects. However, since the 1950s, large numbers of people have moved to Seoul from Chungcheong and Jeolla, and they began to influence the way men speak. Recently, women also have used the &quot;-nya&quot; (). As for &quot;-ni&quot; (), it is usually used toward people to be polite even to someone not close or younger. As for &quot;-nya&quot; (), it is used mainly to close friends regardless of gender.

Like the case of &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;actress&quot;, it also is possible to add a gender prefix for emphasis: &quot;biseo&quot; (비서 &#x27;secretary&#x27;) is sometimes combined with &quot;yeo&quot; (여 &#x27;female&#x27;) to form &quot;yeobiseo&quot; (여비서 &#x27;female secretary&#x27;); &quot;namja&quot; (남자 &#x27;man&#x27;) often is added to &quot;ganhosa&quot; (간호사 &#x27;nurse&#x27;) to form &quot;namja ganhosa&quot; (남자 간호사 &#x27;male nurse&#x27;).

Another crucial difference between men and women is the tone and pitch of their voices and how they affect the perception of politeness. Men learn to use an authoritative falling tone; in Korean culture, a deeper voice is associated with being more polite. In addition to the deferential speech endings being used, men are seen as more polite as well as impartial, and professional. While women who use a rising tone in conjunction with &quot;-yo&quot; () are not perceived to be as polite as men. The &quot;-yo&quot; () also indicates uncertainty since the ending has many prefixes that indicate uncertainty and questioning while the deferential ending has no prefixes to indicate uncertainty. The &quot;-hamnida&quot; () ending is the most polite and formal form of Korea, and the &quot;-yo&quot; () ending is less polite and formal, which reinforces the perception of women as less professional.

Hedges and euphemisms to soften assertions are common in women&#x27;s speech. Women traditionally add nasal sounds &quot;neyng&quot;, &quot;neym&quot;, &quot;ney-e&quot; in the last syllable more frequently than men. Often, &quot;l&quot; is added in women&#x27;s for female stereotypes and so &quot;igeolo&quot; (이거로 &#x27;this thing&#x27;) becomes &quot;igeollo&quot; (이걸로 &#x27;this thing&#x27;) to communicate a lack of confidence and passivity.

Women use more linguistic markers such as exclamation &quot;eomeo&quot; (어머 &#x27;oh&#x27;) and &quot;eojjeom&quot; (어쩜 &#x27;what a surprise&#x27;) than men do in cooperative communication.

==Vocabulary==

The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of &quot;native Korean&quot; words. However, a significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are &quot;Sino-Korean&quot; words. To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from Mongolian and other languages. More recent loanwords are dominated by English.

In South Korea, it is widely believed that North Korea wanted to emphasize the use of unique Korean expressions in its language and eliminate the influence of foreign languages. However, according to researchers such as Jeon Soo-tae, who has seen first-hand data from North Korea, the country has reduced the number of difficult foreign words in a similar way to South Korea.

In 2021, Moon Sung-guk of Kim Il Sung University in North Korea wrote in his thesis that Kim Jong Il had said that vernacularized Sino-Korean vocabulary should be used as it is, not modified. &quot;A language is in constant interaction with other languages, and in the process it is constantly being developed and enriched,&quot; he said. According to the paper, Kim Jong Il argued that academic terms used in the natural sciences and engineering, such as (; &#x27;computer&#x27;) and (; &#x27;hard disk&#x27;) should remain in the names of their inventors, and that the word (; &#x27;chocolate&#x27;) should not be replaced because it had been used for so long.

South Korea defines its vocabulary standards through the 표준국어대사전 (Standard Korean Language Dictionary), and North Korea defines its vocabulary standards through the 조선말대사전 (Korean Language Dictionary).

=== Sino-Korean ===


Sino-Korean vocabulary consists of:
* words directly borrowed from written Chinese, and
* compounds coined in Korea or Japan and read using the Sino-Korean reading of Chinese characters.

Therefore, just like other words, Korean has two sets of numeral systems. English is similar, having native English words and Latinate equivalents such as &quot;water-aqua&quot;, &quot;fire-flame&quot;, &quot;sea-marine&quot;, &quot;two-dual&quot;, &quot;sun-solar&quot;, &quot;star-stellar&quot;. However, unlike English and Latin which belong to the same Indo-European languages family and bear a certain resemblance, Korean and Chinese are genetically unrelated and the two sets of Korean words differ completely from each other. All Sino-Korean morphemes are monosyllabic as in Chinese, whereas native Korean morphemes can be polysyllabic. The Sino-Korean words were deliberately imported alongside corresponding Chinese characters for a written language and everything was supposed to be written in Hanja, so the coexistence of Sino-Korean would be more thorough and systematic than that of Latinate words in English.

The exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50–60%. In 2006 the same author gives an even higher estimate of 65%. Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary &quot;Urimal Keun Sajeon&quot;, asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the colonial period include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as low as 30%.

=== Western loanwords ===

The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, approximately 90% of which are from English. Many words have also been borrowed from Western languages such as German via Japanese (e.g. (&quot;&quot;) &#x27;part-time job&#x27;, (&quot;allereugi&quot;) &#x27;allergy&#x27;, (&quot;gibseu&quot; or &quot;gibuseu&quot;) &#x27;plaster cast used for broken bones&#x27;). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Korea, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example &quot;dozen&quot; &gt; &quot;dāsu&quot; &gt; &quot;daseu&quot;. However, most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current &quot;Hangulization&quot; rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented &quot;Hangeulizations&quot; of the countries&#x27; endonyms or English names.

Because of such a prevalence of English in modern South Korean culture and society, lexical borrowing is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or &quot;Konglish&quot; (), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the South Korean dialect of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary). However, due to North Korea&#x27;s isolation, such influence is lacking in North Korean speech.

==Writing system==


Modern Korean is written with an alphabet script, known as in South Korea and in North Korea. The Korean mixed script, combining Hanja and Hangul, is still used to a certain extent in South Korea, but that method is slowly declining in use even though students learn Hanja in school.

Below are charts of the letters of the Korean alphabet and their Revised Romanization (RR) and canonical International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) values:

The letters of the Korean alphabet are not written linearly like most alphabets, but instead arranged into blocks that represent syllables. So, while the word &quot;bibimbap&quot; (Korean rice dish) is written as eight characters in a row in the Latin alphabet, in Korean it is written , as three &quot;syllabic blocks&quot; in a row. &quot;Mukbang&quot; ( &#x27;eating show&#x27;) is seven characters after romanization but only two &quot;syllabic blocks&quot; before.

Modern Korean is written with spaces between words, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese (except when Japanese is written exclusively in hiragana, as in children&#x27;s books). The marks used for Korean punctuation are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns, from top to bottom, right to left, like traditional Chinese. However, the syllabic blocks are now usually written in rows, from left to right, top to bottom, like English.

==Dialects==
Korean has numerous small local dialects (called &quot;mal&quot; (), &quot;saturi&quot; (), or &quot;bangeon&quot; ()). South Korean authors claim that the standard language (&quot;pyojuneo&quot; or &quot;pyojunmal&quot;) of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around Seoul (which, as Hanyang, was the capital of Joseon-era Korea for 500 years), but since 1966, North Korea officially states that its standard is based on the Pyongyang speech. All dialects of Korean are similar to one another and largely are mutually intelligible (with the exception of dialect-specific phrases or nonstandard vocabulary unique to dialects) though the dialect of Jeju Island is divergent enough to be generally considered a separate language. The Yukjin dialect in the far northeast is also quite distinctive.

One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of the Seoul dialect make use of vowel length, but speakers of the Gyeongsang dialect maintain the pitch accent of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as &quot;z, β, ə&quot;), which have been lost from the standard language, and others are highly innovative.

, , and suggest that the modern Seoul dialect is currently undergoing tonogenesis based on the finding that in recent years lenis consonants (ㅂㅈㄷㄱ), aspirated consonants (ㅍㅊㅌㅋ) and fortis consonants (ㅃㅉㄸㄲ) were shifting from a distinction via voice onset time to that of pitch change; however, disagree with the suggestion that the consonant distinction shifting away from voice onset time is due to the introduction of tonal features, and instead proposes that it is a prosodically conditioned change.

There is substantial evidence for a history of extensive dialect levelling or even convergent evolution or intermixture of two or more originally-distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have a basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects. For example, &quot;garlic chives&quot; translated into Gyeongsang dialect is (), but in Standard Korean, it is (). This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is today. See also the Japanese–Koguryoic languages hypothesis.

== North–South differences ==

The language used in the North and the South exhibit differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.

===Pronunciation===
In North Korea, palatalization of is optional, and can be pronounced between vowels.

Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently (such as the examples below). The pronunciations below are given in Revised Romanization, McCune–Reischauer and modified Hangul (what the Korean characters would be if one were to write the word as pronounced).

* In the North, similar pronunciation is used whenever the Hanja &quot;&quot; is attached to a Sino-Korean word ending in , or .

* In the South, this rule only applies when it is attached to any single-character Sino-Korean word.

===Spelling===

Some words are spelled differently by the North and the South, but the pronunciations are the same.
===Spelling &quot;and&quot; pronunciation===
Basically, the standard languages of North and South Korea, including pronunciation and vocabulary, are both linguistically based on the Seoul dialect, but in North Korea, words have been modified to reflect the theories of scholars like Kim Tu-bong, who sought a refined language, as well as political needs. Some differences are difficult to explain in terms of political ideas, such as North Korea&#x27;s use of the word &quot;rajio&quot; ().:

In general, when transcribing place names, North Korea tends to use the pronunciation in the original language more than South Korea, which often uses the pronunciation in English. For example:

===Grammar===
Some grammatical constructions are also different:
===Punctuation===
In the North, guillemets ( and ) are the symbols used for quotes; in the South, quotation marks equivalent to the English ones ( and ) are standard (although and are also used).

===Vocabulary===
Some vocabulary is different between the North and the South:
==Geographic distribution==
Korean is spoken by the Korean people in both South Korea and North Korea, and by the Korean diaspora in many countries including the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the United States, Japan, and Russia. In 2001, Korean was the fourth most popular foreign language in China, following English, Japanese, and Russian. Korean-speaking minorities exist in these states, but because of cultural assimilation into host countries, not all ethnic Koreans may speak it with native fluency.

===Official status===

Korean is the official language of South Korea and North Korea. It, along with Mandarin Chinese, is also one of the two official languages of China&#x27;s Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture.

In North Korea, the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences (). In South Korea, the regulatory body for Korean is the Seoul-based National Institute of Korean Language, which was created by presidential decree on 23 January 1991.

===King Sejong Institute===
Established pursuant to Article 9, Section 2, of the Framework Act on the National Language, the King Sejong Institute is a public institution set up to coordinate the government&#x27;s project of propagating Korean language and culture; it also supports the King Sejong Institute, which is the institution&#x27;s overseas branch. The King Sejong Institute was established in response to:
* An increase in the demand for Korean language education;
* a rapid increase in Korean language education thanks to the spread of the culture (&quot;hallyu&quot;), an increase in international marriage, the expansion of Korean enterprises into overseas markets, and enforcement of employment licensing system;
* the need for a government-sanctioned Korean language educational institution;
* the need for general support for overseas Korean language education based on a successful domestic language education program.
King Sejong Institute has 59 in Europe, 15 in Africa, 146 in Asia, 34 in the Americas, and 4 in Oceania.

=== TOPIK Korea Institute ===
The TOPIK Korea Institute is a lifelong educational center affiliated with a variety of Korean universities in Seoul, South Korea, whose aim is to promote Korean language and culture, support local Korean teaching internationally, and facilitate cultural exchanges.

The institute is sometimes compared to language and culture promotion organizations such as the King Sejong Institute. Unlike that organization, however, the TOPIK Korea Institute operates within established universities and colleges around the world, providing educational materials. In countries around the world, Korean embassies and cultural centers () administer TOPIK examinations.

==Foreign language==

For native English-speakers, Korean is generally considered to be one of the most difficult foreign languages to master despite the relative ease of learning Hangul. For instance, the United States&#x27; Defense Language Institute places Korean in Category IV with Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), and Arabic, requiring 64 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 26 weeks for Category I languages like Italian, French, and Spanish) to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which they have &quot;sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements&quot; and &quot;can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense.&quot; Similarly, the Foreign Service Institute&#x27;s School of Language Studies places Korean in Category IV, the highest level of difficulty.

The study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by Korean American heritage language students; in 2007, these students were estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities. However, Sejong Institutes in the United States have noted a sharp rise in the number of people of other ethnic backgrounds studying Korean between 2009 and 2011, which they attribute to rising popularity of South Korean music and television shows. In 2018, it was reported that the rise in K-Pop was responsible for the increase in people learning the language in US universities.

=== Testing ===
There are two widely used tests of Korean as a foreign language: the Korean Language Ability Test (KLAT) and the Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK). The Korean Language Proficiency Test, an examination aimed at assessing non-native speakers&#x27; competence in Korean, was instituted in 1997; 17,000 people applied for the 2005 sitting of the examination. The TOPIK was first administered in 1997 and was taken by 2,274 people. Since then the total number of people who have taken the TOPIK has surpassed 1 million, with more than 150,000 candidates taking the test in 2012. TOPIK is administered in 45 regions within South Korea and 72 nations outside of South Korea, with a significant portion being administered in Japan and North America, which would suggest the targeted audience for TOPIK is still primarily foreigners of Korean heritage. This is also evident in TOPIK&#x27;s website, where the examination is introduced as intended for Korean heritage students.

<text>Kyle Merritt MacLachlan (; &#x27;McLachlan&quot;&#x27;, February 22, 1959) is an American actor best known for his Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning role as Dale Cooper in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–1991, 2017) and its film prequel &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992). He is also known for his roles in another two of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; co-creator David Lynch&#x27;s films: Paul Atreides in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and Jeffrey Beaumont in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986). MacLachlan&#x27;s other film roles include Lloyd Gallagher in &quot;The Hidden&quot; (1987), Ray Manzarek in &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991), Cliff Vandercave in &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (1994), Zack Carey in &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995), and Riley&#x27;s father in the &quot;Inside Out&quot; film series (2015, 2024).

In addition to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, MacLachlan has had prominent roles on television such as Trey MacDougal on &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2000–2002), Orson Hodge on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2006–2012), The Captain on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (2010–2014) and &quot;How I Met Your Father&quot; (2022), the Mayor of Portland on &quot;Portlandia&quot; (2011–2018), Calvin Johnson on &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; (2014–2015), and Hank MacLean on &quot;Fallout&quot; (2024–present).

==Early life==
MacLachlan was born Kyle McLachlan (subsequently changing the spelling of his last name to reflect his Scottish heritage) at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital in Yakima, Washington. His mother, Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Stone; 1934–1986), was a public relations director for a school district and a homemaker who was active in community arts programs. His father, Kent Alan McLachlan (1933–2011), was a stockbroker and lawyer. Kyle has Scottish ancestry. He grew up in Yakima as the eldest of three boys, alongside his younger brothers, Craig and Kent Jr. MacLachlan graduated from Eisenhower High School in Yakima. His mother left his father when he was 17, and his parents divorced in his senior year of high school.

MacLachlan was introduced to stage acting by his mother when she became director of a youth theater program for teenagers that she helped set up in Yakima. She also sent him to piano lessons from the age of 9 to 14, when he also began to study classical singing. While in high school, he performed in plays and in class musicals, acting in his first play at age 15. In his senior year, he had the lead role of Brindsley Miller in a production of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Black Comedy&quot;, and performed as Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. In 1982, he graduated cum laude with a BFA in drama from the University of Washington (UW) as a student of the Professional Actor Training Program. He initially planned to major in business and also studied classical voice at UW, but changed his focus to acting.

==Career==
===1980s===
The first film MacLachlan worked on was &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1980), part of which was shot on the University of Washington campus. He was paid $10 as an extra.

In the summer of 1981, after his sophomore year at college, he played the lead in three roles at the Old Lyric Repertory Theatre in Logan, Utah, and the following summer with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.

MacLachlan made his film debut in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) in the starring role of Paul Atreides. MacLachlan was performing in Molière&#x27;s &quot;Tartuffe&quot; at a Seattle-area theater when a casting agent for &quot;Dune&quot; producer Dino De Laurentiis began searching for a young lead and received multiple recommendations for him. After several screen tests, he hit it off with director David Lynch, aided by their common Pacific Northwest backgrounds, and succeeded in winning the part. This marked the beginning of a creative partnership between MacLachlan and Lynch, who would go on to collaborate on four more projects before Lynch&#x27;s death in 2025.

After &quot;Dune&quot; flopped and met with poor reviews from critics, MacLachlan found it difficult to find work. He moved to Los Angeles in 1985, and auditioned for several films, including &quot;Top Gun&quot;, but failed to win any roles, eventually dropping his agent.

Lynch cast MacLachlan in the starring role of Jeffrey Beaumont in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), which was received more positively. Reflecting on his enduring relationship with Lynch in a 2012 interview, MacLachlan remarked: &quot;David Lynch plucked me from obscurity. He cast me as the lead in &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, and people have seen me as this boy-next-door-cooking-up-something-weird-in-the-basement ever since.&quot; Lynch biographer Chris Rodley described MacLachlan as an on-screen incarnation of Lynch&#x27;s own persona.

He starred in the 1987 science fiction action film &quot;The Hidden&quot; as FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher.

===1990s===

MacLachlan further collaborated with Lynch in the ABC television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990–91), playing Special Agent Dale Cooper, reprising that role for Lynch&#x27;s 1992 prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. Lynch commented on those roles in a &quot;GQ&quot; story about MacLachlan: &quot;Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He&#x27;s the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with.&quot; MacLachlan also said he considered Lynch one of his mentors that had a &quot;monumental impact&quot; on him. Lynch, who was known to allow his collaborative partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him, rewrote scenes in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; at the request of MacLachlan, who felt they were not right for his characters.
MacLachlan appeared as musician Ray Manzarek in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;The Doors&quot;, about the band of the same name. He had previously turned down Stone&#x27;s offer to play Chris in the 1986 movie &quot;Platoon&quot;, which ultimately went to Charlie Sheen. Also, in 1991, he played the role of a killer in &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. In the 1993 film version of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;, with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, MacLachlan played the lead role of the persecuted Josef K.

MacLachlan co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson as a rookie prison guard in John Frankenheimer&#x27;s 1994 Emmy-winning HBO film &quot;Against the Wall&quot; about the Attica prison riots. In 1994, he was also featured in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, a live-action movie adaptation of the animated sitcom of the same name, portraying Cliff Vandercave, the movie&#x27;s main antagonist, opposite John Goodman as Fred Flintstone and Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble. 

In 1995, MacLachlan starred in Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Showgirls&quot;. The movie was heavily panned by critics, and it collected a record seven Golden Raspberry Awards. MacLachlan recalls that when he watched &quot;Showgirls&quot; for the first time before the premiere, he thought it was &quot;horrible&quot;. But he later realised that the movie was &quot;inadvertently funny&quot; and embraced for its campiness. According to MacLachlan, although he skipped the movie&#x27;s press tour, he had sat through the whole screening, contrary to reports that he walked out.

===2000s===
From 2000 to 2002, MacLachlan had a recurring role in the American television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, portraying Dr. Trey MacDougal, the one-time husband of Charlotte York (Kristin Davis). MacLachlan played King Claudius in the 2000 film &quot;Hamlet&quot; based on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play. In the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; released in 2001, he voiced the character of the sociopathic real-estate developer Donald Love. In 2002, he made his West End debut in John Kolvenbach&#x27;s &quot;On an Average Day&quot; with Woody Harrelson.

In 2003, MacLachlan made his Broadway debut as Aston in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; with Patrick Stewart. He portrayed the spirit of Cary Grant in the 2004 film &quot;Touch of Pink&quot;. His resemblance to Grant had been previously noted in an episode of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. That same year he also had a guest role in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, in which he played a psychiatrist who shot and killed a sociopathic child who had murdered his son. He was a guest star in the show again in 2011, as a politician whose son is involved in a rape accusation.

In 2006, after starring in the short-lived &quot;In Justice&quot;, MacLachlan appeared in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as the mysterious dentist Orson Hodge. He first appeared during the show&#x27;s second season, and became a full-time cast member at the start of season three. In 2007, MacLachlan was one of the presenters at the London leg of Live Earth benefit concerts. He appeared in the 2008 film &quot;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2&quot;. In the English version of the cult 2006 Norwegian animated film &quot;Free Jimmy&quot; released in 2008, he voiced the character of &quot;Marius&quot;, a militant animal rights activist.

===2010s===
In 2010, after four years of playing Orson Hodge, MacLachlan decided to quit &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as he found the commute from his home in New York City to the set in Los Angeles increasingly difficult since becoming a father in 2008. However, he returned as a guest star in 2012 for season eight, the final season of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. He also guest starred as George &quot;The Captain&quot; Van Smoot in seasons six, eight and nine of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, from 2010 until 2014. He would reprise the role in the first season of the spinoff &quot;How I Met Your Father&quot; in 2022.

From 2011 to 2018, he played the role of Mayor of Portland, Oregon, in the IFC comedy &quot;Portlandia&quot;. After the end of the short-lived 2012 series &quot;Made in Jersey&quot;, where he starred as lawyer Donovan Stark, he was cast as a guest star in &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. In 2013 and 2014 he appeared as prosecutor Josh Perotti in four episodes of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. In 2014 and 2015 he appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; as villain Calvin Johnson / The Doctor. In 2015, he voiced Riley Anderson&#x27;s father in the Pixar animated feature &quot;Inside Out&quot;. In January 2015, it was announced that MacLachlan would return as Special Agent Dale Cooper for the new limited television series &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;, which debuted on May 21, 2017. In an interview, MacLachlan said he doesn&#x27;t understand all of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and that fans understand it much more than him.

In 2018, MacLachlan starred as Isaac Izard, the main antagonist in the fantasy-horror family film &quot;The House with a Clock in its Walls&quot;. In 2019, he appeared as a team owner in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;High Flying Bird&quot; which was shot entirely on the iPhone 8. Later that year, he co-starred in &quot;Carol&#x27;s Second Act&quot;, from the writers of &quot;Booksmart&quot;. The series was canceled in 2020.

At the 11th Annual Governors Awards, held on October 27, 2019, MacLachlan and his &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; co-star Laura Dern paid tribute to their friend and collaborator David Lynch, who received an Academy Honorary Award for his work.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, he reunited with his &quot;Hamlet&quot; co-star Ethan Hawke, portraying Thomas Edison opposite Hawke&#x27;s &quot;Tesla&quot;. Later that year, he made an uncredited cameo appearance in HBO&#x27;s &quot;How To with John Wilson&quot;, which Vulture described as &quot;a glorious 14 seconds&quot;. He then portrayed Franklin D. Roosevelt in &quot;Atlantic Crossing&quot;, which aired on Masterpiece Theatre in 2021.

In 2022, MacLachlan co-starred with Jon Hamm in &quot;Confess, Fletch&quot; and was also cast as Chief Justice Earl Warren in &quot;Miranda&#x27;s Victim&quot;. From 2023 to 2024, he returned to voiceover work with a guest-starring role on Hulu&#x27;s &quot;Futurama&quot; and reprised his role as Riley&#x27;s dad in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out 2&quot; and Disney+&#x27;s &quot;Dream Productions.&quot;

MacLachlan also co-hosted and co-created PodcastOne&#x27;s &quot;Varnamtown&quot; podcast with Epic Magazine co-founder Joshua Davis. The true crime series explores Varnamtown, North Carolina&#x27;s ties to Pablo Escobar. 

In 2024, he was honored with the Canal+ Icon Award at Canneseries ahead of his role in Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Fallout&quot;, the adaptation of the popular video game series. It was quickly renewed for a second season in April 2024. In August 2024, he played a supporting role in &quot;Blink Twice&quot;, the directorial debut of Zoë Kravitz.

In September 2024, he was cast alongside Connie Britton and Kaia Gerber in &quot;Overcompensating&quot;, a college-set comedy series created by and starring Benito Skinner.

In January 2025, the WGAW announced that MacLachlan would posthumously present the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement to David Lynch, who had passed away earlier that month. MacLachlan had previously honored his longtime friend and collaborator with tributes in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and on his personal Instagram account, where he wrote, &quot;I was willing to follow him anywhere because joining him on the journey of discovery, searching and finding together, was the whole point. I stepped out into the unknown because I knew David was floating out there with me. It&#x27;s like Agent Cooper says to Sheriff Truman in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;: &#x27;I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.&#x27; I will miss my dear friend. He has made my world—all of our worlds—both wonderful and strange&quot;.

MacLachlan&#x27;s mother died of ovarian cancer in 1986, aged 52, shortly before &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was released. She had been diagnosed while he was filming &quot;Dune&quot; in 1983, and delayed informing him of the diagnosis. His father died of post-surgery complications in 2011.

In 1992, after his relationship with Boyle ended, he began a relationship with supermodel Linda Evangelista after they met at a photo shoot they did together for Barneys New York.

<text>Kevlar (para-aramid) is a strong, heat-resistant synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, the high-strength material was first used commercially in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. It is typically spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such, or as an ingredient in composite material components.

Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, due to its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is five times stronger than steel. It is also used to make modern marching drumheads that withstand high impact, and for mooring lines and other underwater applications.

A similar fiber, Twaron, with the same chemical structure was developed by Akzo in the 1970s. Commercial production started in 1986, and Twaron is manufactured by Teijin Aramid.

== History ==
Poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide (K29) – branded Kevlar – was invented by the Polish-American chemist Stephanie Kwolek while working for DuPont, in anticipation of a gasoline shortage. In 1964, her group began searching for a new lightweight strong fiber to use for light, but strong, tires. The polymers she had been working with, poly-p-phenylene-terephthalate and polybenzamide, formed liquid crystals in solution, something unique to polymers at the time.

The solution was &quot;cloudy, opalescent upon being stirred, and of low viscosity&quot; and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, who ran the spinneret, to test her solution, and was amazed to find that the fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar. 

In 1971, Lester Shubin, who was then the Director of Science and Technology for the National Institute for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, suggested using Kevlar to replace nylon in bullet-proof vests. Prior to the introduction of Kevlar, flak jackets made of nylon had provided much more limited protection to users. Shubin later recalled how the idea developed: &quot;We folded it over a couple of times and shot at it. The bullets didn&#x27;t go through.&quot; In tests, they strapped Kevlar onto anesthetized goats and shot at their hearts, spinal cords, livers and lungs. They monitored the goats&#x27; heart rate and blood gas levels to check for lung injuries. After 24 hours, one goat died and the others had wounds that were not life threatening. Shubin received a $5 million grant to research the use of the fabric in bullet-proof vests.

Kevlar 149 was invented by Jacob Lahijani of Dupont in the 1980s.

== Production ==
Kevlar is synthesized in solution from the monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (&quot;para&quot;-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The result has liquid-crystalline behavior, and mechanical drawing orients the polymer chains in the fiber&#x27;s direction. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) was the solvent initially used for the polymerization, but for safety reasons, DuPont replaced it by a solution of &quot;N&quot;-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium chloride. As this process had been patented by Akzo (see above) in the production of Twaron, a patent war ensued.

Kevlar production is expensive because of the difficulties arising from using concentrated sulfuric acid, needed to keep the water-insoluble polymer in solution during its synthesis and spinning.

Several grades of Kevlar are available:

* &quot;Kevlar K-29&quot; – in industrial applications, such as cables, asbestos replacement, tires, and brake linings.
* &quot;Kevlar K49&quot; – high modulus used in cable and rope products.
* &quot;Kevlar K100&quot; – colored version of Kevlar
* &quot;Kevlar K119&quot; – higher-elongation, flexible and more fatigue resistant
* &quot;Kevlar K129&quot; – higher tenacity for ballistic applications
* &quot;Kevlar K149&quot; – highest tenacity for ballistic, armor, and aerospace applications
* &quot;Kevlar AP&quot; – 15% higher tensile strength than K-29
* &quot;Kevlar XP&quot; – lighter weight resin and KM2 plus fiber combination
* &quot;Kevlar KM2&quot; – enhanced ballistic resistance for armor applications

The ultraviolet component of sunlight degrades and decomposes Kevlar, a problem known as &quot;UV degradation&quot;, and so it is rarely used outdoors without protection against sunlight.

==Structure and properties==

When Kevlar is spun, the resulting fiber has a tensile strength of about , and a relative density of 1.44 (0.052 lb/in3). The polymer owes its high strength to the many inter-chain bonds. These inter-molecular hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl groups and N&quot;H&quot; centers. Additional strength is derived from aromatic stacking interactions between adjacent strands. These interactions have a greater influence on Kevlar than the van der Waals interactions and chain length that typically influence the properties of other synthetic polymers and fibers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. The presence of salts and certain other impurities, especially calcium, could interfere with the strand interactions and care is taken to avoid inclusion in its production. Kevlar&#x27;s structure consists of relatively rigid molecules which tend to form mostly planar sheet-like structures rather like silk protein.

==Thermal properties==
Kevlar maintains its strength and resilience down to cryogenic temperatures (): in fact, it is slightly stronger at low temperatures. At higher temperatures the tensile strength is immediately reduced by about 10–20%, and after some hours the strength progressively reduces further. For example: enduring for 500 hours, its strength is reduced by about 10%; and enduring for 70 hours, its strength is reduced by about 50%.

==Applications==
=== Science ===

Kevlar is often used in the field of cryogenics for its low thermal conductivity and high strength relative to other materials for purposes. It is most often used to suspend a paramagnetic salt enclosure from a superconducting magnet mandrel in order to minimize any heat leaks to the paramagnetic material. It is also used as a thermal standoff or structural support where low heat leaks are desired.

A thin Kevlar window has been used by the NA48 experiment at CERN to separate a vacuum vessel from a vessel at nearly atmospheric pressure, both in diameter. The window has provided vacuum tightness combined with reasonably small amount of material (only 0.3% to 0.4% of radiation length).

=== Protection ===
Kevlar is a well-known component of personal armor such as combat helmets, ballistic face masks, and ballistic vests. The PASGT helmet and vest that were used by United States military forces used Kevlar as a key component in their construction. Other military uses include bulletproof face masks and spall liners used to protect the crews of armoured fighting vehicles. &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carriers use Kevlar reinforcement in vital areas. Civilian applications include: high heat resistance uniforms worn by firefighters, body armour worn by police officers, security, and police tactical teams such as SWAT.

Kevlar is used to manufacture gloves, sleeves, jackets, chaps and other articles of clothing designed to protect users from cuts, abrasions and heat. Kevlar-based protective gear is often considerably lighter and thinner than equivalent gear made of more traditional materials.

It is used for motorcycle safety clothing, especially in the areas featuring padding such as the shoulders and elbows. In the sport of fencing it is used in the protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. It is increasingly being used in the &quot;peto&quot;, the padded covering which protects the picadors&#x27; horses in the bullring. Speed skaters also frequently wear an under-layer of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates in the event of a fall or collision.

=== Sport ===
In &quot;kyudo&quot;, or Japanese archery, it may be used for bow strings, as an alternative to the more expensive hemp. It is one of the main materials used for paraglider suspension lines. It is used as an inner lining for some bicycle tires to prevent punctures. In table tennis, plies of Kevlar are added to custom ply blades, or paddles, in order to increase bounce and reduce weight. Tennis racquets are sometimes strung with Kevlar. It is used in sails for high performance racing boats.

In 2013, with advancements in technology, Nike used Kevlar in shoes for the first time. It launched the Elite II Series, with enhancements to its earlier version of basketball shoes by using Kevlar in the anterior as well as the shoe laces. This was done to decrease the elasticity of the tip of the shoe in contrast to the nylon conventionally used, as Kevlar expanded by about 1% against nylon which expanded by about 30%. Shoes in this range included LeBron, HyperDunk and Zoom Kobe VII. However these shoes were launched at a price range much higher than average cost of basketball shoes. It was also used in the laces for the Adidas F50 adiZero Prime football boot.

Several companies, including Continental AG, manufacture cycle tires with Kevlar to protect against punctures.

Folding-bead bicycle tires, introduced to cycling by Tom Ritchey in 1984, use Kevlar as a bead in place of steel for weight reduction and strength. A side effect of the folding bead is a reduction in shelf and floor space needed to display cycle tires in a retail environment, as they are folded and placed in small boxes.

=== Music ===

Kevlar has also been found to have useful acoustic properties for loudspeaker cones, specifically for bass and mid range drive units. Additionally, Kevlar has been used as a strength member in fiber optic cables such as the ones used for audio data transmissions.

Kevlar can be used as an acoustic core on bows for string instruments. Kevlar&#x27;s physical properties provide strength, flexibility, and stability for the bow&#x27;s user. To date, the only manufacturer of this type of bow is CodaBow.

Kevlar is also presently used as a material for tailcords (a.k.a. tailpiece adjusters), which connect the tailpiece to the endpin of bowed string instruments.

Kevlar is sometimes used as a material on marching snare drums. It allows for an extremely high amount of tension, resulting in a cleaner sound. There is usually a resin poured onto the Kevlar to make the head airtight, and a nylon top layer to provide a flat striking surface. This is one of the primary types of marching snare drum heads. Remo&#x27;s Falam Slam patch is made with Kevlar and is used to reinforce bass drum heads where the beater strikes.

Kevlar is used in the woodwind reeds of Fibracell. The material of these reeds is a composite of aerospace materials designed to duplicate the way nature constructs cane reed. Very stiff but sound absorbing Kevlar fibers are suspended in a lightweight resin formulation.

===Motor vehicles===

Kevlar is sometimes used in structural components of cars, especially high-value performance cars such as the Ferrari F40.

The chopped fiber has been used as a replacement for asbestos in brake pads. Aramids such as Kevlar release less airborne fibres than asbestos brakes and do not have the carcinogenic properties associated with asbestos.

=== Other uses ===

Wicks for fire dancing props are made of composite materials with Kevlar in them. Kevlar by itself does not absorb fuel very well, so it is blended with other materials such as fiberglass or cotton. Kevlar&#x27;s high heat resistance allows the wicks to be reused many times.

Kevlar is sometimes used as a substitute for Teflon in some non-stick frying pans.

Kevlar fiber is used in rope and in cable, where the fibers are kept parallel within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables have been used in suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy, Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber cable, as its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.

Kevlar was used by scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology as a base textile for an experiment in electricity-producing clothing. This was done by weaving zinc oxide nanowires into the fabric. If successful, the new fabric will generate about 80 milliwatts per square meter.

A retractable roof of over of Kevlar was a key part of the design of the Olympic Stadium, Montreal for the 1976 Summer Olympics. It was spectacularly unsuccessful, as it was completed 10 years late and replaced just 10 years later in May 1998 after a series of problems.

Kevlar can be found as a reinforcing layer in rubber bellows expansion joints and rubber hoses, for use in high temperature applications, and for its high strength. It is also found as a braid layer used on the outside of hose assemblies, to add protection against sharp objects.

Some cellphones (including the Motorola RAZR Family, the Motorola Droid Maxx, OnePlus 2 and Pocophone F1) have a Kevlar backplate, chosen over other materials such as carbon fiber due to its resilience and lack of interference with signal transmission.

The Kevlar fiber/epoxy matrix composite materials can be used in marine current turbines (MCT) or wind turbines due to their high specific strength and light weight compared to other fibers.

==Composite materials==
Aramid fibers are widely used for reinforcing composite materials, often in combination with carbon fiber and glass fiber. The matrix for high performance composites is usually epoxy resin. Typical applications include monocoque bodies for Formula 1 cars, helicopter rotor blades, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash rackets, kayaks, cricket bats, and field hockey, ice hockey and lacrosse sticks.

Kevlar 149, the strongest fiber and most crystalline in structure, is an alternative in certain parts of aircraft construction. The wing leading edge is one application, Kevlar being less prone than carbon or glass fiber to break in bird collisions.

<text>The Kosovo War (; ) was an armed conflict in Kosovo that lasted from 28 February 1998 until 11 June 1999. It was fought between the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which controlled Kosovo before the war, and the Kosovo Albanian separatist militia known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The conflict ended when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened by beginning air strikes in March 1999 which resulted in Yugoslav forces withdrawing from Kosovo.

The KLA was formed in the early 1990s to fight against the discrimination of ethnic Albanians and the repression of political dissent by the Serbian authorities, which started after the suppression of Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy and other discriminatory policies against Albanians by Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević in 1989. The KLA initiated its first campaign in 1995, after Kosovo&#x27;s case was left out of the Dayton Agreement and it had become clear that President Rugova&#x27;s strategy of peaceful resistance had failed to bring Kosovo onto the international agenda. In June 1996, the group claimed responsibility for acts of sabotage targeting Kosovo police stations, during the Kosovo Insurgency. In 1997, the organization acquired a large quantity of arms through weapons smuggling from Albania, following a rebellion in which weapons were looted from the country&#x27;s police and army posts. In early 1998, KLA attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo resulted in an increased presence of Serb paramilitaries and regular forces who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution targeting KLA sympathisers and political opponents; this campaign killed 1,500 to 2,000 civilians and KLA combatants, and had displaced 370,000 Kosovar Albanians by March 1999.

On 20 March 1999, Yugoslav forces began a massive campaign of repression and expulsions of Kosovar Albanians following the withdrawal of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) and the failure of the proposed Rambouillet Agreement. In response to this, NATO intervened with an aerial bombing campaign that began on March 24, justifying it as a &quot;humanitarian war&quot;. The war ended with the Kumanovo Agreement, signed on 9 June 1999, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence. NATO forces entered Kosovo on June 12. The NATO bombing campaign has remained controversial. It did not gain the approval of the UN Security Council and it caused at least 488 Yugoslav civilian deaths, including substantial deaths of Kosovar refugees.

In 2001, a UN administered Supreme Court based in Kosovo found that there had been a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments against the Albanian population, and that Yugoslav troops had tried to force them out of Kosovo, but not to eradicate them and therefore it was not genocide. After the war, a list was compiled which documented that over 13,500 people were killed or went missing during the two year conflict. The Yugoslav and Serb forces caused the displacement of between 1.2 million and 1.45 million Kosovo Albanians. After the war, around 200,000 Serbs, Romani, and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse.

The Kosovo Liberation Army disbanded soon after the end of the war, with some of its members going on to fight for the UÇPMB in the Preševo Valley and others joining the National Liberation Army (NLA) and Albanian National Army (ANA) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia, while others went on to form the Kosovo Police.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted six Serb/Yugoslav officials and one Albanian commander for war crimes.

==Background==
The modern Albanian-Serbian conflict has its roots in the expulsion of Albanians in 1877–1878 from areas that were incorporated into the Principality of Serbia. Muslim Albanians residing in the Sanjak of Niš were quickly expelled after Ottomans had lost control of the region. Modern estimates put the number of expelled Albanians to 50,000–130,000 Albanian refugees. As a result, some Albanian refugees who settled in Kosovo retaliated by attacking the local Serb population. From 1830 to 1876, there had also been a forced migration of up to 150,000 Albanians from the Principality. The conflict became more intense at the end of the 19th century, and in 1901 there were massacres of Serbs using weapons not handed back to the Ottomans following the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.

Tensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the First Balkan War (1912–1913), World War I (1914–1918), and World War II (1939–1945). The Albanian revolt of 1912 in Kosovo resulted in the Ottoman Empire agreeing to the creation of an Albanian quasi-state but Ottoman forces were soon driven out by opportunistic Bulgarian, Serbian and Montenegrin troops. In the ensuing Balkan Wars, at least 50,000 Albanians were massacred in the present-day territory of Kosovo by the Serbian regular army and irregular Komitadjis with the intention of manipulating population statistics before the borders of Albania were recognized during the London Conference of 1912–1913, after the latter proposed the drawing of the borders of Albania based on ethnic statistics.

After World War I Kosovo was incorporated into the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia despite the Albanian community&#x27;s demands for union with Albania. Albanian rebels started the Drenica-Dukagjin Uprisings, which ended with the rebellion being crushed after the fall of the government of Fan Noli in Albania in December 1924 and the subsequent withdrawal of support for the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo by President Zog. Between 1918 and 1939, Yugoslavia expelled hundreds of thousands of Albanians and promoted the settlement of mostly Serb colonists in the region, while Albanian language schools were prohibited. After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. During the occupation, Albanian collaborators persecuted Serb and Montenegrin settlers, with thousands killed and between 70,000 and 100,000 expelled from Kosovo or sent to concentration camps in order to Albanianize the province. The return of the expelled colonists was made next to impossible by a decree from Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, followed by a new law in August 1945, which disallowed the return of colonists who had taken land from Albanian peasants.

===Kosovo in Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia (1945–1980)===
The end of World War II saw Kosovo returning to Yugoslav control. The new socialist government under Josip Broz Tito systematically suppressed nationalism among the ethnic groups throughout Yugoslavia, and established six republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina) as constituent parts of the Yugoslav federation. Tito diluted the power of Serbiathe largest and most populous republicby establishing autonomous governments in the Serbian province of Vojvodina in the north and Kosovo in the south. Until 1963, the region was named the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija and in 1968 it was renamed to the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo.

The period of 1948–1963 in Kosovo was characterized by a brutal crackdown against Albanian nationalists by Aleksandar Ranković and his secret police (the UDBA). In 1955, a state of emergency was declared in order to quell unrest that had purportedly been instigated by terror groups from Albania. Following Ranković&#x27;s ouster in 1966, Tito and his League of Communists Party granted more powers to republics and attempted to improve the political, social and economic situation in Kosovo. In November 1968, large-scale demonstrations took place in Kosovo which were quelled by Yugoslav forces, precipitated by Albanian demands for separate republics in Kosovo and Macedonia. Albanian students and intellectuals pushed for an Albanian-language university and greater representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies.

The University of Pristina was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of University of Belgrade. The lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia hampered Albanian education in Kosovo, so an agreement was struck with Albania itself to supply textbooks.

In 1969 the Serbian Orthodox Church ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of Serbs in Kosovo, seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the interests of Serbs there.

In 1974 Kosovo&#x27;s political status improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with Vojvodina, Kosovo was declared a province and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the federal presidency and its own assembly, police force and national bank. While trying to balance the interests of Albanians and Serbs, this effectively stratified both communities and prompted Serb fears of Kosovo seceding from Yugoslavia. Student demonstrations continued throughout the 1970s, resulting in the imprisonment of many members of the Albanian National Liberation Movement, including Adem Demaçi. The political and administrative changes that began in 1968 resulted in Kosovo Albanians securing complete control over the province&#x27;s political, social and cultural issues as well as growing ties between Kosovo and Albania. However, by 1980, economic impoverishment would become the catalyst for further unrest.

===After the death of Tito (1980–1989)===
Provincial power was still exercised by the League of Communists of Kosovo, but now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito&#x27;s death on 4 May 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo&#x27;s main city, Pristina, when a protest of University of Pristina students over long queues in their university canteen rapidly escalated and in late March and early April 1981 spread throughout Kosovo, causing mass demonstrations in several towns, the 1981 protests in Kosovo. The disturbances were quelled by the Presidency of Yugoslavia proclaiming a state of emergency, sending in riot police and the army, which resulted in numerous casualties.

In 1981 it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards. Serbia reacted with a plan to reduce the power of Albanians in the province and a propaganda campaign that claimed Serbs were being pushed out of the province primarily by the growing Albanian population, rather than the bad state of the economy. 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by Yugoslav police, who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material. Albanian leaders of Kosovo maintained that Serbs were leaving mainly because of the poor economy. The worsening state of Kosovo&#x27;s economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when hiring new employees, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest entity of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635. Due to its comparative poverty it received substantial amounts of Yugoslav development money, leading to quarrels amongst the republics regarding its quantity and utilization.

In February 1982 a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask &quot;why the Serbian Church is silent&quot; and why it did not campaign against &quot;the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo&quot;. In 1985, two Albanian farmers were falsely accused for the Đorđe Martinović incident, which turned into a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in Serbian politics and fueled hatred towards Albanians. In 1987, Aziz Kelmendi, an ethnic-Albanian recruit in the Yugoslav Army (JNA) killed four fellow soldiers in a mass shooting in JNA barracks, with only one of them being an ethnic Serb. Serbian media blamed Albanian nationalism for the event and in response, Yugoslavia sent 400 federal police officers to Kosovo. It was against this tense background that the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986, which concluded that a considerable number had left under pressure from Albanians.

The so-called SANU Memorandum, leaked in September 1986, was a draft document that focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito&#x27;s deliberate hobbling of Serbia&#x27;s power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside Serbia proper. It paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to &quot;physical, political, legal and cultural genocide&quot; in an &quot;open and total war&quot; that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo&#x27;s status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the World war occupations. The Memorandum&#x27;s authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous 20 years and warned that there would soon be none left &quot;unless things changed radically.&quot; The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for &quot;genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established&quot; and &quot;objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created.&quot; It concluded that &quot;Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past.&quot; The SANU Memorandum provoked split reactions: Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at the local level, claiming the Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons, while the Slovenes and Croats saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official Slobodan Milošević.

In April 1987, Serbian President Ivan Stambolić and Slobodan Milošević visited Kosovo with the intention of reducing tensions in the region. A Serb nationalist crowd had gathered near the hall where Milošević was supposed to deliver his speech in Kosovo Polje. The crowd tried to break through the police cordon that was providing security for the gathering, and after clashing with the police, they chanted that Albanian policemen were beating them. Informed of the situation, Milošević walked out of the building and addressed the protesters, telling them &quot;No one will beat you again&quot;. He further called upon the crowd to resist the Albanian pressure to leave Kosovo. This speech marked the beginning of Milošević&#x27;s use of nationalism to gain power, and he was appointed President of the Presidency of Serbia in May 1989.

In November 1988 Kosovo&#x27;s head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989 Milošević announced an &quot;anti-bureaucratic revolution&quot; in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen). Milošević and his government claimed that the constitutional changes were necessary to protect Kosovo&#x27;s remaining Serbs against harassment from the Albanian majority.

===Constitutional amendments (1989–94)===

On 17 November 1988 Kaqusha Jashari and Azem Vllasi were forced to resign from the leadership of the League of Communists of Kosovo (LCK). In early 1989 the Serbian Assembly proposed amendments to the Constitution of Serbia that would remove the word &quot;Socialist&quot; from the Serbian Republic&#x27;s title, establish multi-party elections, remove the independence of institutions of the autonomous provinces such as Kosovo and rename Kosovo as the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. In February Kosovar Albanians demonstrated in large numbers against the proposal, emboldened by striking miners. Serbs in Belgrade protested against the Kosovo Albanian&#x27;s separatism. On 3 March 1989 the Presidency of Yugoslavia imposed special measures assigning responsibility for public security to the federal government. On 23 March the Assembly of Kosovo voted to accept the proposed amendments although most Albanian delegates abstained. In early 1990 Kosovar Albanians held mass demonstrations against the special measures, which were lifted on 18 April 1990 and responsibility for public security was again assigned to Serbia.

On 26 June 1990 Serbian authorities barred access to the building of the Kosovo Assembly, citing special circumstances. On 2 July 1990, 114 ethnic Albanian delegates of the 180-member Kosovo Assembly gathered in front of the closed building and declared Kosovo an independent republic within Yugoslavia. On 5 July the Serbian Assembly dissolved the Kosovo Assembly. Serbia also dissolved the provincial executive council and assumed full and direct control of the province. Serbia took over management of Kosovo&#x27;s principal Albanian-language media, halting Albanian-language broadcasts. On 4 September 1990 Kosovar Albanians observed a 24-hour general strike, virtually shutting down the province. On 5 August 1991, the Serbian Assembly suspended the main Albanian-language daily newspaper, &quot;Rilindja&quot;, declaring its journalism unconstitutional.

On 7 September 1990 the Constitution of Kosovo was promulgated by Albanian members of the disbanded Assembly of Kosovo. Milošević responded by ordering the arrest of the deputies that participated in the meeting. The new controversial Serbian Constitution was promulgated on 28 September 1990. In September 1991, Kosovar Albanians held an unofficial referendum in which they voted overwhelmingly for independence. On 24 May 1992 Kosovar Albanians held unofficial elections for an assembly and president of the Republic of Kosovo and elected Ibrahim Rugova as president.

During this time, the Republic of Kosova started to establish parallel institutions, which were not recognized by Serbia. The presence of Serbian security structures in Kosovo increased considerably and Kosovo was put into constant curfews. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians were fired from government and state-run institutions. By 1990 most Albanian schools were closed and the Serbian government required Albanian teachers to sign loyalty oaths in order to remain employed, effectively asking them to recognize Serbia, and not Republic of Kosova as their country, which the vast majority refused to sign. By 1991 all Albanian schoolteachers and academic staff had been dismissed and a parallel education system was established by the government of the Republic of Kosova, using donated private homes as classrooms. 350,000 Albanians emigrated out of the region due to economic and social pressures over the next seven years, and the Milosevic regime encouraged Serb settlement to the region. United Nations Special Rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki reported on 26 February 1993 that the police had intensified their repression of the Albanian population since 1990, including depriving them of their basic rights, destroying their education system, and conducting large numbers of political dismissals of civil servants.

Milosevic ordered the abolishment of the Academy of Sciences in Kosovo, Albanian street names were changed to Serbian ones, Serbs were allowed to enter the University of Pristina and therefore received preferential treatment, and Albanians were fired from their posts or lost their homes to Serbs (130,000 between 1990-1995).

==Eruption of war==

===The slide to war (1995–1998)===


According to an Amnesty International report in 1998, due to dismissals from the Yugoslav government it was estimated that by 1998 unemployment rate in the Kosovar Albanian population was higher than 70%. The economic apartheid imposed by Belgrade was aimed at impoverishing an already poor Kosovo Albanian population.

In 1996, 16,000 Serb refugees from Bosnia and Croatia were settled in Kosovo by the Milosevic government, sometimes against their will.

Ibrahim Rugova, first President of the Republic of Kosovo pursued a policy of passive resistance which succeeded in maintaining peace in Kosovo during the earlier wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia during the early 1990s. As evidenced by the emergence of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), this came at the cost of increasing frustration among Kosovo&#x27;s Albanian population. In the mid-1990s, Rugova pleaded for a United Nations peacekeeping force for Kosovo.

Continuing repression convinced many Albanians that only armed resistance would change the situation. On 22 April 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in different parts of Kosovo. The KLA, a hitherto-unknown organisation, subsequently claimed responsibility. The nature of the KLA was at first mysterious. It initially seemed that their only goals were to stop repression from Yugoslav authorities. KLA goals also included the establishment of a Greater Albania, a state stretching into surrounding Macedonia, Montenegro and southern Serbia. In July 1998, in an interview for Der Spiegel, KLA spokesman Jakup Krasniqi publicly announced that the KLA&#x27;s goal was the unification of all Albanian-inhabited lands. Sulejman Selimi, a General Commander of KLA in 1998–1999, said:

While Rugova promised to uphold the minority rights of Serbs in Kosovo, the KLA was much less tolerant. Selimi stated that &quot;Serbs who have blood on their hands would have to leave Kosovo&quot;.

The crisis escalated in December 1997 at the Peace Implementation Council meeting in Bonn, where the international community (as defined in the Dayton Agreement) agreed to give the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina sweeping powers, including the right to dismiss elected leaders. At the same time, Western diplomats insisted that Kosovo be discussed and that Yugoslavia be responsive to Albanian demands there. The delegation from Yugoslavia stormed out of the meetings in protest. This was followed by the return of the Contact Group that oversaw the last phases of the Bosnian conflict and declarations from European powers demanding that Yugoslavia solve the problem in Kosovo.

The KLA received financial and material support from the Kosovo Albanian diaspora. In early 1997, Albania collapsed into chaos following the fall of President Sali Berisha. Albanian Armed Forces stockpiles were looted with impunity by criminal gangs, with much of the hardware ending up in western Kosovo and boosting the growing KLA arsenal. Bujar Bukoshi, shadow prime minister in exile (in Zürich, Switzerland), created a group called FARK (Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosova). FARK and the KLA were initially rivals, but later FARK merged into the KLA. The Yugoslav government considered the KLA to be &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;insurgents&quot; who indiscriminately attacked police and civilians, while most Albanians saw the KLA as &quot;freedom fighters&quot;.

On 23 February 1998, the United States Special Envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, stated in Pristina that &quot;the KLA was without any question a terrorist group.&quot; He later told the House Committee on International Relations that &quot;while the KLA had committed &#x27;terrorist acts,&#x27; it had &#x27;not been classified legally by the U.S. Government as a terrorist organization.&#x27;&quot; However, his 23 February statements have been seen as an unwitting &quot;green light&quot; to the Serbian crackdown that followed less than a week later.

===War begins===
KLA attacks intensified, centering on the Drenica valley area with the compound of Adem Jashari being a focal point. Days after Robert Gelbard described the KLA as a terrorist group, Serbian police responded to the KLA attacks in the Likošane area, and pursued some of the KLA to Čirez, resulting in the deaths of 16 Albanian fighters and 26 civilians in the attacks on Likoshane and Çirez. and four Serbian policemen. The KLA&#x27;s goal was to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, and this would shape the first few months of the fighting.

Serb police then began to pursue Adem Jashari and his followers in the village of Donje Prekaze. On 5 March 1998, a massive firefight at the Jashari compound led to the massacre of 60 Albanians, of which eighteen were women and ten were under the age of sixteen. The event provoked massive condemnation from western capitals. Madeleine Albright said that &quot;this crisis is not an internal affair of the FRY&quot;.

On 24 March, Yugoslav forces surrounded the village of Glodjane and attacked a rebel compound there. Despite superior firepower, the Yugoslav forces failed to destroy the KLA unit, which had been their objective. Although there were deaths and severe injuries on the Albanian side, the insurgency in Glodjane was far from stamped out. The village was in fact to become one of the strongest centres of resistance in the upcoming war.

A new Yugoslav government was formed at this time, led by the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Serbian Radical Party. Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman Vojislav Šešelj became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with the country&#x27;s position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.

In early April, Serbia arranged for a referendum on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in the crisis. Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around Deçan and ran a territory based in the village of Glodjane, encompassing its surroundings.

On 21 April 1998, Yugoslav forces started shelling the village of Baballoq. The KLA, composed of 140 volunteers from the village and other KLA soldiers set up a defensive line which stopped the Yugoslav advance. The fighting lasted until August 1998 and started the Frontal War in the Dukagjini region.

On 31 May 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO&#x27;s response to this offensive was mid-June&#x27;s Operation Determined Falcon, a NATO show of force over the Yugoslav borders.

During this time, Yugoslav President Milošević reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who refused to talk to the Serbian side throughout the crisis, but would talk with the Yugoslav government. In fact, the only meeting between Milošević and Ibrahim Rugova happened on 15 May in Belgrade, two days after the special presidential envoy Richard Holbrooke announced that it would take place. Holbrooke threatened Milošević that if he did not obey, &quot;what&#x27;s left of your country will implode&quot;. A month later, Holbrooke visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June, where he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathisers, and to observers in general, that the US was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.

The Yeltsin agreement required Milošević to allow international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo to monitor the situation there. The Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) began operations in early July 1998. The US government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative&#x27;s call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the US demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire &quot;without linkage ... to a cessation in terrorist activities&quot;. 

All through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. The KLA surrounded Peja and Gjakova, and set up an interim capital in the town of Malisheva (north of Rahovec). KLA troops infiltrated Suva Reka and the northwest of Pristina. They moved on to capture the Belaćevac coal pits in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. In July, KLA activity was reported south of Prizren. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on guerrilla and mountain warfare, and harassing and ambushing Yugoslav forces and Serb police patrols.

The tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Rahovec. On 17 July 1998, two nearby villages, Retimlije and Opteruša, were also captured, while less systematic events took place in the larger Serb-populated village of Velika Hoča. The Orthodox monastery of Zočište was looted and torched. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.

A new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo, south of the Pristina-Peja road. In early September, Yugoslav forces began an offensive around Prizren but, despite their advantage in firepower, were unable to capture the KLA stronghold there. In western Kosovo, around Peja, another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.

In early mid-September, for the first time, KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around Podujevo. Finally, in late September, a Yugoslav determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, the threats intensified once again. On 28 September, the mutilated corpses of a family were discovered by KDOM outside the village of Gornje Obrinje. The bloody image of a child&#x27;s doll and streams of displaced persons rallied the international community to action.

====Morale====
Morale was a serious problem for Serb forces; intelligence surveys found that many soldiers disagreed with their comrades&#x27; actions. One tank commander reported, &quot;for the entire time I was in Kosovo, I never saw an enemy soldier and my unit was never once involved in firing at enemy targets. The tanks which cost $2.5 million each were used to slaughter Albanian children... I am ashamed&quot;.

When retreating from Kosovo after NATO intervention, Yugoslav units appeared combat effective with high morale and displaying large holdings of undamaged equipment. Weeks before the end of hostilities, David Fromkin noted that &quot;it seemed possible that NATO unity might crack before Yugoslav morale did.&quot; The announcement by President Clinton that the US would not deploy ground troops gave a tremendous boost to Serbian morale.

===UN, NATO, and OSCE (1998–1999)===

On 9 June 1998, US President Bill Clinton declared a &quot;national emergency&quot; (state of emergency) due to the &quot;unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States&quot; imposed by Yugoslavia and Serbia over the Kosovo War.

On 23 September 1998, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1199. This expressed &#x27;grave concern&#x27; at reports reaching the Secretary General that over 230,000 people had been displaced from their homes by &#x27;the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security forces and the Yugoslav Army&#x27;, demanding that all parties in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cease hostilities and maintain a ceasefire. On 24 September the North Atlantic Council (NAC) of NATO issued an &quot;activation warning&quot; taking NATO to an increased level of military preparedness for both a limited air option and a phased air campaign in Kosovo. The other major issue for those who saw no option but to resort to the use of force was the estimated 250,000 displaced Albanians, 30,000 of whom were out in the woods, without warm clothing or shelter, with winter fast approaching.

Meanwhile, the US Ambassador to the Republic of Macedonia, Christopher Hill, was leading shuttle diplomacy between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. These meetings were shaping the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo. During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO&#x27;s Activation Order being given. NATO was ready to begin airstrikes, and Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milošević. Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that Yugoslavia end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Attempts were made to persuade Milošević to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.

On 13 October 1998, the North Atlantic Council issued activation orders for the execution of both limited air strikes and a phased air campaign in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours. On 15 October the NATO Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October. Difficulties implementing the agreement were reported, as clashes continued between government troops and the guerrillas. The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and Operation Eagle Eye commenced on 30 October.

The KVM was a large contingent of unarmed Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo. Their inadequacy was evident from the start. They were nicknamed the &quot;clockwork oranges&quot; in reference to their brightly coloured vehicles. Fighting resumed in December 1998 after both sides broke the ceasefire, and this surge in violence culminated in the killing of Zvonko Bojanić, the Serb mayor of the town of Kosovo Polje. Yugoslav authorities responded by launching a crackdown against KLA militants.

The January to March 1999 phase of the war brought increasing insecurity in urban areas, including bombings and murders. Such attacks took place during the Rambouillet talks in February and as the Kosovo Verification Agreement unraveled in March. Killings on the roads continued and increased. There were military confrontations in, among other places, the Vushtrri area in February and the heretofore unaffected Kaçanik area in early March.

On 15 January 1999 the Račak massacre occurred when 45 Kosovan Albanians were killed. The bodies had been discovered by OSCE monitors, including Head of Mission William G. Walker, and foreign news correspondents. Yugoslavia denied a massacre took place. The Račak massacre was the culmination of the conflict between the KLA and Yugoslav forces that had continued throughout the winter of 1998–1999. The incident was immediately condemned as a massacre by the Western countries and the United Nations Security Council, and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milošević and his top officials. This massacre was the turning point of the war. NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides. Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, had been subjected to heavy firefights and segregation according to OSCE reports.

===The Rambouillet Conference (January–March 1999)===
On 30 January 1999, NATO issued a statement announcing that the North Atlantic Council had agreed that &quot;the NATO Secretary General may authorise air strikes against targets on FRY territory&quot; to &quot;[compel] compliance with the demands of the international community and [to achieve] a political settlement&quot;. While this was mainly a threat to the Milošević government, it also included a coded threat to the Albanians: any decision would depend on the &quot;position and actions of the Kosovo Albanian leadership and all Kosovo Albanian armed elements in and around Kosovo.&quot;

Also on 30 January 1999, the Contact Group issued a set of &quot;non-negotiable principles&quot; which made up a package known as &quot;Status Quo Plus&quot;effectively the restoration of Kosovo&#x27;s pre-1990 autonomy within Serbia, plus the introduction of democracy and supervision by international organisations. It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the Château de Rambouillet, outside Paris.

The Rambouillet talks began on 6 February 1999, with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by 19 February. The FR Yugoslavian delegation was led by then president of Serbia Milan Milutinović, while Milošević himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 Dayton conference that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milošević negotiated in person. The absence of Milošević was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Yugoslavia as well as abroad; Kosovo&#x27;s Serbian Orthodox bishop Artemije traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time, speculation about an indictment of Milošević for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.

The first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on 23 February 1999 that the negotiations &quot;have led to a &quot;consensus&quot; on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system&quot;. They went on to say that &quot;a political framework is now in place&quot;, leaving the further work of finalising &quot;the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the &quot;invited international&quot; civilian and military presence in Kosovo&quot;. While the Serbs agreed to an autonomous government, free elections, and the release of all political prisoners, the West also insisted on the presence of NATO troops.

While the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Yugoslavs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even Russia (ally of FR Yugoslavia) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking &quot;the will of the people [of Kosovo]&quot; in determining the final status of the province.

On 18 March 1999, the Albanian, US, and British delegations signed what became known as the Rambouillet Accords, while the Yugoslav and Russian delegations refused. The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law. They would have also permitted a continuing Yugoslav army presence of 1,500 troops for border monitoring, backed by up to 1,000 troops to perform command and support functions, as well as a small number of border police, 2,500 ordinary MUP for public security purposes (although these were expected to draw down and to be transformed), and 3,000 local police.

Although the Yugoslav Government cited military provisions of Appendix B of the Rambouillet provisions as the reason for its objections, claiming that it was an unacceptable violation of Yugoslavia&#x27;s sovereignty, these provisions were essentially the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the SFOR (Stabilisation Force) mission there after the Dayton Agreement in 1995. The two sides did not discuss the issue in detail because of their disagreements on more fundamental problems. In particular, the Serb side rejected the idea of any NATO troop presence in Kosovo to replace their security forces, preferring unarmed UN observers. Milošević himself had refused to discuss the annex after informing NATO that it was unacceptable, even after he was asked to propose amendments to the provisions which would have made them acceptable.

After the failure at Rambouillet and the alternative Yugoslav proposal, international monitors from the OSCE withdrew on 22 March, to ensure their safety ahead of the anticipated NATO bombing campaign. On 23 March, the Serbian assembly accepted the principle of autonomy for Kosovo, as well as the non-military aspects of the agreement, but rejected a NATO troop presence.

In a 2009 judgement regarding six former Serb leaders charged with war crimes in Kosovo, the ICTY noted that the causes of the breakdown in the negotiations at Rambouillet were complex and stated that &quot;international negotiators did not take an entirely even-handed approach to the respective positions of the parties and tended to favour the Kosovo Albanians.&quot; It further recorded that, according to a witness, on 14 April 1999, at a meeting initiated by the White House with representatives of the Serbian-American community, President Bill Clinton had stated that &quot;the provision for allowing a referendum for the Albanians in Kosovo went too far and that, if he were in the shoes of Milošević, he probably would not have signed the draft [Rambouillet] agreement either.&quot;

==NATO bombing timeline==


On 23 March 1999 at 21:30 UTC, Richard Holbrooke returned to Brussels and announced that peace talks had failed and formally handed the matter to NATO for military action. Hours before the announcement, Yugoslavia announced on national television it had declared a state of emergency, citing an imminent threat of war and began a huge mobilisation of troops and resources.

On 23 March 1999 at 22:17 UTC, the Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, announced he had directed the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), US Army General Wesley Clark, to &quot;initiate air operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&quot; On 24 March at 19:00 UTC, NATO started its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.

The NATO bombing campaign lasted from 24 March to 11 June 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in Italy and aircraft carriers stationed in the Adriatic. Tomahawk cruise missiles were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. With the exception of Greece, all NATO members were involved to some degree. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II, after the Bosnian War.

The proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as &quot;Serbs out, peacekeepers in, refugees back&quot;. That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defences and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milošević&#x27;s will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was not insignificant, it did not match the intensity of the bombing of Baghdad in 1991.

NATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. Montenegro was bombed on several occasions, but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, Milo Đukanović.

At the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee convoy, believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people. NATO admitted its mistake five days later, and the Yugoslavs accused NATO of deliberately attacking the refugees. A later report conducted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) opined that &quot;civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident&quot;, and that &quot;neither the aircrew nor their commanders displayed the degree of recklessness in failing to take precautionary measures which would sustain criminal charges.&quot; On 7 May, NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists and outraging Chinese public opinion. The United States and NATO later apologised for the bombing, saying that it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the CIA, although this was challenged by a joint report from &quot;The Observer&quot; (UK) and &quot;Politiken&quot; (Denmark) newspapers, which claimed that NATO intentionally bombed the embassy because it was being used as a relay station for Yugoslav army radio signals. The report by the newspaper contradicts findings in the same report by the ICTY which stated that the root of the failures in target location &quot;appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer.&quot; In another incident at the Dubrava prison in Kosovo in May 1999, the Yugoslav government attributed as many as 95 civilian deaths to NATO bombing of the facility after NATO cited Serbian and Yugoslav military activity in the area; a Human Rights Watch report later concluded that at least nineteen ethnic Albanian prisoners had been killed by the bombing, but that an uncertain number – probably more than 70 – were killed by Serbian Government forces in the days immediately following the bombing.

By the start of April, the conflict appeared little closer to a resolution, and NATO countries began to seriously consider conducting ground operations in Kosovo. British prime minister Tony Blair was a strong advocate of ground forces and pressured the United States to agree; his strong stance caused some alarm in Washington as US forces would be making the largest contribution to any offensive. US President Bill Clinton was extremely reluctant to commit US forces for a ground offensive. Instead, Clinton authorised a CIA operation to look into methods to destabilise the Yugoslav government without training KLA troops. At the same time, Finnish and Russian diplomatic negotiators continued to try to persuade Milošević to back down. Tony Blair would order 50,000 British soldiers to be made ready for a ground offensive: most of the available British Army.

Milošević finally recognised that Russia would not intervene to defend Yugoslavia despite Moscow&#x27;s strong anti-NATO rhetoric. He thus accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish–Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.

The Norwegian special forces Hærens Jegerkommando and Forsvarets Spesialkommando cooperated with the KLA in gathering intelligence information. Preparing for an invasion on 12 June, Norwegian special forces worked with the KLA on the Ramno mountain on the border between North Macedonia and Kosovo and acted as scouts to monitor events in Kosovo. Together with British special forces, Norwegian special forces were the first to cross over the border into Kosovo. According to Keith Graves with the television network Sky News, the Norwegians were in Kosovo two days prior to the entry of other forces and were among the first into Pristina. The Hærens Jegerkommando&#x27;s and Forsvarets Spesialkommando&#x27;s job was to clear the way between the contending parties and to make local deals to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.

==Yugoslav army withdrawal and the entry of KFOR==
On 3 June 1999, Milošević accepted the terms of an international peace plan to end the fighting, with the national parliament adopting the proposal amid contentious debate with delegates coming close to fistfights at some points. On 10 June, the North Atlantic Council ratified the agreement and suspended air operations.

On 12 June, after Milošević accepted the conditions, the NATO-led peacekeeping Kosovo Force (KFOR) of 30,000 soldiers began entering Kosovo. KFOR had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. The force was based upon the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General Mike Jackson of the British Army. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a French Army Brigade, a German Army brigade, which entered from the west, while other forces advanced from the south, and Italian Army and United States Army brigades.

The first NATO troops to enter Pristina on the 12th of June 1999 were Norwegian special forces from Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK) and soldiers from the British Special Air Service 22 Regiment, although to NATO&#x27;s diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived at the airport first. Norwegian soldiers were the first to come into contact with Russian troops at the airport. FSK&#x27;s mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties, and to fine-tune the detailed, local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.

The US contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the 1st Armored Division, commanded by Brigadier General Peterson, and was spearheaded by a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attached to the British Forces. Other units included 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) from Stuttgart, Germany and Fort Carson, Colorado, TF 1–6 Infantry (1-6 infantry with C Co 1-35AR) from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the US force was the Greek Army&#x27;s 501st Mechanised Infantry Battalion. The initial US forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future Camp Bondsteel, and Gnjilane, at Camp Monteith, and spent four monthsthe start of a stay which continues to dateestablishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

During the initial incursion, the US soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as US soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages. Although no resistance was met, three US soldiers from the Initial Entry Force were killed in accidents.

On 1 October 1999, approximately 150 paratroopers from Alpha Company, 1/508th Airborne Battalion Combat Team from Vicenza, Italy parachuted into Uroševac as part of Operation Rapid Guardian. The purpose of the mission was primarily to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević of NATO resolve and of its rapid military capability. One US soldier, Army Ranger Sgt. Jason Neil Pringle, was killed during operations after his parachute failed to deploy. The paratroopers of the 1/508th then joined paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and KFOR in patrolling various areas of Kosovo, without incident, through 3 October 1999.

On 15 December 1999, Staff Sergeant Joseph Suponcic of 3rd Battalion/10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was killed, when the HMMWV in which he was a passenger struck an anti-tank mine planted by Albanians and meant for the Russian contingent with which SSG Suponcic&#x27;s team was patrolling in Kosovska Kamenica.

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from Bosnia and Herzegovina and occupied Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO forces. This resulted in an incident during which NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark&#x27;s wish to forcibly block the runways with NATO vehicles, to prevent any Russian reinforcement, was refused by KFOR commander General Mike Jackson.

In 2010, James Blunt described in an interview how his unit was given the assignment of securing Pristina during the advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and how the Russian Army had moved in and taken control of the city&#x27;s airport before his unit&#x27;s arrival. Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt&#x27;s account there was a stand-off with the Russians, and NATO Supreme Commander Clark gave provisional orders to over-power them. Whilst these were questioned by Blunt, they were rejected by General Jackson, with the now famous line, &quot;I&#x27;m not having my soldiers responsible for starting World War III.&quot;

In June 2000, arms trading relations between Russia and Yugoslavia were exposed, which led to retaliation and bombings of Russian checkpoints and area police stations. Outpost Gunner was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of ⅔ Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar system, which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.

==Reaction to the war==

Because of the country&#x27;s restrictive media laws, the Yugoslav media carried little coverage of events in Kosovo, and the attitude of other countries to the humanitarian disaster that was occurring there. Thus, few members of the Yugoslav public expected NATO intervention, instead thinking that a diplomatic agreement would be reached.

===Support for the war===
Support for the Kosovan War and, in particular, the legitimacy of NATO&#x27;s bombing campaign came from a variety of sources. In a 2009 article, David Clark claimed &quot;Every member of NATO, every EU country, and most of Yugoslavia&#x27;s neighbours, supported military action.&quot; Statements from the leaders of United States, Czech Republic and United Kingdom, respectively, described the war as one &quot;upholding our values, protecting our interests, and advancing the cause of peace&quot;, &quot;the first war for values&quot; and one &quot;to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo.&quot; Others included the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who was reported by some sources as acknowledging that the NATO action was legitimate who emphasised that there were times when the use of force was legitimate in the pursuit of peace though Annan stressed that the &quot;[UN Security] Council should have been involved in any decision to use force.&quot; The distinction between the legality and legitimacy of the intervention was further highlighted in two separate reports. One was conducted by the Independent International Commission on Kosovo, entitled &quot;The Kosovo Report&quot;, which found that:

It concluded that &quot;the NATO military intervention was illegal but legitimate&quot;, The second report was published by the NATO Office of Information and Press which reported that, &quot;the human rights violations committed on a large scale in Kosovo provide an incontestable ground with reference to the humanitarian aspect of NATO&#x27;s intervention.&quot; Some critics note that NATO did not have the backing of the United Nations Security Council meant that its intervention had no legal basis, but according to some legal scholars, &quot;there are nonetheless certain bases for that action that are not legal, but justified.&quot;
Aside from politicians and diplomats, commentators and intellectuals also supported the war. Michael Ignatieff called NATOs intervention a &quot;morally justifiable response to ethnic cleansing and the resulting flood of refugees, and not the cause of the flood of refugees&quot; while Christopher Hitchens said NATO intervened only, &quot;when Serbian forces had resorted to mass deportation and full-dress ethnic &#x27;cleansing. Writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Richard A. Falk wrote that, &quot;the NATO campaign achieved the removal of Yugoslav military forces from Kosovo and, even more significant, the departure of the dreaded Serbian paramilitary units and police&quot; while an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that for Mary Kaldor, Kosovo represented a laboratory on her thinking for human security, humanitarian intervention and international peacekeeping, the latter two which she defined as, &quot;a genuine belief in the equality of all human beings; and this entails a readiness to risk lives of peacekeeping troops to save the lives of others where this is necessary.&quot; Reports stated there had been no peace between Albanians and Serbs, citing the deaths of 1,500 Albanians and displacement of 270,000 prior to NATO intervention.

===Criticism of the case for war===
The NATO intervention has been seen as a political diversionary tactic, coming as it did on the heels of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, pointing to the fact that coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the scandal in US news cycles. Herbert Foerstel points out that before the bombing, rather than there being an unusually bloody conflict, the KLA was not engaged in a widespread war against Yugoslav forces and the death toll among all concerned (including ethnic Albanians) skyrocketed following NATO intervention. In a post-war report released by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the organization also noted &quot;the pattern of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24&quot;.

Noam Chomsky argues that the bombing was &quot;not undertaken in “response” to ethnic cleansing and to “reverse” it, as leaders alleged&quot;, but rather that &quot;with full awareness of the likely consequences, Clinton and Blair decided in favor of a war that led to a radical escalation of ethnic cleansing along with other deleterious effects.&quot; Chomsky also notes, similarly to Foerstel, that the number of casualties in the war before the bombing constituted a small number. He concludes that it is impossible to justify the bombing, as there &quot;could be no reasonable expectation of massive ethnic cleansing and violence&quot;. According to Chomsky, the Račak massacre that was considered a turning point for NATO amounted to 45 deaths, a very low number compared to the atrocities committed from both sides after the bombing. According to the International Herald Tribune, &quot;U.S. intelligence reported … that the Kosovo rebels intended to draw NATO into its fight for independence by provoking Serbian forces into further atrocities.&quot;

U.S. President Clinton, his administration and NATO governments were accused of inflating the number of Kosovo Albanians killed by state forces. During the NATO bombing campaign, the then Secretary of Defense, William Cohen claimed that 100,000 Kosovo Albanian men of military age were missing, possibly murdered. The conservative media watchdog group Accuracy in Media charged the alliance with distorting the situation in Kosovo and lying about the number of civilian deaths in order to justify U.S. involvement in the conflict.

After the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of naked aggression, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.

The United Nations Charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the United Nations Security Council; this legal enjoinment has proved controversial with many legal scholars who argue that though the Kosovo War was illegal, it was still legitimate. The issue was brought before the UN Security Council by Russia, in a draft resolution which, &quot;inter alia&quot;, would affirm &quot;that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter&quot;. China, Namibia, and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.

The war inflicted many casualties. Already by March 1999, an estimated 1,500–2,000 civilians and combatants were dead. However, estimates showed that prior to the bombing campaign on 24 March 1999, approximately 1,800 civilians had been killed in the Kosovo war, mostly Albanians but also Serbs and that there had been no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing. By November 1999, 2,108 victims had been exhumed from the province with a total approaching 3,000 expected, but it was unclear how many were civilians and combatants, while the number was also far from the 10,000 minimum civilian death figure cited by Western officials. Final estimates of the casualties are still unavailable for either side.

Perhaps the most controversial deliberate attack of the war was that made against the headquarters of RTS, Serbian public radio and television, on 23 April 1999, which killed at least fourteen people.

Privately, NATO European members were divided about the aims and necessity of the war. Most European allies did not trust the motives of Kosovan Albanians and according to NATO General Wesley Clark, &quot;There was a sense among some that NATO was fighting on the wrong side&quot; in a war between Christians and Muslims.

== Democratic League of Kosovo and FARK ==
The Democratic League of Kosovo (DLK) led by Ibrahim Rugova had been the leading political entity in Kosovo since its creation in 1989. Its parallel government in exile was led by Bujar Bukoshi, and its Minister of Defence until 1998 was the former Yugoslav colonel Ahmet Krasniqi. DLK politicians opposed the armed conflict and were not ready to accept KLA as a political factor in the region and tried to persuade the population not to support it. At one point Rugova even claimed that it was set up by Serbian intelligence as an excuse to invade, or to discredit DLK itself. Nevertheless, the support for KLA even within DLK membership and specifically in the diaspora grew, together with the dissatisfaction with and antagonism toward DLK. KLA initial personnel were members or former members of the DLK. With the changes of the international stance towards KLA and its recognition as a factor in the conflict, DLK&#x27;s position also shifted. The Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosovo, known as FARK, were established in order to place DLK as a military factor in addition to a political one. A parallel paramilitary structure such as FARK was not received well by the KLA.

On 21 September 1998 Ahmet Krasniqi was shot in Tirana. Those responsible were not found, although several theories emerged. The Democratic Party of Albania and its leader Sali Berisha, strong supporters of DLK and FARK, accused SHIK and the Albanian government, which was supporting the KLA, of being responsible. FARK was never a determining factor in the war and was not involved in any battles. It did not number more than few hundred men, and it did not show any commitment to fighting the Serbs, accepting a broader autonomy as a solution rather than independence. Some of the FARK officers were incorporated later under the KLA umbrella. Besides FARK, DLK would also politically and diplomatically oppose KLA and their methods. In a meeting with US President Clinton on 29 May 1999, Rugova, accompanied by Fehmi Agani, Bukoshi, and Veton Surroi, accused KLA of being a left-wing ideology bearer, and some of its leaders as being &quot;nostalgic to known communist figures, such as Enver Hoxha&quot;, referring to the People&#x27;s Movement of Kosovo (LPK) nucleus of KLA, an old underground rival with strong left-wing orientation.

Rugova was present at the negotiations held in Rambouillet and supported the Rambouillet Agreement since the first round, but without any influence. Following the ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population, there was close to a total Albanian support for the NATO campaign, including the DLK side. Surprisingly, Ibrahim Rugova showed up in Belgrade as a guest of Milosevic. At a joint TV appearance on 1 April, ending in a Rugova-Milosevic handshake, Rugova asked for a peaceful solution and the bombings to stop. In the same conference, Millosevic presented his proposal for Kosovo as part of a three-unit federal Yugoslavian state. Rugova&#x27;s presence in Belgrade scattered another set of accusations from KLA and its supporters. Besides being &#x27;passive&#x27; and &#x27;too peaceful&#x27;, Rugova and DLK were accused as &#x27;traitors&#x27;. Following Rugova&#x27;s passage to Italy on 5 May, Rugova claimed that he had been under duress and any &quot;agreement&quot; with Milosovic had no meaning. The general opinion expected the DLK structures and its leader to vanish from the political scene of Kosovo after the Yugoslav withdrawal. Rugova himself stayed out of Kosovo for several weeks, while the prime-minister Bukoshi and other leading membership returned. With only a fraction of Kosovo Albanians participating actively in the war, the support for DLK increased again as a way of opposing the arrogance of many KLA leaders who openly engaged in controlling the economical and political life within the vacuum created right before the deployment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). In the October 2000 local elections, DLK was confirmed as the leading political party.

The feud between KLA and DLK continued in the post-war Kosovo. Many political activists of DLK were assassinated and the perpetrators not found, including Xhemajl Mustafa, Rugova&#x27;s most trusted aide.

==Casualties==

===Civilian losses===
In June 2000, the Red Cross reported that 3,368 civilians (mainly Kosovar Albanians, but with several hundred Serbs, and Roma) were still missing, nearly one year after the conflict, most of whom it concluded had to be &#x27;presumed dead&#x27;.

A study by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia published in 2000 in medical journal the Lancet estimated that &quot;12,000 deaths in the total population&quot; could be attributed to war. This number was achieved by surveying 1,197 households from February 1998 through June 1999. 67 out of the 105 deaths reported in the sample population were attributed to war-related trauma, which extrapolates to be 12,000 deaths if the same war-related mortality rate is applied to Kosovo&#x27;s total population. The highest mortality rates were in men between 15 and 49 (5,421 victims of war) as well as for men over 50 (5,176 victims). For persons younger than 15, the estimates were 160 victims for males and 200 for females. For women between 15 and 49 the estimate is that there were 510 victims; older than 50 years the estimate is 541 victims. The authors stated that it was not &quot;possible to differentiate completely between civilian and military casualties&quot;.

In the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Centre (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Persons, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of war and post-war victims. According to the updated 2015 Kosovo Memory Book, 13,535 people were killed or missing due to the Kosovo conflict, from 1 January 1998 up until December 2000. Of these, 10,812 were Albanians, 2,197 Serbs and 526 Roma, Bosniaks, Montenegrins and others. 10,317 civilians were killed or went missing, of whom 8,676 were Albanians, 1,196 Serbs and 445 Roma and others. The remaining 3,218 dead or missing were combatants, including 2,131 members of the KLA and FARK, 1,084 members of Serbian forces and 3 members of KFOR. As of 2019, the book had been updated to a total of 13,548. In August 2017, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that between 1998 and 1999, more than 6,000 people had gone missing in Kosovo, and that 1,658 remained missing, with neither the person nor the body having, at that time, been found.

====Civilians killed by NATO airstrikes====

Yugoslavia claimed that NATO attacks caused between 1,200 and 5,700 civilian casualties. NATO&#x27;s Secretary General, Lord Robertson, wrote after the war that &quot;the actual toll in human lives will never be precisely known&quot; but he then offered the figures found in a report by Human Rights Watch as a reasonable estimate. This report counted between 488 and 527 civilian deaths (90 to 150 of them killed from cluster bomb use) in 90 separate incidents, the worst of which were the 87 Albanian refugees who perished at the hands of NATO bombs, near Koriša.

====Civilians killed by Yugoslav forces====
Various estimates of the number of killings attributed to Yugoslav forces have been announced through the years. An estimated 800,000 Kosovo Albanians fled and an estimated 7,000 to 9,000 were killed, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The estimate of 10,000 deaths is used by the US Department of State, which cited human rights abuses as its main justification for attacking Yugoslavia.

Statistical experts working on behalf of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prosecution estimate that the total number of dead is about 10,000. Eric Fruits, a professor at Portland State University, argued that the experts&#x27; analyses were based on fundamentally flawed data and that none of its conclusions are supported by any valid statistical analysis or tests.

In August 2000, the ICTY announced that it had exhumed 2,788 bodies in Kosovo, but declined to say how many were thought to be victims of war crimes. KFOR sources told Agence France Presse that of the 2,150 bodies that had been discovered up until July 1999, about 850 were thought to be victims of war crimes.

In an attempt to conceal the corpses of the victims, Yugoslav forces transported the bodies of murdered Albanians deep inside Serbia and buried them in mass graves. According to HLC, many of the bodies were taken to the Mačkatica Aluminium Complex near Surdulica and the Copper Mining And Smelting Complex in Bor, where they were incinerated. There are reports that some bodies of Albanian victims were also burned in the Feronikli plant in Glogovac.

Known mass graves:
* In 2001, 800 still unidentified bodies were found in pits on a police training ground just outside Belgrade and in eastern Serbia.
* At least 700 bodies were uncovered in a mass grave located within a special anti-terrorist police unit&#x27;s compound in the Belgrade suburb of Batajnica.
* 77 bodies were found in the eastern Serbian town of Petrovo Selo.
* 50 bodies were uncovered near the western Serbian town of Peručac.
* A mass grave believed to contain 250 bodies of Albanians killed in the war has been found under a car park in Rudnica near Raška.
* At least 2 bodies, as well as part of the remains of a third body previously found in Rudnica have been found near a mine in the village of Kizevak in southern Serbia. The operation of recovering the bodies is still ongoing.

====Civilians killed by KLA forces====
The KLA abducted and killed Serbian, Roma, and moderate Albanian civilians during and after the war. The exact number of civilians killed by the KLA is not known, though estimates conducted in the initial post-war months listed several hundreds with the targeting of non-Albanians intensifying in the immediate aftermath of KFOR deployment. Although more than 2,500 non-Albanians are believed to have been killed in the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2000, it is not known how many of them were killed by the KLA or affiliated groups.

===NATO losses===
Military casualties on the NATO side were light. According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities as a direct result of combat operations. In the early hours of 5 May, a US military AH-64 Apache helicopter crashed approximately , according to CNN, or , according to the BBC, northeast of Tirana, Albania&#x27;s capital, very close to the border between Kosovo and Albania. The two US pilots of the helicopter, Army Chief Warrant Officers David Gibbs and Kevin L. Reichert, died in that crash. According to NATO statements, they were the only NATO fatalities during the war. However, British radio intercepts of Serbian military communications, said that several French foreign intelligence officers had been killed alongside KLA fighters in a Serbian ambush.

There were other casualties after the war, mostly due to land mines. During the war, the alliance reported the loss of the first US stealth aeroplane (an F-117 Nighthawk) ever shot down by enemy fire. Furthermore, an F-16 fighter was lost near Šabac and 32 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from different nations were lost. The wreckages of downed UAVs were shown on Serbian television during the war. Some US sources claim a second F-117A was also heavily damaged, and although it made it back to its base, it never flew again. A-10 Thunderbolts have been reported as losses, with two shot down and another two damaged. Three US soldiers riding a Humvee in a routine patrol were captured by Yugoslav special forces across the Macedonian border.

===Yugoslav military losses===
At first, NATO claimed to have killed 10,000 Yugoslav troops, while Yugoslavia claimed only 500 had been killed; the NATO investigative teams later corrected it to a few hundred Yugoslav troops killed by air strikes. In 2001, the Yugoslav authorities claimed 462 soldiers were killed and 299 wounded by NATO airstrikes. Later, in 2013, Serbia claimed that 1,008 Yugoslav soldiers and policemen had been killed by NATO bombing. In early June 1999, NATO claimed that 5,000 Yugoslav servicemen had been killed and 10,000 had been wounded during the NATO air campaign. NATO has since revised this estimate to 1,200 Yugoslav soldiers and policemen killed.

Of military equipment, NATO destroyed around 50 Yugoslav Air Force aircraft including 6 MiG-29s destroyed in air-to-air combat. A number of G-4 Super Galebs were destroyed in their hardened aircraft shelter by bunker-busting bombs which started a fire which spread quickly because the shelter doors were not closed. At the end of war, NATO officially claimed that they had destroyed 93 Yugoslav tanks. Yugoslavia admitted a total of 3 destroyed tanks. The latter figure was verified by European inspectors when Yugoslavia rejoined the Dayton accords, by noting the difference between the number of tanks then and at the last inspection in 1995. NATO claimed that the Yugoslav army lost 93 tanks (M-84&#x27;s and T-55&#x27;s), 132 APCs, and 52 artillery pieces. &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the second-largest news weekly magazine in the U.S., gained access to a suppressed US Air Force report that claimed the real numbers were &quot;3 tanks, not 120; 18 armored personnel carriers, not 220; 20 artillery pieces, not 450&quot;. Another US Air Force report gives a figure of 14 tanks destroyed. Most of the targets hit in Kosovo were decoys, such as tanks made out of plastic sheets with telegraph poles for gun barrels, or old World War II–era tanks which were not functional. Anti-aircraft defences were preserved by the simple expedient of not turning them on, preventing NATO aircraft from detecting them, but forcing them to keep above a ceiling of , making accurate bombing much more difficult. Towards the end of the war, it was claimed that carpet bombing by B-52 aircraft had caused huge casualties among Yugoslav troops stationed along the Kosovo–Albania border. Careful searching by NATO investigators found no evidence of any such large-scale casualties.

The most significant loss for the Yugoslav Army was the damaged and destroyed infrastructure. Almost all military air bases and airfields (Batajnica, Lađevci, Slatina, Golubovci and Đakovica) and other military buildings and facilities were badly damaged or destroyed. Unlike the units and their equipment, military buildings could not be camouflaged. thus, defence industry and military technical overhaul facilities were also seriously damaged (Utva, Zastava Arms factory, Moma Stanojlović air force overhaul centre, technical overhaul centres in Čačak and Kragujevac). In an effort to weaken the Yugoslav Army, NATO targeted several important civilian facilities (the Pančevo oil refinery, Novi Sad oil refinery, bridges, TV antennas, railroads, etc.)

===KLA losses===
Around 1,500 Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers were killed, according to KLA&#x27;s own estimates. HLC registered 2,131 KLA and FARK insurgents killed in its comprehensive database.

===Aftermath===

The Yugoslav and Serb forces caused the displacement of between 1.2 million to 1.45 million Kosovo Albanians. After the end of the war in June 1999, numerous Albanian refugees started returning home from neighboring countries. By November 1999, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 848,100 out of 1,108,913 had returned.

According to the 1991 Yugoslavia Census, of the nearly 2 million population of Kosovo in 1991, 194,190 were Serbs, 45,745 were Romani and 20,356 were Montenegrins. According to the Human Rights Watch, 200,000 Serbs and thousands of Roma fled from Kosovo during and after the war. Homes of minorities were burned and Orthodox churches and monasteries were destroyed. The Yugoslav Red Cross had also registered 247,391 mostly Serbian refugees by 26 November. More than 164,000 Serbs left Kosovo during the seven weeks which followed Yugoslav and Serb forces&#x27; withdrawal from, and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) entering Kosovo.

Further inter-ethnic violence took place in 2000, and 2004.

==War crimes==
===By the Federal Yugoslav government===


For the government of Serbia, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is &quot;still regarded as a distressing obligation, the necessary price for joining the European Union&quot;. Religious objects were damaged or destroyed. Of the 498 mosques in Kosovo that were in active use, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) documented that 225 mosques sustained damage or destruction by the Yugoslav Serb army. In all, eighteen months of the Yugoslav Serb counterinsurgency campaign between 1998 and 1999 within Kosovo resulted in 225 or a third out of a total of 600 mosques being damaged, vandalised, or destroyed. During the war, Islamic architectural heritage posed for Yugoslav Serb paramilitary and military forces as Albanian patrimony, with destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage being a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.

Widespread rape and sexual violence by the Serbian army, police and paramilitaries occurred during the conflict and the majority of victims were Kosovo Albanian women, numbering an estimated 20,000. The crimes of rape by the Serb military, paramilitary and police amounted to crimes against humanity and a war crime of torture.

On 27 April 1999, a mass execution of at least 377 Kosovo Albanian civilians, of whom 36 were under 18 years old, was committed by Serbian police and Yugoslav Army forces in the village of Meja near the town of Gjakova. It followed an operation which began after the killing of six Serbian policemen by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The victims were pulled from refugee convoys at a checkpoint in Meja and their families were ordered to proceed to Albania. Men and boys were separated and then executed by the road. It was one of the largest massacres in the Kosovo War.

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević was charged by the UN&#x27;s International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with crimes against humanity and war crimes. In 2001, then-President Vojislav Koštunica &quot;fought tooth and nail&quot; against attempts to put Milošević before an international court but was unable to prevent this happening after further atrocities were revealed.

By 2014, the ICTY issued final verdicts against the indicted Yugoslav officials who were found guilty of deportation, other inhumane acts (forcible transfer), murder and persecutions (crimes against humanity, Article 5), as well as murder (violations of the laws or customs of war, Article 3):
* Nikola Šainović, former deputy prime minister of the FRY, sentenced to 18 years in prison.
* Dragoljub Ojdanić, former Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army, sentenced to 15 years in prison.
* Nebojša Pavković, former Commander of the Third Army of the Yugoslav Army, sentenced to 22 years in prison.
* Vladimir Lazarević, former Commander of the Priština Corps of the Yugoslav Army, sentenced to 14 years in prison.
* Sreten Lukić, former Head of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, sentenced to 20 years in prison.
* Vlastimir Đorđević, former Assistant Minister of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) and Chief of the Public Security Department (RJB) of the MUP, was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
* Milan Milutinović was acquitted of all charges.
* Vlajko Stojiljković committed suicide.
* Slobodan Milošević died before a verdict was reached.

The ICTY found that:
===By Kosovo Albanian forces===

The ICTY convicted KLA commander Haradin Bala for murder, torture and cruel treatment in the Lapušnik prison camp, and sentencted him to 13 years’ imprisonment. Fatmir Limaj and Isak Musliu were acquitted.

In 2008, Carla Del Ponte published a book in which she alleged that, after the end of the war in 1999, Kosovo Albanians were smuggling organs of between 100 and 300 Serbs and other minorities from the province to Albania.

In March 2005, a UN tribunal indicted Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj for war crimes against the Serbs. On 8 March, he tendered his resignation. Haradinaj, an ethnic Albanian, was a former commander who led units of the Kosovo Liberation Army and was appointed prime minister after winning an election of 72 votes to three in the Kosovo&#x27;s Parliament in December 2004. Haradinaj was acquitted on all counts along with fellow KLA veterans Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj. The Office of the Prosecutor appealed their acquittals, resulting in the ICTY ordering a partial retrial. On 29 November 2012 all three were acquitted for the second time on all charges. The trials were rife with accusations of witness intimidation, as media outlets from several different countries wrote that as many as nineteen people who were supposed to be witnesses in the trial against Haradinaj were murdered (the ICTY disputed these reports).

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), &quot;800 non-Albanian civilians were kidnapped and murdered from 1998 to 1999&quot;. After the war, &quot;479 people have gone missing... most of them Serbs&quot;. HRW notes that &quot;the intent behind many of the killings and abductions that have occurred in the province since June 1999 appears to be the expulsion of Kosovo&#x27;s Serb and Roma population rather than a desire for revenge alone. In numerous cases, direct and systematic efforts were made to force Serbs and Roma to leave their homes.&quot; Some 200,000 Serbs and Roma fled Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces.

In April 2014, the Assembly of Kosovo considered and approved the establishment of a special court to try cases involving crimes and other serious abuses committed in 1999–2000 by members of the KLA. Reports of abuses and war crimes committed by the KLA during and after the conflict include massacres of civilians, prison camps, burning and looting of homes and destruction of medieval churches and monuments.

Carla Del Ponte said that the US for political reasons, did not want the ICTY to scrutinise war crimes committed by the KLA. According to her, Madeleine Albright who was the Secretary of State at the time told her to proceed slowly with the investigation of Ramush Haradinaj to avoid unrest in Kosovo.

===By NATO forces===

The Yugoslav government and a number of international pressure groups (e.g., Amnesty International) claimed that NATO had carried out war crimes during the conflict, notably the bombing of the Serbian TV headquarters in Belgrade on 23 April 1999, where 16 people were killed and 16 more were injured. Sian Jones of Amnesty stated, &quot;The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and television was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime&quot;. A report conducted by the ICTY entitled &quot;Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&quot; concluded that, &quot;Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable&quot; and that, &quot;NATO&#x27;s targeting of the RTS building for propaganda purposes was an incidental (albeit complementary) aim of its primary goal of disabling the Serbian military command and control system and to destroy the nerve system and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power.&quot; In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, &quot;unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.&quot;

==International reaction to NATO intervention==

===Africa===
* – Egypt supported NATO intervention in Kosovo and withdrew its ambassador from Belgrade.
* – Libyan Jamahiriya leader, Muammar Gaddafi opposed the campaign and called on world leaders to support Yugoslavia&#x27;s &#x27;legitimate right to defend its freedoms and territorial integrity against a possible aggression.&#x27;

===Asia===
* – Cambodia was against the campaign.
* – China deeply condemned the bombing, saying it was an act of aggression against the Yugoslav people, especially when NATO bombed its embassy in Belgrade on 7 May 1999, riots and mass demonstrations against the governments of the United States and Great Britain were reported against both the attack and the operation overall. Jiang Zemin, the President of the country at the time, called &#x27;once more&#x27; for an immediate halt to the airstrikes and demanded peaceful negotiations.
* – India condemned the bombing. The Indian foreign ministry also stated that it &#x27;urged all military actions to be brought to a halt&#x27; and that &#x27;FR Yugoslavia be enabled to resolve its internal issues internally.&#x27;
* – Indonesia was against the campaign.
* – Israel did not support the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Ariel Sharon criticised NATO&#x27;s bombing as an act of &quot;brutal interventionism&quot;. It was suggested that Sharon may have supported the Yugoslav position because of the Serbian population&#x27;s history of saving Jews during the Holocaust.
* – Jordan supported NATO intervention in Kosovo and withdrew its ambassador from Belgrade.
* – Japan&#x27;s PM Keizō Obuchi advocated the bombing, stating that Yugoslavia had an &#x27;uncompromising attitude.&#x27; Japan&#x27;s foreign minister Masahiko Kōmura said that, &#x27;Japan understands NATO&#x27;s use of force as measures that had to be taken to prevent humanitarian catastrophe.&#x27;
* – Malaysia supported the bombing, stating that it &#x27;was necessary to prevent genocide in Kosovo.&#x27;
* – Pakistan&#x27;s government was concerned about developing situations in Kosovo and called for UN intervention.
* – United Arab Emirates supported NATO intervention in Kosovo. The UAE population gave financial aid, and set up and ran a refugee camp and built an airstrip for incoming relief supplies at Kukës in Northern Albania.
* – Vietnam was against the bombing campaign.

===Europe===
* – Albania strongly supported the bombing campaign. This resulted in the breaking of diplomatic ties between Albania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who accused the Albanian government of harbouring KLA insurgents and supplying them with weapons.
* – Turkey, a NATO member, supported and was involved in the bombing campaign though it expressed hesitation about a ground offensive. The Turkish government stressed that NATO&#x27;s involvement was not about undermining Yugoslav territorial integrity, but about reversing the genocidal policies of the Milošević government. The Turkish population, as a result of historical, cultural, and religious ties to the Balkans felt a responsibility to assist Kosovo Albanians by supporting their government&#x27;s position.
* – Greece took no active part in the NATO campaign and 96% of the Greek population was opposed to the NATO bombings.
* – In France, the bulk of the population supported the action but factions on the far left and far right opposed it.
* – Slobodan Milošević, the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia called the bombings, an &#x27;unlawful act of terrorism&#x27; and the &#x27;key to colonize Yugoslavia&#x27;. The Yugoslav population also strongly opposed the bombing. Milošević stated that, &#x27;the only correct decision that could have been made was the one to reject foreign troops on our territory.&#x27; The Yugoslavs who opposed Milošević also opposed the bombing, saying that it &#x27;supports Milošević rather than attacking him.&#x27;
* – Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder newly elected government supported the NATO campaign; German public opinion was not prepared for a prolonged campaign.
* – The bombing was met with mixed reactions in Italy. Following former prime minister Romano Prodi&#x27;s decision to allow coalition forces to use Italian airbases and military infrastructures, Massimo D&#x27;Alema&#x27;s centre-left government authorised the country&#x27;s participation in the air campaign. The bombing was also supported by Silvio Berlusconi and the centre-right opposition. Domestic opposition to the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia was strong.
* – Russia strongly condemned the campaign. President Boris Yeltsin stated that, &#x27;Russia is deeply upset by NATO&#x27;s military action against sovereign Yugoslavia, which is nothing more than open aggression.&#x27; They also condemned NATO at the United Nations saying that NATO air strikes on Serbia were &#x27;an illegal action.&#x27; Some Russians volunteered to go to Kosovo, not only to fight the KLA, but also to oppose NATO.
* – As a contributor to the bombing, the United Kingdom strongly supported the bombing campaign, as did a majority of the British population.
* – The Polish government sanctioned NATO&#x27;s activities but Poland did not participate in the operation There were demonstrations in Warsaw against the bombing.
* – Bulgaria allowed its airspace to be used by NATO aircraft for attacks. Despite Bulgaria&#x27;s ambitions of joining both NATO and the European Union, the leftist opposition organised street protests in Sofia over the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the public was reportedly deeply divided because of sympathy for their fellow Slavs and Christian Orthodox Serb neighbours but also a desire to join the European Union and NATO. Several NATO missiles and aircraft strayed off course into Bulgaria.
* – Romania allowed NATO planes to use Romanian airspace to strike targets in Serbia. Supporting NATO during the Yugoslav Wars got Romania&#x27;s position as an official NATO member in 2004. However, a overwhelmingy majority of Romanians continued showing support to their historical Orthodox Christian ally Serbia, most Romanian citizens strongly opposed the NATO bombing campaign.

===Oceania===
* – Australia supported the campaign. Prime Minister John Howard stated that, &quot;history has told us that if you sit by and do nothing, you pay a much greater price later on.&quot;

===United Nations===
* – The United Nations had mixed reactions to the bombing, which was carried out without its authorisation. Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General said, &quot;In spite of all the efforts made by the international community, the Yugoslav authorities have persisted in their rejection of a political settlement … it is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed, but there are times when the use of force is legitimate in the pursuit of peace&quot; adding that &quot;the [UN Security] Council should be involved in any decision to resort to the use of force.&quot;

==Military and political consequences==
The Kosovo War had a number of important consequences in terms of the military and political outcome. The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine Kosovo&#x27;s level of autonomy as envisaged under UN Security Council Resolution 1244, but efforts failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its unilateral declaration of independence on 17 February 2008.

The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, had begun in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself. In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes &quot;supervised independence&quot; for the province, which is in contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1244. By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the Security Council, had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty. Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Priština.

The campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the US arsenal, which were later addressed for the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns. Apache attack helicopters and AC-130 Spectre gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were reduced to critically low levels. For combat aircraft, continuous operations resulted in skipped maintenance schedules, and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service. Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with Global Positioning System satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Although pilotless surveillance aircraft were extensively used, often attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led missiles being fitted to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the &quot;sensor to shooter&quot; time to virtually zero.

Kosovo also showed that some low-tech tactics could reduce the impact of a high-tech force such as NATO; the Milošević government cooperated with Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist regime in Iraq, passing on many of the lessons learned in the Gulf War. The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either Soviet or NATO, during the Cold War and had developed tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably used to mislead overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:
* US stealth aeroplanes were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors, they would become visible on the radar screens. The downing of an F-117 Nighthawk by a missile was possibly spotted in this way.
* Dummy targets such as fake bridges, airfields and decoy aeroplanes and tanks were used extensively. Tanks were made using old tires, plastic sheeting and logs, and sand cans and fuel set alight to mimic heat missions. Serbia claims they fooled NATO pilots into bombing hundreds of decoys, though General Clark&#x27;s survey found that in Operation: Allied Force, NATO airmen hit just 25 decoysan insignificant percentage of the 974 validated hits. NATO sources claim that this was due to operating procedures, which oblige troops, in this case aircraft, to engage any and all targets, however unlikely they may be. The targets needed only to look real to be shot at when detected. NATO claimed that the Yugoslav air force was devastated: &quot;Official data show that the Yugoslav army in Kosovo lost 26 percent of its tanks, 34 percent of its APCs, and 47 percent of the artillery to the air campaign.&quot;

== Military decorations ==
As a result of the Kosovo War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization created a second NATO medal, the NATO Medal for Kosovo Service, an international military decoration. Shortly thereafter, NATO created the Non-Article 5 Medal for Balkans service to combine both Yugoslavian and Kosovo operations into one service medal.

Due to the involvement of the United States armed forces, a separate US military decoration, known as the Kosovo Campaign Medal, was established by President Bill Clinton in 2000.

The Kosovo Campaign Medal (KCM) is a military award of the United States Armed Forces established by Executive Order 13154 of President Bill Clinton on 3 May 2000. The medal recognises military service performed in Kosovo from 24 March 1999 through 31 December 2013.

<text>Kent is a ceremonial county in South East England. It is bordered by Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north, the Strait of Dover to the south-east, East Sussex to the south-west, Surrey to the west, and Greater London to the north-west. The county town is Maidstone. 

The county has an area of and had population of 1,875,893 in 2022, making it the fifth most populous county in England. The north of the county contains a conurbation which includes the towns of Chatham, Gillingham, and Rochester. Other large towns are Maidstone and Ashford, and the borough of Canterbury holds city status. For local government purposes Kent consists of a non-metropolitan county, with twelve districts, and the unitary authority area of Medway. The county historically included south-east Greater London, and is one of the home counties. 

The north of Kent is a plain bordering the Thames Estuary. South of this is the North Downs, a chalk downland ridge which crosses the county from north-west to south-east and which forms dramatic chalk cliffs, including the White Cliffs of Dover, where it meets the English Channel. The south-west of the county contains part of the Greensand Ridge and the Weald, the area between the North and South Downs. The south-east of the county contains the low-lying Romney Marsh. The North Downs and High Weald have been designated national landscapes. The geography of the county lends itself to the cultivation of fruit orchards, and it has been nicknamed &quot;the Garden of England&quot;. In north-west Kent, industries include aggregate building material extraction, printing, and scientific research. Coal mining has also played its part in the county&#x27;s industrial heritage.

Kent&#x27;s location between London and the Strait of Dover, the narrowest crossing point between England and mainland Europe, has led to the county being the point of entry for many prominent figures and groups in British history. It was one of the first British territories to be settled by Germanic tribes, most notably the Jutes, following the withdrawal of the Romans. In the 6th century, Saint Augustine landed in the county to begin the conversion of England to Christianity and became the first archbishop of Canterbury; Canterbury Cathedral is now a World Heritage Site. England relied on the county&#x27;s ports to provide warships through much of its history; the Cinque Ports in the 10th–14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th centuries were of particular importance. Dover Castle has been described as the &quot;key of England&quot; due to its strategic significance.

==Etymology==
The name is of Celtic origin, and dates back to at least the 4th century BC. It is one of the earliest names recorded in Britain, known to the Greeks since the explorer Pytheas recorded it as &quot;Kantion&quot; during his voyage around the British Isles in about 325 BC. As such, it has been claimed as the &quot;oldest recorded name still in use in England.&quot;

The meaning has been explained as &#x27;coastal district,&#x27; &#x27;corner-land&#x27; or &#x27;land on the edge&#x27; (Welsh &quot;cant&quot; &#x27;bordering of a circle, tyre, edge;&#x27; Breton &quot;cant&quot; &#x27;circle;&#x27; Dutch &quot;kant&quot; &#x27;side, edge&#x27;). In Latin sources the area is called &quot;Cantia&quot; or &quot;Cantium&quot;, while the Anglo-Saxons referred to it as &quot;Cent&quot;, &quot;Cent lond&quot; or &quot;Centrice&quot;.

==History==
The area was first occupied by early humans, intermittently due to periods of extreme cold, during the Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age), as attested by an early Neanderthal skull found in the quarries at Swanscombe. The Medway megaliths were built during the Neolithic era. There is a rich sequence of Bronze Age, Celtic Iron Age, and Britto-Roman era occupation, as indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup and the Roman villas of the Darent valley.

Julius Caesar described the area as &quot;Cantium&quot;, or the home of the Cantiaci, in 51 BC. The extreme west of the modern county was by the time of Roman Britain occupied by a Celtic Iron Age tribe known as the Regni. Caesar wrote that the people of Kent were &#x27;by far the most civilised inhabitants of Britain&#x27;.

Following the withdrawal of the Romans, large numbers of Germanic speakers from mainland Europe settled in Kent, bringing their language, which came to be Old English. While they expelled the native Romano-British population, some likely remained in the area, eventually assimilating with the newcomers. Of the invading tribes, the Jutes were the most prominent, and the area became a Jutish kingdom recorded as &quot;Cantia&quot; in about 730 and &quot;Cent&quot; in 835. The early medieval inhabitants of the county were referred to as the &quot;Cantwara&quot;, or Kentish people. The city of Canterbury was the largest in Kent.

In 597, Pope Gregory I appointed the religious missionary (who became Saint Augustine of Canterbury after his death) as the first Archbishop of Canterbury. In the previous year, Augustine successfully converted the pagan King Æthelberht of Kent to Christianity. The Diocese of Canterbury became England&#x27;s first Episcopal See with first cathedral and has since remained England&#x27;s centre of Christianity. The second designated English cathedral was for West Kent at Rochester Cathedral.

Kent was traditionally partitioned into East and West Kent, and into lathes and hundreds. The traditional border of East and West Kent was the county&#x27;s main river, the Medway. Men and women from east of the Medway are Men (or Maids) of Kent, those from the west are Kentishmen or Kentish Maids. The divide has been explained by some as originating in the Anglo-Saxon migrations, with Jutes mainly settling east of the Medway and Saxons settling west of it.

In the 11th century, the people of Kent (or &quot;Chenth&quot;, per the Domesday Book) adopted the motto &quot;Invicta&quot;, meaning &quot;undefeated&quot; or &quot;unconquered&quot;. The adoption of this motto followed the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy, as he was unable to subdue the county and they negotiated favourable terms. The continued resistance of the Kentish people against the Normans led to Kent&#x27;s designation as a semi-autonomous county palatine in 1067. Under the nominal rule of William&#x27;s half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the county was granted similar powers to those granted in the areas bordering Wales and Scotland.

During the medieval and early modern period, Kent played a major role in several of England&#x27;s most notable rebellions, including the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, led by Wat Tyler,
Jack Cade&#x27;s Kent rebellion of 1450, and Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion of 1554 against Queen Mary I.

The Royal Navy first used the River Medway in 1547. By the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) a small dockyard had been established at Chatham. By 1618, storehouses, a ropewalk, a drydock, and houses for officials had been built downstream from Chatham.

By the 17th century, tensions between Britain and the powers of the Netherlands and France led to increasing military build-up in the county. Forts were built all along the coast following the raid on the Medway, a successful attack by the Dutch navy on the shipyards of the Medway towns in 1667.

The 18th century was dominated by wars with France, during which the Medway became the primary base for a fleet that could act along the Dutch and French coasts. When the theatre of operation moved to the Atlantic, this role was assumed by Portsmouth and Plymouth, with Chatham concentrating on shipbuilding and ship repair. As an indication of the area&#x27;s military importance, the first Ordnance Survey map ever drawn was a one-inch map of Kent, published in 1801. Many of the Georgian naval buildings still stand.

In the early 19th century, smugglers were very active on the Kent coastline. Gangs such as The Aldington Gang brought spirits, tobacco and salt to the county, and transported goods such as wool across the sea to France.

In 1889, the County of London was created and took over responsibility for local administration of parts of north-west Kent. These included the towns of Greenwich, Woolwich, Plumstead, Deptford, Lee, Eltham, Charlton, and Kidbrooke. In 1900, however, Kent absorbed the district of Penge. Some of Kent is contiguous with the Greater London sprawl, notably parts of Dartford.

Originally, the border between Kent and Sussex (later East Sussex) ran through the towns of Tunbridge Wells and Lamberhurst. In 1894, by the Local Government Act, the parts of these towns that lay in East Sussex were absorbed by Kent.

During the Second World War, much of the Battle of Britain was fought in the skies over Kent.

Between June 1944 and March 1945, more than 10,000 V1 flying bombs, or &quot;Doodlebugs&quot;, were fired towards London from bases in Northern France. Although many were destroyed by aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons, both London and Kent were hit by around 2,500 of these bombs.

After the war, Kent&#x27;s borders changed several more times. In 1965, the London boroughs of Bromley and Bexley were created from nine towns formerly in Kent. In 1998, Rochester, Strood, Chatham, Gillingham and Rainham left the administrative county of Kent to form the Unitary Authority of Medway. Plans for another unitary authority in north-west Kent were dropped, but in 2016 consultations began between five Kent local authorities (Canterbury, Thanet, Dover, Folkestone &amp; Hythe, and Ashford) with a view to forming a new unified authority for East Kent, although remaining within the auspices of Kent County Council. This idea was eventually dropped.
For almost nine centuries, a small part of present-day East London (the North Woolwich, London E16 area), formed part of Kent.

== Geography ==

Kent is in the southeastern corner of England. It borders the Thames Estuary and the North Sea to the north, and the Straits of Dover and the English Channel to the south. France is across the Strait.

The major geographical features of the county are based on a series of ridges and valleys running east–west across the county. These are the results of erosion of the Wealden dome, a dome across Kent and Sussex created by alpine movements 20–10 million years ago. This dome consists of an upper layer of chalk above successive layers of Upper Greensand, Gault Clay, Lower Greensand, Weald Clay, and Wealden sandstone. The ridges and valleys formed when the exposed clay eroded faster than the exposed chalk, greensand, or sandstone.

Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Ashford, and Folkestone are built on greensand, while Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells are built on sandstone. Dartford, Gravesend, the Medway towns, Sittingbourne, Faversham, Canterbury, Deal, and Dover are built on chalk. The easterly section of the Wealden dome has been eroded away by the sea, and cliffs such as the White Cliffs of Dover are present where a chalk ridge known as the North Downs meets the coast. Spanning Dover and Westerham is the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The Wealden dome is a Mesozoic structure lying on a Palaeozoic foundation, which can often create the right conditions for coal formation. This is found in East Kent roughly between Deal, Canterbury, and Dover. The Coal Measures within the Westphalian Sandstone are about deep, and are subject to flooding. They occur in two major troughs, which extend under the English Channel.

Seismic activity has occasionally been recorded in Kent, though the epicentres were offshore. In 1382 and 1580 there were two earthquakes exceeding 6.0 on the Richter Scale. In 1776, 1950, and on 28 April 2007 there were earthquakes of around 4.3. The 2007 earthquake caused physical damage in Folkestone. A further quake on 22 May 2015 measured 4.2 on the Richter Scale. It was centred in the Sandwich area of east Kent at about ten miles below the surface. There was little if any damage reported.
The coastline of Kent is continuously changing, due to tectonic uplift and coastal erosion. Until about 960, the Isle of Thanet was an island, separated by the Wantsum channel, formed around a deposit of chalk; over time, the channels silted up with alluvium. Similarly Romney Marsh and Dungeness have been formed by accumulation of alluvium.

Kent&#x27;s principal river, the River Medway, rises near East Grinstead in Sussex and flows eastwards to Maidstone. Here it turns north and breaks through the North Downs at Rochester, then joins the estuary of the River Thames near Sheerness. The Medway is some long. The river is tidal as far as Allington lock, but in earlier times, cargo-carrying vessels reached as far upstream as Tonbridge. The Medway has captured the head waters of other rivers such as the River Darent. Other rivers of Kent include the River Stour in the east.

A 2014 study found that Kent shares significant reserves of shale oil with other neighbouring counties, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said &quot;will bring jobs and business opportunities&quot; and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area is required to achieve these objectives; it has been opposed by environmental groups.


=== Climate ===
Kent is one of the warmest parts of Britain. On 10 August 2003, in the hamlet of Brogdale near Faversham the temperature reached , at that time the highest temperature ever officially recorded in the United Kingdom. The record still stands as the hottest August day ever recorded.
== Governance ==

Kent County Council and its twelve district councils administer most of the county (3352 km2), whilst the Medway Council administers the more densely populated Medway unitary authority (192 km2), independently of the county council. Together they have around 300 town and parish councils. Kent County Council&#x27;s headquarters are in Maidstone, while Medway&#x27;s offices are at Gun Wharf, Chatham.

For most of its history since the local government reforms instituted by the Local Government Act 1972, Kent County Council has been under Conservative Party control; the exception was between 1993 and 1997 when the party came under no overall control with Labour Party leadership. At the most recent county council election in 2021, the Conservatives won 62 out of 81 seats. Also elected were seven Labour councillors, six Liberal Democrats, four from the Green Party, one Swale Independent and one residents&#x27; association representative.

Of Kent&#x27;s thirteen districts, two are under Conservative control (Sevenoaks, Dartford), four are under Labour control (Gravesham, Medway, Thanet, Dover), one is under Liberal Democrat control (Tunbridge Wells), and six are under no overall control and are administered by coalitions (Tonbridge and Malling, Maidstone, Swale, Ashford, Canterbury, Folkestone and Hythe). Notably, Thanet is the only council in the United Kingdom to have come under UK Independence Party (UKIP) control, which it did in 2015.

At the national level, Kent is represented in the House of Commons by eighteen Members of Parliament (MPs). The county has historically been dominated by the Conservative Party at general elections. Prior to 2024, the party had won a majority of Kentish seats in every election since the local government reforms of 1974, including during Labour&#x27;s landslide victories of 1997 and 2001. In both 2010 and 2015, the Conservatives won every seat in the county. The 2024 election saw a sharp decline in support for the Conservatives, and the county is currently represented by eleven Labour MPs, six Conservatives and one Liberal Democrat.



==Demography==

At the 2011 census, Kent, including Medway, had 1,727,665 residents (18.0% of which in Medway); had 711,847 households (17.5% of which in Medway) and had 743,436 dwellings (14.8% of which in Medway). 51.1% of Kent&#x27;s population excluding Medway was female — as to Medway, this proportion was 50.4%.

The tables below provide statistics for the administrative county of Kent, that is, excluding Medway.


==Economy==

At the 2001 UK census, employment statistics for the residents in Kent, including Medway, were as follows: 41.1% in full-time employment, 12.4% in part-time employment, 9.1% self-employed, 2.9% unemployed, 2.3% students with jobs, 3.7% students without jobs, 12.3% retired, 7.3% looking after home or family, 4.3% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.7% economically inactive for other reasons. Of residents aged 16–74, 16% had a higher education qualification or the equivalent, compared to 20% nationwide.

The average hours worked per week by residents of Kent were 43.1 for males and 30.9 for females. Their industry of employment was 17.3% retail, 12.4% manufacturing, 11.8% real estate, 10.3% health and social work, 8.9% construction, 8.2% transport and communications, 7.9% education, 6.0% public administration and defence, 5.6% finance, 4.8% other community and personal service activities, 4.1% hotels and restaurants, 1.6% agriculture, 0.8% energy and water supply, 0.2% mining, and 0.1% private households. This is higher than the whole of England for construction and transport/communications and lower for manufacturing.

Kent is sometimes known as the &quot;Garden of England&quot; for its abundance of orchards and hop gardens. In particular the county produces tree-grown fruits, strawberries and hazelnuts. Distinctive hop-drying buildings called oasts are common in the countryside, although many have been converted into dwellings. Nearer to London, market gardens also flourish. Kent is the main area for hazelnut production in the UK.

However, in recent years, there has been a significant drop in agriculture, and industry and services are increasing their utilisation of the area. This is illustrated by the following table of economic indicator gross value added (GVA) between 1995 and 2003 (figures are in £ millions):


North Kent is heavily industrialised, with cement-making at Northfleet and Cuxton, brickmaking at Sittingbourne, shipbuilding on the Medway and Swale, engineering and aircraft design and construction at Rochester, chemicals at Dartford, papermaking at Swanley, and oil refining at Grain. There is a steel mini mill in Sheerness and a rolling mill in Queenborough. There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, although the older one, Dungeness A, built in 1965, was decommissioned in 2006.

Cement-making, papermaking, and coal-mining were important industries in Kent during the 19th and 20th centuries. Cement came to the fore in the 19th century when massive building projects were undertaken. The ready supply of chalk and huge pits between Stone and Gravesend bear testament to that industry. There were also other workings around Burham on the tidal Medway. Chalk, gravel and clay were excavated on Dartford Heath for centuries.

Kent&#x27;s original paper mills stood on streams like the River Darent, tributaries of the River Medway, and on the River Stour. Two 18th century mills were on the River Len and at Tovil on the River Loose. In the late 19th century huge modern mills were built at Dartford and Northfleet on the River Thames and at Kemsley on The Swale. In pre-industrial times, almost every village and town had its own windmill or watermill, with over 400 windmills known to have stood at some time. Twenty-eight survive within the county today, plus two replica mills and a further two in that part of Kent now absorbed into London. All the major rivers in the county were used to power watermills.

From about 1900, several coal pits operated in East Kent. The Kent Coalfield was mined during the 20th century at several collieries, including Chislet, Tilmanstone, Betteshanger, and the Snowdown Colliery, which ran from 1908 to 1986.

The west of the county (including Tunbridge Wells, Tonbridge, and Sevenoaks) has less than 50% of the average claimant count for low incomes or worklessness as the coastal districts of Dover, Folkestone and Hythe, and Thanet (chiefly three resorts: Ramsgate, Broadstairs, and Margate). West and Central Kent have long had many City of London commuters.

==Culture==

===Architecture===

Kent&#x27;s geographical location between the Straits of Dover and London has influenced its architecture, as has its Cretaceous geology and its good farming land and fine building clays. Kent&#x27;s countryside pattern was determined by a gavelkind inheritance system that generated a proliferation of small settlements. There was no open-field system, and the large tracts were owned by the two great abbeys, Christ Church, Canterbury and St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, that did not pass into the hands of the king during the Reformation. Canterbury Cathedral is the United Kingdom&#x27;s metropolitan cathedral; it was founded in AD 598 and displays architecture from all periods. There are nine Anglo-Saxon churches in Kent. Rochester Cathedral is England&#x27;s second-oldest cathedral, the present building built in the Early English Style. These two dioceses ensured that every village had a parish church.

The sites of Richborough Castle and Dover Castle, along with two strategic sites along Watling Street, were fortified by the Romans and the Dukes of Kent. Other important sites include Canterbury city walls and Rochester Castle. There remained a need to defend London and thus Kent. Deal Castle, Walmer Castle, Sandown Castle (whose remains were eroded by the sea in the 1990s) were constructed in late mediaeval times, and HM Dockyard, at Chatham and its surrounding castles and forts—Upnor Castle, Great Lines, and Fort Amherst—more recently.

Kent has three unique vernacular architecture forms: the oast house, the Wealden hall house, and Kentish peg-tiles.

Kent has bridge trusts to maintain its bridges, and though the great bridge (1387) at Rochester was replaced there are medieval structures at Aylesford, Yalding and Teston. With the motorways in the late twentieth century came the M2 motorway bridge spanning the Medway and the Dartford tunnel and the Dartford Bridge spanning the Thames.

===Literature and publishing===
Kent has provided inspiration for several notable writers and artists. Canterbury&#x27;s religious role gave rise to Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, a key development in the English language. The father of novelist Charles Dickens worked at the Chatham Dockyard; in many of his books, the celebrated novelist featured the scenery of Chatham, Rochester, and the Cliffe marshes. During the late 1930s, Nobel Prize-awarded novelist William Golding worked as a teacher at Maidstone Grammar School, where he met his future wife Ann Brookfield. William Caxton, who first introduced the printing press to England, was born in Kent; the recent invention was key in helping many Kent dialect words and spellings to become standard in English. Lord Northbourne hosted a biodynamic agriculture conference on his estate at Betteshanger in the summer of 1939, he coined the term &#x27;organic farming&#x27; and published his manifesto of organic agriculture the following year spawning a global movement for sustainable agriculture and food.

===Classical music===
Many notable musicians have been associated with Kent. Walter Galpin Alcock, composer and organist, who played the organ at the coronations of Edward VII, George V and George VI, was born at Edenbridge in 1861. Richard Rodney Bennett, composer and pianist, was born at Broadstairs in 1936. Alfred Deller, counter-tenor singer, was born at Margate in 1912. Orlando Gibbons, composer and organist, died in Canterbury on 5 June 1625 and is buried in the cathedral. George Frideric Handel took the waters at Royal Tunbridge Wells in 1734 and 1735. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, together with his father, mother and sister, stayed at Bourne Park House near Canterbury, 25-30 July 1765. The nights of 24 and 30 July were spent in Canterbury, where they also went to the horse races. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, then an 18-year-old sea cadet, was anchored at Gravesend from November 1862 to February 1863; while there, he completed the slow movement of his First Symphony. Malcolm Sargent, conductor, was born at Ashford in 1895. Thomas Tallis, composer and organist, was a lay clerk of Canterbury Cathedral around 1541-2. Peter Warlock, composer and writer on music, and Ernest John Moeran, composer, resided at Eynsford from 1925 to 1928; Arnold Bax, William Walton and Constant Lambert visited them here. Percy Whitlock, organist and composer, was born at Chatham in 1903. 

===Visual arts===
A number of significant artists came from Kent, including Thomas Sidney Cooper, a painter of landscapes, often incorporating farm animals, Richard Dadd, a maker of faery paintings, and Mary Tourtel, the creator of the children&#x27;s book character, Rupert Bear. The artist Clive Head was also born in Kent. The landscape painter J. M. W. Turner spent part of his childhood in the town of Margate in East Kent, and regularly returned to visit it throughout his life. The East Kent coast inspired many of his works, including some of his most famous seascapes. Kent has also been the home to artists including Frank Auerbach, Tracey Emin and Stass Paraskos.

Kent was also the location of the largest number of art schools in the country during the nineteenth century, estimated by the art historian David Haste, to approach two hundred. This is believed to be the result of Kent being a front line county during the Napoleonic Wars. At this time, before the invention of photography, draughtsmen were used to draw maps and topographical representations of the fields of battle, and after the wars ended many of these settled permanently in the county in which they had been based. Once the idea of art schools had been established, even in small towns in Kent, the tradition continued, although most of the schools were very small one-man operations, each teaching a small number of daughters of the upper classes how to draw and make watercolour paintings. Nonetheless, some of these small art schools developed into much larger organisations, including Canterbury College of Art, founded by Thomas Sidney Cooper in 1868, which is today the University for the Creative Arts.

Blean near Canterbury was home to Smallfilms, the production company founded by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin and responsible for children&#x27;s TV favourites Noggin the Nog, Ivor the Engine and Bagpuss.

===Performing arts===
The county&#x27;s largest theatre is the Marlowe Theatre in the centre of Canterbury.

Music festivals that take place in Kent include Chilled in a Field Festival, Electric Gardens, Hop Farm Festival, In the Woods Festival, Lounge On The Farm and the annual Smugglers Festival near Deal. Other venues for live music include Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone and the Assembly Hall in Tunbridge Wells.

=== Kentish independence ===
Kentish people have long viewed themselves as Kentish first and British second, and to this day refer to themselves as either &#x27;Men of Kent&#x27; or &#x27;Kentish men&#x27; depending on whether they live to the East or West of the River Medway. After the 2016 Brexit referendum and subsequent proposals for &quot;border checks&quot; on the Kentish border, effectively making Kent a country within a country, this pride in being Kentish began to form into calls from some areas for an independent Kent or an autonomous republic within the UK, especially from the county&#x27;s prominent newspapers, with the idea being discussed in detail in some areas – with some ideas such as mock passports and tongue-in-cheek manifestos being created. These calls for independence can be explained by the individualistic and rebellious mentality that has always existed in the county, which can be explained by the county&#x27;s position in the very south-east of the United Kingdom, having been a prominent and independent kingdom for centuries as well as being the source of many major rebellions that have occurred in the United Kingdom.

==Transport==
===Roads===
With the Roman invasion, a road network was constructed to connect London to the Channel ports of Dover, Lympne and Richborough. The London–Dover road was Watling Street. These roads are now approximately the A2, B2068, A257, and the A28. The A2 runs through Dartford (A207), Gravesend, Rochester, Canterbury, and Dover; the A20 through Eltham, Wrotham, Maidstone, Charing, Ashford. Hythe, Folkestone and Dover; the A21 around Sevenoaks, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and on to Hastings in East Sussex. In the 1960s, two motorways were built; the M2 from Medway to Faversham, and the M20 from Swanley to Folkestone. Part of the M25 runs through Kent, from Westerham to the Dartford Crossing. The M26 motorway, built in 1980, provides a short link between the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near Wrotham. Kent currently has more motorways by distance than any other county in the UK, with sections of the M2, M20, M25 and M26 totalling within the extents of the ceremonial county.

In the run-up to Britain leaving the European Union, Government minister Michael Gove confirmed that the Government intended to impose a &quot;de facto&quot; border between Kent and the rest of England for freight lorries, in order to deal with expected lorry queues of 7,000 or more at Folkestone, Dover and other ports. Heavy goods vehicle operators need to apply for a 24-hour Kent Access Permit (KAP) to take a vehicle of 7.5 tonnes or more into Kent if their intention is to cross to the EU via Dover or the Eurotunnel.

===Water===
The medieval Cinque Ports, except for the Port of Dover, have all now silted up. The Medway Estuary has been an important port and naval base for 500 years. The River Medway is tidal up to Allington and navigable up to Tonbridge. Kent&#x27;s two canals are the Royal Military Canal between Hythe and Rye, which still exists, and the Thames and Medway Canal between Strood and Gravesend. Built-in 1824, it was purchased in 1846 by the railways, which partially backfilled it. Container ports are at Ramsgate and Thamesport. Following the closures across the lower Medway, and the Swale to the Isle of Sheppey, during the 20th century, the Woolwich Ferry is the only domestic ferry that runs in the broadest definition of the county.

===Railways===

The earliest locomotive-driven passenger-carrying railway in Britain was the Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway which opened in 1830. This and the London &amp; Greenwich Railway later merged into South Eastern Railway (SER).
By the 1850s, SER&#x27;s networks had expanded to Ashford, Ramsgate, Canterbury, Tunbridge Wells, and the Medway towns. SER&#x27;s major London termini were London Bridge, Charing Cross, and Cannon Street. Kent also had a second major railway, the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway. Originally the East Kent Railway in 1858, it linked the northeast Kent coast with London terminals at Victoria and Blackfriars.

The two companies merged in 1899, forming the South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway, further amalgamated with other railways by the Railways Act 1921 to form the Southern Railway. Britain&#x27;s railways were nationalised in 1948, forming British Railways. The railways were privatised in 1996 and most Kent passenger services were franchised to Connex South Eastern. Following financial difficulties, Connex lost the franchise and was replaced by South Eastern Trains and after Southeastern.

The Channel Tunnel was completed in 1994 and High Speed 1 in November 2007 with a London terminus at St Pancras. A new station, Ebbsfleet International, opened between Dartford and Gravesend, serving northern Kent. The high speed lines will be utilised to provide a faster train service to coastal towns like Ramsgate and Folkestone. This station is in addition to the existing station at Ashford International, which has suffered a massive cut in service as a result.
In addition to the &quot;main line&quot; railways, there are several light, heritage, and industrial railways in Kent. There are three heritage, standard gauge railways; Spa Valley Railway near Tunbridge Wells on the old Tunbridge Wells West branch, East Kent Railway on the old East Kent coalfield area and the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway on the Weald around Tenterden. In addition, there is the gauge, Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway on the southeast Kent coast along the Dungeness peninsula. Finally, there is the , industrial Sittingbourne &amp; Kemsley Light Railway, previously the Bowaters Paper Railway.

===Air===
Charter flights are provided by Lydd Airport at Lydd.

In 2002, it was revealed that the government was considering building a new four-runway airport on the marshland near the village of Cliffe on Hoo Peninsula. This plan was dropped in 2003 following protests by cultural and environmental groups. However further plans for a Thames Estuary Airport on the Kent coast have subsequently emerged, including the Thames Hub Airport, again sited on the Isle of Grain and designed by Lord Foster, and the London Britannia Airport plan, colloquially known as &quot;Boris Island&quot; due to its being championed by the former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, which would see a six runway airport built on an artificial island to be towards the Shivering Sands area, north-east of Whitstable.
Both of these options were dropped in 2014 in favour of expansion at either Gatwick or Heathrow Airport, the latter finally being the chosen option following Theresa May&#x27;s installation as Prime Minister in summer 2016.

Manston Airport, located near the village of Manston in the Thanet district, was a former RAF facility that also handled some civilian flights. It closed in 2014.

==Education==

Kent has four universities: Canterbury Christ Church University with campuses throughout East Kent; University of Kent, with campuses in Canterbury and Medway; University of Greenwich (a London University), with sites at Woolwich, Eltham, London and Medway; the University for the Creative Arts (UCA) also has three of its five campuses in the county.

Although much of Britain adopted a comprehensive education system in the 1970s, Kent County Council (KCC) and Medway Unitary Authority are among around fifteen
local authorities still providing wholly selective education through the eleven-plus examination with students allocated a place at a secondary modern school or at a grammar school.

Together, the two Kent authorities have 38 of the 164 grammar schools remaining in Britain.

Kent County Council has the largest education department of any local council in Britain,
providing school places for over 289,000 pupils.

In 2005–06, Kent County Council and Medway introduced a standardised school year, based on six terms, as recommended by the Local Government Association in its 2000 report, &quot;The Rhythms of Schooling&quot;.

Kent County Council Local Education Authority maintains 96 secondary schools, of which 33 are selective schools and 63 are secondary modern schools.

Music education is provided by Kent Music (formerly Kent Music School), which has its origins in the 1940s. Kent Music provides services across the county including Kent County Youth Orchestra, Kent Youth Choirs, and an annual summer school at Benenden School.

===National Challenge schools===
In 2010, Kent had the highest number of National Challenge schools in England: schools which are branded &#x27;failing&#x27; based on the British Government&#x27;s floor targets that 30% of pupils achieve at least 5 GCSE grades A* to C. Of the 63 secondary modern schools, 33 missed this target; thus 52% of Kent secondary modern schools (34% out of all 96 maintained secondary schools) are &#x27;failing&#x27;.

==Sport==
In association football, Kent&#x27;s highest ranked football team is Gillingham FC (nicknamed &#x27;The Gills&#x27;) who play in Football League Two, having been demoted at the end of the 2021–22 season. Maidstone United was a Football League side from 1989 until going bankrupt in 1992. Kent clubs in the higher levels of non-league football include Ebbsfleet United, who were promoted in 2023. Tonbridge Angels and the current incarnation of Maidstone United currently play in National League South, the sixth tier of the English football pyramid.

Kent is represented in cricket by Kent County Cricket Club. The club was a founder member of the County Championship in 1890 and has won the competition, the major domestic first-class cricket competition, seven times. The club is based at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury and also plays matches at the Nevill Ground in Royal Tunbridge Wells and the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. The Kent Women cricket team has won the Women&#x27;s County Championship seven times since it was established in 1997. Cricket has traditionally been a popular sport in the county and Kent is considered one of the locations in which the game first developed. Teams have represented the county since the early 18th century. The Kent Cricket League is the top level of club competition within Kent and features teams from throughout the county, including areas such as Beckenham and Bexley which were formerly part of the county.

Canterbury Hockey Club and Holcombe Hockey Club both play in the top division in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s England Hockey Leagues. Sevenoaks Hockey Club&#x27;s women first XI plays in the second tier of national competition.

The Invicta Dynamos, based in Gillingham, are a semi-professional ice hockey team that plays in the National Ice Hockey League. They replaced the Medway Bears as the senior team in 1997. They share the home ice rink at Planet Ice Gillingham with the secondary senior team, Invicta Mustangs and the ladies ice hockey team, the Invicta Dynamics.

In rugby union, Tonbridge Juddians and Canterbury RFC play in the fourth-tier of English rugby in the National League 2 South. Gravesend RFC play in the seventh-tier London 2 South-East. Blackheath FC, a club within the historic boundaries of the county, play in fourth-tier National League 2 South. Both Tonbridge Juddians and Blackheath RFC played in National league 1 (the third-tier of English rugby) up until the end of the 2021–2022 season.

In motorsport, the Brands Hatch circuit near Swanley has played host to a number of national and international racing events and hosted 12 runnings of the British Grand Prix in various years between 1964 and 1986.

There have been multiple American football teams based in Kent since the game was popularised in the UK. Currently, the Canterbury is the home of the East Kent Mavericks, the 2023 BAFA National Leagues Southern Football Conference 2 Champions, as well as teams from both universities.

Kent is home to two National League netball clubs, both based in northwest Kent: Telstars (Premier Division 2) and KCNC (Premier Division 3).

In basketball, the Kent Panthers participate in Division 3 of the National Basketball League.

The 2021–2022 season has seen three Kentish clubs demoted from the third-tier of their respective sports to the fourth-tier, with rugby clubs Tonbridge Juddians and Blackheath RFC being demoted in rugby and Gillingham FC being demoted in football.

==News and media==

===Television===

Kent is served by the BBC&#x27;s South East region, which is based in Tunbridge Wells and provides local news for the county and East Sussex. Its commercial rival is ITV Meridian Ltd, which has a newsroom at The Maidstone Studios despite the main studio being based in Hampshire. Main transmitters providing these services are at West Hougham, near Dover and Blue Bell Hill, between Chatham and Maidstone. A powerful relay transmitter at Tunbridge Wells serves the town and surrounding area. Those parts of Kent closest to London such as Swanley, Westerham, Dartford, Gravesend, and Sevenoaks lie within the ITV London and BBC London areas, taking their television signals from the Crystal Palace transmitter.

===Radio===
Kent has two county-wide stations – BBC Radio Kent, based in Tunbridge Wells; and the commercial station KMFM, owned by the KM Group. KMFM previously consisted of seven local stations which covered different areas of the county (and are still technically seven different licences) but have shared all programming since 2012

The county&#x27;s first commercial station was originally known as Invicta FM and began broadcasting in 1984. After various buyouts, the station was rebranded into Heart Kent in 2009 as part of the Heart Network. The station was closed and merged with several other Heart stations in the south of England in 2019 to form Heart South, with the Kent studios in Whitstable closing and production moving to Fareham in Hampshire.
