<text>The Kerguelen Islands ( or ; in French commonly &#x27; but officially&#x27;, ), also known as the Desolation Islands (&quot;&quot; in French), are a group of islands in the sub-Antarctic region. They are among the most isolated places on Earth, with the closest territory being the Heard Island and McDonald Islands territory of Australia located at roughly , and the nearest inhabited territory being Madagascar at more than in distance. The islands, along with Adélie Land, the Crozet Islands, Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands, and France&#x27;s Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean, are part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands and are administered as a separate district.

The islands constitute one of the two exposed parts of the Kerguelen Plateau (the other being Heard Island and the McDonald islands), a large igneous province mostly submerged in the southern Indian Ocean. The main island, Grande Terre, is in area, about three-quarters of the size of Corsica, and is surrounded by a further 300 smaller islands and islets, forming an archipelago of . The climate is harsh and chilly with frequent high winds throughout the year. The surrounding seas are generally rough and they remain ice-free year-round. There are no indigenous inhabitants, but France maintains a permanent presence of 45 to 100 soldiers, scientists, engineers, and researchers. There are no airports on the islands, so all travel to and from the outside world is by ship.

== History ==
Before being officially catalogued in 1772, the Kerguelen Islands appear as the &quot;Ile de Nachtegal&quot; on Philippe Buache&#x27;s 1754 map entitled &quot;Carte des Terres Australes comprises entre le Tropique du Capricorne et le Pôle Antarctique où se voyent les nouvelles découvertes faites en 1739 au Sud du Cap de Bonne Esperance&quot; (&#x27;Map of the Southern Lands contained between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Pole, where the new discoveries made in 1739 to the south of the Cape of Good Hope may be seen&#x27;). It is possible this early name was after Abel Tasman&#x27;s ship &quot;De Zeeuwsche Nachtegaal&quot;. On the Buache map, &quot;Ile de Nachtegal&quot; is located at 43°S, 72°E, about 6° north and 2° east of the accepted location of Grande Terre.

The islands were officially discovered by the French navigator Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec on 12 February 1772. The next day, Charles de Boisguehenneuc landed and claimed the island for the French crown. Yves de Kerguelen organised a second expedition in 1773 and arrived at the &quot;baie de l&#x27;Oiseau&quot; by December 1773. On 6 January 1774 he commanded his lieutenant, Henri Pascal de Rochegude, to leave a message notifying any passers-by of the two passages and of the French claim to the islands.

Thereafter, a number of expeditions briefly visited the islands, including the third voyage of Captain James Cook in December 1776. Cook verified and confirmed the passage of de Kerguelen by discovering and annotating the message left by the French navigator, calling it &quot;Kerguelen Land&quot; in his honor.

Soon after its discovery, the archipelago was regularly visited by whalers and sealers (mostly British, American, and Norwegian) who hunted the resident populations of whales and seals to the point of near extinction, including fur seals in the 18th century and elephant seals in the 19th century. The sealing era lasted from 1781 to 1922 during which time 284 sealing visits are recorded, nine of which ended when the vessel was wrecked. Modern industrial sealing, associated with whaling stations, occurred intermittently between 1908 and 1956. Since the end of the whaling and sealing era, most of the islands&#x27; species have been able to increase their population again. Relics of the sealing period include try pots, hut ruins, graves and inscriptions.

In 1800, the spent eight months sealing and whaling around the islands. During this time Captain Robert Rhodes, her master, prepared a chart of the islands. That vessel returned to London in April 1801 with 450 tons of sea elephant oil.

In 1825, the British sealer John Nunn and three crew members from &quot;Favourite&quot; were shipwrecked on Kerguelen until they were rescued in 1827 by Captain Alexander Distant during his hunting campaign.

The islands were not completely surveyed until the Ross expedition of 1840.

The Australian James Kerguelen Robinson (1859–1914) was the first human born south of the Antarctic Convergence, on board the sealing ship &quot;Offley&quot; in Gulf of Morbihan (Royal Sound then), Kerguelen Island on 11 March 1859.

In 1874–1875, British, German, and U.S. expeditions visited Kerguelen to observe the transit of Venus. For the 1874 transit, George Biddell Airy of the U.K. Royal Observatory organised and equipped five expeditions to different parts of the world. Three of these were sent to the Kerguelen Islands and led by Stephen Joseph Perry, who set up his main observation station at Observatory Bay and two auxiliary stations, one at Thumb Peak led by Sommerville Goodridge, and the second at Supply Bay, led by Cyril Corbet. Observatory Bay was also used by the German Antarctic Expedition, led by Erich Dagobert von Drygalski in 1902–1903. In January 2007, an archaeological excavation was carried out at this site.

In 1877 the French started a coal mining operation, but soon abandoned it.

In 1892, due to German operations in the area, France sent the aviso &quot;Eure&quot;, under Commander Lieutard, to reassert its claim over the Kerguelen Islands, the islands of Amsterdam and St. Paul, and the Crozet Archipelago. In 1924, it was decided to administer these territories (in addition to that portion of Antarctica claimed by France and known as Adélie Land) from Madagascar; as with all Antarctic territorial claims, France&#x27;s possession on the continent is held in abeyance until a new international treaty is ratified that defines each claimant&#x27;s rights and obligations.

In 1908, the French explorer Raymond Rallier du Baty made a privately funded expedition to the island. His autobiographical account of the adventure (&quot;15,000 Miles in a Ketch&quot;. Thomas Nelson and Sons: London, 1917) describes the months that he spent surveying the island and hunting seals to finance his expedition.

The German auxiliary cruiser called at Kerguelen during December 1940. During their stay the crew performed maintenance and replenished their water supplies. This ship&#x27;s first fatality of the war occurred when a sailor, Bernhard Herrmann, fell while painting the funnel. He is buried in what is sometimes referred to as &quot;the southernmost German war grave&quot; of World War II.

Kerguelen has been continually occupied since 1950 by scientific research teams, with a population of 50 to 100 personnel frequently present. There is also a French satellite tracking station.

Until 1955, the Kerguelen Islands were administratively part of the French Colony of Madagascar and Dependencies. That same year, they collectively became known as &#x27; (French Southern and Antarctic Lands) and were administratively part of the French &#x27;. In 2004 they were permanently transformed into their own entity (keeping the same name) but having inherited another group of five very remote tropical islands, &quot;&quot;, which are also ruled by France and are dispersed widely throughout the southern Indian Ocean.

==Grande Terre==

The main island of the archipelago is called &quot;&quot;. It measures east to west and north to south.

Port-aux-Français, a scientific base, is along the eastern shore of the Gulf of Morbihan on La Grande Terre. Facilities there include scientific-research buildings, a satellite tracking station, dormitories, a hospital, a library, a gymnasium, a pub, and the chapel of Notre-Dame des Vents.

The highest point is Mont Ross in the Gallieni Massif, which rises along the southern coast of the island and has an elevation of . The Cook Ice Cap (), France&#x27;s largest glacier with an area of about , lies on the west-central part of the island. Overall, the glaciers of the Kerguelen Islands cover just over . Grande Terre has also numerous bays, inlets, fjords, and coves, as well as several peninsulas and promontories. The most important ones are listed below:

* Courbet Peninsula
* Rallier du Baty Peninsula
* Péninsule Gallieni
* Péninsule Loranchet
* Péninsule Jeanne d&#x27;Arc
* Presqu&#x27;île Ronarc&#x27;h
* Presqu&#x27;île de la Société de Géographie
* Presqu&#x27;île Joffre
* Presqu&#x27;île du Prince de Galles
* Presqu&#x27;île du Gauss
* Presqu&#x27;île Bouquet de la Grye
* Presqu&#x27;île d&#x27;Entrecasteaux
* Presqu&#x27;île du Bougainville
* Presqu&#x27;île Hoche

===Notable localities===
There are also a number of notable localities, all on La Grande Terre (see also the main map):

* Anse Betsy (Betsy Cove) is a former geomagnetic station on Baie Accessible (Accessible Bay), on the north coast of the Courbet Peninsula. On this site an astronomical and geomagnetic observatory was erected on 26 October 1874 by a German research expedition led by Georg Gustav Freiherr von Schleinitz. The primary goal of this station was the 1874 observation of the transit of Venus.
* Armor (Base Armor), established in 1983, is located west of Port-aux-Français at the bottom of Morbihan Gulf, for the acclimatization of salmon to the Kerguelen islands.
* Baie de l&#x27;Observatoire (Observatory Bay) is a former geomagnetic observation station, just west of Port-Aux-Français, on the eastern fringe of the Central Plateau, along the northern shore of the Golfe du Morbihan.
* Cabane Port-Raymond is a scientific camp at the head of a fjord cutting into the Courbet Peninsula from the south.
* Cap Ratmanoff is the easternmost point of the Kerguelens.
* La Montjoie is a scientific camp on the south shore of Baie Rocheuse, along the northwestern coast of the archipelago.
* Molloy (Pointe Molloy) is a former observatory west of the present-day Port-Aux-Français, on the northern shore of the Golfe du Morbihan (Kerguelen). An American expedition led by G. P. Ryan erected a station at this site on 7 September 1874. That station was also established to observe the 1874 transit of Venus.
* Port Bizet is a seismographic station on the northeastern coast of Île Longue. This also serves as the principal sheep farm for the island&#x27;s resident flock of Bizet sheep.
* Port Christmas is a former geomagnetic station on Baie de l&#x27;Oiseau, in the extreme northwest of the Loranchet Peninsula. It was named by Captain James Cook, who re-discovered the islands and who anchored there on Christmas Day, 1776. This is also the place where Captain Cook coined the name &quot;Desolation Islands&quot; in reference to what he saw as a sterile landscape.
* Port Couvreux, a former whaling station, experimental sheep farm, and geomagnetic station is on Baie du Hillsborough, on the southeast coast of Presqu&#x27;île Bouquet de la Grye. Starting in 1912, sheep were raised here to create an economic base for future settlement. However, the attempt failed and the last inhabitants had to be evacuated, and the station abandoned, in 1931. The huts remain, as well as a graveyard with five anonymous graves. These are those of the settlers who were unable to survive in the harsh environment.
* Port Curieuse, a harbor on the west coast across Île de l&#x27;Ouest, was named after the ship &quot;La Curieuse&quot;, which was used by Raymond Rallier du Baty on his second visit to the islands (1913–14).
* Port Douzième (Twelfth Port) is a hut and former geomagnetic station on the southern shore of the Golfe du Morbihan.
* Port Jeanne d&#x27;Arc is a former whaling station founded by a Norwegian whaling company in 1908, and a former geomagnetic station, and lies in the northwestern corner of Presqu&#x27;île Jeanne d&#x27;Arc, looking across the Buenos Aires passage to Île Longue ( northeast). The derelict settlement consists of four residential buildings with wooden walls and tin roofs, and a barn. One of the buildings was restored in 1977, and another in 2007.

From 1968 to 1981, a site just east of Port-aux-Français was a launching site for sounding rockets, some for French (Dragon rockets), American (Arcas) or French-Soviet (Eridans) surveys, but at the end mainly for a Soviet program (M-100).

==Islands==
The following is a list of the most important adjacent islands:

* Île Foch in the north of the archipelago, at , the second most important offlier in the Kerguelens.
* Île Saint-Lanne Gramont, is to the west of Île Foch in the Golfe Choiseul. It has an area of . Its highest point reaches .
* Île du Port, also in the north in the Golfe des Baleiniers is the fourth largest satellite island with an area of . Near its centre it reaches an elevation of .
* Île de l&#x27;Ouest (west coast, about )
* Île Longue (southeast, about )
* Îles Nuageuses (northwest, including île de Croÿ, île du Roland, îles Ternay, îles d&#x27;Après)
* Île de Castries
* Îles Leygues (north, including île de Castries, île Dauphine)
* Île Violette
* Île Australia (also known as &quot;Île aux Rennes&quot; – &quot;Reindeer Island&quot;) (western part of the Golfe du Morbihan, area , elevation )
* Île Haute (western part of the Golfe du Morbihan, elevation )
* Île Mayès
* Îles du Prince-de-Monaco (south, in the Audierne bay)

* Île Altazin (a small island in the Swains Bay)
* Île Gaby (a small island in the Swains Bay)
* Île de Croÿ (a small island off the coast of Grande Terre)
* Île du Roland (a small island off the coast of Grande Terre)

==Economy==

Principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus on scientific research, mostly earth sciences and biology.

The former sounding rocket range to the east of Port-aux-Français is currently the site of a SuperDARN radar.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station, located east of Port-aux-Français. CNES needed a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, but foreign, place like Australia or New Zealand.

Agricultural activities were limited until 2007 to raising sheep (about 3,500 Bizet sheep, a breed that is rare in mainland France) on Longue Island for consumption by the occupants of the base, as well as small quantities of vegetables in a greenhouse within the immediate vicinity of the main French base. There are also feral rabbits and sheep that can be hunted, as well as wild birds.

There are also five fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island (a &quot;department&quot; of France about north) who are licensed to fish within the archipelago&#x27;s exclusive economic zone.

==Geology==

The Kerguelen Islands form an emerged part of the submerged Kerguelen Plateau, which has a total area nearing . The plateau was built by volcanic eruptions associated with the Kerguelen hotspot, and now lies on the Antarctic Plate.

The major part of the volcanic formations visible on the islands is characteristic of an effusive volcanism, which caused a trap rock formation to start emerging above the level of the ocean 35 million years ago. The accumulation is of a considerable amount; basalt flows, each with a thickness of three to ten metres, stacked on top of each other, sometimes up to a depth of . This form of volcanism creates a monumental relief shaped as stairs of pyramids.

Other forms of volcanism are present locally, such as the strombolian volcano Mont Ross, and the volcano-plutonic complex on the Rallier du Baty Peninsula. Various veins and extrusions of lava such as trachytes, trachyphonolites, and phonolites are common all over the islands.

No eruptive activity has been recorded in historic times, but some fumaroles are still active in the south-west of Grande-Terre island.

Fossilized wood found in the islands has been identified as Araucarians and Cypresses, showing that the islands were once forested with conifers. While an exact date for these wood fragments is unknown, they have been tentatively described as being from the early Cenozoic. The presence of these species may suggest that Kerguelen&#x27;s prehistoric flora may have been similar to the Antarctic flora found across the southern hemisphere. 

Glaciation caused the depression and tipping phenomena which created the gulfs at the north and east of the archipelago. Erosion caused by the glacial and fluvial activity carved out the valleys and fjords; erosion also created conglomerate detrital complexes, and the plain of the Courbet Peninsula.

The islands are part of a submerged microcontinent called the Kerguelen Subcontinent. The microcontinent emerged substantially above sea level for three periods between 100 million years ago and 20 million years ago. The so-called Kerguelen Subcontinent may have had tropical flora and fauna about 50 million years ago. The Kerguelen Subcontinent finally sank 20 million years ago and is now below sea level. Kerguelen&#x27;s sedimentary rocks are similar to ones found in Australia and India, indicating they were all once connected. Scientists hope that studying the Kerguelen sub-continent will help them discover how Australia, India, and Antarctica broke apart.

==Climate==
Kerguelen&#x27;s climate is oceanic, cold, and extremely windswept. Under the Köppen climate classification, Kerguelen&#x27;s climate is considered to be an &quot;ET&quot; or tundra climate, which is technically a form of polar climate, as the average temperature in the warmest month is below . Comparable climates include the Aleutian Islands, Campbell Island (New Zealand), Iceland, northern Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia), Labrador (Canada), and Wollaston Islands (Chile).

All climate readings come from the Port-aux-Français base, which has one of the more favourable climates in Kerguelen because of its proximity to the coast and its location in a gulf sheltered from the wind.

The average annual temperature is with an annual range of around . The warmest months of the year include January and February, with average temperatures between . The coldest month of the year is August with an average temperature of . Annual high temperatures rarely surpass , while temperatures in winter have never been recorded below at sea level.

Kerguelen receives frequent precipitation, with snow throughout the year as well as rain. Port-aux-Français receives a modest amount of precipitation ( per annum) compared to the west coast which receives an estimated three times as much precipitation per year.

The mountains are frequently covered in snow but can thaw very quickly in rain. Over the course of several decades, many permanent glaciers have shown signs of retreat, with some smaller ones having disappeared completely.

The west coast receives almost continuous wind at an average speed of because the islands are between the Roaring Forties and the Furious Fifties. Wind speeds of are common and can even reach .

Waves up to high are common, but there are many sheltered places where ships can anchor.

==Flora and fauna==

The islands are part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra ecoregion that includes several subantarctic islands. Plant life is mainly limited to grasses, mosses, and lichens, although the islands are also known for the indigenous, edible Kerguelen cabbage, a good source of vitamin C to mariners. The main indigenous animals are insects along with large populations of ocean-going seabirds, seals, and penguins.

The wildlife is particularly vulnerable to introduced species; one particular problem has been cats. The main island is the home of a well-established feral cat population, descended from ships&#x27; cats. They survive on sea birds and the feral rabbits that were introduced to the islands. There are also populations of wild sheep (&quot;Ovis orientalis orientalis&quot;) and reindeer.

In the 1950s and 1960s, French geologist Edgar Albert de la Rue began to introduce several species of salmonids. Of the seven species introduced, only brook trout and brown trout survived to establish wild populations.

===Coleoptera===
* Carabidae
** [introduced]
* Weevil
** &quot;Palirhoeus eatoni&quot; [native]
* Hydraenidae
** [endemic]

== In popular culture ==
The islands appear in a number of fictional works:

* In &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s only complete novel, the crew of the &quot;Jane Guy&quot; alights at Kerguelen Island before eventually pushing on towards the South Pole.
* French writer Jules Verne&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Le Sphinx des glaces&quot; (&quot;An Antarctic Mystery&quot;) offers a follow-up to Poe&#x27;s book, and revisits the Kerguelen Islands, with the first chapter being entitled &quot;Les Îles Kerguelen.&quot; 
* The 1874 short story &quot;The Tachypomp&quot; by Edward Page Mitchell tells of a hole through the center of the Earth with one end in the United States and the other in &quot;Kerguellen&#x27;s Land&quot;.

<text>Kahlúa () is a brand of coffee liqueur owned by the Pernod Ricard company and produced in Veracruz, Mexico. The drink contains rum, sugar, and arabica coffee.

==History==
Pedro Domecq began producing Kahlúa in 1936. It was named Kahlúa, meaning &#x27;House of the Acolhua people&#x27; in the Veracruz Nahuatl language. Jules Berman was the first importer of the liqueur to the United States, earning him the nickname &quot;Mr. Kahlua&quot;.

The company merged in 1994 with Allied Lyons to become Allied Domecq. In turn, that company was partially acquired in 2005 by Pernod Ricard, the largest spirits distributor in the world since its merger with the Swedish Vin &amp; Sprit in March 2008.

Since 2004, the alcohol content of Kahlúa is 20.0%; earlier versions had 26.5%. In 2002, a more expensive, high-end product called &quot;Kahlúa Especial&quot; became available in the United States, Canada and Australia after previously being offered only in duty-free markets. Made with arabica coffee beans grown in Veracruz, Mexico, Kahlúa Especial has an alcohol content of 36%, has a lower viscosity, and is less sweet than the regular version.

In 2021, Kahlúa introduced a new bottle design for the United Kingdom market. It also reduced the alcohol content to 16% &quot;to address &#x27;evolving&#x27; consumer trends towards conscious drinking and lower-alcohol options&quot;. For the United States market, Kahlúa retains the more traditional bottle design and alcohol content.

==Uses==
Kahlúa is used to make cocktails or drink neat or on ice. Some people use it when baking desserts, and/or as a topping for ice cream, cakes, and cheesecakes.

It is mixed in several ways, often with different combinations of milk, cream, coffee and cocoa.

Because Kahlúa is made from coffee beans, it contains caffeine. According to the company, &quot;Kahlúa contains about 100ppm caffeine, which means about 100mg/litre of product. So, for a standard 1.5oz [45ml] drink of Kahlúa there would be about 5mg of caffeine. Just to put it in perspective, an 8oz [240ml] brewed coffee can contain up to about 200mg of caffeine.&quot;

Kahlúa is a key ingredient in several notable cocktails:

*Alfonso Xiii 
*Espresso Martini
*White Russian
*Black Russian
*Mind Eraser
*B-52
*Baby Guinness
*Kahlúa Sour
*Moose Milk
*Mudslide
*Spanish coffee
*Dirty Mother
==Awards==

Kahlúa and Kahlúa Especial have received accolades from international spirit ratings organizations. The San Francisco World Spirits Competition awarded the Kahlúa Especial three silver medals between 2005 and 2007 and a bronze in 2009. The Beverage Testing Institute gave the Especial a score of 85 in 2007.

<text>Allen Kelsey Grammer (born February 21, 1955) is an American actor, comedian, and producer. He gained fame for his role as the psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; (1984–1993) and its spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; (1993–2004, and again from 2023 to 2024). At more than 20 years on-air, this is one of the longest-running roles played by a single live-action actor in primetime television history. He has received numerous accolades including a total of six Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Tony Award.

Grammer, having trained as an actor at Juilliard and the Old Globe Theatre, made his professional acting debut as Lennox in the 1981 Broadway revival of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. The following year, he portrayed Cassio acting opposite Christopher Plummer and James Earl Jones in &quot;Othello&quot;. In mid-1983, he acted alongside Mandy Patinkin in the original off-Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;. He has since starred in the leading roles in productions of both &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

On film, he is known for his role as Dr. Hank McCoy / Beast in the superhero films &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Marvels&quot; (2023). His other roles include &quot;Down Periscope&quot; (1996), &quot;The Pentagon Wars&quot; (1998), and &quot;Swing Vote&quot; (2008). He is also known for his voice roles in &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997), &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), and as Sideshow Bob in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1990–present). He took guest roles in the sitcoms &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2010–2012), &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; (2016), and &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2017). For his performance as the corrupt mayor in the Starz political series &quot;Boss&quot; (2011–2012), he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama.

In early 2010, Grammer returned to Broadway in the musical revival of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, where he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical. In mid-2016, Grammer won a Tony Award for Best Musical as producer of a musical revival of &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. In early 2019, he starred as Don Quixote in a production of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; at the London Coliseum. In late 2023, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described Grammer as one of &quot;the finest actors&quot; of his generation. He was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in mid-2001.

== Early life, family and education ==
Kelsey Grammer was born on Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Grammer&#x27;s mother, Sally Cranmer (1928–2008), was a dancer who performed under the name of Sally Sullivan. His father, Frank Allen Grammer Jr. was a musician who owned a coffee shop, Greer&#x27;s Place; and owned and edited a magazine, &quot;Virgin Islands View&quot;. Kelsey had a younger sister, Karen, and four half-siblings from his father&#x27;s second marriage.

Grammer&#x27;s personal life has been shaped by many family tragedies. Following his parents&#x27; divorce, Grammer was raised in New Jersey by his mother and maternal grandparents, Gordon and Evangeline Cranmer. The family later relocated to Pompano Beach, Florida. Shortly after, when Grammer was twelve years old, his grandfather died of cancer. In 1968, his father was murdered in Saint Thomas during a wave of racial violence following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In 1975, his sister was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, by spree killer Freddie Glenn. In 1980, his two teenage half-brothers died in a scuba diving accident.

Grammer attended Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was there that he first began to sing and perform on stage. Grammer later won a scholarship to study drama at the Juilliard School, where he was a member of Group 6 from 1973 to 1975. However, after his sister&#x27;s murder, Grammer failed to attend classes and was eventually expelled.

Grammer described himself as &quot;a Caribbean kid&quot;, and he enjoys vacationing in the Bahamas, the US Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Islands.

== Career ==
=== 1977–1983: Theatre work and early roles ===
After leaving Juilliard, Grammer had a three-year internship with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego in the late 1970s before a stint in 1980 at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Grammer acted as the Burglar in the LA production of the George Bernard Shaw play &quot;Too True to Be Good&quot; in 1977. In 1980 he starred in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. He made his Broadway debut in 1981 as &quot;Lennox&quot; in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, taking the lead role when Philip Anglim withdrew after receiving negative reviews. Grammer then played Michael Cassio in the 1982 Broadway revival of &quot;Othello&quot;, alongside James Earl Jones and Christopher Plummer. That same year he portrayed Codename Lazar in the Public Theatre production of the David Hare play &quot;Plenty&quot;. In 1983, he performed in the demo of the Stephen Sondheim–James Lapine production &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;, starring Mandy Patinkin.

=== 1984–1993: Breakthrough with &quot;Cheers&quot; ===
In 1984, Grammer first appeared as Dr. Frasier Crane in the NBC sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. Grammer&#x27;s Broadway co-star and former Juilliard classmate, Mandy Patinkin, suggested Grammer to the New York casting director. He was supposed to appear for only six episodes, but ended up as a regular cast member. The character of Frasier first appears in the third season and continues to appear until the final season of the series in May 1993. Frasier Crane also had a crossover appearance in the 1992 &quot;Wings&quot; episode &quot;Planes, Trains, &amp; Visiting Cranes&quot;.

Grammer has provided the voice of Sideshow Bob on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, starting in the 1990 episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot;. He won a fifth Emmy Award for his work in the episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot;. Bob has appeared in twenty-two episodes of the show, the most recent being 2023&#x27;s &quot;Treehouse of Horror XXXIV&quot;.

From April to June 1992, he played the title role in &quot;Richard II&quot;, staged at the Mark Taper Forum at the Los Angeles Music Center.

=== 1993–2004: Stardom and acclaim with &quot;Frasier&quot; ===

In September 1993, the character became the protagonist of spin-off &quot;Frasier.&quot; In the show, Frasier has moved from Boston to Seattle and works as a radio psychiatrist alongside his producer Roz (Peri Gilpin). In addition to starring, Grammer also directed more than 30 episodes, and sang the closing theme &quot;Tossed Salads and Scrambled Eggs&quot;. In 2001, he negotiated a $700,000-per-episode salary for &quot;Frasier&quot;. The show was nominated for, and won, numerous awards during its 11-year run, concluding in May 2004. The show met instant success, and received five Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series. This record has never been broken, with &quot;Modern Family&quot; tying the record. Grammer himself received 10 Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his role in &quot;Frasier&quot;, winning four times, tying him with Carroll O&#x27;Connor, Michael J. Fox and Jim Parsons for the most wins for Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. His 20-year run playing Dr. Frasier Crane (in both &quot;Cheers&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;) ties a length set by James Arness in playing Marshal Matt Dillon on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; from 1955 to 1975, but it was surpassed by Richard Belzer in playing Det. John Munch on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; since 1993. Then, in February 2021, it was announced that Grammer would reprise the character in a revival set to air on the streaming service Paramount+.

In 1995, Grammer voiced Dr. Frankenollie in the Mickey Mouse short &quot;Runaway Brain&quot;, and it was nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He later starred in the lead role as Lt. Commander Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Dodge in the film &quot;Down Periscope&quot; (1996), and voiced Vladimir &quot;Vlad&quot; Vasilovich in the 20th Century Fox&#x27;s critically acclaimed animated movie &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997). In 1999, Grammer voiced the main antagonist Stinky Pete in Pixar&#x27;s Golden Globe Award-winning &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999). He also provided voice work for several other animated television series and direct-to-video films, such as &quot;Barbie of Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Bartok the Magnificent&quot;, the title character in the short-lived animated series &quot;Gary the Rat,&quot; and the narrator of &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;. He also voiced Dr. Ivan Krank in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (2004). In 2004, he played Ebenezer Scrooge in the musical television film &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

Grammer&#x27;s voice has been featured in many commercials. In 1998, he appeared in a commercial for Honey Nut Cheerios, where he voices the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood. Since 2006, Grammer has provided the voice for television commercials advertising Hyundai. In 2008, Grammer reprised his role of Dr. Frasier Crane in a commercial for Dr Pepper (&quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot; co-star Bebe Neuwirth also reprised her role as Lilith Sternin in the same commercial, albeit in voice only). In 2000, Grammer again played &quot;Macbeth&quot; on Broadway, in a production that closed after only 10 days.

=== 2005–present ===
In 2005, Grammer produced an American adaptation of the British show &quot;The Sketch Show&quot;, which aired on Fox. The main cast consisted of Malcolm Barrett, Kaitlin Olson, Mary Lynn Rajskub and Paul F. Tompkins, as well as Lee Mack from the British version of the show. Grammer appeared in only short opening and closing segments in each episode. Many of the sketches from the British version were re-created. Only six episodes of the show were made, and it was cancelled after just four of them had aired. In 2007, Grammer starred with Patricia Heaton in the American sitcom &quot;Back to You&quot;, which Fox cancelled after its first season. His next lead role, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Hank&quot;, was cancelled after only five episodes had aired. Grammer later commented, &quot;Honestly, it just wasn&#x27;t very funny.&quot;

On April 18, 2010, Grammer made his Broadway musical debut playing the role of Georges in a revival of the Jerry Herman/Harvey Fierstein musical &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; at the Longacre Theatre. Grammer starred alongside Douglas Hodge for which they both were nominated for Tony Awards for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Grammer was said to have been &quot;delivering an assured and charming leading turn.&quot; In 2011 and 2012, Grammer found temporary success in the Starz drama series &quot;Boss&quot; as a fictional mayor of Chicago, based on former mayor Richard J. Daley. It premiered in October 2011. It was his first dramatic TV series. At the 2012 Golden Globe Awards Grammer won the award for Best Actor in a Television Series Drama for his role. The show ran for 18 episodes over two seasons. From 2010 to 2012, Grammer guest starred as a comical version of himself in three episodes of the NBC show &quot;30 Rock&quot; alongside Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer.

In 2011, he was originally announced to provide the voice of Henry J. Waternoose III in the prequel to Monsters, Inc.: Monsters University, and he was meant to replace James Coburn, following Coburn&#x27;s death in 2002. The character, however, got cut from the film.
In 2014, Grammer came back to sitcom television when he appeared in &quot;Partners&quot; with comedian Martin Lawrence. The Lionsgate-produced show was written and executive produced by Robert L. Boyett and Robert Horn, known for writing hit shows like &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Living Single&quot;, &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, and &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. Despite this, the show was cancelled after its first season. Later that same year, Grammer starred in several films such as Bonaparte in &quot;The Expendables 3&quot; (2014) and as Harold Attinger in &quot;&quot; (2014). He appeared as both the narrator and Herod the Great, in the National Geographic TV film &quot;Killing Jesus.&quot; In 2015 Grammer and John Lithgow lent their voices to the critically acclaimed documentary &quot;Best of Enemies&quot; as William F. Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal, respectively. The documentary surrounds the events around the televised debates between intellectuals Vidal and Buckley during the 1968 United States presidential election. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and was shortlisted for the Academy Award for Best Documentary but did not make the final cut.

In March 2015, Grammer originated the roles of Charles Frohman and Captain Hook in the Broadway premiere of the musical &quot;Finding Neverland,&quot; continuing with the roles through June. In February 2016 he made an appearance in the West End production of &quot;Big Fish&quot;. In 2016, Grammer won a Tony Award as a producer of &quot;The Color Purple&quot;. In 2019, Grammer starred as Don Quixote in a production of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; at the London Coliseum. That same year he starred as Harry Hamilton in the Netflix film &quot;Like Father&quot; (2018), alongside Kristen Bell, and as a detective opposite Nicolas Cage in &quot;Grand Isle&quot; (2019).

Grammer reprised his role as Frasier Crane in the 2023 revival of &quot;Frasier&quot; on Paramount+. The show was renewed for a second season with Peri Gilpin from the original series returning for a recurring role.

== Personal life ==
Grammer has been married four times, and has seven children and one grandchild, Emmett. His first marriage, to a dance instructor, Doreen Alderman, lasted from 1982 to 1990, although they were separated for the last six years of that period. They have one daughter, the actress Spencer Grammer (born October 9, 1983). Through Spencer, Grammer has one grandson, born on October 10, 2011.

After his divorce from Alderman, Grammer had a daughter, Kandace Greer Grammer (born February 15, 1992), with a hair and makeup stylist, Barrie Buckner. Kandace was later a cast member on MTV&#x27;s show &quot;Awkward.&quot;

His second marriage, to Leigh-Anne Csuhany in September 1992, lasted one year. When Csuhany was three months pregnant, Grammer filed for an annulment and evicted her from their home; Grammer claimed she was abusive and fired a gun at him. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.

In 1994, he met 28-year-old Tammi Baliszewski at a bar in Manhattan Beach, California. In December 1994, they appeared together on the cover of &quot;People&quot; magazine, announcing their engagement and Grammer&#x27;s substance abuse problems.

In August 1997, Grammer married the dancer and model Camille Donatacci. They met on a blind date in 1996. They have a daughter, Mason, born October 2001, and a son, Jude, born August 2004, both born to a surrogate mother. During their marriage, several of Grammer and Donatacci&#x27;s homes were featured in magazines, including ones in Malibu (February 2001, &quot;InStyle&quot;), Maui (May 2004, &quot;InStyle&quot;), Long Island (April 2008, &quot;InStyle&quot;), Bachelor Gulch (&quot;Architectural Digest)&quot;, and Bel Air, Los Angeles (&quot;Architectural Digest&quot;). In New York City, they lived at 15 Central Park West. On July 1, 2010, it was announced that Camille had filed for divorce. The pair&#x27;s divorce was finalized on February 10, 2011.

On August 12, 2010, Grammer announced that he was going to be a father to a fifth child, this time with his girlfriend, Kayte Walsh, an English flight attendant 25 years his junior and daughter of the former footballer Alan Walsh. In October, Grammer announced that Walsh had miscarried six weeks earlier. The couple announced their engagement in December 2010 and married at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on February 25, 2011, two weeks after the dissolution of Grammer&#x27;s third marriage. Grammer and Walsh have a daughter, born July 2012, and two sons, born July 2014 and November 2016. On January 18, 2023, it was reported that Grammer had purchased a house in his wife&#x27;s hometown of Portishead, Somerset, England.

===Murder of Karen Grammer===

On July 1, 1975, Grammer&#x27;s younger sister, 18-year-old Karen Grammer, was raped and murdered by a spree killer, Freddie Glenn, and two other men. Grammer identified his sister&#x27;s body and informed their mother shortly after. According to Grammer, his bouts of alcoholism and drug abuse were driven, in part, by guilt and depression over his sister&#x27;s death, as the pair had been close in childhood.

In a 2012 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Grammer said he would be willing to forgive the perpetrators if they would take responsibility for the crime, though they all claimed innocence. In the same interview, Grammer expressed his loss of faith for several years after Karen&#x27;s death. He subsequently forgave Glenn in a 2014 parole hearing after being convinced of Glenn&#x27;s contrition, but refused to support his release, saying that it would &quot;be a betrayal of my sister&#x27;s life&quot;. He named his daughter Spencer Karen Grammer in part for his sister.

Karen Grammer&#x27;s murder and the investigation by the Colorado Springs Police Department was the subject of the episode &quot;Animal Nature&quot; of the Investigation Discovery series &quot;Homicide Hunter&quot;.

=== Politics ===
Grammer is a supporter of the Republican Party, and he endorsed the Tea Party movement on economic issues such as small government and lower taxes; &quot;City A.M.&quot; described him as &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s best-known Republicans, a rare spark of red in a blue sea of Democrats&quot;.

A &quot;New York&quot; magazine profile published in 2010 described Grammer as pro-choice. In 2015, however, his wife posted an Instagram photo of Grammer wearing a T-shirt from the pro-life group Abort73.

Grammer has expressed disbelief on the scientific consensus on climate change, comparing the California wildfires to alleged global cooling from his youth and criticized the 2011 and 2018 climate meetings. Additionally, he stated in a 2016 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the person he admired most was Vladimir Putin &quot;because he is so comfortably who he is&quot;. In 2019, he issued a statement in support of Brexit.

Grammer has criticized Washington politicians, stating: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Washington did us any favors for the last 50, 60 years, I think they&#x27;ve all been sort of the same party, the same bunch of clowns&quot; He has expressed an interest in some day running for United States Congress, Mayor of New York City, and the presidency. In an interview with radio talk show host Frank Morano in August 2021, he indicated that he was no longer interested in running for office. Grammer was a guest at President George W. Bush&#x27;s first inauguration. Grammer endorsed Rudy Giuliani in the 2008 presidential primary and later campaigned for John McCain in the general election. Grammer also promoted RightNetwork, a conservative start-up American television network. He endorsed Michele Bachmann for the Republican nomination for president in 2012. Grammer later endorsed Mitt Romney after he had won the Republican nomination. He initially supported Ben Carson&#x27;s candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, although later stating he would gladly vote for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the upcoming election.

In a December 2023 interview with BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; to promote the new series of &quot;Frasier&quot;, Grammer confirmed he still supports Donald Trump.

=== Health problems ===
Grammer has a history of substance abuse. In 1988, he was charged with drunk driving and cocaine possession and sentenced to 30 days in jail. In August 1990, Grammer was charged again with cocaine possession and was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation, fined $500, and required to perform 300 hours of community service. In January 1991, Grammer was given an additional two years&#x27; probation for violating his original probation through additional cocaine use. In September 1996, he crashed his Dodge Viper sports car while intoxicated, and subsequently checked into the Betty Ford Center for 30 days. Grammer&#x27;s personal problems affected his work. The cast and producers of both &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot; held interventions to help him; co-star Bebe Neuwirth and writer Ken Levine cited delays with rehearsals and filming due to his erratic behavior. The writer Dan O&#x27;Shannon recalled:

Grammer credits his religion for helping him confront his personal problems.

On May 31, 2008, while paddleboarding with his then-wife Camille in Hawaiʻi, Grammer had a heart attack. Their personal assistant, Scott MacLean, was essential in saving his life. Grammer was discharged on June 4, 2008, and was said to be &quot;resting comfortably&quot; at his Hawaii residence. Seven weeks after the attack, Grammer told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; that, although his spokesman described the attack as mild, it was more severe as his heart had stopped. Grammer thought Fox&#x27;s decision to cancel his TV sitcom &quot;Back to You&quot; contributed to his health problems, saying: &quot;It was a very stressful time for me, and a surprise that it was cancelled. But you know, everything that doesn&#x27;t kill us—which it almost did—makes us stronger!&quot;

===Legal issues===
In 1988, Grammer was arrested for possession of one-quarter gram of cocaine, after being pulled over in a traffic stop for driving with expired plates in North Hollywood, California. A year earlier, he had been arrested for a DUI in Van Nuys, California, and would go on to serve 14 days of a 30-day sentence. Grammer later served 10 days of community service after failing to comply with the requirements of his parole in 1990. Later in the same year, Grammer was sentenced to 90 days of house arrest, ordered to pay a $500 fine, underwent drug and alcohol abuse counseling, and performed 300 hours of community service for his 1988 cocaine possession case.

In 1995, Grammer was accused of sleeping with his child&#x27;s underage babysitter. A grand jury chose not to indict the actor, stating: &quot;The young woman&#x27;s delay of more than a year in pressing charges against Mr. Grammer made it difficult to support her claim.&quot; Grammer released a statement shortly afterward, saying: &quot;I have said from the outset that there was no basis for the allegations.&quot; In 1996, Grammer&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Cerlette Lamme, sued him for defamation of character and invasion of privacy over content he included in his autobiography &quot;So Far...&quot;.

In 1998, Grammer filed a lawsuit against Internet Entertainment Group (IEG), which Grammer claimed had stolen from his home a videotape of him sleeping with a woman. IEG counter-sued Grammer, denying it was in possession of such a tape, and Grammer&#x27;s suit was dropped. IEG President Seth Warshavsky later said, &quot;We have been presented with another Kelsey Grammer tape. But we have no plans to air it. We are still evaluating it at this time.&quot;

Grammer won numerous awards and accolades, particularly for his work on &quot;Frasier&quot;. He was the first American actor to be nominated for multiple Emmy awards for portraying the same character on three different television shows (&quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, and &quot;Wings&quot;). In 2010, Grammer received his first Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance in &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot; opposite Douglas Hodge. He later won the Best Revival of a Musical, as a producer for &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; in 2016. On May 22, 2001, he was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television. He received a nomination from the Directors Guild of America Award in 1999, for directing the &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;Merry Christmas, Mrs. Moskowitz&quot;. At the Golden Globes, he has received nine nominations and won three.

<text>Kemerovo () is an industrial city and the administrative center of Kemerovo Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Iskitimka and Tom Rivers, in the major coal mining region of the Kuznetsk Basin. Population: 

The city was known as &quot;Shcheglovsk&quot; until March 27, 1932.

==History==
Kemerovo is an amalgamation of, and successor to, several older Russian settlements. A waypoint named Verkhotomsky &quot;ostrog&quot; was established nearby in 1657 on a road from Tomsk to Kuznetsk fortress. In 1701, the settlement of Shcheglovsk was founded on the left bank of the Tom; soon it became a village. By 1859, seven villages existed where modern Kemerovo is now: Shcheglovka (or Ust-Iskitimskoye), Kemerovo (named in 1734), Yevseyevo, Krasny Yar, Kur-Iskitim (Pleshki), Davydovo (Ishanovo), and Borovaya. In 1721, coal was discovered in the area. The first coal mines were established in 1907, later a chemical plant was established in 1916. By 1917, the population of Shcheglovo had grown to around 4,000 people.

The area&#x27;s further development was boosted by the construction of a railway between Yurga and Kolchugino (now Leninsk-Kuznetsky) with a connection between Topki and Shcheglovo. Shcheglovo was granted town status on May 9, 1918, which is now considered to be the date of Kemerovo&#x27;s founding; and was later known as Shcheglovsk. The town became the central location for the Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony which was established there in 1921. 650 workers from 20 countries settled there and set up what became the Kemerovo Coke Chemical Plant. Some of their descendants visited the modern factory in 2011. On May 27, 1932, Shcheglovsk was renamed Kemerovo and became the administrative center of Kemerovo Oblast in 1943. In 2018, 60 people were killed by a fire in a shopping mall. In 2022, at least 20 people were killed by a fire in a nursing home.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after the village of Kemerovo, named after the surname of the first settlers of the Kemerovs. The ending &quot;ovo&quot; suggests a toponymic transition through a personal name. The village gave its name to the Kemerovo mine that arose under it. In 1925, the city of Scheglovsk was formed from two neighboring villages Kemerovo and Scheglovo, which in 1932 was renamed to Kemerovo after the name of the mine. According to others, the name is based on the Turkic word &quot;kemer&quot;, meaning &quot;cliff, coast&quot;. The inhabitants of the city are called: Kemerovochanin, Kemerovochanka, Kemerovochane.

== Administrative and municipal status ==
Kemerovo is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Kemerovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Kemerovo City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Kemerovo City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Kemerovsky Urban Okrug.

==Politics==
===Council of People&#x27;s Deputies===
The Kemerovo City Council of People&#x27;s Deputies is a representative body of power comprising 36 deputies. The term of office of deputies is five years.

On 13 March 2011, elections to the Council of People&#x27;s Deputies were held, following which the seats in the council were distributed as follows: 31 - United Russia, 2 - A Just Russia, and 2 - Patriots of Russia. Grigory Verzhitsky, a representative of United Russia and a deputy from the 16th constituency of Kemerovo, was elected chairman. At the sixty-eighth meeting of the Kemerovo City Council, Verzhitsky&#x27;s resignation as chairman was accepted at his own request. Since 2017, the city council has been headed by Nikolai Senchurov. Since 2021, the council has been headed by Yuri Andreyev.

== Economy ==

The industrialization of Kemerovo was driven and underpinned by coal mining and by the heavy industry based on the availability of coal. It remains an important industrial city, built up during the Soviet period, with important steel, aluminum and machinery based manufacturing plants along with chemical, fertilizer, and other manufacturing industries. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the city&#x27;s industries have experienced a severe decline, creating high levels of unemployment. Major companies based in the city include Siberian Business Union.

== Transportation ==
=== Public transport ===
The public transport network of Kemerovo consists of 70 city bus routes (including 6 seasonal), 63 suburban (including 35 seasonal), 53 public taxi routes (including 2 seasonal), 5 tram, and 9 trolleybus routes.

686 transport units enter the streets of the city every day, including:
* 201 buses of city and suburban routes;
* 364 units of route taxis;
* 121 units of electric transport.

The fare in public transport is 20 rubles, in express buses - 21 rubles, in fixed-route taxis - 22 rubles (as of March 24, 2019). Free Wi-Fi was used in all Kemerovo trams to attract passenger traffic.

On 6 June 2024, one person was killed and over 140 injured when a tram ran away after apparently suffering a brake failure. Two people were arrested and accused of allowing a disabled tram to operate.

=== Air transportation ===

The city is served by Kemerovo International Airport that reside to the south-east of the city. It has one runway with artificial turf of class B that is long. The airport is named after the Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, a native of Kuzbass. There are two bus routes to the airport - 101 and 126.

=== Railway transportation ===
Kemerovo is linked to western Russia by a branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway and has the Kemerovo Railway station.

==Education==

Six higher education institutions are located in Kemerovo: Kemerovo State University, Kuzbass State Technical University, Kemerovo Institute of Food Industry (University), Kemerovo State Medical Academy, Kemerovo State Institute of Culture, Kemerovo Agricultural Institute and Kuzbass Economy and Justice Institute.

== Sport ==
The public interest for bandy is widespread in Russia. 26,000 watched the opening game of the 2011–12 Russian Bandy League when local club Kuzbass played against Dynamo Moscow and Kuzbass is among the very best in the Russian Bandy League. The 2007 Bandy World Championship was held in the city. Female bandy only exists in a few places in Russia. Now Kemerovo is about to start it up. Moscow already had two multi-use indoor arenas where bandy can be played. Kemerovo got the first one in Russia specifically built for bandy (today also Khabarovsk and Ulyanovsk have it). Kuzbass plays the matches in the league at Khimik Stadium because of the big public interest. That arena has a capacity of 32000. As it also is equipped with artificial ice, Kemerovo has the best infrastructure for developing bandy in Russia.

Since 2013 there has been a &quot;bandy on boots&quot; tournament for national diasporas living in Kuzbass.

The Kuzbass Kemerovo motorcycle speedway team regularly participated in the Soviet Union Championship from 1968 through to 1992. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the team disbanded. However, the team won the silver medal in 1988 and the bronze medal in 1986 and 1987. Occasional ice speedway is held on the Mototrack Rosto DOSAAF at ().

==Climate==
Kemerovo&#x27;s position gives it a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and long, severely cold winters. Its average temperatures vary from in January to in July. It has fairly low precipitation of around annually.

== City symbols ==
=== Coat of arms ===

The heraldic description of the coat of arms of the city of Kemerovo is the following: in the crossed scarlet and black field, there is a narrow golden belt in the form of two diverging heads of grain ears, behind them there is a golden cogwheel that goes down; there is a silver retort in the middle, its neck tilted to the right.

The figures of the coat of arms of the city of Kemerovo symbolize the historically established main directions of the industrial development of the city:
* retort - chemical industry;
* cogwheel - mechanical engineering;
* ears of corn - the fertility of the land associated with the use of mineral fertilizers produced at the chemical enterprises of the city.

<text>In an archipelago like the Hawaiian Islands the water between islands is typically called a &quot;channel&quot; or &quot;passage&quot;. Described here are the channels between the islands of Hawaiʻi, arranged from northwest to southeast.

== Kaulakahi Channel ==

The Kaulakahi Channel separates the islands of Niʻihau and Kauaʻi. It is wide. Kaulakahi translates to &quot;the single flame (streak of color).&quot;

== ʻAuʻau Channel ==

The ʻAuʻau Channel is one of the most protected areas of ocean in the Hawaiian Islands, lying between Lānaʻi and Maui. The channel is also protected by Molokaʻi to the north, and Kahoʻolawe to the south. The depth of the channel reaches , and its width is . ʻAuʻau channel is a whale-watching center in the Hawaiian Islands. Humpback whales migrate approximately from Alaskan waters each autumn and spend the northern hemisphere winter months in the protected waters of the channel.

ʻAuʻau translates to &quot;to take a bath,&quot; referring to its calm bath-like conditions.

== Kealaikahiki Channel ==
The Kealaikahiki Channel is the channel between Lānaʻi and Kahoʻolawe. It literally means &quot;the road to Tahiti&quot;, both figuratively and literally, as Tahiti lies generally southward of its orientation. Known informally as the &quot;Tahiti Express&quot; for its strength in that direction.

== Minor channels and alternate names ==
=== Lahaina Roads ===
The middle of the ʻAuʻau channel off Lahaina is known as the Lahaina Roads. Once filled with whalers when Lahaina was a capital for that industry, Lahaina Roads were later adopted as an alternate anchorage for the main U.S. Pacific Fleet based at Pearl Harbor. However, Lahaina was not used, and the bulk of the fleet remained moored in Pearl Harbor. The Roads are still a common moorage for oceangoing cruise ships and naval vessels of many flags, including the U.S., whose passengers and crews add to the tourists visiting the island.

=== Kumukahi Channel ===

<text>Kemp Town Estate, also known as Kemp Town, is a 19th-century Regency architecture residential estate in the east of Brighton in East Sussex, England. It consists of Arundel Terrace, Lewes Crescent, Sussex Square, Chichester Terrace, and the Kemp Town Enclosures (the gardens). The estate was conceived and financed by Thomas Read Kemp, designed by Charles Busby and Amon Henry Wilds, and constructed by Thomas Cubitt. Work began in 1823 and it was completed in 1855. It has given its name to the larger Kemptown region of Brighton.

==History==
Kemp Town Estate was designed by Charles Busby and Amon Henry Wilds and constructed by Thomas Cubitt. Building work started in 1823 on Arundel Terrace, Chichester Terrace, Lewes Crescent and Sussex Square. Chichester Terrace incorporated the earlier Chichester House. In 1837 Thomas Kemp fled the country to escape his creditors. The project continued under Cubitt with the support of the Fifth Earl of Bristol. It was completed in 1855, with Sussex Square larger than London&#x27;s Grosvenor Square and at the time the biggest housing crescent in Britain. The original estate is a good example of Regency architecture.

The gardens which form Sussex Square and Lewes Crescent, separated by Eastern Road, are known formally as the Kemp Town Enclosures. Work began on the Enclosures in 1823. Early works led by Henry Philips included the landscaping of the gardens and the addition of a tunnel to the esplanade.

At around the same time, Brighton&#x27;s neighbour Hove was expanding on the western boundary of Brighton, with the development of the Brunswick Estate which featured similar though smaller Regency-style properties, and its own market, police station, riding school and (as in Kemp Town) small mews streets for staff housing.

==Modern times==
It has given its name to the larger Kemptown region of Brighton. The majority of the original estate is now demarcated by the modern Kemp Town Conservation Area as defined by the local authority, Brighton and Hove City Council.

The Enclosures are owned communally by the freeholders of the 105 houses which make up the Kemp Town Estate.

Below and to the east of Kemp Town, at beach level, is now Brighton Marina, and Black Rock the site of a former lido.

<text>The Kentucky Derby () is an American Grade I stakes race run at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The race is run by three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of . Colts and geldings carry and fillies .

Held annually on the first Saturday in May, the Derby is the first leg of the Triple Crown. It is preceded by the two-week-long Kentucky Derby Festival. The race is known as &quot;The Run for the Roses&quot;, as the winning horse is draped in a blanket of roses. Lasting approximately two minutes, the Derby has been alternately called &quot;The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports&quot;, &quot;The Fastest Two Minutes in Sports&quot;, or &quot;The Greatest Two Minutes in Sports&quot;, coined by Churchill Downs president Matt Winn. At least two of these descriptions are thought to be derived from the words of sportswriter Grantland Rice, when in 1935 he said &quot;Those two minutes and a second or so of derby running carry more emotional thrills, per second, than anything sport can show.&quot;

The race was first run in 1875. Unlike the other, older races of the Triple Crown—the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes—along with the Travers Stakes (the oldest comparable stakes race in the US), the Kentucky Derby and its sibling race, the Kentucky Oaks, have been run every year since inception. They were twice rescheduled within the same year, the first time due to World War II in 1945, and the second time due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Derby and the Oaks are the oldest major sporting events in the US held annually since their beginning. Among thoroughbred stakes races, they are the oldest that have been held annually on the same track every year.

The Derby is the most-watched and most-attended horse race in the United States. The 2024 Kentucky Derby marked the 150th running of the race.

==History==
In 1872, Col. Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition, traveled to England, visiting Epsom in Surrey where The Derby had been running annually since 1780. From there, Clark went on to Paris, France, where a group of racing enthusiasts had formed the French Jockey Club in 1863. They had organized the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp, which at the time was the greatest race in France. Returning home to Kentucky, Clark organized the Louisville Jockey Club to raise money for building quality racing facilities just outside the city. The track would soon become known as Churchill Downs, named for John and Henry Churchill, who provided the land for the racetrack. The naming went official in 1937.

The Kentucky Derby was first run at miles (12 furlongs; 2.4 km) the same distance as the Epsom Derby, before changing lengths in 1896 to its current miles (10 furlongs; 2 km). On May 17, 1875, in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000 people, a field of 15 three-year-old horses contested the first Derby. Under jockey Oliver Lewis, a colt named Aristides, who was trained by future Hall of Famer Ansel Williamson, won the inaugural Derby. Later that year, Lewis rode Aristides to a second-place finish in the Belmont Stakes.

Initially a successful venue, the track ran into financial difficulties due to a protracted, gambling-related horseman boycott removing it from the upper echelons of racing that would last until just after the turn of the 20th century. In 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated with the new capitalization and improved facilities. Despite this, the business floundered until 1902, when a syndicate led by Col. Matt Winn of Louisville acquired the facility. Under Winn, Churchill Downs prospered, and the Kentucky Derby then became the preeminent stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses in North America.

Thoroughbred owners began sending their successful Derby horses to compete in two other races. These two are the Preakness Stakes at the Pimlico Race Course, in Baltimore, and the Belmont Stakes in Elmont, New York. The three races offered large purses, and in 1919, Sir Barton became the first horse to win all three races. However, the term &quot;Triple Crown&quot; did not come into use for another eleven years. In 1930, when Gallant Fox became the second horse to win all three races, sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage. Fueled by the media, public interest in the possibility of a &quot;superhorse&quot; that could win the Triple Crown began in the weeks leading up to the Derby. Two years after the term went in use, the race (until that time ran in mid-May since inception) changed the date to the first Saturday in May. This change allows for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Before 1931, eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby. On May 12, 1917, and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby took place on the same day. On eleven occasions the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes, and in 2020, the Belmont was run first, then the Kentucky Derby, and the Preakness Stakes last.

On May 16, 1925, the first live radio broadcast of the Kentucky Derby aired on WHAS as well as on WGN in Chicago. On May 7, 1949, the first television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, produced by WAVE-TV, the NBC affiliate in Louisville. This coverage was aired live in the Louisville market and sent to NBC as a kinescope newsreel recording for national broadcast. On May 3, 1952, the first national television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, aired from then-CBS affiliate WHAS-TV. In 1954, the purse exceeded US$100,000 for the first time. In 1968, Dancer&#x27;s Image became the first horse to win the race and then face disqualification. A urine test revealed traces of phenylbutazone (an anti-inflammatory painkiller drug) inside Dancer&#x27;s Image. Forward Pass won after a protracted legal battle by the owners of Dancer&#x27;s Image (which they lost). Forward Pass thus became the eighth winner for Calumet Farm. Unexpectedly, the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later, allowing horses to run on phenylbutazone. In 1970, Diane Crump became the first female jockey to ride in the Derby, finishing 15th aboard Fathom.

The fastest time ever run in the Derby was in 1973 at 1:59.4 minutes, when Secretariat broke the record set by Northern Dancer in 1964. Also during that race, Secretariat did something unique in Triple Crown races: for each successive quarter run, his times were faster. Although the races do not record times for non-winners, in 1973 Sham finished second, two and a half lengths behind Secretariat in the same race. Using the thoroughbred racing convention of one length equaling one-fifth of a second to calculate Sham&#x27;s time, he also finished in under two minutes. Another sub-two-minute finish, only the third, was set in 2001 by Monarchos at 1:59.97, the first year the race used hundredths of seconds instead of fifths in timing.

In 2005, the purse distribution for the Derby changed, so that horses finishing fifth would henceforth receive a share of the purse; previously only the first four finishers did so.

The Kentucky Derby began offering $3 million in purse money in 2019. Churchill Downs officials have cited the success of historical race wagering terminals at their Derby City Gaming facility in Louisville as a factor behind the purse increase. The Derby first offered a $1 million purse in 1996; it was doubled to $2 million in 2005.

In 2020, the Derby was postponed from May 2 to September 5 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the second time in history the race had been postponed, the other being in 1945. Churchill Downs used a new singular 20-stall starting gate for the 2020 Kentucky Derby, replacing the previous arrangement that used a standard 14-stall gate and an auxiliary six-stall gate. The old setup contributed to congestion at the start of the race, especially in the gap between the two gates.

Rich Strike, a reserve who only made it into the final field after a late scratching, won the race in 2022 at final odds of 80:1 and parimutuel betting payouts were even larger.

In January 2024, the purse for the Kentucky Derby was increased to $5 million.

=== Attendance ===
Millions of people from around the world bet at various live tracks and online sportsbooks. In 2017, a crowd of 158,070 watched Always Dreaming win the Derby, making it the seventh biggest attendance in the history of the racetrack. The track reported a wagering total of $209.2 million from all the sources on all the races on the Kentucky Derby Day program. It was a 9 percent increase compared to the total of $192.6 million in 2016 and an increase of 8 percent over the previous record set in 2015 of $194.3 million. TwinSpires, a platform for betting online and a partner of the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders&#x27; Cup, recorded $32.8 million in handle on the Churchill Down races for the Kentucky Derby Day program. This record was a 22 percent increase over the preceding year. On the Kentucky Derby race alone, the handle of TwinSpires was $20.1 million, which is a 22 percent rise compared to the prior year.

The race often draws celebrities. HM Queen Elizabeth II, on a visit to the United States, joined the racegoers at Churchill Downs in 2007.

=== Sponsorship ===
The 2004 Kentucky Derby marked the first time that jockeys—as a result of a court order—were allowed to wear corporate advertising logos on their clothing.

Norman Adams has been the designer of the Kentucky Derby Logo since 2002. On February 1, 2006, the Louisville-based fast-food company Yum! Brands, Inc. announced a corporate sponsorship deal to call the race &quot;The Kentucky Derby presented by Yum! Brands.&quot; In 2018, Woodford Reserve replaced Yum! Brands as the presenting sponsor.

==Traditions==
In addition to the race itself, several traditions play a significant role in the Derby atmosphere. The mint julep—an iced drink consisting of bourbon, mint, and sugar syrup—is the traditional beverage of the race. The historic beverage comes served in an ice-frosted silver julep cup. However, most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from souvenir glasses (first offered in 1939 and available in revised form each year since) printed with all previous Derby winners. Also, burgoo, a thick stew of beef, chicken, pork, and vegetables, is a popular Kentucky dish served at the Derby.
The infield—a spectator area inside the track—offers general admission prices but little chance of seeing much of the race, particularly before the jumbotron installation in 2014. Instead, revelers show up in the infield to party with abandon. By contrast, &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; refers to the expensive box seats that attract the rich, the famous and the well-connected. Women appear in elegant outfits lavishly accessorized with large, elaborate hats. Following the Call to the Post played on bugle by Steve Buttleman, as the horses start to parade before the grandstands, the University of Louisville Cardinal Marching Band plays Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. This song is a tradition which began in 1921. The event attracts spectators from a large area, flying in hundreds of private aircraft to Louisville International Airport.

The Derby is frequently referred to as &quot;The Run for the Roses&quot;, because a lush blanket of 554 red roses is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year. New York sports columnist and future Churchill Downs president Bill Corum in 1925 began describing the race thusly, but the tradition originated in 1883 when New York City socialite E. Berry Wall presented roses to ladies at a post-Derby party. The Churchill Downs founder and president, Col. Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., attended that event. This gesture is believed to have led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race&#x27;s official flower. However, it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to draping roses on the Derby winner. The Governor of Kentucky and the Chairman of Churchill Downs Incorporated present the garland and the Kentucky Derby Trophy to the winner. Pop vocalist Dan Fogelberg composed the song &quot;Run for the Roses&quot;, released in time for the 1980 running of the race.

=== Riders Up! ===
&quot;Riders Up!&quot; is the traditional command from the Paddock Judge for jockeys to mount their horses in advance of the upcoming race. Since 2012, the grand marshal recites this phrase.

Grand marshals
===National Anthem performers===
=== Festival ===

In the weeks preceding the race, numerous activities took place for the Kentucky Derby Festival. Thunder Over Louisville—an airshow and fireworks display—generally begins the festivities in earnest two weeks before the Derby.

==Records==

=== Horse records ===
Secretariat set the record for speed in 1973 with a time of 1:59.4. During its first two decades when the Derby was run at miles, the record was 2:34.5, set by Spokane in 1889.

The largest margin of victory is 8 lengths, a feat tied by four different horses: Old Rosebud in 1914, Johnstown in 1939, Whirlaway in 1941, and Assault in 1946.

The highest odds of a winning horse were 91 to 1 for Donerail in 1913. The second-highest odds occurred in 2022, when Rich Strike went off at 80 to 1 and won the race.

Three horses have won the Kentucky Derby without competing as a two-year-old: Apollo (1882), Justify (2018), and Mage (2023).

=== Jockey records ===
107 jockeys have won the Kentucky Derby, with 27 doing so multiple times. Isaac Murphy (1890–91), Jimmy Winkfield (1901–02), Ron Turcotte (1972–73), Eddie Delahoussaye (1982–83), Calvin Borel (2009–10), and Victor Espinoza (2014–15) are the only jockeys to win the Derby in back-to-back years. Borel is the only jockey with three wins in a four-year span (2007, &#x27;09, &#x27;10).
=== Trainer records ===
116 trainers have won the Kentucky Derby, with 19 doing so multiple times. Six trainers have won the Derby in back-to-back years: Herbert J. Thompson (1932–33), Ben Jones (1948–49), Jimmy Jones (1957–58), Lucien Laurin (1972–73), D. Wayne Lukas (1995–96), and Bob Baffert (1997–98).
=== Owner records ===
Seventeen owners have won the Kentucky Derby multiple times with horses they fully or partially owned.

* Partnered with other entities in an ownership group for one or more winning horses.

=== &quot;Oaks/Derby Double&quot; ===
Jockeys, trainers, and owners competing in the Kentucky Derby often will compete in the Kentucky Oaks, a race for fillies held the day before the Derby. Winning both these races in the same year is referred to as an &quot;Oaks/Derby Double;&quot; 8 jockeys, 3 trainers, and 4 owners have accomplished this feat:

*Until the 1950s, the Oaks was held several days or weeks after the Derby.

==Sire lines==
Winners of the Kentucky Derby can be connected to each other due to the practice of arranging horse breeding based on their previous success. All of the horses can be traced back to the three foundational sires, with Godolphin Arabian the ancestor of 7 winners, Byerley Turk the ancestor of 11 winners, and Darley Arabian the ancestor of 132 winners, including all winners since 1938.

=== Darley Arabian line ===
The Darley Arabian (1700c) sire line (all branched through the Eclipse (1764) line) produced 132 Derby winners (124 colts, 5 geldings, 3 fillies), including all winners from 1938 to present. The main branches of this sire line are:
* the King Fergus (1775) branch (all branched through the Voltigeur (1847) line), produced 14 winners. His sire line continued primarily through his son Vedette (1854) with 12 winners, due to his sons Speculum (1865) with 6 winners (nearly exclusively through Sundridge (1898) with 5 winners, most recently Count Turf in 1951) and Galopin (1872) with 6 winners (exclusively through St. Simon (1881), most recently Go For Gin in 1994).
* the Potoooooooo (1773) branch produced 118 winners (all branched through the Waxy (1790) line), including all winners from 1995 to present. The primary branch of this sire line is through Whalebone (1807), which has produced 113 winners. In turn, the primary branch continues through Sir Hercules (1826), which has produced 91 winners (including all winners since 2006), and then the Birdcatcher (1833) branch which produced 79 winners. From Birdcatcher, the branch of The Baron (1842) has produced 69 winners, of which 67 winners trace to Stockwell (1849). Stockwell&#x27;s son Doncaster (1870) sired Bend Or (1877), whose sire line accounts for 65 winners. The main branch of the Bend Or sire line continued through his son Bona Vista (1889) with 56 winners, exclusively through the Phalaris (1913) line, which has dominated in the last several decades (including all winners from 2006 to present) through the following sons: 
** the Pharamond (1925) branch (4 winners all through the Tom Fool (1949) line, most recently Silver Charm in 1997). 
** the Sickle (1924) branch, (24 winners all branched through the Native Dancer (1950) line, nearly exclusively through Raise a Native (1961) with 23 winners, continued primarily through Mr Prospector (1970) with 16 winners through 8 different sons: Fusaichi Pegasus, winner of the 2000 Kentucky Derby, and 7 other sons through their progeny (most recently Mage in 2023, with his son Fappiano (1977) accounting for 6 winners, nearly exclusively through his son Unbridled with 5 winners, including his win in the 1990 Kentucky Derby and 4 other winners (most recently Always Dreaming in 2017)).
** the Pharos (1920) branch (28 winners all branched through the Nearco (1935) line, through his sons Royal Charger (1942), Nearctic (1954), and Nasrullah (1940)). The Royal Charger branch (exclusively through his son Turn-To (1951)) produced 5 winners (most recently Barbaro in 2006), the Nearctic branch produced 9 winners, exclusively through his son Northern Dancer (1961) with his win in the 1964 Kentucky Derby, and direct male progeny of 8 winners, including 5 winners through his son Storm Bird (most recently Mystik Dan in 2024), while the Nasrullah branch produced 14 winners (most recently Nyquist in 2016) primarily through his son Bold Ruler (1954) with 10 winners (most recently California Chrome in 2014).
** special notes:
*** the Waxy (1790) branch produced two main lines: the primary branch of Whalebone (1807), and the secondary branch of Whisker (1812) which produced 5 winners (exclusively through the King Tom (1851) line), most recently 1909 Kentucky Derby winner Wintergreen.
*** an offshoot of the Whalebone (1807) branch, the Camel (1822) branch (18 winners exclusively through the Touchstone (1831) line), produced 2005 Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo through his grandson Orlando&#x27;s (1841) branch. Since then, each winner of the Kentucky Derby has gone through Whalebone&#x27;s more frequent sire line branch of Sir Herecules (1826). The Orlando branch (6 winners exclusively through the Himyar (1875) line) is the less common of the two branches derived through Camel. Orlando&#x27;s brother Newminster (1848) produced 12 winners (primarily through the Hyperion (1930) line with 8 winners), most recently Chateaugay in 1963.
*** the Sir Hercules (1826) branch produced two main lines: the primary branch of Birdcatcher (1833), and the secondary branch of Faugh-a-Ballagh (1841) which produced 12 winners (exclusively through the Leamington (1853) line), most recently 1908 Kentucky Derby winner Stone Street.
*** the Birdcatcher (1833) branch produced two main lines: the primary branch of The Baron (1842), and the secondary branch of Oxford (1857) which produced 10 winners (primarily through the Swynford (1907) line with 8 winners, with his son St. Germans producing 5 winners), most recently 1965 Kentucky Derby winner Lucky Debonair.
*** the Bend Or (1877) branch produced two main lines: the primary branch of Bona Vista (1889), and the secondary branch of Ormonde (1883) which produced 8 winners (exclusively through the Teddy (1913) line, with his son Sir Gallahad producing 5 winners, most recently Hoop Jr. in 1945), most recently 1957 Kentucky Derby winner Iron Liege.

=== Byerley Turk line ===
The Byerley Turk (1680c) sire line produced 11 winners (8 colts, 3 geldings). The main branches of this sire (all branched through the Herod (1758) line) are:
* the Highflyer (1774) branch produced 1 winner, most recently Macbeth II in 1888.
* the Florizel (1768) branch produced 3 winners (all branched through the Lexington (1850) line), most recently Manuel in 1899.
* the Woodpecker (1773) branch produced 7 winners (all branched through the Buzzard (1787) line). The main branches of this sire line are:
** the Castrel (1801) branch produced 1 winner, most recently Kingman in 1891.
** the Selim (1802) branch produced 6 winners (all branched through the Glencoe (1831) line). The main branches of this sire line are:
*** the Star Davis (1849) branch produced 1 winner, most recently Day Star in 1878.
*** the Vandal (1850) branch produced 5 winners (all branched through the Virgil (1864) line), most recently Alan-a-Dale in 1902.

=== Godolphin Arabian line ===
The Godolphin Arabian (1724c) sire line produced 7 winners (6 colts, 1 gelding). The main branches of this sire (all branched through the West Australian (1850) line) are:
* the Solon (1861) branch produced 3 winners, including:
**the Barcaldine (1878) branch produced 1 winner, most recently Omar Khayyam in 1917
**the Arbitrator (1874) branch produced 2 winners (all branched through The Finn (1912) line), most recently Flying Ebony in 1925
* the Australian (1858) branch produced 4 winners, including:
** Baden-Baden (1874), winner of the 1877 Kentucky Derby
**the Waverly (1870) branch produced 1 winner, most recently Montrose in 1887
**the Spendthrift (1876) branch produced 2 winners (all branched through the Man o&#x27; War (1917) line), most recently War Admiral in 1937

<text>FX-87 is a polymorphic typed functional language based on a system for static program analysis in which every expression has two static properties: a type and an effect. In a study done by MIT, FX-87 yields similar performance results as functional languages on programs that do not contain side effects (Fibonacci, Factorial). FX-87 did yield a great performance increase when matching DNA sequences.

KFX is the kernel language of FX-87. It was described in &#x27;Polymorphic Effect Systems&#x27;, J.M. Lucassen et al., &quot;Proceedings of the 15th Annual ACM Conference POPL&quot;, ACM 1988, pp. 47–57.

<text>The katal (symbol: kat) is that catalytic activity that will raise the rate of conversion by one mole per second in a specified assay system. It is a unit of the International System of Units (SI) used for quantifying the catalytic activity of enzymes (that is, measuring the enzymatic activity level in enzyme catalysis) and other catalysts.

The unit &quot;katal&quot; is not attached to a specified measurement procedure or assay condition, but any given catalytic activity is: the value measured depends on experimental conditions that must be specified. Therefore, to define the quantity of a catalyst in katals, the &quot;catalysed rate of conversion&quot; (the rate of conversion in presence of the catalyst minus the rate of spontaneous conversion) of a defined chemical reaction is measured in moles per second. One katal of trypsin, for example, is that amount of trypsin which breaks one mole of peptide bonds in one second under the associated specified conditions.

==Definition==
One katal refers to an amount of enzyme that gives a catalysed rate of conversion of one mole per second. Because this is such a large unit for most enzymatic reactions, the nanokatal (nkat) is used in practice.
:formula_1
The katal is not used to express the rate of a reaction; that is expressed in units of concentration per second, as moles per liter per second. Rather, the katal is used to express catalytic activity, which is a property of the catalyst.

==SI multiples==
== History ==
The General Conference on Weights and Measures and other international organizations recommend use of the katal. It replaces the non-SI enzyme unit of catalytic activity. The enzyme unit is still more commonly used than the katal, especially in biochemistry. The adoption of the katal has been slow.

==Origin==

The name &quot;katal&quot; has been used for decades. The first proposal to make it an SI unit came in 1978, and it became an official SI unit in 1999. The name comes from the Ancient Greek κατάλυσις (&quot;katalysis&quot;), meaning &quot;dissolution&quot;; the word &quot;catalysis&quot; itself is a Latinized form of the Greek word.

<doc id="17143" wikidata="Q36101" url="?curid=17143" title="Koala">
<text>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family &quot;Phascolarctidae&quot;. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the island&#x27;s eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, dark nose. The koala has a body length of and weighs . Its fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations are possibly separate subspecies, but not all researchers accept this.

Koalas typically inhabit open &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on them. Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Like other marsupials, koalas give birth to young known as joeys at a very early stage of development. They crawl into their mothers&#x27; pouches, where they live for their first six to seven months. They are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by pathogens such as &quot;Chlamydiaceae&quot; bacteria and &quot;koala retrovirus&quot;.

Because of their distinctive appearance, koalas, along with kangaroos, are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia. They were hunted by Indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description in 1814 although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala, thereby introducing the species to the British public. Further details about the animal&#x27;s biology were revealed in the 19th century by English scientists. Koalas are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts, and associated bushfires, some related to climate change. In February 2022, the koala was officially listed as endangered in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;koala&quot; comes from the Dharug , meaning . Although the vowel &quot;u&quot; was originally written in the English orthography as &quot;oo&quot; (in spellings such as &quot;coola&quot; or &quot;koolah&quot; — two syllables), the spelling later became &quot;oa&quot; and the word is now pronounced in three syllables, possibly in error.
Related words include &quot;kula&quot; from Georges River to Sydney&#x27;s south and west, and &quot;kulla&quot; (or kūlla) among southeastern Queensland’s Dippil people.
Another hypothesis is that koala was an aboriginal name from the Hawkesbury River district near Sydney.

Adopted by white settlers, the word &quot;koala&quot; became one of hundreds of Aboriginal loan words in Australian English, where it was also commonly referred to as &quot;native bear&quot;, later &quot;koala bear&quot;, for its resemblance to a bear. It is one of several Aboriginal words that made it into International English alongside words like &quot;didgeridoo&quot; and &quot;kangaroo&quot;. The generic name, &quot;Phascolarctos&quot;, is derived from the Greek words () and () . The specific name, , is Latin for .

==Taxonomy==
The koala was given its generic name &quot;Phascolarctos&quot; in 1816 by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, who did not give it a specific name until further review. In 1819, German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss gave it the binomial &quot;Lipurus cinereus&quot;. Because &quot;Phascolarctos&quot; was published first, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, it has priority as the official genus name. French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest coined the name &quot;Phascolarctos fuscus&quot; in 1820, suggesting that the brown-coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones. Other names suggested by European authors included &quot;Marodactylus cinereus&quot; by Goldfuss in 1820, &quot;P. flindersii&quot; by René Primevère Lesson in 1827, and &quot;P. koala&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1827.

===Evolution===
The koala is classified with wombats (family &quot;Vombatidae&quot;) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The koala&#x27;s lineage possibly branched off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.

The modern koala is the only extant member of &quot;Phascolarctidae&quot;, a family that includes several extinct genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had broader diets. Some species, such as &quot;Nimiokoala greystanesi&quot; and some species of &quot;Perikoala&quot;, were around the same size as the modern koala, while others, such as species of &quot;Litokoala&quot;, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures, which suggests that they also made long-distance vocalisations and had a relatively inactive lifestyle. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; woodlands. The genus &quot;Phascolarctos&quot; split from &quot;Litokoala&quot; in the late Miocene, and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a eucalyptus diet: the palate shifted towards the front of the skull; the upper teeth were lined by thicker bone, molars became relatively low compared to the jaw joint and with more chewing surface; the pterygoid fossa shrank; and a larger gap separated the incisor teeth and the molars.

&quot;P. cinereus&quot; may have emerged as a dwarf form of the giant koala (&quot;P. stirtoni&quot;), following the disappearance of several giant animals in the late Pleistocene. A 2008 study questioned this hypothesis, noting that &quot;P. cinereus&quot; and &quot;P. stirtoni&quot; were sympatric during the mid-late Pleistocene, and that their teeth morphology displayed the major differences. The fossil record of the modern koala extends back at least to the middle Pleistocene.

===Genetics and variations===
Three subspecies have been described: the Queensland koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus adustus&quot;, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus cinereus&quot;, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus victor&quot;, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala is the smallest, with silver or grey short hairs and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull. The geographic limits of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests koalas exist as a cline within a single evolutionarily significant unit with limited gene flow between local populations. In 2016, a comprehensive phylogenetic study did not support the recognition of any subspecies.

Other studies have found that koala populations are highly inbred with low genetic variation. Such low genetic diversity may have been caused by population declines during the late Pleistocene. Rivers and roads limit gene flow and contribute to the isolation of southeast Queensland populations. In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome.

==Characteristics==
The koala is a robust animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail. It has a body length of and a weight of , making it among the largest arboreal marsupials. Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland. The species is sexually dimorphic: males are 50% larger than females. Males&#x27; noses are more curved and sport chest glands, which are visible as bald patches. The female&#x27;s pouch opening is secured by a sphincter which holds the young in.

The pelage of the koala is denser on the back. Back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown. The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is mottled whitish and dark. The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation. The koala has curved, sharp claws well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) that allow them to grip small branches. On the hind paws, the second and third digits are fused, a typical condition for members of the &quot;Diprotodontia&quot;, and the attached claws (which are still separate) function like a comb. The animal has a robust skeleton and a short, muscular upper body with relatively long upper limbs that contribute to its ability to climb. The thigh muscles are anchored further down the shinbone, increasing its climbing power.

For a mammal, the koala has a disproportionately small brain, 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only on average. The brain&#x27;s surface is fairly smooth and &quot;primitive&quot;. It does not entirely fill the cranial cavity, unlike most mammals, and is lightened by large amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. It is possible that the fluid protects the brain should the animal fall from a tree. The koala&#x27;s small brain may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain. Its small brain limits its ability to perform complex behaviours. For example, it will not eat plucked eucalyptus leaves on a flat surface, which does not match its feeding routine.

The koala has a broad, dark nose with a good sense of smell, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility. Its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits, an adaptation to living on a more vertical plane. Its round ears provide it with good hearing, and it has a well-developed middle ear. The koala larynx is located relatively low in the vocal tract and can be pulled further down. They possess unique folds in the velum (soft palate), known as velar vocal folds, in addition to the typical vocal folds of the larynx. These features allow the koala to produce deeper sounds than would otherwise be possible for their size.

The koala has several adaptations for its low nutrient, toxic, and fibrous diet. The animal&#x27;s dentition consists of incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw) that are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The koala bites a leaf with the incisors and clips it with the premolars at the petiole, before chewing it to pieces with the cusped molars. Koalas may store food in their cheek pouches before it is ready to be chewed. The partially worn molars of koalas in their prime are optimal for breaking leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal&#x27;s energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.

Koalas are hindgut fermenters, and their digestive retention can last 100 hours in the wild or 200 hours in captivity. This is made possible by their caecum— long and in diameter—possibly the largest for an animal of its size. Koalas can retain food particles for longer fermentation if needed. They are more likely keep smaller particles as larger ones take longer to digest. While the hindgut is relatively large, only 10% of the animal&#x27;s energy is obtained from digestion in this chamber. The koala&#x27;s metabolic rate is only 50% of the typical mammalian rate, owing to its low energy intake, although this can vary across seasons and sexes. They can digest the toxic plant secondary metabolites, phenolic compounds and terpenes due to their production of cytochrome P450, which neutralises these poisons in the liver. The koala replaces lost water at a lower rate than species such as some possums. It maintains water by absorbing it in the caecum, resulting in drier faecal pellets packed with undigested fibre.

==Distribution and habitat==

The koala&#x27;s range covers roughly , and 30 ecoregions. It ranges throughout mainland eastern and southeastern Australia, including the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The koala was introduced to several nearby islands. The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range.

Fossil evidence shows that the koala&#x27;s range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the late Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by Indigenous Australians. Koalas were introduced to Western Australia at Yanchep in 1938 but that population was reduced to 4 individuals by 2022. Koalas can be found in both tropical and temperate habitats ranging from dense woodlands to more spaced-out forests. In semi-arid climates, they prefer riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Foraging and activities===

Koalas are herbivorous, and while most of their diet consists of eucalypt leaves, they can be found in trees of other genera, such as &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Allocasuarina&quot;, &quot;Callitris&quot;, &quot;Leptospermum&quot;, and &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. Though the foliage of over 600 species of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is available, the koala shows a strong preference for around 30. They prefer plant matter with higher protein than fibre and lignin. The most favoured species are &quot;Eucalyptus microcorys&quot;, &quot;E. tereticornis&quot;, and &quot;E. camaldulensis&quot;, which, on average, make up more than 20% of their diet. Despite its reputation as a picky eater, the koala is more generalist than some other marsupial species, such as the greater glider. The koala does not need to drink often as it can get enough water from the leaves, though larger males may additionally drink water found on the ground or in tree hollows. When feeding, a koala reaches out to grab leaves with one forepaw while the other paws hang on to the branch. Depending on the size of the individual, a koala can walk to the end of a branch or must stay near the base. Each day, koalas eat up to of leaves, spread over four to six feeding periods. Despite their adaptations to a low-energy lifestyle, they have meagre fat reserves.

Their low-energy diet limits their activity and they sleep 20 hours a day. They are predominantly active at night and spend most of their waking hours foraging. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as long as a day. On warm days, a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie down with its limbs dangling. When it gets hot, the koala rests lower in the canopy and near the trunk, where the surface is cooler than the surrounding air. It curls up when it gets cold and wet. It resorts to a lower, thicker, branch during high winds. While it spends most of the time in the tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree, with either a walking or leaping gait. The koala usually grooms itself with its hind paws, with their double claws, but it sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.

===Social life===
Koalas are asocial and spend just 15 minutes a day on social behaviours. In areas of higher density and fewer trees, home ranges are smaller and more clumped. Koala society appears to consist of &quot;residents&quot; and &quot;transients&quot;: the former are mostly adult females and the latter are males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominant. The territories of dominant males are found near breeding females, while younger males must wait until they reach full size to challenge for breeding rights. Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do, dominant ones retain their status. As a male climbs a new tree, he rubs his chest against it and sometimes dribbles urine. This scent-marking behaviour probably serves as communication, and individuals are known to sniff the bottom of a newly found tree. Chest gland secretions are complex chemical mixtures — about 40 compounds were identified in one analysis — that vary in composition and concentration across season and age.

Adult males communicate with loud bellows — &quot;a long series of deep, snoring inhalations and belching exhalations&quot;. Because of their low frequency, these bellows can travel far through the forest. Koalas may bellow at any time, particularly during the breeding season, when it serves to attract females and possibly intimidate other males. They also bellow to advertise their presence when they change trees. These sounds signal and exaggerate the male&#x27;s body size; females pay more attention to bellows by larger males. Female koalas bellow, though more softly, in addition to making snarls, wails, and screams. These calls are produced when in distress and when making defensive threats. Younger animals squeak and older ones squawk when distraught. When another individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low closed-mouth grunt. Koalas also communicate with facial expressions. When snarling, wailing, or squawking, the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears forward. Screaming koalas pull their lips and ears back. Females form an oval shape with their lips when annoyed.

Agonistic behaviour typically consists of quarrels between individuals who are trying to pass each other on a tree. This occasionally involves biting. Strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite. In extreme situations, a larger male may try to displace a smaller rival from a tree, chasing, cornering, and biting it. Once the individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals who come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid fighting due to energy costs.

===Reproduction and development===

Koalas are seasonal breeders, and they give birth from October to May. Females in oestrus lean their heads back and shake their bodies. Despite these obvious signals, males try to copulate with any female during this period, mounting them from behind. Because of his much larger size, a male can overpower a female. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors but will accede to one that is dominant or familiar. The commotion can attract other males to the scene, obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. A female may learn who is more dominant during these fights. Older males typically accumulate scratches, scars, and cuts on the exposed parts of their noses and their eyelids.

Koalas are induced ovulators. The gestation period lasts 33–35 days, and a female gives birth to one joey or occasionally, twins. The young are born tiny and barely formed, weighing no more than . However, their lips, forelimbs, and shoulders are relatively advanced, and they can breathe, defecate, and urinate. The joey crawls into its mother&#x27;s pouch to continue its development. Female koalas do not clean their pouches, while an unusual trait among marsupials.

The joey latches on to one of the female&#x27;s two teats and suckles it. The female lactates for as long as a year to make up for her low energy production. Unlike in other marsupials, koala milk becomes less fatty as the joey grows. After seven weeks, the joey has a proportionally large head, clear edges around its face, more colouration, and a visible pouch (if female) or scrotum (male). At 13 weeks, the joey weighs around , and its head doubles in size. The eyes begin to open and hair begins to appear. At 26 weeks, the fully furred animal resembles an adult and can look outside the pouch.

At six or seven months, the joey weighs and fully emerges from the pouch for the first time. It explores its new surroundings cautiously, clutching its mother for support. Around this time, the mother prepares it for a eucalyptus diet by producing a faecal pap that the joey eats from her cloaca. This pap comes from the cecum, is more liquid than regular faeces, and is filled with bacteria. A nine month old joey has its adult coat colour and weighs . Having permanently left the pouch, it rides on its mother&#x27;s back for transportation, learning to climb by grasping branches. Gradually, it becomes more independent. The mother becomes pregnant again after a year after the offspring reaches around . She permanently severs her bond with her previous offspring and no longer allows it to suckle, but it remains nearby until it is one-and-a-half to two years old.

Females become sexually mature at about three years of age; in comparison, males reach sexual maturity at about age four although they can experience spermatogenesis as early as two years. Males do not start marking their scent until they reach sexual maturity though their chest glands become functional much earlier. Koalas can breed every year if environmental conditions are good, though the long dependence of the young usually leads to year-long gaps in births.

===Health and mortality===
Koalas live from 13 to 18 years in the wild although males may die sooner because of their more risky lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees, yet they can get hurt and even die, particularly inexperienced young and fighting males. Around age six, the koala&#x27;s chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal dies of starvation. Koalas have few predators. Dingos and large pythons and some birds of prey may take them. Koalas are generally not subject to external parasites other than ticks around the coast. The mite &quot;Sarcoptes scabiei&quot; gives koalas mange, while the bacterium &quot;Mycobacterium ulcerans&quot; skin ulcers, but these are uncommon. Internal parasites are few and have little effect. These include the &quot;Bertiella obesa&quot; tapeworm, commonly found in the intestine, and the &quot;Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus&quot; and &quot;Durikainema phascolarcti nematodes&quot;, which are infrequently found in the lungs. In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas taken to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals were infected with parasitic protozoal genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, the most frequent of which was &quot;T. irwini&quot;.

Koalas can be subject to pathogens such as &quot;Chlamydiaceae&quot; bacteria, which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are common on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. , efforts are underway to use vaccination to try to stem the koala chlamydia epidemic. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) which is similar to AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in koala populations suggests it spread from north to south, for only southern populations have virus-free individuals. 

The animals are vulnerable to bushfires due to their slow speed and the flammability of eucalypt trees. The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches where it is vulnerable to heat and fire. Bushfires divide the animal&#x27;s habitat, which isolates them, decreases their numbers, and creates genetic bottlenecks. Dehydration and overheating can prove fatal. Consequently, the koala is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Models of climate change predict warmer and drier climates, suggesting that the koala&#x27;s range will shrink in the east and south to more mesic habitats.

==Relation to humans==

===History===
The first written reference to the koala was recorded by John Price, servant of John Hunter, the Governor of New South Wales. Price encountered the &quot;cullawine&quot; on 26 January 1798, during an expedition to the Blue Mountains, but his remarks would first be published in &quot;Historical Records of Australia&quot;, nearly a century later. In 1802, French-born explorer Francis Louis Barrallier encountered the animal when his two Aboriginal guides, returning from a hunt, brought back two koala feet they were intending to eat. Barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them and his notes to Hunter&#x27;s successor, Philip Gidley King, who forwarded them to Joseph Banks. Similar to Price, Barrallier&#x27;s notes were not published until 1897. Reports of the &quot;Koolah&quot; appeared in the Sydney Gazette in late 1803, and helped provide the impetus for King to send artist John Lewin to create watercolours of the animal. Lewin painted three pictures, one of which was printed in Georges Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Le Règne Animal (The Animal Kingdom)&quot; (1827).

Botanist Robert Brown was the first to write a formal scientific description in 1803, based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal&#x27;s skull, throat, feet, and paws. Brown&#x27;s work remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however; his field books and notes remained in his possession until his death, when they were bequeathed to the British Museum in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer&#x27;s koala watercolours were not published until 1989. William Paterson, who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales, wrote an eyewitness report of his encounters with the animals and this would be the basis for British surgeon Everard Home&#x27;s anatomical writings on them. Home, who in 1808 published his report, coined the scientific name &quot;Didelphis coola&quot;.

George Perry officially published the first image of the koala in his 1810 natural history work &quot;Arcana&quot;. Perry called it the &quot;New Holland Sloth&quot;, and his dislike for the koala, evident in his description of the animal, was reflected in the contemporary British attitudes towards Australian animals as strange and primitive:

...  the eye is placed like that of the Sloth, very close to the mouth and nose, which gives it a clumsy awkward appearance, and void of elegance in the combination ... they have little either in their character or appearance to interest the Naturalist or Philosopher. As Nature however provides nothing in vain, we may suppose that even these torpid, senseless creatures are wisely intended to fill up one of the great links of the chain of animated nature ...

Naturalist and popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala in his three-volume work &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot; (1845–1863) and introduced the species, as well as other members of Australia&#x27;s little-known faunal community, to the public. Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the koala to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided an early description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat. English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the koala as a marsupial in the 1840s, and compared it to fossil species &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and &quot;Nototherium&quot;, which had been discovered just recently. Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the koala to fossil marsupials in his 1871 &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot;.

Britain received its first living koala in 1881, which was obtained by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on it and it was unable to free itself. Forbes dissected the specimen and wrote about the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver — parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell — well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus — described the uterine development of the koala in 1884, and used this new information to convincingly map out the evolutionary timeline of the koala and the monotremes.

===Cultural significance ===
The koala is known worldwide and is a major draw for Australian zoos and wildlife parks. It has been featured in popular culture and as soft toys. It benefited the Australian tourism industry by over $1 billion in 1998, and subsequently grown. Its international popularly rose after World War II, when tourism increased and the animals were exported to zoos overseas. In 1997, about 75% of European and Japanese tourists placed the koala at the top of their list of animals to see. According to biologist Stephen Jackson: &quot;If you were to take a straw poll of the animal most closely associated with Australia, it&#x27;s a fair bet that the koala would come out marginally in front of the kangaroo&quot;. Factors that contribute to the koala&#x27;s enduring popularity include its teddy bear-like appearance with childlike body proportions.

The koala features in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of Indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped them get to Australia by rowing the boat. Another myth tells of a tribe that killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people from other parts of the world. How the koala lost its tail is the subject of many tales. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for uncouth behaviour. Tribes in Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal that gave valuable guidance. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for making trees grow in their arid lands. The animal is depicted in rock carvings, though less so than some other species.

Early European settlers in Australia considered the koala to be a creeping sloth-like animal with a &quot;fierce and menacing look&quot;. At the turn of the 20th century, the koala&#x27;s reputation took a positive turn. It appears in Ethel Pedley&#x27;s 1899 book &quot;Dot and the Kangaroo&quot;, as the &quot;funny native bear&quot;. Artist Norman Lindsay depicted a more anthropomorphic koala in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; cartoons, starting in 1904. This character also appeared as Bunyip Bluegum in Lindsay&#x27;s 1918 book &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot;. The most well known fictional koala is Blinky Bill. Created by Dorothy Wall in 1933, the character appeared in books, films, TV series, merchandise, and a 1986 environmental song by John Williamson. The koala first appeared on an Australian stamp in 1930. 

The song &quot;Ode to a Koala Bear&quot; appears on the B-side of the 1983 Paul McCartney/Michael Jackson duet single &quot;Say Say Say&quot;. A koala is the main character in animated cartoons in the early 1980s: Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The Kwicky Koala Show&quot; and Nippon Animation&#x27;s &quot;Noozles&quot;. Food products shaped like the koala include the Caramello Koala chocolate bar and the bite-sized cookie snack Koala&#x27;s March. Dadswells Bridge in Victoria features a tourist complex shaped like a giant koala and the Queensland Reds rugby team has a koala as its icon.

===Koala diplomacy===
Political leaders and members of royal families had their pictures taken with koalas, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry, Crown Prince Naruhito, Crown Princess Masako, Pope John Paul II, US President Bill Clinton, Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev and South African President Nelson Mandela At the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit, hosted by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, many world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Barack Obama, were photographed holding koalas. The event gave rise to the term &quot;koala diplomacy&quot;, which became the Oxford Word of the Month for December 2016. The term also includes the loan of koalas by the Australian government to overseas zoos in countries such as Singapore and Japan, as a form of &quot;soft power diplomacy&quot;, like the &quot;panda diplomacy&quot; practised by China.

==Conservation==


The koala was originally classified as Least Concern on the Red List, and reassessed as Vulnerable in 2014. In the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Queensland, the species was listed under the EPBC Act in February 2022 as endangered by extinction. The described population was determined in 2012 to be &quot;a species for the purposes of the EPBC Act 1999&quot; in Federal legislation.

Australian policymakers declined a 2009 proposal to include the koala in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. A 2017 WWF report found a 53% decline per generation in Queensland, and a 26% decline in New South Wales. The koala population in South Australia and Victoria appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) argued that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures was based on a misconception that the total population was 200,000, whereas they believed in 2012 that it was probably less than 100,000. AKF estimated in 2022 that there could be 43,000–100,000. This compares with 8 to 10 million at the start of the 20th century. The Australian Government&#x27;s Threatened Species Scientific Committee estimated that the 2021 koala population was 92,000, down from 185,000 two decades prior.

The koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century, largely for its fur. Australia exported as many as two million pelts by 1924. Koala furs were used to make rugs, coat linings, muffs, and on women&#x27;s garment trimmings. The first successful efforts at conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane&#x27;s Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney&#x27;s Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. Its owner Noel Burnet created the first successful breeding program.

One of the biggest threats to the koala is habitat destruction and fragmentation. Near the coast, the main cause of this is urbanisation, while in rural areas, habitat is cleared for agriculture. Its favoured trees are harvested for wood products. In 2000, Australia had the fifth highest rate of land clearance globally, stripping of native plants. The koalas&#x27; distribution has shrunk by more than 50% since European arrival, largely due to habitat fragmentation in Queensland. Nevertheless, koalas live in many protected areas.

While urbanisation can pose a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas given enough trees. Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: collisions with vehicles and attacks by domestic dogs. Cars and dogs kill about 4,000 animals every year. To reduce road deaths, government agencies have been exploring various wildlife crossing options, such as the use of fencing to channel animals toward an underpass, in some cases adding a walkway to an existing culvert. Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres. In a 30-year retrospective study performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre, trauma was found to be the most frequent cause of admission, followed by symptoms of &quot;Chlamydia&quot; infection.

<text>A killer micro is a microprocessor-based machine that infringes on mini, mainframe, or supercomputer performance turf. It originally referred to the replacement of vector supercomputers built with bipolar technology by Massively Parallel Processors (MPP) assembled from a larger number of lower performing microprocessors. These systems faced initial skepticism, based on the assumption that applications do not have significant parallelism, because of Amdahl&#x27;s law, but the success of early systems such as nCUBE and the fast progress in microprocessor performance following Moore&#x27;s law led to a fast replacement.

Taken from the title of Eugene Brooks&#x27; (of Lawrence Livermore Lab) talk &quot;Attack of the Killer Micros&quot; at Supercomputing 1990. This title was probably chosen after the &quot;Attack of the Killer Tomatoes&quot; cult film.

<doc id="17148" wikidata="Q6407569" url="?curid=17148" title="Killer poke">
<text>In computer jargon, a killer poke is a method of inducing physical hardware damage on a machine or its peripherals by the insertion of invalid values, via, for example, BASIC&#x27;s POKE command, into a memory-mapped control register. The term is typically used to describe a family of fairly well known tricks that can overload the analog electronics in the CRT monitors of computers lacking hardware sanity checking (notable examples being the IBM Portable and Commodore PET.)

==Specific examples==
===Zuse Z1/Z3===
The Z1 (1938) and Z3 (1941) computers built by Konrad Zuse contained illegal sequences of instructions which damaged the hardware if executed by accident.

===Commodore PET===
The PET-specific killer poke is connected to the architecture of that machine&#x27;s video rasterizer circuits. In early PETs, writing a certain value to the memory address of a certain I/O register (codice_1) made the machine able to display text and graphics on the screen 106% faster. This was accomplished by disabling a &quot;wait to print to screen&quot; safeguard designed to reduce static/noise by preventing the shared VRAM from being read by the display at the same time as it was being written to by the CPU. With this safeguard disabled, graphics could appear on the screen twice as fast, but small bits of static would also appear. Despite the static, some games designed for early PETs included this POKE in their source code in order to benefit from the faster graphics.

When the PET range was revamped with updated hardware, the video rasterizer circuits were redesigned to run at a faster speed and without the need for a &quot;wait to print&quot; safeguard. Thus, the old POKE trick no longer resulted in faster graphics. Instead, performing the old trick on the new hardware led to strange behavior by the new video chip, which could cause signal contention and possibly damage the PET&#x27;s integrated CRT monitor. This is because the exact pin targeted by the POKE command used to control display timing, but in the upgraded video chip, that pin controlled the vertical sync. Thus, running the POKE on the newer hardware caused graphics to compress vertically, sometimes down to an extremely bright horizontal line. Fears that this anomaly might burn in to the display led to the nickname &quot;killer poke&quot;; however, it is not known to have ever caused any permanent damage to the monitor.

===Commodore 1541 Disk Drive===
The Commodore 64 had an optional external 5-1/4&quot; floppy drive. The Commodore 1541 contained a 6502 microprocessor which was used to run Commodore DOS and also to manage the drive mechanism. The drives stored data on 35 tracks (#0–34), and the stepper motor could be manually controlled through BASIC by PRINT#-ing &quot;MEMORY-WRITE&quot; commands to the drive (which correspond to the POKE command of BASIC, but write to the drive&#x27;s internal memory and I/O registers, not those of the computer itself). If the drive was at either end of its range (track 0 or track 39) and it was commanded to continue moving, there was no software or firmware method to prevent drive damage. Continued &quot;knocking&quot; of the drive head against the stop would throw the mechanism out of alignment. The problem was exacerbated by copy protection techniques that used non-standard disk formats with unusual track counts. The Commodore 1571 had an optical head stop instead of a mechanical one.

===TRS-80 Model I &amp; III===
The original TRS-80 and TRS-80 Model III had the ability to switch between a 32-character-wide display and a 64-character display. Doing so actuated a relay in the video hardware, accomplished by writing to a specific memory-mapped control register. Programs that repeatedly switched between 32- and 64-character modes at high speed (either on purpose or accidentally) could permanently damage the video hardware. While this is not a single &quot;killer poke&quot;, it demonstrates a software failure mode that could permanently damage the hardware.

The TRS-80 Model I also has a similar cassette motor relay accessible via a memory poke command and could result in damaging the relay.

===LG CD-ROM drives===
Certain models of LG CD-ROM drives with specific firmware used an abnormal command for &quot;update firmware&quot;: the &quot;clear buffer&quot; command usually used on CD-RW drives. Linux uses this command to tell the difference between CD-ROM and CD-RW drives. Most CD-ROM drives dependably return an error for the unsupported CD-RW command, but the faulty drives interpreted it as &quot;update firmware&quot;, causing them to stop working (or, in casual parlance, to be &quot;bricked&quot;).

=== Flash memory ===
The resource of flash memory is large, but limited. Since writing to storage is an essential operation, most applications have enough privileges to exhaust the resource of flash chips within 24 hours by filling the storage enough to cause write amplification and continuously rewriting a small file.

===MSi Laptops UEFI===
Systemd mounts variables used by Unified Extensible Firmware Interface on Linux system&#x27;s sysfs as writable by the root user of a system. As a result, it is possible for the root user of a system to completely brick a system with a non-conforming UEFI implementation (specifically some MSi laptops) by using the codice_2 command to delete the codice_3 directory, or recursively delete the root directory.

<text>A kill file (also killfile, bozo bin or twit list) is a file that stores text matching patterns that are used in some Usenet reading programs to filter out (ignore) articles by subject, author, or other header information. Adding a pattern to a kill file results in matching articles being ignored by the person using the newsreader. By extension, the term may describe a decision to ignore an author or topic. A kill file feature was first implemented in Larry Wall&#x27;s rn.

==Variations==

Some newsreaders allow the user to specify a time period to keep an author in the kill file.

An ignore list is a similar yet simpler feature found in some web-based forums, including some web-based Usenet portals, which filters out posts by author only.

Scoring is a more advanced feature found in some newsreaders, including Gnus. The newsreader uses fuzzy logic to apply arbitrarily complex overlapping rules, stored in score files, to score articles. An article is ignored when its score is below a user-defined threshold. For example, articles might score as ignored (killed) if it violates too many low-weighted stylistic rules (e.g. containing too many capital letters or too little punctuation, implying an annoying reading experience), or only one or two highly-weighted rules (such as the body containing objectionable keywords or the origin being a known source of spam).

==History==
Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1986 of his wish for improvements to an offline reader for the Byte Information Exchange online service: &quot;What I really need, though, is a program that will ... sort through the messages, assigning some to a priority file and others to the bit bucket depending on subject matter and origin&quot;.

==Media==
In William Gibson&#x27;s novel &quot;Idoru&quot;, the virtual community Hak Nam is built around an &quot;inverted killfile&quot; and is modeled on Kowloon Walled City.

<doc id="17154" wikidata="Q379673" url="?curid=17154" title="Kit Carson">
<text>Christopher Houston Carson (December 24, 1809 – May 23, 1868) was an American frontiersman. He was a fur trapper, wilderness guide, Indian agent and U.S. Army officer. He became an American frontier legend in his own lifetime through biographies and news articles; exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. His understated nature belied confirmed reports of his fearlessness, combat skills, tenacity, as well as profound effect on the westward expansion of the United States. Although he was famous for much of his life, historians in later years have written that Kit Carson did not like, want, or even fully understand the fame that he experienced during his life.

Carson left home in rural Missouri at 16 to become a mountain man and trapper in the West. In the 1830s, he accompanied Ewing Young on an expedition to Mexican California and joined fur-trapping expeditions into the Rocky Mountains. He lived among and married into the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes.

In the 1840s, Carson was hired as a guide by John C. Frémont, whose expeditions covered much of California, Oregon, and the Great Basin area. Frémont mapped and wrote reports and commentaries on the Oregon Trail to assist and encourage westward-bound pioneers, and Carson achieved national fame through those accounts. Under Frémont&#x27;s command, Carson participated in the U.S. conquest of California from Mexico at the beginning of the Mexican–American War. During this time, he also participated in the Frémont-led Sacramento River massacre and Klamath Lake massacre against the Indians. Later in the war, Carson was a scout and courier who was celebrated for his rescue mission after the Battle of San Pasqual and for his coast-to-coast journey from California to Washington, D.C., to deliver news of the conflict in California to the government. In the 1850s, he was appointed as the Indian agent to the Ute Indians and the Jicarilla Apaches.

During the American Civil War, Carson led a regiment of mostly Hispanic volunteers from New Mexico on the side of the Union at the Battle of Valverde in 1862. When the Confederate threat was eliminated in New Mexico, Carson led forces to suppress the Navajo, Mescalero Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes by destroying their food sources. He was breveted a brigadier general and took command of Fort Garland, Colorado. He was there only briefly, as poor health forced him to retire from military life.

Carson was married three times and had ten children. He died at Fort Lyon of an aortic aneurysm on May 23, 1868. He is buried in Taos, New Mexico, next to his third wife, Josefa Carson. 

During the late nineteenth century, Kit Carson became a legendary symbol of America&#x27;s frontier experience, which influenced twentieth century erection of statues and monuments, public events and celebrations, imagery by Hollywood, and the naming of geographical places.

== Early life (1809-1829) ==
Christopher Houston Carson was born on December 24, 1809, near Richmond, Madison County, Kentucky. His parents were Lindsay Carson and his second wife, Rebecca Robinson. Lindsay had five children by his first wife, Lucy Bradley, and ten more children by Rebecca. Lindsay Carson had a Scots-Irish Presbyterian background. He was a farmer, a cabin builder, and a veteran of the Mexican–American War, American Indian Wars, and American Civil War. He fought Natives on the American frontier and lost two fingers on his left hand in a battle with the Fox and Sauk Indians.

The Carson family moved to Boone&#x27;s Lick, Howard County, Missouri, when Kit was about a year old. The family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of Daniel Boone, who had purchased the land from the Spanish. The Boone and Carson families became good friends and worked and socialized together and intermarried. Lindsay&#x27;s oldest son, William, married Boone&#x27;s grand-niece, Millie Boone, in 1810. Their daughter Adaline became Kit&#x27;s favorite playmate.

Missouri was then the frontier of American westward expansionism; cabins were &quot;forted&quot; with tall stockade fences to defend against Native attacks. As men worked in the fields, sentries were posted with weapons to protect the farmers. Carson wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;For two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring.&quot;

In 1818, Lindsay Carson died instantly when a tree limb fell on him while he was clearing a field. Kit was about eight years old. Despite being penniless, his mother took care of her children alone for four years. She then married Joseph Martin, a widower with several children. Kit was a young teenager and did not get along with his stepfather. The decision was made to apprentice him to David Workman, a saddler in Franklin, Missouri. Kit wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that Workman was &quot;a good man, and I often recall the kind treatment I received&quot;.

Franklin was situated at the eastern end of the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier. Many of the customers at the saddle shop were trappers and traders from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West. Carson found work in the saddlery not to his taste: he once stated that &quot;the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave.&quot;

=== Santa Fe Trail ===
In August 1826, against his mother&#x27;s wishes, Kit ran away from his apprenticeship. He went west with a caravan of fur trappers and tended their livestock. They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, reaching their destination in November 1826. He settled in Taos.

Carson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson&#x27;s older brothers during the War of 1812. Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper and learning the necessary languages for trade. Eventually, he became fluent in Spanish and several Native American languages.

Workman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one-cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: &quot;Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler&#x27;s trade.&quot;

Between 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest. He also worked at a copper mine near the Gila River, in southwestern New Mexico. In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth. Only three specific women were mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade&#x27;s mother in Washington, DC; and Mrs. Ann White, killed by Natives after the White massacre.

== Mountain man (1829–1841) ==
At the age of 19, Carson began his career as a mountain man. He traveled through many parts of the American West with famous mountain men like Jim Bridger and Old Bill Williams. He spent the winter of 1828–1829 as a cook for Ewing Young in Taos. He joined Young&#x27;s trapping expedition of 1829. The leadership of Young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping Carson&#x27;s early life in the mountains. In addition to furs and the company of other mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure. Carson probably killed and scalped a Native for the first time when he was 19, during Young&#x27;s expedition.

In August 1829, the party went into Apache territory along the Gila River. The expedition was attacked, giving Carson his first experience of combat. Young&#x27;s party continued on to Alta California; trapped and traded in California from Sacramento in the north to Los Angeles in the south; and returned to Taos, New Mexico, in April 1830 after it had trapped along the Colorado River.

Carson joined a rescue party in Taos searching for the perpetrators of an attack on a wagon train, although the perpetrators managed to escape. Carson joined another expedition, led by Thomas Fitzpatrick and William Levin, in 1831. Fitzpatrick, Levin, and his trappers went north to the central Rocky Mountains. Carson hunted and trapped in the West for about ten years. He was known as a reliable man and a good fighter.

Life for Carson as a mountain man was not easy. After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them for months at a time until the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in Wyoming. With the money received for the pelts, the necessities of an independent life, including fish hooks, flour and tobacco, were bought. As there was little or no medical access in the regions in which he worked, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself. There was also sometimes conflict with Indians. Carson&#x27;s primary clothing then was made of deer skins that had stiffened from being left outdoors for a long period of time. This clothing offered some protection against weapons used by hostile Indians.

Grizzly bears were one of the mountain man&#x27;s greatest enemies. In 1834, when Carson was hunting an elk alone, two bears crossed paths with him and quickly chased him up a tree. One of the bears tried, unsuccessfully, to make him fall by shaking the tree, but eventually went away. Carson then returned to his camp as fast as possible. He wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;[The bear] finally concluded to leave, of which I was heartily pleased, never having been so scared in my life.&quot;

Carson&#x27;s Memoirs are full of stories about hostile Indian encounters. In January 1833, for example, warriors of the Crow tribe stole nine horses from Carson&#x27;s camp. Carson and two other men sprayed the Crow camp with gunfire, killing most of the Crow. Carson wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;During our pursuit for the lost animals, we suffered considerably but, the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a redskin to his long home, our sufferings were soon forgotten.&quot;
Carson viewed the Blackfoot Nation as a hostile tribe and the greatest threat to his livelihood and safety. He hated them and killed them at every opportunity. The historian David Roberts wrote: &quot;It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man&#x27;s instinct and duty.&quot; Carson had several encounters with the Blackfoot. His last battle with the Blackfoot took place in spring 1838. He was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by Jim Bridger. In Montana Territory, the group found a teepee with the corpses of three Indians who had died of smallpox inside. Bridger wanted to move on, but Carson and the other young men wanted to kill Blackfoot, so they found the Blackfoot village and killed ten Blackfoot warriors. The Blackfoot found some safety in a pile of rocks but were driven away. It is not known how many Blackfoot died in this incident. The historian David Roberts wrote that &quot;if anything like pity filled Carson&#x27;s breast as, in his twenty-ninth year, he beheld the ravaged camp of the Blackfoot, he did not bother to remember it.&quot; Carson wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that the battle was &quot;the prettiest fight I ever saw&quot;.

His last rendezvous with trappers was held in 1840. At that time, the fur trade began to drop off as beaver hats went out of fashion and beaver populations across North America were declining rapidly from overexploitation. Carson knew that it was time to find other work. He wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else.&quot; In 1841, he was hired at Bent&#x27;s Fort, in Colorado, at the largest building on the Santa Fe Trail. Hundreds of people worked or lived there. Carson hunted buffalo, antelope, deer, and other animals to feed the people, paid one dollar a day. He returned to Bent&#x27;s Fort several times during his life to provide meat for the fort&#x27;s residents.

Carson&#x27;s views about Indians softened over the years. He found himself more and more in their company as he grew older, and his attitude towards them became more respectful and humane. He urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use. As an Indian agent in his later life, he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty and fairness and clothed and fed properly. The historian David Roberts believes his first marriage, to an Arapaho woman named Singing Grass, &quot;softened the stern and pragmatic mountaineer&#x27;s opportunism&quot;.

== Expeditions with Frémont (1842–1848) ==
In April 1842, Carson went back to his childhood home in Missouri to put his daughter Adaline in the care of relatives. On the return trip, Carson met John C. Frémont aboard a steamboat on the Missouri River. Frémont was a US Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers who was about to lead an expedition into the West. After a brief conversation, Frémont hired Carson as a guide at $100 a month, the best-paying job of Carson&#x27;s life. Frémont wrote, &quot;I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting. He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested, with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address; quiet and unassuming.&quot;

=== First expedition, 1842 ===
In 1842, Carson guided Frémont across the Oregon Trail to South Pass, Wyoming. It was their first expedition into the West together. The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass. A guidebook, maps, and other paraphernalia would be printed for westward-bound migrants and settlers. After the five-month trouble-free mission was accomplished, Frémont wrote his government reports, which made Carson&#x27;s name known across the United States, and spurred a migration of settlers westward to Oregon via the Oregon Trail.

=== Second expedition, 1843 ===
In 1843, Carson agreed to join Frémont&#x27;s second expedition. Carson guided Frémont across part of the Oregon Trail to the Columbia River in Oregon. The purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail from South Pass, Wyoming, to the Columbia River. They also made a side-trip to Great Salt Lake in Utah, using a rubber raft to navigate the waters. On the way to California, the party suffered from bad weather in the Sierra Nevada Mountains but was saved by Carson&#x27;s good judgment and his skills as a guide; they found American settlers who fed them. The expedition then headed to California, which was illegal and dangerous because California was Mexican territory. The Mexican government ordered Frémont to leave. Frémont finally went back to Washington, D.C. The government liked his reports but ignored his illegal trip into Mexico. Frémont was made a captain. The newspapers nicknamed him &quot;The Pathfinder&quot;.

During the expedition, Frémont trekked into the Mojave Desert. His party met a Mexican man and boy, who both told Carson that Native Americans had ambushed their party of travelers. The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed. The murderers then stole the Mexican&#x27;s 30 horses. Carson and a mountain man friend, Alexis Godey, went after the murderers. After two days they found them, rushed into their camp, and killed and scalped two of the murderers. The stolen horses were recovered and returned to the Mexican man and boy. That deed brought Carson even greater fame and confirmed his status as a western hero in the eyes of the American people.

=== Third expedition, 1845 ===
In 1845, Carson guided Frémont on their third expedition (Frémont made a fourth, but without Carson). From Westport Landing, Missouri, they crossed the Rockies, passed the Great Salt Lake, and down the Humboldt River to the Sierra Nevada of California and Oregon. Frémont made scientific plans and included artist Edward Kern in his corps, but from the outset the expedition appeared to be political in nature. Frémont may have been working under secret government orders, since US President Polk wanted Alta California for the United States. Once in California, Frémont started to rouse the American settlers into a patriotic fervor. The Mexican general José Castro at Monterey ordered him to leave. On Gavilán Mountain, Frémont erected a makeshift fort and raised the US flag in defiance, before departing north. The party moved into the Sacramento River Valley past Mount Shasta, surveying into Oregon, fighting Indians along the way, and camped near Klamath Lake. Near here, a messenger from Washington, D.C., caught up with Frémont and made it clear that Polk wanted California.

On March 30, 1846, while traveling north along the Sacramento Valley, Frémont&#x27;s party met Americans who said that a group of Native Americans was planning to attack settlers. Frémont&#x27;s party set about searching for Native Americans. On April 5, 1846, Frémont&#x27;s party spotted a Wintu village and launched an unprovoked attack, killing 120 to 300 men, women, and children, and displacing many more in what is known as the Sacramento River massacre.
 Carson, later stated that &quot;It was a perfect butchery.&quot;

At Klamath Lake, in southern Oregon, Frémont&#x27;s party was hit in a revenge attack by 15 to 20 Indians on the night of May 9, 1846. Two or three men in camp were killed. The attackers fled after a brief struggle. Carson, angry that his friends had been killed, took an ax to a dead Indian and, according to Frémont, &quot;knocked his head to pieces&quot;. In retaliation for the attack, a few days later, Frémont&#x27;s party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in what was called the Klamath Lake massacre. The entire village was razed and at least 14 people were killed. There was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack.

=== Bear Flag Revolt ===
In June 1846, Frémont and Carson participated in a California uprising against Mexico, the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. American settlers in California wanted to be free of the Mexican government and declared California an independent republic. The American rebels found the courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont, who had written an oath of allegiance, and his troops behind them. Frémont and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to kill an old Mexican man, José de los Reyes Berreyesa, and his two adult nephews, who had been captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay to prevent them from notifying Mexico about the uprising.

Frémont worked hard to win California for the United States, for a time fashioning himself as its military governor until he was replaced by General Stephen W. Kearny, who outranked him.

From 1846 to 1848, Carson served as courier traveling three times from California to the East and back. Frémont wrote, &quot;This was a service of great trust and honor... and great danger also.&quot; In 1846, dispatched with military records for the Secretary of War in Washington, D.C., Carson took the Gila Trail, but was met on the trail by General Kearny, who ordered him to hand his dispatches to others bound east, and return to California as his much-needed guide. In early 1847, Carson was ordered east from California again with more dispatches for Washington, D.C., where he arrived by June. Returning to California via a short visit with his family in Taos, he followed the Old Spanish Trail to Los Angeles. He was dispatched a third time as government courier leaving Los Angeles in May 1848 via the Old Spanish Trail and reached Washington, D.C., with important military messages, which included an official report of the discovery of gold in California.

Newspapers reported on Carson&#x27;s travels with some exaggeration, including that he had been killed by Plains Indians in July 1848. Lt. George Brewerton accompanied Carson on part of this trip and published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (1853) an account that added to his now-growing celebrity status. In 1848, as his fame grew, a Baltimore hat maker offered a &quot;Kit Carson Cap&quot;, &quot;after the unique style of the domestic one worn by that daring pioneer&quot;. A new steamboat, named the &quot;Kit Carson&quot;, was built for the Mississippi-Ohio river trade, &quot;with qualities of great speed&quot;. At the St. Louis Jockey Club, one could bet on a horse &quot;as swift as the wind&quot;, named &quot;Kit Carson&quot;.

== Mexican–American War (1846–1848) ==
Lasting from 1846 to 1848, the Mexican–American War was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico. After the war, Mexico was forced to sell the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

One of Carson&#x27;s best-known adventures took place during this war. In December 1846, Carson was ordered by General Kearny to guide him and his troops from Socorro, New Mexico, to San Diego, California. Mexican soldiers attacked Kearny and his men near the village of San Pasqual, California.

Kearny was outnumbered. He knew that he could not win and so ordered his men to take cover on a small hill. On the night of December 8, Carson, a naval lieutenant, Edward Fitzgerald Beale, and an Indian scout left Kearny to bring reinforcements from San Diego, away. Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise and walked barefoot through the desert. Carson wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, &quot;Finally got through, but had the misfortune to lose our shoes. Had to travel over a country covered with prickly pear and rocks, barefoot.&quot;

By December 10, Kearny believed that reinforcements would not arrive. He planned to break through the Mexican lines the next morning, but 200 mounted American soldiers arrived in San Pasqual late that night. They swept the area driving the Mexicans away. Kearny was in San Diego on December 12.

==Ranching, family life, and herding sheep (1848–1853)==
After the Mexican–American War transferred California and New Mexico to the United States, Carson returned to Taos to attempt to transition into a career as a businessman and rancher. He developed a small rancho at Rayado, east of Taos, and raised beef. He brought his daughter Adaline from Missouri to join Josefa and the family in a period where family life settled the frontiersman. Josefa loved to sew, and he bought her an early sewing machine, one of the first Singer models, a resourceful tool for their expanding family. She managed the household, in the tradition of the Hispanic women of New Mexico, while he continued shorter travels. In the summer of 1850, he sold a herd of horses to the military at Ft. Laramie, Wyoming. The following year, he took wagons on a trading expedition to Missouri and back along the Santa Fe Trail. In 1852, for old times sake, he and a few of the veteran trappers made a loop trapping expedition through Colorado and Wyoming.

In mid-1853, Carson left New Mexico with 7,000 thin legged churro sheep for the California Trail across Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and into California. He was taking them to settlers in northern California and southern Oregon. Carson had with him six experienced New Mexicans from the haciendas of the Rio Abajo to herd the sheep. Upon his arrival in Sacramento, he was surprised to learn of his elevation, again, to a hero of the Conquest of California; over the rest of his life he was recognized as a celebrated frontiersman, an image developed by publications of varied accuracy.

== Books and dime novels (1847–1859) ==
Carson&#x27;s fame spread throughout the United States with government reports, dime novels, newspaper accounts, and word of mouth. The first accounts published for popular audiences were extracts from Frémont&#x27;s explorations reports as reprinted in period newspapers. Frémont&#x27;s journals, modified by Jesse Benton Frémont into romantic accounts of the uncharted West, appeared in the early 1840s. Newspapers throughout the US and England reprinted excerpts about wild tales of buffalo hunts, vast new landscapes, and indigenous peoples. Carson&#x27;s heroics enlivened the pages. In June 1847, Jesse Benton Frémont helped Carson prepare a brief autobiography, the first, published as an interview in the Washington, D.C. Union, and reprinted by newspapers across the country.

Charles E. Averill (1830–1852), &quot;the youthful novelist&quot;, published a magazine article for &quot;Holden&#x27;s Dollar Magazine&quot; in April 1848 that he expanded into a novel advertised as &quot;Kit Carson, the Prince of the Gold Hunters; or the Adventures of the Sacramento; a Tale of the New Eldorado, Founded on Actual Facts&quot;, an even more fantastic tale exploiting Carson&#x27;s rising fame. It arrived on bookstore shelves by May 1849, in time for the California Gold Rush demand for narratives (fictional or not) on the trail to California. Averill&#x27;s pioneers were in awe of Carson: &quot;Kit Carson!...the famous hunter and adventurer of the Great West, the hardy explorer of the trackless wilderness...the prince of backwoodsmen&quot; arrives to guide them. When later asked about the book, Carson said &quot;every statement made [by Averill] is false.&quot;

Similarly, Emerson Bennett (1822–1905), a prolific novelist of sensational romances, wrote an overland trail account where a fictional Carson joins a California bound wagon train. Arriving in bookstores in January 1849, his &quot;The Prairie Flower, or Adventures in the Far West&quot; exploited the Carson myth, and, like Averill, quickly followed with a sequel. In each novel, the Westering immigrants are in awe of the famous Carson. Both novelists sensationalized the fictional Carson as an &quot;Indian fighter&quot;, with gruesome trashy accounts as &quot;red-skins&quot; &quot;bite the dust&quot; (Averill, &quot;Gold Hunter&quot;). For example, of one victim, Averill wrote, &quot;blood gushed in a copious stream from his nostrils&quot;; while Bennett wrote &quot;Kit Carson, like an embodied spirit of battle, thundered past me on his powerful charger, and bending forward in his saddle, with a motion quick as lightning itself, seized the scalp lock of my antagonist in one hand, and with the other completely severed his head from his body, which he bore triumphantly away&quot; (Bennett, &quot;Prairie Flower&quot;, p. 64). The novelists&#x27; gruesome, gory and sensationalized woolly West descriptions would keep readers turning the pages, and buying more buckets-of-blood fictional accounts of Carson, especially during the coming age of dime novels.

=== Indian captive Ann White ===

Carson&#x27;s reaction to his depiction in these first novels is suggested by the account of events around the fate of Ann White. In 1849, as he moved to civilian life at Taos and Rayado, Carson was asked to guide soldiers on the trail of White, her baby daughter, and &quot;negro servant&quot;, who had been captured by Jicarilla Apaches and Utes. The commanding officer, Captain William Grier of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, ignored Carson&#x27;s advice about an immediate rescue attempt after catching the Jicarillas unaware, but after a shot was fired the order was given to attack, and the Jicarillas had started to flee. As Carson describes it in his autobiography, &quot;In about 200 yards, pursuing the Indians, the body of Mrs. White was found, perfectly warm, had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow... I am certain that if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved.&quot; Her child and servant were taken away by the fleeing Jicarillas and killed shortly after the attack, according to an 1850 report by James S. Calhoun, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico.

A soldier in the rescue party wrote: &quot;Mrs. White was a frail, delicate, and very beautiful woman, but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained; it was literally covered with blows and scratches. Her countenance even after death indicated a hopeless creature. Over her corpse, we swore vengeance upon her persecutors.&quot;

Carson discovered a fictional book, possibly by Averill, about himself in the Apache camp. He wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;: &quot;In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds, and I have often thought that Mrs. White would read the same, and knowing that I lived near, she would pray for my appearance and that she would be saved.&quot; The real Carson had met the fictional Carson and was deeply upset at his inability to have saved White, for he had failed to live up to the growing myth around himself. He was sorry for the rest of his life that he had not rescued White; the dime-novel Carson would have saved her.

=== Memoirs ===
In 1854, Lt. Brewerton encouraged Carson to send him a sketch of his life, and offered to polish it into a book. Carson dictated a &quot;memoir&quot; of some 33,000 words over the next few years, but moved on to another collaborator. Friend Jesse B. Turley was engaged in late 1856 to help Carson prepare the memoir, and after a year&#x27;s work sent the rough manuscript to a New York publisher. In 1858, Dr. DeWitte Clinton Peters (1829–1876), a U. S. Army surgeon who had met Carson in Taos, acquired the manuscript and with Charles Hatch Smith (1829–1882), a Brooklyn lawyer turned music teacher, sometime preacher, and author rewrote it for publication. The biography was titled &quot;Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Rocky Mountains, from Facts Narrated by Himself&quot;. When the book was read to Carson, he said, &quot;Peters laid it on a leetle too thick.&quot; Originally offered by subscription by Smith&#x27;s publisher, W. R. C. Clark &amp; Co., New York City, it quickly earned rave reviews, not for its prose but its subject matter. The first run, a pricey $2.50 gilt edition or $4 antiqued copy, included a note signed (maybe) by Carson authenticating the story and the authorization given to Dr. Peters for the work. The Peters (with the help of Smith) biography had expanded the slim memoirs by five times (to 534 pages), with much edited-in filler, moralizing, and tedium. A cheaper edition was published in 1859, followed by two imitations that stole the market. In 1860, Charles Burdett, &quot;a writer of no particular distinction&quot;, wrote a biography based on the Dr. Peters work, published as &quot;The Life of Kit Carson, the Great Western Hunter&quot;. The great house of inexpensive novels and questionable nonfiction, Beadle&#x27;s Dime Library, in 1861, brought out &quot;The Life and Times of Kit Carson, the Rocky Mountain Scout and Guide&quot; by Edward S. Ellis, one of the stable of writers used by the firm. A popular, shorter work, it also used the Dr. Peters biography, which itself Peters revised in 1874 to bring the biography up to Carson&#x27;s 1868 death. It is unknown if Carson profited from any of these publications based on his memoirs.

In 1905, among the estate of Dr. Peter&#x27;s son in Paris, was located the original Carson memoir. This was published with little comment in 1926, followed by a revised or &quot;polished&quot; version in 1935, and, finally, in 1968, a solidly annotated edition edited by Harvey Lewis Carter, who had cleared up much of the background about the manuscript. Carson&#x27;s memoir is the most important source about his life, to 1858, but as Carter notes, Carson was too brief, had lapses in memory, and his chronology was fallible. One frustrated author wrote of the Carson memoir that it &quot;is as skinny as a hairless Chihuahua dog and as bald of details as a white egg&quot;.

=== Dime novels ===
During the last half of the nineteenth century, inexpensive novels and pseudo-nonfiction met the need of readers looking for entertainment. Among the major publishing firms was the house of Beadle, opened in 1860. One study, &quot;Kit Carson and Dime Novels, the Making of a Legend&quot; by Darlis Miller, notes some 70 dime novels about Carson were either published, re-published with new titles, or incorporated into new works over the period 1860–1901. The usual blood-and-thunder tales exploited Carson&#x27;s name to sell copies. When competition threatened the house of Beadle, a word-smith said they &quot;just kill more Indians&quot; per page to increase sales. Skewed images of the personalities and place are exemplified by the Beadle title: &quot;Kiowa Charley, The White Mustanger; or, Rocky Mountain Kit&#x27;s Last Scalp Hunt&quot; (1879) in which an older Carson is said to have &quot;ridden into Sioux camps unattended and alone, had ridden out again, but with the scalps of their greatest warriors at his belt&quot;. Edward Ellis, biographer of Carson, wrote under the pseudonym of J. F. C. Adams &quot;The Fighting Trapper or Kit Carson to the Rescue&quot; (1879), another lurid work without any hint of reality.

By the 1880s, the shoot-em-up gunslinger was replacing the frontiersman tales, but of those in the new generation, one critic notes, &quot;where Kit Carson had been represented as slaying hundreds of Indians, the [new] dime novel hero slew his thousands, with one hand tied behind him.&quot; The dime novel&#x27;s impact was the blurring of the real Carson by creating a mythic character. In fiction, according to historian of literature Richard Etulain, &quot;the small, wiry Kit Carson becomes a ring-tailed roarer, a gigantic Samson...a strong-armed demigod [who] could be victorious and thus pave the way for western settlement.&quot;

== Indian Agent (1854–1861) ==
Between January 1854 and May 1861, Carson served as one of the first Federal Indian Agents in the Far West. He sold his interest in the Rayado ranch and opened an office in a room of his Taos home, gratis—the office would be perpetually underfunded. He was responsible for the Maoche Ute people, Jicarilla Apache, and Taos Pueblo in a vast expanse of northern New Mexico Territory (which then included southwest Colorado). His duties were broad and insurmountable: &quot;prevent conflict as far as possible, to persuade the Indians to submit to the government&#x27;s will, and to solve problems arising from contact between Indians and whites&quot;.

The seven years as agent is probably the best documented of his life because of the correspondence, weekly and annual reports, and special filings required by the position (he had a private secretary because he could not write; some believe the secretary took the dictation also for his memoir). He summarized meetings with tribes - almost a daily occurrence when home - such as disputes over who stole whose cow, and the day-to-day effort to help with food, clothes and presents for tribes. He negotiated a halt of Plains tribes killing Taos Pueblo Indians desiring the traditional hunt of buffalo near Raton. Carson had the advantage of knowing at least fourteen Indian dialects as well as being a master of sign language.

One complex issue was captives. For example, captives stolen from Navajo by Ute were sold in the New Mexico settlements, or of a white child from central Texas settlements taken captive by Plains tribes then sold in New Mexico. As agent, Carson intervened.

Much of Carson&#x27;s work as agent has been overlooked because of the focus on his mountain-man explorer or blood-and-thunder image. This was a significant period for him as well as the region, which experienced a large folk migration of Hispanos into Indian lands, as well as the Colorado gold rush and its impact on the tribes. Carson&#x27;s view of the best future for the nomadic Indian evolved. By the late 1850s, he recommended, to make way for the increasing number of white settlers, that they should give up hunting and become herders and farmers, be provided with missionaries to Christianize them, and move onto reserves in their homeland but distant from settlements with their bad influence of ardent spirits, disease, and unscrupulous Hispanos and Anglos. Carson predicted, &quot;If permitted to remain as they are, before many years they will be utterly extinct.&quot;

== Military career (1861–1868) ==

In April 1861, when the American Civil War broke out, many officers from the South in the United States Army resigned their commissions and offered their services to the Confederate States of America or their home states. Some of those officers were then serving in New Mexico Territory and included James Longstreet and Richard S. Ewell, both of whom gained senior rank in the Army of Northern Virginia, and Henry Hopkins Sibley. Arriving in Richmond, Sibley persuaded President Jefferson Davis to appoint him a brigadier general and lead a brigade of mounted cavalry to conquer New Mexico Territory and possibly Colorado Territory, southern California and the northern parts of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua.

When Confederate forces captured southern New Mexico Territory, the Union military commander, Colonel Edward Canby, ordered the governor to call for volunteers to defend the territory. Carson resigned his position as agent to the Ute Indian Tribe and volunteered to defend the Territory. Mindful that Carson had experienced military discipline as an army scout under Fremont and, later, with General Stephen Kearny during the War with Mexico, the governor appointed Carson the Lieutenant Colonel of the First New Mexico Volunteer Infantry. During the summer of 1861, Carson worked to organize the regiment of approximately one thousand men, most of whom were from prominent Hispanic families, at Fort Union in northeast New Mexico Territory. On September 21, the regiment&#x27;s colonel resigned, and Carson assumed command.

=== Action against the Confederates ===

Canby had reservations about the fighting qualities of the volunteers and believed that his regular infantry were at a disadvantage in the vastness of New Mexico to the mounted Confederate cavalry. He decided to avoid fighting the Texans in the open field and strengthened the stone and adobe walls of his southern bastion, Fort Craig (about one hundred miles north of Mesilla). In January 1862, concluding that the Texans would invade northward up the Rio Grande River Valley, Canby consolidated most of his regular infantry and New Mexico volunteer regiments at Fort Craig. Following orders, Carson marched his First New Mexico regiment south from Albuquerque to form part of the fort&#x27;s garrison.

On February 19, 1862, Carson led his regiment east across the Rio Grande to occupy high ground across from Fort Craig to protect the post from a Confederate-turning move. The next day, Canby joined Carson&#x27;s regiment with the bulk of the regulars. However, when Texan artillery fire panicked troops from the Second New Mexico Volunteers, Canby withdrew most of his force back to the fort. Carson and his regiment remained on the east bank of the Rio Grande to protect the left flank of the Union line.

Two days later, the Confederate force sought to cross the Rio Grande to the west bank at the Valverde ford, about six miles north of Fort Craig. Canby deployed regulars and Colorado volunteer units as his front line. He assigned Carson&#x27;s regiment to a support position behind the regulars on the left and, later in the fight, the center of the Union line.

Later in the day, Carson crossed to the east side of the river toward the Confederates. He advanced his regiment four hundred yards along the right flank of the Union line until ordered to withdraw. After the day-long battle, the Union force retreated to Fort Craig where Carson reported one enlisted man killed, one wounded, and eleven missing.

Following the Battle at Valverde, the Confederates moved north up the Rio Grande. In late March, Colorado volunteers destroyed the Confederate supply trains at the Battle of Glorieta Pass, necessitating that the Texans abandon their invasion of New Mexico Territory. Canby took the regulars north from Fort Craig to harass the retreating Confederates and herd them back to Texas. Carson and his regiment remained in Fort Craig. Although the starving Confederates passed a few miles to the west of the fort, Canby, seeing no need to risk a pitched battle with a defeated and retreating foe, did not order Carson to confront the Confederate column. Carson and his regiment remained in Fort Craig through the spring and summer of 1862.

Canby held Carson&#x27;s regiment in reserve at the Battle at Valverde and assigned it and other New Mexico volunteer regiments to passively garrison Fort Craig while he used regulars and Colorado volunteer troops to herd the Texans out of the territory. He believed that the Hispanic volunteers would not stand up to the Texans in combat. Canby reported that the &quot;people of the Territory, with few exceptions, I believe, are loyal, but they are apathetic in disposition,&quot; which explained their &quot;tardiness&quot; in volunteering. He contended that he could &quot;place no reliance upon any volunteer force that can be raised, unless strongly supported by regular troops.&quot; Carson concurred. He co-signed a letter stating &quot;that without the support and protection of the Regular Army of the United States they [New Mexicans] are entirely unable to protect the public property in the Territory or the lives of such officers, civil and military, as may be left among them after the withdrawal of the regular forces...&quot;

=== Rounding up the Mescalero Apaches ===
To confront the Texans, in 1861, Canby had consolidated his available force by pulling in the garrisons from posts built to control the Apache and Navajo Indians. When Canby ordered his troops to abandon Fort Stanton (about eighty miles east of Fort Craig) in August 1861, about two hundred of the approximately five hundred Mescalero Apache Indians were subsisting on rations distributed to them by the army. With those supplies no longer available, some of the nine bands of Mescalero Apache Indians began raiding ranches and communities near their homeland in the Capitan Mountains.

Brigadier General James Carleton, of the First California Volunteer Cavalry, succeeded Canby as military commander of the territory in the fall of 1862. He then sent Carson and five companies of his regiment to occupy and re-build Fort Stanton. Carleton&#x27;s confidential orders of October 12, 1862 to Carson, in part, read:

&quot;All Indian men of that tribe [Mescalero Apache] are to be killed whenever and wherever you find them: the 
women and children will not be harmed, but you will take them prisoners and feed them at Fort Stanton...&quot;

Carleton felt that &quot;this severity in the long run will be the most humane course that could be pursued toward these Indians.&quot; He intended to re-settle the Mescalero Apache Indians from their traditional lands in the Capitan Mountains to a reservation along the Pecos River at Bosque Redondo, near present-day Fort Sumner. In Carleton&#x27;s vision, the government would teach the hunting-and-gathering Mescalero bands the arts of agriculture, thereby keeping them from marauding outside the reservation.

Before Carson arrived at Fort Stanton, Company H, commanded by Captain James Graydon, encountered a band of about thirty Mescalero Apache Indians under chiefs Manuelito and Jose Largo at Gallinas Springs on October 20, 1862. According to Major Arthur Morrison, Graydon &quot;deceived&quot; the Indians by offering them provisions and then shot and killed the two chiefs and nine others and wounded another twenty. Carson&#x27;s inquiry into the matter came to naught when Graydon, months later, died of a wound received in a duel.

However, the shock of these killings, along with the fight between two companies of the First California Volunteer Cavalry from Fort Fillmore and a band of Apaches in Dog Canyon near Alamogordo, induced most of the surviving Mescalero chiefs to surrender to Carson. By March 1863, the army had settled the few hundred surviving Mescalero Apache Indians on Bosque Redondo near the newly built Fort Sumner. Perhaps a hundred of the Mescalero Apache Indians, such as the band led by Santana, either fled to Mexico or joined other Apache tribes to the west.

=== Campaign against the Navajo ===
Carleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation, which was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove). He chose the site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements. He also wanted the Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo. He thought also that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement.

The Mescalero Apaches walked to the reservation. By March 1863, 400 Apaches had settled around nearby Fort Sumner. Others had fled west to join fugitive bands of Apaches. By mid-summer, many of the people were planting crops and doing other farm work.

On July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe. His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on sight and to take the women and children captives. No peace treaties were to be made until all Navajo were on the reservation.

Carson searched far and wide for the Navajo. He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands. The roundup proved frustrating for Carson. He was in his fifties and tired and ill. By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields and remove their animals from the area. The Navajo would starve if the destruction continued, and 188 surrendered and were sent to Bosque Redondo. Life at the Bosque had turned grim, and murders took place. The Apaches and Navajos fought. The water in the Pecos contained minerals that gave people cramps and stomach aches. Residents had to walk to find firewood.

=== Battle of Canyon de Chelly ===

Carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign. Major General Carleton refused and ordered him to invade the Canyon de Chelly, where many Navajos had taken refuge. The historian David Roberts writes, &quot;Carson&#x27;s sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863–1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign.&quot;

The Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo. They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary, and 300 Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim, called Fortress Rock. They resisted Carson&#x27;s invasion by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight. The 300 Navajo survived the invasion. In January 1864, Carson swept through the Canyon with his forces, including Captain Albert Pfeiffer. The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down. Few Navajo were killed or captured. Carson&#x27;s invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the United States could invade their territory at any time. Many Navajo surrendered at Fort Defiance, Arizona.

By March 1864, there were 3,000 refugees at Fort Canby, with 5,000 more joining later. Suffering from the intense cold and hunger, Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe the Navajo and forced the thousands of them to walk to Bosque Redondo. Many died along the way, and those falling behind were fatally shot. In Navajo history, the horrific trek is known as Long Walk of the Navajo. By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure, Major General Carleton was fired, and Congress started investigations. In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland. Bosque Redondo was closed.

=== First Battle of Adobe Walls ===
On November 25, 1864, Carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the First Battle of Adobe Walls in the Texas Panhandle. Adobe Walls was an abandoned trading post that had been blown up by its inhabitants to prevent a takeover by hostile Indians. Combatants at the First Battle were the US Army and Indian scouts against Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches. It was one of the largest engagements fought on the Great Plains.

The battle was the result of General Carleton&#x27;s belief that Indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail. He wanted to punish them and brought in Carson to do the job. With most of the army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection that the settlers sought was almost nonexistent. Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts. In addition, he had two mountain howitzers which were fired at the cdr

On the morning of November 25, Carson discovered and attacked a Kiowa village of 176 lodges. After destroying the village, he moved forward to Adobe Walls. Carson found other Comanche villages in the area and realized he would face a very large force of Native Americans. A Captain Pettis estimated that 1,200 to 1,400 Comanche and Kiowa began to assemble. That number would swell, according to some accounts, to an implausible 3,000. Four to five hours of battle ensued. When Carson ran low on ammunition and howitzer shells, he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby Kiowa village, where they burned the village and many fine buffalo robes. His Indian scouts killed and mutilated four elderly and weak Kiowas.

First Adobe Walls, northeast of Stinnett in Hutchinson County, Texas, was Carson&#x27;s last military engagement and ended inconclusively. Three of Carson&#x27;s men died, and twenty-one were wounded. More than 100 warriors lost their lives, and 200 were wounded.

The retreat to New Mexico then began with few deaths among Carson&#x27;s men. General Carleton wrote to Carson: &quot;This brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so nobly won in the service of your country.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1847, the future General William Tecumseh Sherman met Carson in Monterey, California. Sherman wrote: &quot;His fame was then at its height... and I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still wilder Indians of the plains... I cannot express my surprise at beholding such a small, stoop-shouldered man, with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage or daring. He spoke but little and answered questions in monosyllables.&quot;

Colonel Edward W. Wynkoop wrote: &quot;Kit Carson was five feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140 pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, squarely built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body. But, his head and face made up for all the imperfections of the rest of his person. His head was large and well-shaped with yellow straight hair, worn long, falling on his shoulders. His face was fair and smooth as a woman&#x27;s with high cheekbones, straight nose, a mouth with a firm, somewhat sad expression yet kissable lips, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty.&quot;

Lieutenant George Douglas Brewerton made one coast-to-coast dispatch-carrying trip to Washington, DC, with Carson. Brewerton wrote: &quot;The Kit Carson of my &quot;imagination&quot; was over six feet high—a sort of modern Hercules in his build—with an enormous beard, and a voice like a roused lion... The real Kit Carson I found to be a plain, simple... man; rather below the medium height, with brown, curling hair, little or no beard, and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman&#x27;s. In fact, the hero of a hundred desperate encounters, whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness, where the white man is almost unknown, was one of Dame Nature&#x27;s gentleman...&quot;

=== Freemasonry ===
Carson joined Freemasonry in the Santa Fe Territory of New Mexico, petitioning in Montezuma Lodge No. 101. He was initiated an Entered Apprentice on April 22, 1854, passed to the degree of Fellowcraft June 17, 1854, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason December 26, 1854, just two days after his 42nd birthday. Carson, together with several other Freemasons in Taos, petitioned to charter Bent Lodge No. 204 (now Bent Lodge # 42) from the Grand Lodge of Missouri AF&amp;AM, a request that was granted on June 1, 1860, with Carson elected Junior Warden of the lodge. Carson served as Senior Warden the following year and would have served as Worshipful Master, but the lodge went dark due to the Civil War.

The Masonic fraternity continued to serve him and his family well after his death. In 1908, the Grand Lodge of New Mexico erected a wrought iron fence around his family burial plot. The following year, the Grand Lodge of New Mexico granted a new charter to Bent Lodge 42 and challenged the Lodge to purchase and preserve Carson&#x27;s home. More than a century later, the Museum of Kit Carson&#x27;s House is still managed by Bent Lodge.

=== Marriages ===
Carson was married three times. His first two wives were Native American. His third wife was born of an old Hispanic family in Taos, New Mexico, then part of the Republic of Mexico. Carson was the father of ten children. He never wrote about his first two marriages in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;. He may have thought he would be known as a &quot;squaw man&quot;, which was not welcomed by polite society.

In 1836, Carson met an Arapaho woman, Waanibe (Singing Grass, or Grass Singing), at a mountain man rendezvous held along the Green River in Wyoming. Singing Grass was a lovely young woman, and many mountain men were in love with her. Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper, Chouinard, for Waanibe&#x27;s hand in marriage. Carson won but had a very narrow escape. The French trapper&#x27;s bullet singed his hair. The duel was one of the best known stories about Carson in the 19th century.

Carson married Singing Grass. She tended to his needs and went with him on his trapping trips. They had a daughter, Adaline (or Adeline). Singing Grass died after she had given birth to Carson&#x27;s second daughter circa 1839. His second child did not live long. In 1843, in Taos, the young child fell into a boiling kettle of soap tallow and subsequently died.
Carson&#x27;s life as a mountain man was too hard for a little girl, so he took Adaline to live with his sister Mary Ann Carson Rubey in St. Louis, Missouri. Adaline was taught in a school for girls. Carson brought her West when she was a teenager. She married and divorced a George Stilts of St. Louis. In 1858, she went to the California goldfields. Adaline died in 1860 or after 1862, probably in Mono County, California.

In 1841, Carson married a Cheyenne woman, Making-Out-Road. They were together only a short time. Making-Out-Road divorced him in the way of her people by putting Adaline and all of Carson&#x27;s property outside their tent. Making-Out-Road left Carson to travel with her people through the West.

About 1842, Carson met Josefa Jaramillo, the daughter of a prominent Mexican couple living in Taos. To marry her, Carson left the Presbyterian Church for the Catholic Church. He married the 14-year-old Josefa on February 6, 1843. They had eight children.

=== Illiteracy ===
Despite being fluent in multiple European and Indian languages, Carson was illiterate. He was embarrassed by that and tried to hide it. In 1856, he dictated his &quot;Memoirs&quot; to another and stated: &quot;I was a young boy in the school house when the cry came, Injuns! I jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book, and thar it lies.&quot;

Carson enjoyed having other people read to him and preferred the poetry of Lord Byron. Carson thought that Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s long poem, &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; was &quot;the finest expression of outdoor life&quot;. Carson eventually learned to write &quot;C. Carson&quot;, but it was very difficult for him. He made his mark on official papers, and it was then witnessed by a clerk or other official.

==Final days==
When the Civil War ended, and the Indian Wars campaigns were in a lull, Carson was appointed brevet brigadier general (dated March 13, 1865) and appointed commandant of Ft. Garland, Colorado, in the heart of Ute territory. Carson had many Ute friends in the area and assisted in government relations.

After being mustered out of the army, Carson took up ranching, settling at Boggsville in Bent County. In 1868, at the urging of Washington and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Carson journeyed to Washington, D.C., where he escorted several Ute Chiefs to meet with the US president to plead for assistance to their tribe. While in Washington, Carson was referred to a doctor by the name of Lewis Albert Sayre who lived in New York City. Carson made the short journey by train and met with Dr. Sayre who confirmed what Carson had already feared, he was suffering from an aneurysm. This wasn&#x27;t new information for Carson, back in Colorado, Dr. Tilton had previously diagnosed him, and when he returned the doctor was shocked by the declining state of Carson. In fact, Carson was in such poor health that &quot;...Dr. Tilton thought the trip had all but killed him&quot; according to Hampton Sides in his book, &quot;Blood and Thunder&quot;. The trip to Washington, D.C., had taken a toll on Carson and caused the symptoms from his aneurysm to worsen.

Soon after his return, his wife, Josefa, died from complications after she gave birth to their eighth child. Her death was a crushing blow to Carson. According to Carson&#x27;s son, Charles, &quot;he just seemed to pine away after Mother died&quot;. The combination of a long and exhausting journey with the passing of his wife had a devastating effect on Carson. He died a month later, age 58, on May 23, 1868, in the presence of Dr. Tilton and his friend Thomas Boggs in the surgeon&#x27;s quarters at Fort Lyon, Colorado. His last words were &quot;Goodbye, friends. &quot;Adiós, compadres.&quot;&quot; The cause of his death was abdominal aortic aneurysm. His resting place is Taos, New Mexico.

== Monument and memorials ==

The first Kit Carson monument, erected in Santa Fe in 1885 at the federal courthouse, was a simple stone obelisk with inscriptions including the words &quot;pathfinder, pioneer, soldier&quot;, and &quot;He Led the Way&quot;. Union Civil War veterans, the Grand Army of the Republic, led the fundraising and dedicated it &quot;to remember the brave deeds of a pioneer and patriot who fought for his country&quot;.

In 1907, the Daughters of the American Revolution began placing monuments along the Santa Fe Trail and other sites that Carson had known. For example, the DAR guides noted the monument to Carson at Santa Fe and his and Josefa&#x27;s home in Taos and the nearby cemetery, where his grave had been marked by the Grand Army of the Republic.

The first statues were erected in Colorado. In 1911, the granddaughter of Carson unveiled an equestrian statue at the community park near the state capitol in Denver. It &quot;honored the great explorer&quot; and was inscribed as well with &quot;He Led the Way&quot;. In Trinidad, Colorado, the Daughters of the American Revolution and Boy Scouts of America led fund raising for the bronze statue of Carson in the city&#x27;s new Kit Carson Park, placed in 1913.

Californians followed with a statue of Carson on Olvera Street in Los Angeles, and a bronze representation of a tree trunk with &quot;Carson 1844&quot; inscribed on it, placed at Carson Pass in the Sierra Nevada. Both represented him as the explorer. Other statues or monuments followed in California, Washington, D.C. (sculpted by Isidore Konti), Nevada, and elsewhere.

==In popular culture==
=== Early movies and television ===
Grand popular culture imagery of Carson, expressed through Hollywood cinema, began with the 1928 silent film &quot;Kit Carson&quot; from Paramount, a purported real-life story of Carson and the conquest of California. It was followed with a talking movie series begun in 1933, with 12 chapters, titled &quot;Fighting with Kit Carson&quot; with a cast including Johnny Mack Brown (as Kit) and both Noah Beery and Noah Beery Jr., with &quot;plenty of stunts and action&quot;. Paramount&#x27;s crew converted the series into a feature-length film, &quot;Fighting with Kit Carson&quot;, in 1946. These popular matinee westerns strove for entertainment, not for accuracy, and exploited the Kit Carson name and myth.

The Kit Carson character played minor roles in other 1930s Westerns like the 1936 &quot;Sutter&#x27;s Gold&quot;, loosely about the California gold discovery; and the 1939 &quot;Mutiny on the Blackhawk&quot;, an odd western with a mutiny on a slave ship that lands in California with Kit Carson and others ready to save the day. The 1940 western titled &quot;Kit Carson&quot; stars Jon Hall (as Kit), Dana Andrews (as Fremont), and others. Kit joins Captain John Fremont to guide a wagon train just as Mexican General Castro orders all Americans from California, then the conquest of California begins, a tale enlivened with gratuitous Indian attacks. Filmed in Kayenta, Arizona, and nearby Monument Valley, Navajo were hired as part of the crew.

From 1951 to 1955, the television show &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot; ran for 105 episodes. He was a buckskin-clad heroic character who fights robbers, villains, and other bad guys. Bill Williams, who played Kit, complained that the show lacked the drama of the real Kit because of censors, NAFBRAT, wanting to eliminate violence from children&#x27;s show. &quot;Its all in the history books&quot;, Williams told the press, &quot;the real Kit should be tough&quot;, fighting bears and mountain lions. He was a &quot;famous Indian fighter&quot;. To him, TV Kit was &quot;a sissy on horseback&quot;.

=== &quot;Kit Carson Days&quot; celebrations ===
The celebration of a community&#x27;s past was a popular event by early in the twentieth century. A mountain man or &quot;Kit Carson&quot; themed history celebration was one of many that began to appear. They were not events to retell the accurate life of Kit Carson, but the mythic Kit. Alamosa, Colorado, Taos, New Mexico, Jackson, California and elsewhere all had begun hosting &quot;Kit Carson Days&quot; celebrations by the 1930s. The event would have a mountain man camp, part of a living history spectacle, and include muzzle loading musket firing.

By the 1960s, Escondido, California&#x27;s &quot;Kit Carson Days&quot; celebration included a reenactment of the &quot;Battle of San Pasqual&quot; and Indian dances at Kit Carson Park. Some advertised an emphasis on family fun, with children at the end of a parade—the &quot;Kiddie Carson&quot; parade—and young women competing to be &quot;Kittie Carson&quot;. Because of COVID-19, none were scheduled for 2020.
=== Historic preservation ===

Though structures that Carson would have known had been preserved before 1950, full scale historic preservation projects of sites specifically significant for their association with Kit Carson did not begin until 1950s. In 1952, the Masonic Lodge of Taos, which had inherited the Carson home, restored and opened his classic adobe house as the Kit Carson Home and Museum, one representative of the early 19th century architecture and Hispano family setting but significant because of Carson. That same year, the state of New Mexico acquired the grave site and established Kit Carson State Park and Memorial Cemetery. The museum emphasized his early career, from around 1843 (when the Carsons bought the home) into the 1850s. Nearby, the former site of his Rayado home, acquired by the Boy Scouts of America, was reconstructed in spirit if not accuracy (no original architectural documents are extant) during the 1950s.

== Reputation ==
In 1950, professor Henry Nash Smith published his classic &quot;Virgin Land, the American West as Symbol and Myth&quot;. A new type of study, one that looked at literature to understand the general public&#x27;s view of the frontier, and its creation myth and symbols. To Smith, Carson represented the symbolic mountain man image created first in the novels of James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, the pathfinder who went into the wilderness as advance pioneer for civilization. Smith details the creation of mythic Carson as a national hero, as well as &quot;Indian fighter, the daredevil horseman, the slayer of grizzly bears, the ancestor of the hundreds of two-gun men who came later decades to people the Beadle dime novels&quot;. Other writers defined two distinct Carsons portrayed in nineteenth century literature, of myth vs. reality. During the first half of the twentieth century, the general public put those beliefs in the mythic Carson into popular actions by erecting monuments and statues, holding public celebrations, and supporting early movies and television.

The 1970 publication of Dee Brown&#x27;s best-selling &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; opened the eyes of the reading public to the tragic history of Native Americans which spurred a revaluation of the role of Carson in the Navajo wars. Over the last fifty years, echoing Brown, other writers, fiction and nonfiction, have split the mythic tale from Henry Nash Smith&#x27;s Carson as symbol of America&#x27;s heroic narrative of opening the West to create that of Carson as symbol for how the nation mistreated its indigenous peoples.

In 1973, during the annual Taos Fiesta, protesters declared that Carson should be stripped of historical honors, his grave at Taos threatened with exhumation, and the renaming of Kit Carson State Park was demanded. Taos led in reconsideration, in a public forum, as to whether Carson was the hero of old or a &quot;blood thirsty imperialist&quot;. To one group represented, the American Indian Movement, Carson was responsible for the murder, or genocide of Native Americans. A subsequent history symposium, in 1993 in Taos, tried to enlighten and explain the frontiersman, to air various views. The Navajo were invited, but refused to attend. Voicing one extreme view, an anthropologist remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s like trying to rehabilitate Adolf Hitler.&quot;

New Mexico historian Marc Simmons published a piece that was presented at the 1993 conference. He started with the history of vandalizing of Carson related sites, the painting of a black swastika on his grave and the scratching of the word &quot;killer&quot; on a nearby marker, of the defacing of the Kit Carson monument in Santa Fe. He related how a young professor at Colorado College was successful in demanding that a period photograph of Carson be removed from the ROTC office; how a tourist told a journalist at the Carson home in Taos, &quot;I will not go into the home of that racist, genocidal killer.&quot;; and a Navajo at a trading post said, &quot;No one here will talk about Kit Carson. He was a butcher.&quot; Other examples were presented, then Simmons followed with a brief explanation of Carson and his times, a theme expanded by Tom Dunlay in, what Simmons calls a magisterial, balanced treatment of the world of &quot;Kit Carson &amp; the Indians&quot; (2000).

In the early twenty-first century, best-selling writers Hampton Sides and David Roberts have reappraised the Carson reputation in their works, and have explained the complex image of Carson. While a heroic image or reputation of Carson is expressed in the earlier, 1968, biography by Harvey Carter, the older narrative has been revised by both Sides and Roberts: In 1968, Carter stated, &quot;In respect to his actual exploits and his actual character, however, Carson was not overrated. If history has to single out one person from among the Mountain Men to receive the admiration of later generations, Carson is the best choice. He had far more of the good qualities and fewer of the bad qualities than anyone else in that varied lot of individuals.&quot; In 2000, David Roberts wrote, &quot;Carson&#x27;s trajectory, over three and a half decades, from thoughtless killer of Apaches and Blackfeet to defender and champion of the Utes, marks him out as one of the few frontiersmen whose change of heart toward the Indians, born not of missionary theory but of first-hand experience, can serve as an exemplar for the more enlightened policies that sporadically gained the day in the twentieth century.&quot; In 2006, Sides said that Carson believed the Native Americans needed reservations as a way of physically separating and shielding them from white hostility and white culture. He is said to have viewed the raids on white settlements as driven by desperation, &quot;committed from absolute necessity when in a starving condition&quot;. Indian hunting grounds were disappearing as waves of white settlers filled the region.

A final statement from biographer Roberts in 2000 was &quot;the fate in recent years of Kit Carson&#x27;s reputation makes for a more perverse lesson in the vicissitudes of fame.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Carson&#x27;s home in Taos, New Mexico, is the Kit Carson Home and Museum. His tourist attraction grave is nearby in the former Kit Carson State Park, now managed as a city park. A Kit Carson monument obelisk (1885) stands at the Santa Fe, New Mexico federal building park. The Kit Carson marker of bronze, dedicated to his 1844 trip, is in Carson Pass, California. A 1913 statue of Kit Carson stands at Trinidad, Colorado&#x27;s Kit Carson Park. In Denver, Colorado, an equestrian statue of Kit Carson on horseback that once stood atop the Pioneer Fountain was removed and stored in 2020.

Carson National Forest in New Mexico was named for him, as were Kit Carson County and the town of Kit Carson, both in Colorado. A river and valley in Nevada are named for Carson as well as the state&#x27;s capital, Carson City. The Carson Plain in southwest Arizona is named for him.

Kit Carson Peak in the Sangre de Cristo range in Colorado, Kit Carson Mesa in Colfax County, New Mexico, and Carson Pass in Alpine County, California, and the Carson River in Alpine County, California and Douglas, Storey, Lyon, and Churchill Counties in Nevada, are all named in honor for him.

Fort Carson, an army post near the city of Colorado Springs, Colorado, was named after him during World War II by the popular vote of the men training there. Kit Carson Park in Escondido, California, and in Taos, New Mexico are named in honor for him. Innumerable streets, businesses, and lesser geographical features were given his name.

<text>A kipper is a whole herring, a small, oily fish, that has been split in a butterfly fashion from tail to head along the dorsal ridge, gutted, salted or pickled, and cold-smoked over smouldering wood chips (typically oak).

In the United Kingdom, Ireland and some regions of North America, kippers are most commonly eaten for breakfast. In the United Kingdom, kippers, along with other preserved smoked or salted fish such as the bloater and buckling, were also once commonly enjoyed as a high tea or supper treat, most popularly with inland and urban working-class populations before World War II.

==Terminology==
The word is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;cypera&quot;, or copper, based on the colour of the fish. The word has various possible parallels, such as Icelandic &quot;kippa&quot; which means &quot;to pull, snatch&quot; and the Germanic word &quot;kippen&quot; which means &quot;to tilt, to incline&quot;. Similarly, the Middle English &quot;kipe&quot; denotes a basket used to catch fish. Another theory traces the word kipper to the &quot;kip&quot;, or small beak, that male salmon develop during the breeding season.

As a verb, &quot;kippering&quot; (&quot;to kipper&quot;) means to preserve by rubbing with salt or other spices before drying in the open air or in smoke. 
Originally applied to the preservation of surplus fish (particularly those known as &quot;kips,&quot; harvested during spawning runs), &quot;kippering&quot; has come to mean the preservation of any fish, poultry, beef or other meat in like manner. The process is usually enhanced by cleaning, filleting, butterflying or slicing the food to expose maximum surface area to the drying and preservative agents.

===Kippers, bloaters, and bucklings===
All three are types of smoked herring. Kippers are split, gutted and then cold-smoked; bloaters are cold-smoked whole; bucklings are hot-smoked whole.

== Origin ==
Although the exact origin of the kipper is unknown, this process of slitting, gutting, and smoke-curing fish is well documented. According to Mark Kurlansky, &quot;Smoked foods almost always carry with them legends about their having been created by accident—usually the peasant hung the food too close to the fire, and then, imagine his surprise the next morning when …&quot;. For instance Thomas Nashe wrote in 1599 about a fisherman from Lothingland in the Great Yarmouth area who discovered smoking herring by accident. Another story of the accidental invention of kipper is set in 1843, with John Woodger of Seahouses in Northumberland, when fish for processing was left overnight in a room with a smoking stove.

==Colouring==
A kipper is also sometimes referred to as a &quot;red herring&quot;, although particularly strong curing is required to produce a truly red kipper.
The term appears in a mid-13th century poem by the Anglo-Norman poet Walter of Bibbesworth, &quot;He eteþ no ffyssh But heryng red.&quot; Samuel Pepys used it in his diary entry of 28 February 1660: &quot;Up in the morning, and had some red herrings to our breakfast, while my boot-heel was a-mending, by the same token the boy left the hole as big as it was before.&quot;

The dyeing of kippers was introduced as an economy measure in the First World War by avoiding the need for the long smoking processes. This allowed the kippers to be sold quickly, easily and for a substantially greater profit. Kippers were originally dyed using a coal tar dye called brown FK (the FK is an abbreviation of &quot;for kippers&quot;), kipper brown or kipper dye. Today, kippers are usually brine-dyed using a natural annatto dye, giving the fish a deeper orange/yellow colour. European Community legislation limits the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of Brown FK to 0.15 mg/kg. Not all fish caught are suitable for the dyeing process, with mature fish more readily sought, because the density of their flesh improves the absorption of the dye. An &quot;orange kipper&quot; is a kipper that has been dyed orange.

Kippers from the Isle of Man and some Scottish producers are not dyed; instead, the smoking time is extended in the traditional manner.
==Preparation==
&quot;Cold-smoked&quot; fish that have not been salted for preservation must be cooked before being eaten safely (they can be boiled, fried, grilled, jugged or roasted, for instance). In general, oily fish are preferred for smoking as the heat is evenly dispersed by the oil, and the flesh resists flaking apart like drier species.

In the UK, kippers are usually served at breakfast, although their popularity has declined since the Victorian and Edwardian eras.

In the United States, where kippers are much less commonly eaten than in the UK, they are almost always sold as either canned &quot;kipper snacks&quot; or in jars found in the refrigerated foods section. These are precooked and may be eaten without further preparation. 

==Industry==
Kippers produced in the Isle of Man are exported around the world. Thousands are produced annually in the town of Peel, where two kipper houses, Moore&#x27;s Kipper Yard (founded 1882) and Devereau and Son (founded 1884), smoke and export herring.

Mallaig, once the busiest herring port in Europe, is famous for its traditionally smoked kippers, as are Stornoway kippers and Loch Fyne kippers. The harbour village of Craster in Northumberland is famed for Craster kippers, which are prepared in a local smokehouse, sold in the village shop and exported around the world.

==Related terms==
The Manx word for kipper is , literally &quot;red herring&quot;; the Irish term is &quot;scadán dearg&quot; with the same meaning.

&quot;Kipper time&quot; is the season in which fishing for salmon in the River Thames in the United Kingdom is forbidden by an Act of Parliament; this period was originally the period 3 May to 6 January but has changed since. &quot;Kipper season&quot; refers (particularly among fairground workers, market workers, taxi drivers and the like) to any lean period in trade, particularly the first three or four months of the year.

Members of the Canadian military referred to English people as &quot;kippers&quot; because they were believed to frequently eat kippers for breakfast.

The English (UK) idiom [to be] &quot;stitched (or &quot;done&quot;) up like a kipper&quot; is commonly used to describe a situation where a person has (depending on context) been &quot;fitted up&quot; or &quot;framed&quot;; &quot;used&quot;, unfairly treated or betrayed; or cheated out of something, with no possibility of correcting the &quot;wrong&quot; done.

In the children&#x27;s books &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, and in the television show &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot;, The Flying Kipper is a nickname for a fast fish train usually pulled by Henry the Green Engine.

The United States Department of Agriculture defines &quot;Kippered Beef&quot; as a cured dry product similar to beef jerky but not as dry.

<text>The Kipsigis or Kipsigiis are a Nilotic group, contingent of the Kalenjin ethnic group and speak a dialect of the Kalenjin language identified by their community eponym, Kipsigis. It is observed that the Kipsigis and another original group native to Kenya known as Ogiek have a merged identity. The Kipsigis are the biggest sub tribe within the Kalenjin community. The latest census population in Kenya put the Kipsigis at 1,972,000 speakers, accounting for 45% of all Kalenjin speaking people. They occupy the highlands of Kericho stretching from Timboroa to the Mara River in the south and the Mau Escarpment in the east to Kebeneti. They also occupy parts of Laikipia, Kitale, Nakuru, Narok, the Trans Mara District, Eldoret and the Nandi Hills.

Apart from the Kalenjin, the other tribe is the Tatonga of Western Tanzania. In their expansion southwards, the Kipsigis and the Tatonga people reached the present-day Shinyanga area in Western Tanzania only for the former group to return to the Kericho area before some went back south, but could only settle at Angata Barigoi in Trans Mara next to the Tanzanian Border.&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;-0.631701&quot; longitude=&quot;35.230408&quot; zoom=&quot;7&quot; width=&quot;217&quot; height=&quot;177&quot;&gt;

The IBEAC company and the British colonial government referred to the Kipsigis people as Lumbwa and Kwavi. The pre-colonial traditional occupations of the Kipsigis included semi-pastoral herding, military expeditions, and farming sorghum and millet. Post-colonial Kipsigis today still live predominantly in their historical tribal territory on the Western Highlands of Kenya at an altitude of 1500m to 2000m; they mainly grow tea, undertake dairy farming and farm maize. They also grow wheat, pyrethrum and coffee.

==Origin, establishment and precolonial history==
===Origin===

The Maliri people originally from Omo Valley in Ethiopia, immigrated into South Sudan and later Uganda; The Maliri are thought to have settled in what are now Jie country and large parts of Dodoth country in Uganda. Their arrival in the districts is estimated at 600 to 800 years ago (i.e. c.1200 to 1400 AD); As a consequence of Lwoo incursion into the Maliri territory, the tribe broke into groups that would go on to forge the Pokot and Sebei factions of Kalenjin and Merille/Dasaanach (who migrated back to Omo Valley through the East banks of Lake Turkana). The Pokot faction would go on to interact with Maasai and Iraqw around Kerio Valley in Kenya with profound impact which would cement the emergence of Kalenjin tribes such as Cherang&#x27;any people; while Sebei interacted with Oropom thus possibly creating a seedbed in Mount Elgon highlands for a proto Nandi-Kipsigis group.

The Nandi account is that the ancestors of Nandi migrated from Mount Elgon under the leadership of Kakipoch. It is observed from the Nandi oral traditions that Lumbwa clans joined them later, thus implying that the Nandi adopted groups of people associated with Sirikwa culture. From local folk lore, the Kipsigis were initially a single group and identity with the Nandi as &#x27;Chemwal&#x27; until 1800 when the community was separated by a wedge of Uas Nkishu Maasai in Kipchorian River (River Nyando); the resulting community south of Nandi hills (Kipkelion) became Kipsigis.

The recollection of various accounts among the Kipsigis describe an origin in Egypt and a migration route up the Nile for cooler climate with the group calling themselves &quot;&#x27;Miotik&#x27;&quot; or &quot;&#x27;Lote Bunik&#x27;&quot; with the later meaning cormorants; Along their migration route, they had transitionary settlements in countries they named: &quot;Burgei, Tto, Koita Tui/Lotik&quot; and finally Mount Elgon region. Later on, the accounts detail an interest among &quot;Miotik&quot; (Nandi and Kipsigis) to move into Lake Baringo where they possibly encountered the Maasai and pressed on South to Mau Summit and thus split into two; Kipsigis eponym being coined by their material culture of woven plates &quot;(Kisgisiik)&quot; which seems to have been a defining feature when they settled at Kipsigis Hill in Londiani.

=== Culture ===
The Kipsigis observe a belief system maintained by all other Kalenjin people. The system observes polytheistic theism with the deities Asiis (a solar deity) and Tororot are each considered major deities. Some studies suggest that Tororot was the initial kalenjin deity but interactions in Kerio valley led to assimilation of the priestly Kibasisek clan whose peculiarity is having the Sun as their tortem; they were much sought after to perform marriage rituals and other religious activities. While multiple other deities exist independently to one another. In the Kipsigis&#x27; monotheistic belief system, Asis is instead considered the single supreme deity and the other deities are considered Asis&#x27; attributes, rather than independent entities. The Kipsigis allude to cultural values including superstition, spiritualism, and a sacred and cyclical nature of life. They believe all elements of the natural world are connected, that good deeds never go unnoticed, and that bad deeds lead to consequences in various forms. The Kipsigis view &quot;happiness&quot; as a lack of negative experiences, indicating a quiet and calm state. This convention under the culture and positive psychology studies when contrasted to other indigenous communities gives researchers an obstacle in obtaining a qualitative or quantitative measure of happiness.

The Kipsigis people&#x27;s oral tradition is observed to have a rich background in songs. Many of their oral traditions feature a creature known as &quot;&#x27;Chemosi&#x27;,&quot; which is interchangeable with the Nandi bear; a monstrous ape-like basic-intelligence creature which also feature among other communities of Kenya, Uganda and parts of Congo.

A western adventurer Edgar Beecher Bronson claims to have seen a creature that he notes the Lumbwa people referred to as Dingonek. He describes it as a water creature whose features include an armadillo-like, leopard-patterned, hippo-sized back and a leopard&#x27;s head with two large protruding fangs. He reports that the Lumbwa and the Wadoko peoples spoke of such a creature in the Maggori River then provides an account of his sighting of the said creature. His is the only account of such a creature.

Food and Drinks

The meals mainly consist of a cooked thick paste of elusine flour, vegetables or meat, a blend of milk and cow blood, or milk. The Kipsigis ferment milk in gourds with powdered popcorn flower tree cinders. The sour milk is known as Mursiik. The tribe also brewed nubian gin and it was reserved for men and women in and past middle age.

Mushrooms

The Kipsigis are known to gather &quot;Termitomyces tylerianus&quot;, &quot;Termitomyces umkowaan&quot; and &quot;Termitomyces microcarpus (puunereek).&quot;

==== Astronomy and calendar ====

The Milky Way is known as &quot;Poit&#x27;ap kechei&quot; (literally &quot;sea of stars&quot;), the morning star – Tapoiyot, the midnight star – Kokeliet, and Orion&#x27;s Belt – Kakipsomok. The Milky Way was traditionally perceived as a lake in which children are bathing and playing. Furthermore, the movement of stars was sometimes linked to earthly concerns. For example, the appearance or non-appearance of the Pleiades indicated whether or not to expect a good or a bad harvest. Sometimes superstitions were held regarding certain events. A halo was traditionally said to represent a cattle stockade. At least as of the early 20th century, a break occurring on the east side was considered to be unlucky while one on the west side was seen to be lucky. A comet was at the same time regarded as the precursor of a great misfortune.

The Kipsigis call a month &#x27;Arawet&#x27;, which is also the term for our satellite, the moon. A year is called &#x27;Kenyit&#x27; which can be derived from the phrase &#x27;Ki-nyit&#x27; meaning &#x27;to accomplish, to fill in&#x27;. A year was marked by the order of months and more importantly by ceremonial and religious celebration of the yearly harvest which was held at the various shrines. This event being analogous to a practice observed by most of the other Africans has inspired the Kwanza festivities celebrated by predominantly by people of African descent in the United States. Kenyit started in February. It had two seasons known as &quot;olto&quot; (pl. &quot;oltosiek&quot;) and was divided into twelve months, &quot;arawet&quot; (pl. &quot;arawek&quot;). In place of a decade is the order of &quot;Ibinda&quot; which is usually between 10 and 17 years. In place of a century is the completion of the age set which takes between 100 and 120 years.

The first season of the year, olt-ap-iwot (iwotet), was the wet season and ran from March to August. The dry season, olt-ap-keme (kemeut), ran from September to February. The kipsunde and kipsunde oieng harvest ceremonies were held in September and October respectively to mark the change in Seasons.

===== Months (arawek) and Seasons =====
=== Geopolitical and military organisation ===

==== Social organization ====
The Kipsigis tribe is a patriarchal society that was organized in terms of geo-political groupings, clan systems, age sets and military ranks.

===== Genealogical organisation (Ortiinweek) =====
The Kipsigis organize themselves into a series of groupings based on shared kinship analogous to clans. A clan is brought about by a shared ancestor with a context of adoption as a way of naturalization into the clan, usually from Maasai/Gusii/Luo as Kipsigis cannot adopt from within Kalenjin. The patriarchal ancestors, notably the patriarch Kakipoch, immigrated the Nandi-Kipsigis population to Uasin Ngishu plains and Kerio Valley. Formulation of the clan system is thought to have come about due to assimilation of other communities and population growth as a system of preventing pedigree collapse and in-breeding as the main purpose of clans was to prevent marriage within the same clan (marriages being mainly heterosexual but with a lesbian marriage in context). Clans also projected various professionalism and probably adopted identities where for instance, certain clans were exclusively priests, others were exclusively smiths, others exclusively hunters and gathers while others had other particular peculiarities.

===== Generations =====
The Kipsigis observe a cyclical generation setting system. The system seems to have been arrogated plausibly from the Bantu Kikuyu people. The system completes a full rotation in between about a hundred and a hundred and twenty years. The set is composed of generations that extend between 15 and 20 years. The system was used to account for historical events and demographic management.
==== Geopolitical organization ====
Em or emet, was the highest recognized geographic division among the Kipsigis. It spans a geopolitical region demarcated as being a jurisdiction of the tribe and entitled to a decree of sovereignty. This unit was identifiable as a political institution but the main work of civil control and administration was done by the &quot;kokwotinwek&quot; (plural of &quot;kokwet&quot;). Linguistic evidence indicates that this form of societal organization dates back to their Southern Nilotic heritage. It is believed that the Southern Nilotes of two thousand years ago cooperated in loose supra-clan groupings, called *e:m.

&quot;Kokwet&quot; was the most significant political and judicial unit among the Kipsigis. The governing body of each kokwet was its &quot;kok&quot; (village council). Kokwet denotes a geographic cluster of settlement similar in concept to a village. &quot;Kok&quot; elders were the local authority for arbitration and conflict resolution.

===== The Office of the King (Oorgoiiyoot) =====
Operational in Nandi, the Orkoiyot institution was communed to Kipsigis not later than 1850, after the ousting and assassination of Kimnyole Arap Turgat. Kimnyole sent his three sons (Kipchomber arap Koilege, Arap Boisyo and Arap Buigut) to Kipsigis who immediately began to establish a Kipsigis confederation, each of them establishing kingly homesteads with servants, messengers and reception parlors. The office of the &quot;Oorgoiiyoot&quot; was dissolved after the Lumbwa Treaty.

==== Military organisation ====

While evidence suggests precolonial Kipsigis as having engaged in conquests of territory, a mistaken impression emerges of an efficient organized military; rather the existence of a Kipsigis army was indicative of a social organization at the tribal level despite evidence of large portions of conquered territory and defeat of strong armies. The precolonial Kipsigis were presented as a markedly acephalous society politically with both military and political organization having to be examined in terms of relatively autonomous territorial groups within the tribe.

The Kipsigis armies organized themselves into four regiments &quot;(pororiosiek)&quot; namely: &quot;Kikaige, Ng&#x27;etunyo, Kebeni and Kasanet&quot;. Recruitment into the regiments was achieved through the age set and clan system. Each regiment fought independently which often resulted in weak and often conflicting strategies. At a later stage, the four regiments merged into two consisting of Kipkaige and Kasanet on the one side and Ng&#x27;etunyo and Kebeni on the other; but ultimately, the strength of this army was tested with a resounding defeat at the hands of Gusii in the battle of Ngoina dated to &quot;circa 1850&quot;. Once again, the Kipsigis army regiments regrouped into one force composed equally of all four regiments and while this development would spur a record of victories, it would also be tested in the battle of Mogori &quot;circa 1890&quot; with a defeat that had dire implications on the spirit and identity of the Kipsigis.

Other studies depict a more elaborate military organization; for instance, there were an extra tire of regiments and ranks including: the generals (Kiptayat/Kiptaiinik), spies (&quot;Yotiik&quot;, &quot;Seegeik&quot; and &quot;Sogooldaiik&quot;), and the procession ranks (&quot;Ng&#x27;anymetyeet&quot;, &quot;Pirtiich&quot;, &quot;Oldimdo/Lumweet&quot; and &quot;Kipeelbany&quot;). There were yearly mock up practice for warring called &quot;Kaambageet&quot;.

The arms of the fighting men usually consisted of a spear, shield, sword and club. By the late 19th century, up to four kinds of spears, representing various eras and areas were in use. In Nandi, the eren-gatiat, of the Sirkwa era was still in use though only by old men. It had a short and small leaf-shaped blade with a long socketed shank and a long butt. Two types of the Maasai era spear, known as ngotit, were also in use. Those of the eastern, northern and southern counties had long narrow blades with long iron butt, short socket and short shaft. Those of the central county (emgwen) had short broad blades with short iron butts. In the western counties, a spear that had a particularly small head, a long shaft and no butt was in use, it was known as ndirit. The pastoral Pokot carried two Maasai era spears, known as &quot;ngotwa&quot; while the agricultural sections armed themselves with a sword, known as &quot;chok&quot;.

Archery was also very much a prominent skill practiced among the Kipsigis for purposes ranging from agriculture to defense and security. There were an array of arrows for various specialties such as for shooting a bull for blood, hunting arrows and defensive arrows meant either as a deterrent by causing mortal wounds or others meant to get stuck in the victim while others were poisoned and thus each of the arrow types were used depending on the occasion.

===== Significant wars and battles =====
===== Historical Kipsigis War Heroes =====
The military culture of the Kipsigis directly led to adoration of war heroes and successful commanders. Some of them include: Araap Ngulolu, Kipsiongo Araap Terer of Kipkoibon, Araap Taptugen of Belgut, Araap Buiywo, Araap Nyarino, Araap Tamasoon, Araap Kirui of Kapkugoeek clan, Araap Tompo, Araap Mastamet, Araap Cheriro, Kendeiywo Araap Baliach, Arap Moigi and Araap Tengecha (who stood out among all of them and a close friend of Jomo Kenyatta).

=== Precolonial History ===
Breaking away from the former Chemwal ethnicity and becoming Kipsigis in about 1790s and 1800s, the Kipsigis population grew from an estimated population of less than five hundred in what is today&#x27;s Fort Tenan. From here, they acquired military resilience against the neighbouring Luo who would go on to call them Jalang&#x27;o (meaning one who is spirited). They also fought Kisii communities out of today&#x27;s Kabianga in Kericho West District and also towards the east against the Maasai who occupied parts of Kipkelion, Kericho and Londiani. The expansion of the Kipsigis territory was rapid and violent and by the 1890s as Orkoiyot institution was established, Kipsigis territory extended from the Nandi Hills in the North to Sotik in the South, with a small region in Bureti.

==== Menya Arap Kisiara ====
Menya is narrated among the Kipsigis as an excellent diplomat and war hero. He is credited for defeating the Maasai who used to inhabit larger portions of Kericho county. Significant battles are recalled having been fought in Iltianit(Londiani), fought in Kericho, Chemoiben, and then Siriat in Sotik. Initially an outcast and an outlier, Menyua Arap Kisiara was banished off the tribal land for marrying a &quot;Kapkerichek&quot; clanswoman which at the time, was also his own clan. He defected with his company of warriors, - Tapkile and Kipketes/Kipkeles into Maasai community. He then started his own clan of Kapkaon. Returning later on as formidable warrior and establishing his army, he challenged the Maasai into a duel estimated from oral traditions to have taken place in the 1770s to where Kaplong town in Sotik is situated today, Menya led an army to war against the Maasai in order to resolve land disputes and territorial privileges. The war ensued for a number of weeks to a couple of months and for the most part, both sides lost many warriors, and many were injured. Towards the end, Menya called in a truce and overnight, amassed aid and reinforcements from Kipsigis warriors across the whole of Kipsigis. On returning to the ultimate and decisive battle, he easily outwitted the Maasai with an army of an estimated 3000 warriors or more. Maasai conceded defeat and resolved to vacate what constitutes today most if not all of Bomet County and Narok West Constituency.

==== Orgoik ====
&#x27;Orgoik&#x27; (plural) or ‘Orgoiyoot’ (singular) is any clansperson of the Talaai clan spread across Nandi, Kipsigis, Tugen and Marakwet. In Kipsigis, most of the Talaai clansmen can identify a patrilineal genealogy to three sons of Kimnyole Araap Turgat namely: Kipchomber Araap Koilege, Chebochok Kiptonui Araap Boisyo and Araap Buiygut; Koitalel Araap Samoei was their younger sibling. The three brothers were sent by their father, Araap Turgat to Kipsigis nation shortly before his assassination by the Nandi people. Their benefactor was their uncle, Araap Kiroisi of Sotik.

Considered special and thought to have out-of-worldly powers, the three were pushed into leadership and for the first time in Kipsigis history, they were able to hold positions that can be equalled to a king or leaders of autonomous regions. Their influence led to expansion of the Kipsigis territory adding to the achievements of Menya Araap Kisiara. They were also considered herbal medicinemen and thus acquired wealth from war reparation and pay for medical services. They went on to have very sedentary lifestyles with their homesteads employing several servants and a primitive equivalent of slaves.

Following the Lumbwa treaty between Kipsigis and The British, the three brothers were arrested and would, in about 1903, be deported to Kikuyu-land while their siblings and immediate families consisting of about 700 individuals were banished to Gwassi in Homa Bay County and stayed there excommunicated between 1934 and 1962. They were later on resettled in Kablilo, Sigowet-Soin, Kiptere, Ainamoi, Belgut and some few in Emgwen.

Among the Kipsigis, there is speculative talk that implicates Daniel Arap Moi and Jomo Kenyatta as having relations with the Orgoik.

===== Kipchomber arap Koilege =====

Kipchomber lived in Cheriri in Kiptere before being imprisoned by the British and sent to Rusinga island of Kisumu. He was instrumental in dispersing Luo people from Kiptere to Sondu. Among the Kipsigis, and perhaps among all the other Kalenjin, Arap Koilege is believed to have blessed Kenyatta Jomo and handed to him his attire which included a hide, a belt colloquially called &#x27;Kenyatet&#x27;, a head gear among others after which, Koilege asked Kenyatta to visit a leader of the Maasai who was a Laibon. The attire was worn by Jomo very many ceremonial times when he was the president of Kenya. Today, Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s traditional attire is buried with him in a muselium in Kenya&#x27;s National Assembly building in Nairobi.

===== Chebochok Kiptonui arap Boisio =====
Chebochock was the son to Kimyole Arap Turgat. After Kimnyole was ousted and assassinated by the Nandi, Chebochok and his two brothers found refuge among the Kipsigis people while Koitalel Arap Samoei found refuge among the Tugen people. Chebochock Kiptonui arap Boisio settled in Londiani. He established himself a kingly estate. He empowered and commandeered Kipsigis armies to acquire land towards Laikipia.

He is reported or speculated to have fathered a boy to a widow who used to herd cattle, she was known as Wambui. The boy is reported to have been named Johnstone Peter Kamau. She then moved to a farm in Nyeri where she married Muigai but who later divorced her because of issues associated with cuckoldry.

In 1913, Chebochok Kiptonui Arap Boiso and his two brothers were banished to Fort Hall and Nyeri. Coincidentally, Wambui was assigned the role to look after the three brothers by the Europeans.

===== Kibuigut =====

==== Mugenik Barngetuny Araap Sitonik ====
Barngetuny Mugenik was a Kipsigis prophet who is still respected by the Kipsigis community. His age set was initiated between 1815 and 1838, and lived in what is now the town of Sotik, located in Bomet county. He was of the &quot;Kipkendek&quot; clan, and his maternal uncle was Kimyole Araap Turukat, from Talai clan, the famous Nandi Orgoiyot. It is estimated that he died in 1885 and was buried adjacent to what is today&#x27;s Sotik Police station in Sotik town. The Kipsigis hold that Mugenik had revelations and visions which he told to the people. These revelations contained instruction on how the Kipsigis people were expected to live a holy life before Asiis, their solar deity. Mugenik&#x27;s visions also foretold future events that were to take place in the Kipsigis country. Among his prophecies were the arrival of the British, the arrival of trains, the development of towns, modern clothing, and the establishment of colonialism and the eventual independence of African nations. Also significantly, it is narrated how he had visions of the establishment of Sotik Police station, Sotik KCC creameries factory and two of Sotik bridges that were to be operated under colour bar system. There are also accounts from his visions that detail vast expansion of the Kipsigis territory and others that hint a decimation of the Kipsigis population as a handiwork of a boy, or more precisely translated to mean derogatively an uncircumcised boy. Among many other prophecies, perhaps of great intrigue to the Kipsigis was one in which he foretold about a Kipsigis man with a star on his (possibly military) who led what is equivalent to Kenyan jurisdiction today.

=== Colonial history ===
The Kipsigis had an initial contact with the British in 1889 and within 17 years, the British had established their rule over the tribe. The British initially started to expropriate the tribal Kipsigis land to create a buffer zone between the mutually antagonistic Gusii and Kipsigis; but it was clear from the beginning that an underlying tenet of the British policy towards the Kipsigis was the ultimate conversion of the tribe from a predominantly semi-pastoral economy to one of peasant cultivation.

==== Lumbwa Treaty ====
==== Sotik Massacre ====
Originally not part of the White Highlands, Sotik District was a Y-shaped strip of land about 50 miles and in some places not more than three miles wide, carved out of the Native Reserve. Sotik was Abugusii and Maasai territory before 1800 but, under a treaty promulgated by Menya Araap Kisiara, the Maasai were pushed to Trans-Mara. Following the arrival of the British, the Kipsigis rallied alongside the Nandis to fight against the building of the Kenya-Uganda Railway.

Seeing the long-drawn-out resistance of the Nandi led by Koitalel Araap Samoei, the intelligence officer Richard Meinertzhagen, vowed to break the impasse. In the middle of 1905, a punitive raid led by Major Richard Pope-Hennessy killed 1,850 men, women, and children who were rounded up and fired upon indiscriminately with a Maxim gun and other weapons. The massacre was ostensibly in retaliation against the refusal by the Sotik people to heed an ultimatum by the British government to return cattle raided from the Maasai. It is noted that medal of honours were awarded to officers who took part in these operations around the same time.

Some months later on 19 October 1905, Richard Meinertzhagen tricked Koitalel into what was effectively an ambush and shot him at point-blank range, killing him on the spot and the rest of his entourage. With Koitalel dead, the Nandi resistance was neutralized, and the British proceeded to evict the Kipsigis and Nandi from their land and sent them to areas that were largely unfit for human habitation. The Sotik massacre and the assassination of Koitalel were directly linked to the setting aside of Sotik for European settlement and the colonial system of forced labour, punitive taxes for Africans, economic, and racial segregation. It is disingenuous to argue that it was a buffer zone to keep warring African tribes apart.

In August 2020, following the murder of Gerge Floyd, Claudia Webbe, Member of Parliament for Leicester East wrote in a letter addressed to UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson, about Sotik Massacre and asked that the massacre should be taught in British schools.

==== World War I ====
World War I is inferred among the Kipsigis as &#x27;&quot;Boriet ap Talianek&quot;&#x27; - literally &#x27;Italian War&#x27; and it&#x27;s an inflection point among the Kipsigis coming out of which, integration into modernity. Some men were drafted or volunteered to fight and it is remarked how the Empire they fought for did not recognize them or keep any records or accounts of African soldiers.

==== Nandi Protest of 1923 ====
A number of factors taking place in the early 1920s led to what has come to be termed the Nandi Protest or Uprisings of 1923. It was the first expression of organized resistance by the Nandi since the wars of 1905–06.

Primary contributing factors were the land alienation of 1920 and a steep increase in taxation, taxation tripled between 1909 and 1920 and because of a change in collection date, two taxes were collected in 1921. The Kipsigis and Nandi refused to pay and this amount was deferred to 1922. Further, due to fears of a spread of rinderpest following an outbreak, a stock quarantine was imposed on the Nandi Reserve between 1921 and 1923. The Nandi, prevented from selling stock outside the Reserve, had no cash, and taxes had to go unpaid. Normally, grain shortages in Nandi were met by selling stock and buying grain. The quarantine made this impossible. The labour conscription that took place under the Northey Circulars only added to the bitterness against the colonial government.

All these things contributed to a buildup of antagonism and unrest toward the government between 1920 and 1923. In 1923, the &quot;saget ab eito&quot; (sacrifice of the ox), a historically significant ceremony where leadership of the community was transferred between generations, was to take place. This ceremony had always been followed by an increased rate of cattle raiding as the now formally recognized warrior age-set sought to prove its prowess. The approach to a saget ab eito thus witnessed expressions of military fervor and for the ceremony all Nandi males would gather in one place.

Alarmed at the prospect and as there was also organized protest among the Kikuyu and Luo at that time, the colonial government came to believe that the Orkoiyot was planning to use the occasion of the &quot;Saget ab eito&quot; of 1923 as a cover under which to gather forces for a massive military uprising. On 16 October 1923, several days before the scheduled date for the &quot;saget ab eito&quot;, the Orkoiyot Barsirian Arap Manyei and four other elders were arrested and deported to Meru. Permission to hold the ceremony was withdrawn and it did not take place, nor has it ever taken place since. The Orkoiyot Barsirian Arap Manyei would spend the next forty years in political detention, becoming Kenya&#x27;s, and possibly Africa&#x27;s, longest-serving political prisoner.

 One of the foremost Kipsigis colonial Chiefs was Cheborge Arap Tengecha. Although he was sometimes fondly referred to as “Kiprany-tich,” meaning he stood up to colonial excesses, this nom de guerre was countermanded by his alleged heavy-handedness and “unbridled” obsequiousness towards the colonial authorities. Nevertheless, Arap Tengecha can be credited with some positive deeds that helped transform the Kipsigis society in a changed world of colonial domination. First, the man, born about 1892, embraced literacy by accepting to go to school, unlike his peers. His capacity to read and write earned him a place in the colonial law courts and civil service as an interpreter based at the Kericho District Commissioner’s office. He served under District Commissioners, Cecil M. Dobbs, Sydney Hubert La Fontaine, George Henry C. Boulderson, T. H. Hinkinson, among others. 
As an acknowledgement of his prowess as an interpreter, Arap Tengecha was sent to Kerendei in Maasailand (Narok) in 1921 to continue his work there, having mastered the Maa language and other languages such as Kisii, Luo and Swahili. In 1934, he was appointed to the exalted position of Chief of Bomet Location where he excelled in his new position as an administrator and enforcer of colonial policies. When the district administration was reorganised by District Commissioner Henry G. Gregory-Smith in 1946, Chief Tengecha, now a top favourite of the colonial government, was appointed the Chief of Bureti Location where he served until his retirement in 1961. In recognition of his “illustrious career” at his retirement, Queen Elizabeth II of England conferred on Chief Tengecha the coveted OBE (Order of the British Empire).

==== World War II ====
With the German, Italian and Japanese threat at the borders of the British Empire, many people were dragged into military service during World War II. In East Africa, a huge number of Kenyans were recruited to serve in the Burma and Ethiopian Campaigns. Known to the Kipsigis as &#x27;&quot;Boriet ap Jeromaan&quot;&#x27;, literally German war, the world event marks a period of time and denotes a generation where some of its youthful men either volunteered or were drafted into the King&#x27;s African Rifles forces. In August 1914, during the First World War, KAR soldiers were dispatched to fight German forces between what is Kenya-Tanzania border today, moreso in Taita-Tavetta. During the Second World War in 1944, some were deployed to join the fight in Burma Campaign against the Imperial Japanese Army. After the war, African soldiers were forgotten and hardly any records of them and their accounts were kept.

==Post-independence==
=== Emerging socio-cultural trends and dynamics ===
The Kipsigis culture and heritage has transformed and attritioned initially as a result of the contact with British colonialists and a remarkable switch to Christianity, forsaking the belief in Asiis or incorporating some aspects of their traditional religion into Christianity. Later on, a formal colonial government meant the tribe had to comply with government rules and laws which in part vitiated some traditional norms such as warring and raiding neighboring antagonistic tribes. After independence, the declining of adherence to culture and heritage subsisted, significantly, the banning of female genital mutilation led to abandonment of initiation of girls while schooling limited the period of time boys spent in seclusion during initiation; apparently, because of the spread of HIV and the devastating impact associated as some of the first cases were reported in Kenya in the late 1980s, circumcision of boys was promoted and as a result, the custom of initiation of boys persisted.

==== Music, film and written arts ====
Contemporary Kalenjin music has long been influenced by Kipsigis producers, artistes, and musicians leading to Kericho&#x27;s perception as a cultural innovation center in Kenya and effectively in the Great-Lakes Region of Africa. Community introspection reveals how Chepalungu constituency has beaten the odds to carve a niche for itself as the home of Kalenjin secular artistes. One notable Raphael Kipchamba arap Tapotuk was a luminary artiste, songwriter and producer credited as being a forebearer of Kalenjin pop culture often manifesting his works as folk song, country, and jazz. His music records are beloved by the entirety of Kalenjin; Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi, William Samoei Ruto and a host of Kalenjin leaders and celebrities in attending Kipchamba&#x27;s funeral in his home in Chepalungu, 14 April 2007 remarked the might and their love for the artiste.

A song &quot;Chemirocha III&quot; collected by ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey in 1950 from the Kipsigis in Kapkatet in Kericho was written in honour of Jimmie Rodgers. The song&#x27;s title is an approximation of the musician&#x27;s name. According to legend, tribe members were exposed to Rodgers&#x27; music through British soldiers during World War II. Impressed by his yodeling, they envisioned Rodgers as &quot;a faun, half-man and half-antelope.&quot; &quot;Chemirocha III&quot; is credited to &quot;Chemutoi Ketienya with Kipsigis girls&quot;, and was described by Tracey as &quot;humorous&quot; in his notes. &quot;Chemirocha III&quot; is included on Tracey&#x27;s &quot;The Music of Africa: Musical Instruments 1: Strings&quot; LP, from 1972.

Kimursi, an actor in the 1950 adventure film: &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, is credited as being of Kipsigis ethnicity. In the cast, he took on the role of Khiva.

The Kenyan long-distance runner Ezekiel Kemboi danced to a Kalenjin hit single, &quot;Emily Chepchumba&quot;, during the 2011 IAAF Daegu World championship, after crossing the finish line in the 3000 metres steeplechase and during the London Summer Olympics held in August 2012, after crossing the finish line in the 3000 metre steeple chase finals and winning gold. The song was written, sang and recorded by a Kipsigis artist, Bamwai.

===Sports===
Kalenjin are reputable as an ethnic conglomerate endemic with athletic prowess. The Kipsigis, the most populous tribe among the Kalenjin has had a culture of sportsmanship among its population and through the years, there have been excellent sportsmen and sportswomen from the tribe. It is believed that genetic predisposition, altitude and environmental adaptation, diet, poverty and all-inclusive training philosophy contribute to the success of Kalenjin sportspersons.

==== Science and academia ====
It is observed that among the Kipsigis, knowledge is measured binomially where to be thought of as knowledgeable, &quot;ng’om&quot;, one has to display the application of the corresponding knowledge. In academia, the &#x27;Kipsigis&#x27; word or eponym has inspired the nomenclature of an extinct genus of East African antelope from the middle Miocene (Kipsigicerus). Other academic terms associated with the Kipsigis include &quot;Acraea sotikensis&quot; and Sotik lion (&quot;Panthera leo melanochaita&quot;).

Dr. Taaitta Araap Toweett was a Kipsigis elite and political leader. He was awarded scholarship by the Kipsigis County Council in 1955 to the South Devon Technical College, Torquay, to study for a diploma in public and social administration. He obtained a B.A. (1956) and B.A. (Hons) 1959 from the University of South Africa. On his return from Britain in 1957, he was appointed Community Development Officer for Nandi District, the first African CDO to be recruited locally in Kenya. During this period was the editor of the Kipsigis vernacular magazine &quot;Ngalek Ap Kipsigisiek&quot;, published quarterly. He was one of the eight original Africans elected to the Legislative Council in 1958 as Member for the Southern Area, a constituency comprising mainly Kipsigis and Maasai Districts. He formed Kalenjin Political Alliance Party that later on got into an alliance with KADU. He served on the Dairy Board and played a crucial role in the foundation of the co-operative movement nationally. In 1960, 1962, 1963 he attended the Lancaster House Conferences held in London to draft Kenya&#x27;s Constitution, paving the way for complete self-rule. Before Kenya&#x27;s independence, he was appointed Assistant Minister for Agriculture (1960), Minister of Labour and Housing in 1961 and Minister of Lands, Surveys and Town Planning in 1962. After Kenya&#x27;s Independence, he was appointed Minister for Education in 1969, Minister for Housing and Social Services in 1974, Minister for Education in 1976. He was also elected President of the 19th General Assembly of UNESCO (1976–1978). In 1977, he finished his PhD thesis on &quot;A Study of Kalenjin Linguistics&quot;. In 1980, he was appointed as the chairperson of Kenya Literature Bureau. In 1983–1985, he served as the Charperson, Kenya Airways after which he was appointed the chairperson, Kenya Seed Company. He also served as a Director of the &quot;Kenya Times&quot; newspaper and went on to edit and publish his own newspaper, &quot;Voice of Rift Valley&quot;, between 1997 and 2000.

Professor Jonathan Kimetet Araap Ngeno was a Kipsigis elite who was sponsored by African Inland Church from Litein to study in the United States. He was invited back to Kenya and reintegrated by Daniel arap Moi to achieve political attrition over Dr. Taaitta Toweett. He was appointed to Ministerial positions and was elected the Fourth Speaker of the Parliament of Kenya succeeding coincidentally his &quot;baghuleita&quot; (a male agemate who was initiated in the same seclusion home), Moses Kiprono arap Keino.

In the 1990s, Professor Davy Kiprotich Koech by then the Director of Kenya Medical Research Institute and Dr. Arthur O. Obel, the Chief Research Officer published in two medical journals the initial results of the newfound drug &quot;Kemron&quot; that was perceived from the preliminary study of 10 patients to cure AIDS. The drug was introduced in a public ceremony presided by Kenya&#x27;s former President, Daniel Toroitch Arap Moi and the work of the new wonder drug discovered was hailed as a major step against HIV/AIDS. Kemron was the trade name for a low-dose of alpha interferon, manufactured form of a natural body chemical in a tablet form that dissolves in the mouth. Clinical trials of Kemron funded by WHO in five African Countries did not find any health benefits reported by Kemri Scientists. Thereafter, WHO in a press release in its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, termed Kemron as an experimental drug of unproven benefit for HIV/AIDS treatment. The American National Institute of Health concluded that no one had been able to duplicate the effects claimed by scientists behind Kemron. In 1998 Prof. Davy Koech led the Commission of Inquiry into the Education System of Kenya. Hosted by Kenya Broadcasting Cooperation (KBC) in 2019, Prof. Koech cited bad peer review on his experimental drug and that he was currently overseeing reexamination of Kemron and further research in China.

===Politics===

==== Community politics ====
The Kipsigis community is a rich political arena. The Kipsigis present themselves in a united political front along with their kin, the Kalenjin mass. With the leadership of Daniel Moi, Kalenjin community took a leftist form and were in favour of divolved governance under the alias &quot;Majimboism&quot;. When Moi became the president of Kenya, Kalenjins shifted to a right wing front with solemn support for Moi and his government. During Moi&#x27;s regime, incidences of politically motivated violence took place and Kipsigis for the most part were touted as perpetrators. Under Mwai Kibaki, Kipsigis and Kalenjin in entirety took a passive political approach which then bounced back to a roller coaster of leftist and right wing support in alliagence to the rising star of Kalenjin Politics, Dr. William Samoei Ruto.

===== Prominent leadership =====

====== Presidency ======

Whilst the Kipsigis tribe consider Jomo Kenyatta as the spurious love child of the Kipsigis Orkoiyot, Chebochok Kiptonui Arap Boiso, they aspire to present Kenya with a president. Apparently. William Samoei Kipchirchir Ruto, Kipsigis in origin and from Komosi clan has served in various ministerial positions, and as the Deputy President of Kenya under Uhuru Kenyatta&#x27;s presidency. As of August 2022, William Ruto was announced the winner of the Kenyan 2022 general elections and after a court appeal by the defeated candidate, Raila Odinga, Ruto&#x27;s win was upheld. William Samoei Ruto was inaugurated in September 2022 as the fifth president of the Republic of Kenya and is currently the incumbent president.

===== MAU Settlement Programs and evictions =====

The Kipsigis initial settlement was at Tulwaap Kipsigis in Londiani; strategically, the hill makes up part of the Mau Forest reserve in Kenya. The Kipsigis believe they have a &#x27;god-given&#x27; claim upon the forest which alludes to the adoption at some point in the Kipsigis history of the aboriginal hunter-gatherer tribe, the Okiek who are native to a region between Mount Kenya stretching up all the way to Mau Forest in Rift Valley. Mau crisis started when the trust land was allocated to group ranches between the 1980s and 1990s who were mainly ethnic Maasai elite during Daniel Moi&#x27;s Kanu era. The problem exacerbated about when the group ranches went beyond the cutline and occupied forest land. Part of the Mau Forest was initially a trust land under the defunct Narok County Council. Traditionally, the forest has been inhabited by the Ogiek. However, due to immigration from other ethnic groups, large parts of the forest area were cleared for settlement. In 2004, the famous Ndungu Report listed these land allocations, terming them illegal and recommended their revocation of them. Some evictions were done between 2004 and 2006 without a resettlement option. In 2005, the government placed a caveat on all title deeds issued to claimants, saying they were irregularly issued.

In 2008, the Kibaki regime through the then Prime Minister Raila Odinga ordered evictions to be effected by October 2008 in order to protect the forest from destruction. The order was opposed by several Rift Valley politicians led by Isaac Ruto. The then Agriculture Minister William Ruto, proposed evictees be allocated land elsewhere. Later, Environment Minister John Michuki would reverse the order. Subsequently, in 2008, there was a political row over the resettlement of people in the Mau Forest who had been allocated land in the 1980s and 1990s.

===== Redress for violations by British colonial government =====
In 2017, a consortium from the Kipsigis community organised by Professor Paul Kiprono Chepkwony and led by Karim Ahmad Khan sought redress for human rights violations committed by the British government during the colonial period. The plaintiffs were more than 100,000 ethnic Kipsigis victims and the members of Talai Clan.

===== Provisions for Oorgoiik =====
The Talai clansmen returned or continued to peacefully live with Kipsigis people after independence. After the campaign of AIM and Catholic church the Talai clansmen were sidelined and hated but today, they exist peacefully with the Kipsigis and take upon the identity of the Kipsigis equally like any other clansmen. Notably, the residents of Chepalungu constituency (today&#x27;s Sotik and Chepalungu constituencies) voted in Tamason Barmalel, the grandson of Koitalel Arap Samoei, as their MP between 1969 and 1974.

Allocations of land made by the Kenyan Government under Taaita Towet and Daniel arap Moi to the Talai clansmen has been reported to be grabbed and commercialised by corrupt agents and thus, those living in Kericho live in wanting situations and poverty.

==== Conflicts and violence ====
While fairly known for a disposition to be welcoming and hospitable, the Kipsigis are also infamous in Kenya for having participated or led offensive stance during some of Kenya&#x27;s ethnic violence where in some, ethnic cleansing was a characteristic. The overarching cause for this violence has primarily been discriminatory politics, land contentions and incitement. The Kipsigis amass into the Kalenjin group which in totality portray a united political alliance thus making them subject to discrimination and incitement. Secondary intrinsic factors for violence machinate through a condition of sinuosity jumbled up between historical injustices, conceitedness from historical precolonial war efforts and demographics where unemployment is rife among the youth and a majority of the population is disadvantaged and disenfranchised economically.

After a comprehensive risk assessment of social, economic and political factors that increase the likelihood of genocide in Kenya, the Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention&#x27;s May 2011 report identified several risk factors including; a low degree of democracy, isolation from the international community, high levels of military expenditure, severe government discrimination or active repression of native groups, socioeconomic deprivation combined with group-based inequality and a legacy of intergroup hatred among other risk factors.

===== 1992 skirmishes =====
In 1992, a series of events contributed to a feeling of uncertainty in Kenya, these events included widespread charges of government corruption that had brought halts or cuts in the flow of foreign aid upon which Kenya&#x27;s economy depended on, and protests against the government of President Daniel arap Moi that resulted in police attacks on demonstrators. Forby, under diplomatic pressure, the KANU regime under Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi caved to the political demand and need for multi-party democracy. Prior to 1992 elections, because of their support for the nascent opposition, KANU affiliates incited Kalenjin against Kikuyu around the idea that Kikuyu were non-indigenous and had appropriated Kalenjin land. As a result, ethnic cleaning campaigns before during and after the 1992 general elections erupted in a bid out of spite for the out-group and phobia for the tribal claim on land. According to some accounts 779 people were killed and about 56,000 displaced.

===== 2008 post-election violence =====
In January and February 2008, following the 2007 Kenyan general elections, post-election violence spontaneously erupted throughout the country but in the Rift Valley province; the violence span out and evolved from acts of riots and protests to all out violence against the Kisii and Kikuyu communities who were affiliated to the President Mwai Kibaki&#x27;s PNU party. A characteristic of the violence it seemed was to expel the out-groups but not necessarily to kill. There was also looting of businesses and firms run by the out-groups as well as on some government properties. The pattern of violence subsequently showed planning and organization by politicians, businessmen, village leaders and local leaders, who enlisted criminal gangs to execute the violence. This was particularly the case in Rift Valley and Nairobi. In Naivasha, Nakuru and the slum areas of Nairobi, Kikuyu gangs were mobilized and used to unleash violence against Luos, Luhyas and Kalenjins, and to expel them from their rented residences. In many instances the police action added to the violence, with considerable evidence that officers took sides and used terror tactics against slum dwellers. In some instances, sexual violence took the form of individual and gang rapes and female and male genital mutilation.

===== 2018 Maa-Kipsigis skirmishes =====
The Maasai and the Kipsigis have historically and traditionally antagonised each other right from and a period earlier than the Maasai era. This usually manifested as cattle raids, eventual battles and the subsequent southward thwarting and ejection of the Maasai. After Kenya&#x27;s independence, there have been periodic tensions between the Maasai and the Kipsigis which have backgrounds in history and traditions and fuelled by political incitement especially during the elections period. Politicians have been said to fuel the clashes with their remarks, both in public forums and on social media. In 2018 for instance, Narok County Senator Ledama Olekina, part of the Maasai community, has been criticised for remarks about the evictions.

In 2018 particularly, the Uhuru government under the Minister of Lands evicted a section of the Mau Complex settlers who are mainly of Kipsigis ethnicity. The evictions were particularly forceful, inconsiderate, inhuman and without compensation. A major section of the Maasai leaders supported the evictions and are said or known to have committed hate speech. In the wake of the polarisation, the Maasai are reported to have attacked Kipsigis evictees and in retaliation, Kipsigis men in Narok and Bomet counties retaliated. The battles implored the use of crude or/and traditional weaponry including nuts (a nut used to fit to a screw fitted onto a wooden handle about a foot and a half long), spears, bows and arrows, swords and torches (or at least, petrol/gasoline and lighters).

Following the 2018 evictions and Maasai-Kipsigis clashes, several human-rights defenders came together to file a paper in protest of the human-rights violations committed by the Kenyan government in evicting people from the forests; it said in part, &quot;The actions of the Government of Kenya in forcibly evicting tens of thousands of people from forests violates a range of human rights, which are contained in international instruments to which Kenya is a State Party.&quot; Kenyan lawyer Leonard Sigey Bett filed a petition with the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands challenging the evictions. Environmental conservation groups generally support the eviction of people from the forest, but only if the exercise is done amicably and humanely.

<text>A knife (: knives; from Old Norse &#x27;knife, dirk&#x27;) is a tool or weapon with a cutting edge or blade, usually attached to a handle or hilt. One of the earliest tools used by humanity, knives appeared at least 2.5 million years ago, as evidenced by the Oldowan tools. Originally made of wood, bone, and stone (such as flint and obsidian), over the centuries, in step with improvements in both metallurgy and manufacturing, knife blades have been made from copper, bronze, iron, steel, ceramic, and titanium. Most modern knives have either fixed or folding blades; blade patterns and styles vary by maker and country of origin.

Knives can serve various purposes. Hunters use a hunting knife, soldiers use the combat knife, scouts, campers, and hikers carry a pocketknife; there are kitchen knives for preparing foods (the chef&#x27;s knife, the paring knife, bread knife, cleaver), table knife (butter knives and steak knives), weapons (daggers or switchblades), knives for throwing or juggling, and knives for religious ceremony or display (the kirpan).

==Parts==

A modern knife consists of:
# the &quot;blade&quot;
# the &quot;handle&quot;
# the &quot;point&quot; – the end of the knife used for piercing
# the &quot;edge&quot; – the cutting surface of the knife extending from the point to the heel
# the &quot;grind&quot; – the cross section shape of the blade
# the &quot;spine&quot; – the thickest section of the blade; on a single-edged knife, the side opposite the edge; on a two-edged knife, more toward the middle
# the &quot;fuller&quot; – a groove added to make the blade lighter (optional)
# the &quot;ricasso&quot; – the flat section of the blade located at the junction of the blade and the knife&#x27;s bolster or guard (optional) 
# the – the barrier between the blade and the handle which prevents the hand from slipping forward onto the blade and protects the hand from the external forces that are usually applied to the blade during use (optional)
# the &quot;hilt&quot; or &quot;butt&quot; – the end of the handle used for blunt force
# the &quot;lanyard&quot; – a strap used to secure the knife to the wrist (optional)

The blade edge can be plain or serrated, or a combination of both. Single-edged knives may have a &quot;reverse edge&quot; or &quot;false edge&quot; occupying a section of the spine. These edges are usually serrated and are used to further enhance function.

The handle, used to grip and manipulate the blade safely, may include a &quot;tang&quot;, a portion of the blade that extends into the handle. Knives are made with partial tangs (extending part way into the handle, known as &quot;stick tangs&quot;) or full tangs (extending the full length of the handle, often visible on top and bottom). There is also the &quot;enterçado&quot; construction method present in antique knives from Brazil, such as the Sorocaban Knife, which consists in riveting a repurposed blade to the ricasso of a bladeless handle. The handle may include a bolster, a piece of heavy material (usually metal) situated at the front or rear of the handle. The bolster, as its name suggests, is used to mechanically strengthen the knife.

===Blade===

Knife blades can be manufactured from a variety of materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminated blades use multiple metals to create a layered structure, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be pressed between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Damascus steel is a form of pattern welding with similarities to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.

Titanium is a metal that has a better strength-to-weight ratio, is more wear resistant, and more flexible than steel. Although less hard and unable to take as sharp an edge, carbides in the titanium alloy allow them to be heat-treated to a sufficient hardness. Ceramic blades are hard, brittle, lightweight, and do not corrode: they may maintain a sharp edge for years with no maintenance at all, but are fragile and will break if dropped on a hard surface or twisted in use. They can only be sharpened on silicon carbide sandpaper and appropriate grinding wheels. Plastic blades are not sharp and are usually serrated to enable them to cut. They are often disposable.
Steel blades are commonly shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades are made by heating a single piece of steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers&#x27; more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral bolsters can be crafted through either shaping method.

Knives are sharpened in various ways. Flat ground blades have a profile that tapers from the thick spine to the sharp edge in a straight or line. Seen in cross section, the blade would form a long, thin triangle, or where the taper does not extend to the back of the blade, a long thin rectangle with one peaked side. Hollow ground blades have , beveled edges. The resulting blade has a thinner edge, so it may have better cutting ability for shallow cuts, but it is lighter and less durable than flat ground blades and will tend to bind in deep cuts. Serrated blade knives have a wavy, scalloped or saw-like blade. Serrated blades are more well suited for tasks that require aggressive &#x27;sawing&#x27; motions, whereas plain edge blades are better suited for tasks that require push-through cuts (e.g., shaving, chopping, slicing).

Many knives have holes in the blade for various uses. Holes are commonly drilled in blades to reduce friction while cutting, increase single-handed usability of pocket knives, and, for butchers&#x27; knives, allow hanging out of the way when not in use.

====Fixed-blade features====

A fixed blade knife, sometimes called a sheath knife, does not fold or slide, and is typically stronger due to the tang, the extension of the blade into the handle, and lack of moving parts.

====Folding blade features====
A folding knife connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, allowing the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent injury to the knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user&#x27;s hand, folding knives typically have a locking mechanism. Different locking mechanisms are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.
Popular locking mechanisms include:
* &quot;Slip joint&quot; – Found most commonly on traditional pocket knives, the opened blade does not lock, but is held in place by a spring device that allows the blade to fold if a certain amount of pressure is applied.
* &quot;Lockback&quot; – Also known as the &quot;spine lock&quot;, the lockback includes a pivoted latch affixed to a spring, and can be disengaged only by pressing the latch down to release the blade.
* &quot;Linerlock&quot; – Invented by Michael Walker, a Linerlock is a folding knife with a side-spring lock that can be opened and closed with one hand without repositioning the knife in the hand. The lock is self-adjusting for wear.
* &quot;Compression Lock&quot; – A variant of the Liner Lock, it uses a small piece of metal at the tip of the lock to lock into a small corresponding impression in the blade. This creates a lock that does not disengage when the blade is torqued, instead of becoming more tightly locked. It is released by pressing the tab of metal to the side, to allow the blade to be placed into its groove set into the handle.
* &quot;Frame Lock&quot; – Also known as the &quot;integral lock&quot; or &quot;monolock&quot;, this locking mechanism was invented by a custom knifemaker Chris Reeve for the Sebenza as an update to the liner lock. The frame lock works in a manner similar to the liner lock but uses a partial cutout of the actual knife handle, rather than a separate liner inside the handle to hold the blade in place.
* &quot;Collar lock&quot; – found on Opinel knives.
* &quot;Button Lock&quot; – Found mainly on automatic knives, this type of lock uses a small push-button to open and release the knife.
* &quot;Axis Lock&quot; – A locking mechanism patented by Benchmade Knife Company until 2020. A cylindrical bearing is tensioned such that it will jump between the knife blade and some feature of the handle to lock the blade open.
* &quot;Arc Lock&quot; – A locking mechanism exclusively licensed to SOG Specialty Knives. It differs from an axis lock in that the cylindrical bearing is tensioned by a rotary spring rather than an axial spring.
* &quot;Ball Bearing Lock&quot; – A locking mechanism exclusively licensed to Spyderco. This lock is conceptually similar to the axis and arc locks but the bearing is instead a ball bearing.
* &quot;Tri-Ad Lock&quot; – A locking mechanism exclusively licensed to Cold Steel. It is a form of lockback which incorporates a thick steel stop pin between the front of the latch and the back of the tang to transfer force from the blade into the handle.
* &quot;PickLock&quot; – A round post on the back base of the blade locks into a hole in a spring tab in the handle. To close, manually lift (pick) the spring tab (lock) off the blade post with your fingers, or in &quot;Italian Style Stilettos&quot; swivel the bolster (hand guard) clockwise to lift the spring tab off the blade post.

Another prominent feature of many folding knives is the opening mechanism. Traditional pocket knives and Swiss Army knives commonly employ the nail nick, while modern folding knives more often use a stud, hole, disk, or &quot;flipper&quot; located on the blade, all of which have the benefit of allowing the user to open the knife with one hand.

The &quot;wave&quot; feature is another prominent design, which uses a part of the blade that protrudes outward to catch on one&#x27;s pocket as it is drawn, thus opening the blade; this was patented by Ernest Emerson and is not only used on many of the Emerson knives, but also on knives produced by several other manufacturers, notably Spyderco and Cold Steel.

&quot;Automatic&quot; or &quot;switchblade&quot; knives open using the stored energy from a spring that is released when the user presses a button or lever or other actuator built into the handle of the knife. Automatic knives are severely restricted by law in the UK and most American states.

Increasingly common are &quot;assisted opening&quot; knives which use springs to propel the blade once the user has moved it past a certain angle. These differ from automatic or switchblade knives in that the blade is not released by means of a button or catch on the handle; rather, the blade itself is the actuator. Most assisted openers use flippers as their opening mechanism. Assisted opening knives can be as fast or faster than automatic knives to deploy.

=====Common locking mechanisms=====

In the lock back, as in many folding knives, a stop pin acting on the top (or behind) the blade prevents it from rotating clockwise. A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade from rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, lifting the hook and freeing the blade.

When negative pressure (pushing down on the spine) is applied to the blade all the stress is transferred from the hook on the blade&#x27;s tang to the hook on the rocker bar and thence to the small rocker pin. Excessive stress can shear one or both of these hooks rendering the knife effectively useless. Knife company Cold Steel uses a variant of the lock back called the Tri-Ad Lock which introduces a pin in front of the rocker bar to relieve stress on the rocker pin, has an elongated hole around the rocker pin to allow the mechanism to wear over time without losing strength and angles the hooks so that the faces no longer meet vertically.

The bolt in the bolt lock is a rectangle of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the bolt to the forward position where it rests above the tang of the blade preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through the handle of the knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backward freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.

In the liner lock, an L-shaped split in the liner allows part of the liner to move sideways from its resting position against the handle to the centre of the knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests flush against the handle allowing the knife to rotate. A frame lock is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner inside the handle material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.

====Sliding blade features====
A sliding knife is a knife that can be opened by sliding the knife blade out the front of the handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the gravity knife). Another form is an OTF (out-the-front) switchblade, which only requires the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).

===Handle===
The handles of knives can be made from a number of different materials, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Handles are produced in a wide variety of shapes and styles. Handles are often textured to enhance grip.
* Wood handles provide good grip and are warm in the hand, but are more difficult to care for. They do not resist water well, and will crack or warp with prolonged exposure to water. Modern stabilized and laminated woods have largely overcome these problems. Many beautiful and exotic hardwoods are employed in the manufacture of custom and some production knives. In some countries it is now forbidden for commercial butchers&#x27; knives to have wood handles, for sanitary reasons.
* Plastic handles are more easily cared for than wooden handles, but can be slippery and become brittle over time.
* Injection molded handles made from higher grade plastics are composed of polyphthalamide, and when marketed under trademarked names such as &quot;Zytel&quot; or &quot;Grivory&quot;, are reinforced with &quot;Kevlar&quot; or fiberglass. These are often used by major knife manufacturers.
* Rubber handles such as Kraton or Resiprene-C are generally preferred over plastic due to their durable and cushioning nature.
* Micarta is a popular handle material on &quot;user&quot; knives due to its toughness and stability. Micarta is nearly impervious to water, is &quot;grippy&quot; when wet, and is an excellent insulator. Micarta has come to refer to any fibrous material cast in resin. There are many varieties of micarta available. One very popular version is a fiberglass impregnated resin called G-10.
* Leather handles are seen on some hunting and military knives, notably the KA-BAR. Leather handles are typically produced by stacking leather washers, or less commonly, as a sleeve surrounding another handle material. Russian manufacturers often use birchbark in the same manner.
* Skeleton handles refers to the practice of using the tang itself as the handle, usually with sections of material removed to reduce weight. Skeleton handled knives are often wrapped with parachute cord or other wrapping materials to enhance grip.
* Stainless steel and aluminum handles are durable and sanitary, but can be slippery. To counter this, premium knife makers make handles with ridges, bumps, or indentations to provide extra grip. Another problem with knives that have metal handles is that, since metal is an excellent heat-conductor, these knives can be very uncomfortable, and even painful or dangerous, when handled without gloves or other protective handwear in (very) cold climates.

More exotic materials usually only seen on art or ceremonial knives include: Stone, bone, mammoth tooth, mammoth ivory, oosik (walrus penis bone), walrus tusk, antler (often called stag in a knife context), sheep horn, buffalo horn, teeth, and mop (mother of pearl or &quot;pearl&quot;). Many materials have been employed in knife handles.

Handles may be adapted to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities. For example, knife handles may be made thicker or with more cushioning for people with arthritis in their hands. A non-slip handle accommodates people with palmar hyperhidrosis.

==Rituals and superstitions==

The knife plays a significant role in some cultures through ritual and superstition, as the knife was an essential tool for survival since early man. Knife symbols can be found in various cultures to symbolize all stages of life; for example, a knife placed under the bed while giving birth is said to ease the pain, or, stuck into the headboard of a cradle, to protect the baby; knives were included in some Anglo-Saxon burial rites, so the dead would not be defenseless in the next world. The knife plays an important role in some initiation rites, and many cultures perform rituals with a variety of knives, including the ceremonial sacrifices of animals. Samurai warriors, as part of bushido, could perform ritual suicide, or seppuku, with a tantō, a common Japanese knife. An athame, a ceremonial knife, is used in Wicca and derived forms of neopagan witchcraft.

In Greece, a black-handled knife placed under the pillow is used to keep away nightmares. As early as 1646 reference is made to a superstition of laying a knife across another piece of cutlery being a sign of witchcraft. A common belief is that if a knife is given as a gift, the relationship of the giver and recipient will be severed. Something such as a small coin, dove or a valuable item is exchanged for the gift, rendering &quot;payment.&quot;

==Legislation==

Some types of knives are restricted by law, and carrying of knives may be regulated, because they are often used in crime, although restrictions vary greatly by jurisdiction and type of knife. For example, some laws prohibit carrying knives in public while other laws prohibit possession of certain knives, such as switchblades.

<doc id="17163" wikidata="Q668642" url="?curid=17163" title="Knockout">
<text>A knockout (abbreviated to KO or K.O.) is a fight-ending, winning criterion in several full-contact combat sports, such as boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, mixed martial arts, karate, some forms of taekwondo and other sports involving striking, as well as fighting-based video games. A full knockout is considered any legal strike or combination thereof that renders an opponent unable to continue fighting.

The term is often associated with a sudden traumatic loss of consciousness caused by a physical blow. Single powerful blows to the head (particularly the jawline and temple) can produce a cerebral concussion or a carotid sinus reflex with syncope and cause a sudden, dramatic KO. Body blows, particularly the liver punch, can cause progressive, debilitating pain that can also result in a KO.

In boxing and kickboxing, a knockout is usually awarded when one participant falls to the canvas and is unable to rise to their feet within a specified period of time, typically because of exhaustion, pain, disorientation, or unconsciousness. For example, if a boxer is knocked down and is unable to continue the fight within a ten-second count, they are counted as having been knocked out and their opponent is awarded the KO victory.

In mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions, no time count is given after a knockdown, as the sport allows submission grappling as well as ground and pound. If a fighter loses consciousness (&quot;goes limp&quot;) as a result of legal strikes, it is declared a KO. Even if the fighter loses consciousness for a brief moment and wakes up again to continue to fight, the fight is stopped and a KO is declared. As many MMA fights can take place on the mat rather than standing, it is possible to score a KO via ground and pound, a common victory for grapplers. 

In fighting games such as &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Tekken&quot;, a player scores a knockout by fully depleting the opponent&#x27;s health bar, with the victor being awarded the round. The player who wins the most rounds, either by scoring the most knockouts or by having more vitality remaining when time expires during each round, wins the match. This differs from combat sports in reality, where a knockout ends the match immediately. However, some fighting games aim for a more realistic experience, with titles like &quot;Fight Night&quot; adhering to the rules of professional boxing, although technically they are classified as sports games, and share many of the same features as NFL and NBA video games.

==Technical knockout ==

A technical knockout (TKO or T.K.O.), stoppage, or referee stopped contest (RSC) is declared when the referee decides during a round that a fighter cannot safely continue the match for any reason. Certain sanctioning bodies also allow the official attending physician at ringside to stop the fight as well. In amateur boxing, and in many regions professionally, including championship fights sanctioned by the World Boxing Association (WBA), a TKO is declared when a fighter is knocked down three times in one round (called an &quot;automatic knockout&quot; in WBA rules). Furthermore, in amateur boxing, a boxer automatically wins by TKO if his opponent is knocked down four times in an entire match. 

In MMA bouts, the referee may declare a TKO if a fighter cannot intelligently defend themselves while being repeatedly struck.

== Double knockout ==

A double knockout, both in real-life combat sports and in fighting-based video games, occurs when both fighters trade blows and knock each other out simultaneously and are both unable to continue fighting.

In amateur boxing, a double knockout result is determined based on the round of competition. In all contests &quot;except&quot; the final, both fighters are declared to have lost the contest and are eliminated. In the final, where there must be a winner, the contest ends as if the bell sounded at the end of the final round, and the round is scored, with the winner determined by points. However, if both boxers are downed, both rise up, but one has reached the limit of knockdowns, the winning boxer is the one who has not reached the three/four knockdown limit.
==Physical characteristics==

Little is known as to what exactly causes one to be knocked unconscious, but many agree it is related to trauma to the brain stem. This usually happens when the head rotates sharply, often as a result of a strike. There are three general manifestations of such trauma:
* a typical knockout, which results in a sustained (three seconds or more) loss of consciousness (comparable to general anesthesia, in that the recipient emerges and has lost memory of the event).
* a &quot;flash&quot; knockout, when a very transient (less than three seconds) loss of consciousness occurs (in the context of a knock-down) and the recipient often maintains awareness and memory of the combat.
* a &quot;stunning&quot;, a &quot;dazing&quot; or a fighter being &quot;out on his feet&quot;, when basic consciousness is maintained (and the fighter never leaves his feet) despite a general loss of awareness and extreme distortions in proprioception, balance, visual fields, and auditory processing. Referees are taught specifically to watch for this state, as it cannot be improved by sheer willpower and usually means the fighter is already concussed and unable to safely defend themselves.

A basic principle of boxing and other combat sports is to defend against this vulnerability by keeping both hands raised about the face and the chin tucked in. This may still be ineffective if the opponent punches effectively to the solar plexus.

A fighter who becomes unconscious from a strike with sufficient knockout power is referred to as having been &quot;knocked out&quot; or &quot;KO&#x27;d&quot; (&quot;kay-ohd&quot;). Losing balance without losing consciousness is referred to as being &quot;knocked down&quot; (&quot;down but not out&quot;). Repeated blows to the head, regardless of whether they cause loss of consciousness, may in severe cases cause strokes or paralysis in the immediacy, and over time have been linked to permanent neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (&quot;punch-drunk syndrome&quot;). Because of this, many physicians advise against sports involving knockouts.

==Knockdown==

A knockdown occurs when a fighter touches the floor of the ring with any part of the body other than the feet following a hit, but is able to rise back up and continue fighting. The term is also used if the fighter is hanging on to the ropes, caught between the ropes, or is hanging over the ropes and is unable to fall to the floor and cannot protect himself. A knockdown triggers a count by the referee (normally to 10); if the fighter fails the count, then the fight is ended as a KO.

A flash knockdown is a knockdown in which the fighter hits the canvas but is not noticeably hurt or affected.

<text>The Kalahari Desert is a large semi-arid sandy savanna in Southern Africa extending for , covering much of Botswana, as well as parts of Namibia and South Africa.

It is not to be confused with the Angolan, Namibian, and South African Namib coastal desert, whose name is of Khoekhoegowab origin and means &quot;vast place&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Kalahari&quot; is derived from the Tswana word &quot;Kgala&quot;, meaning &quot;the great thirst&quot;, or &quot;Kgalagadi&quot;, meaning &quot;a waterless place&quot;; the Kalahari has vast areas covered by red sand without any permanent surface water.

== History ==

The Kalahari Desert was not always a dry desert. The fossil flora and fauna from Gcwihaba Cave in Botswana indicates that the region was much wetter and cooler at least from 30 to 11 thousand Before Present, especially after 17,500 BP.

== Geography ==
Drainage of the desert is by dry black valleys, seasonally inundated pans, and the large salt pans of the Makgadikgadi Pan in Botswana and Etosha Pan in Namibia. The only permanent river, the Okavango, flows into a delta in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds—called omuramba—traverse the central northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season.

A semi-desert, with huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains, the Kalahari supports more animals and plants than a true desert, such as the Namib Desert to the west. There is little rainfall, and the summer temperature is very high. The driest areas usually receive of rain per year, and the wettest just a little over . The surrounding Kalahari Basin covers over extending farther into Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, encroaching into parts of Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

==Climate==
The climate is sub-humid rather than semi-arid in the north and east, where the dry forests, savannahs, and salt lakes prevail. South and west, where the vegetation is predominantly xeric savanna or even a semi-desert, the climate is &quot;Kalaharian&quot; semi-arid. The Kalaharian climate is subtropical (average annual temperature greater than or equal to 18 °C, at peaks reaching 40 °C and above, with mean monthly temperature of the coldest month strictly below 18 °C), and is semi-arid with the dry season from April to September, the coldest six months of the year. It is the southern tropical equivalent of the Sahelian climate with the wet season during summer. The altitude has been adduced as the explanation why the Kalaharian climate is not tropical; its altitude ranges from 600 to 1600 meters (and generally from 800 to 1200 meters), resulting in a cooler climate than that of the Sahel or Sahara. For example, winter frost is common from June to August, rarely seen in the warmer Sahelian regions. For the same reason, summer temperatures certainly can be very hot, but not in comparison to regions of low altitude in the Sahel or Sahara, where some stations record average temperatures of the warmest month around 38 °C, whereas the average temperature of the warmest month in any region in the Kalahari never exceeds 29 °C, though daily temperatures occasionally reach up to close to (44.8 °C at Twee Rivieren Rest Camp in 2012).
The dry season lasts eight months or more, and the wet season typically from less than one month to four months, depending on location. The southwestern Kalahari is the driest area, particularly a small region toward the west-southwest of Tsaraxaibis (Southeast of Namibia). The average annual rainfall ranges from around 110 mm (close to aridity) to more than 500 mm in some north and east areas. During summertime in all regions, rainfall may go with heavy thunderstorms. In the driest and sunniest parts of the Kalahari, over 4,000 hours of sunshine are recorded annually on average.

In the Kalahari, there are three main mechanisms of atmospheric circulation, dominated by the Kalahari High anticyclone in winter, and by the Kalahari Heat Low in summer:

* The North and Northwest of the Kalahari are subject to the alternation &quot;Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)/&quot;Continental Trade winds&quot;. The ITCZ is the meeting area of the boreal trade winds with their austral counterparts what meteorologists call &quot;Meteorological equator&quot; and the sailors &quot;Doldrum&quot; or &quot;Pot-au-noir&quot; : the ITCZ generates rains in the wet season, whereas the continental trade winds cause the dry season;
* The rest of the Kalahari is subject to the maritime trade winds that largely shed their moisture as they cross up and over the Southern African Great Escarpment before arriving over the Kalahari.
*In the southern hemisphere summer (from December to February), a low-pressure system develops over the Kalahari, which is driven by strong surface heating (known as a Thermal Low). The low-pressure system helps to control the moisture-bearing easterly wind emanating from the Indian Ocean, thus influencing rainfall across southern Africa.

There are huge subterranean water reserves beneath parts of the Kalahari; the Dragon&#x27;s Breath Cave, for example, is the largest documented non-subglacial underground lake. Such reserves may partly be the residues of ancient lakes; the Kalahari Desert was once a much wetter place. The ancient Lake Makgadikgadi dominated the area, covering the Makgadikgadi Pan and surrounding areas, but it drained or dried out some 10,000 years ago. It may have once covered as much as . In ancient times, there was sufficient moisture for farming, with dikes and dams collecting the water. These are now filled with sediment, breached, or no longer in use, though they can be readily seen via Google Earth.

The Kalahari has had a complex climatic history over the past million or so years, in line with major global changes. Changes in the last 250,000 years have been reconstructed from various data sources, providing evidence of former extensive lakes and drier periods. During the latter, the area of the Kalahari has expanded to include parts of western Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Angola.

==Vegetation and flora==
Due to its low aridity, the Kalahari supports a variety of flora. The native flora includes acacia trees and many other herbs and grasses. The kiwano fruit, also known as the horned melon, melano, African horned cucumber, jelly melon, or hedged gourd, is endemic to a region in the Kalahari Desert (specific region unknown).

Even where the Kalahari &quot;desert&quot; is dry enough to qualify as a desert in the sense of having low precipitation, it is not strictly speaking a desert because it has too dense a ground cover. The main region that lacks ground cover is in the southwest Kalahari (southeast of Namibia, northwest of South Africa, and southwest of Botswana) in the south of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. For instance, in the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality of South Africa, total vegetation cover may be as low as 30.72% on non-protected (from cattle grazing) farmlands south of Twee Rivieren Rest Camp and 37.74% in the protected (from cattle grazing) South African side of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park: these southernmost Kalahari xeric savanna areas are truly semi-deserts. However, in all the remaining Kalahari, except on salt pans during the dry season, the vegetation cover can be denser, up to almost 100%, in some limited areas.

In an area of about 600,000 km2 in the south and west of the Kalahari, the vegetation is mainly xeric savanna. This area is the ecoregion identified by World Wide Fund for Nature as Kalahari xeric savanna AT1309. Typical savanna grasses include &quot;Schmidtia&quot;, &quot;Stipagrostis&quot;, &quot;Aristida&quot;, and &quot;Eragrostis&quot;; these are interspersed with trees such as camelthorn (&quot;Acacia erioloba&quot;), grey camelthorn (&quot;Acacia haematoxylon&quot;), shepherd&#x27;s tree (&quot;Boscia albitrunca&quot;), blackthorn (&quot;Acacia mellifera&quot;), and silver cluster-leaf (&quot;Terminalia sericea&quot;).

In certain areas where the climate is drier, it becomes a true semi-desert with ground not entirely covered by vegetation: &quot;open&quot; as opposed to &quot;closed&quot; vegetation. Examples include the north of the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality, itself in the north of South Africa, and the Keetmanshoop Rural in the southeast of Namibia. In the north and east, dry forests cover an area of over 300,000 km2 in which Rhodesian teak and several species of acacia are prominent. These regions are termed Kalahari Acacia-Baikiaea woodlands AT0709.

Outside the Kalahari &quot;desert&quot;, but in the Kalahari basin, halophytic vegetation to the north is adapted to pans, lakes that are completely dry during the dry season, and maybe for years during droughts, such as in Etosha (Etosha Pan halophytics AT0902) and Makgadikgadi (Zambezian halophytics AT0908).

A totally different vegetation is adapted to the perennial fresh water of the Okavango Delta, an ecoregion termed Zambezian flooded grasslands AT0907.

==Fauna==

The Kalahari is home to the lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;), cheetah (&quot;Acinonyx jubatus&quot;), African leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;), spotted hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;), brown hyena (&quot;Parahyaena brunnea&quot;), and African wild dog (&quot;Lycaon pictus pictus&quot;). Birds of prey include the secretarybird (&quot;Sagittarius serpentarius&quot;), martial eagle (&quot;Polemaetus bellicosus&quot;) and other eagles, the giant eagle owl (&quot;Bubo lacteus&quot;) and other owls, falcons, goshawks, kestrels, and kites. Other animals include wildebeest, springbok, gemsbok and other antelopes, Cape porcupines (&quot;Hystrix africaeaustralis&quot;), and ostriches (&quot;Struthio camelus&quot;).

Some of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal wetlands, such as the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. This area, for example, supports numerous halophilic species, and in the rainy season, tens of thousands of flamingos visit these pans.

==Protected areas==
The following protected areas were established in the Kalahari:
*Central Kalahari Game Reserve
*Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park
*Khutse Game Reserve
*Tswalu Kalahari

==Population==

The San people have lived in the Kalahari for 20,000 years as hunter-gatherers. They hunt wild game with bows and poisoned arrows and gather edible plants, such as berries, melons and nuts, as well as insects. The San get most of their water requirements from plant roots and desert melons found on or under the desert floor. They often store water in the blown-out shells of ostrich eggs. The San live in huts built from local materials—the frame is made of branches, and the roof is thatched with long grass. Most of their hunting and gathering techniques replicate pre-historic tribes. Bantu-speaking Tswana, Kgalagadi, and Herero and a small number of European settlers also live in the Kalahari desert. The city of Windhoek is situated in the Kalahari Basin.

==Kalahari, San and diamonds==
In 1996, De Beers evaluated the potential of diamond mining at Gope. In 1997, the eviction of the San and Bakgalagadi tribes in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve from their land began.
In 2006, a Botswana High Court ruled in favor of the San and Bakgalagadi tribes in the reserve, finding their eviction unlawful. The Government of Botswana granted a permit to De Beers&#x27; Gem Diamonds/Gope Exploration Company (Pty) Ltd. to conduct mining activities within the reserve.

<doc id="17166" wikidata="Q217242" url="?curid=17166" title="Katanga Province">
<text>Katanga was one of the four large provinces created in the Belgian Congo in 1914.
It was one of the eleven provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1966 and 2015, when it was split into the Tanganyika, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Between 1971 and 1997 (during the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko when Congo was known as Zaire), its official name was Shaba Province.

Katanga&#x27;s area encompassed . Farming and ranching are carried out on the Katanga Plateau. The eastern part of the province is a rich mining region which supplies cobalt, copper, tin, radium, uranium, and diamonds. The region&#x27;s former capital, Lubumbashi, is the second-largest city in the Congo.

==History==

Copper mining in Katanga dates back over 1,000 years, and mines in the region were producing standard-sized ingots of copper for international transport by the end of the 10th century CE.

In the 1890s, the province was beleaguered from the south by Cecil Rhodes&#x27; Northern Rhodesia, and from the north by the Belgian Congo, the personal possession of King Leopold II of Belgium. Msiri, the King of Katanga, (no such title exist, Msiri is a title for local authority in area controlled by Kazembe) held out against both, but eventually Katanga was subsumed by the Belgian Congo.

After 1900, the Societe Generale de Belgique practically controlled all of the mining in the province through Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK). This included uranium, radium, copper, cobalt, zinc, cadmium, germanium, manganese, silver, gold, and tin.

In 1915, a deposit of pitchblende and other uranium minerals of a higher grade than had ever been found before anywhere in the world and higher than any found since were discovered at Shinkolobwe. The discovery was kept secret by UMHK. After World War I ended a factory was built at Olen; the secrecy was lifted at the end of 1922 with the announcement of the production of the first gram of radium from the pitchblende. By the start of World War II, the mining companies &quot;constituted a state within the Belgian Congo&quot;. The Shinkolobwe mine near Jadotville (now Likasi) was at the centre of the Manhattan Project.
In 1960, after the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then called Republic of the Congo) gained independence from Belgium, the UMHK, Moise Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo supported the secession of Katanga province from the Congo. This was supported by Belgium but opposed by the Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. This led to the assassination of Lumumba and the Katanga Crisis (or &quot;Congo Crisis&quot;), which lasted from 1960 to 1965. The breakaway State of Katanga existed from 1960 to 1963, then was reintegrated.

In 2005, the new constitution specified that Katanga was to be split up into separately administered provinces.

Militias such as Mai Mai Kata Katanga led by Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga fought for Katanga to secede, and his group briefly took over the provincial capital Lubumbashi in 2013.

In 2015, Katanga Province was split into the constitutional provinces of Tanganyika, Haut-Lomami, Lualaba, and Haut-Katanga.

==Economy==
Copper mining is an important part of the economy of Katanga province. Cobalt mining by individual contractors is also prevalent. A number of reasons have been advanced for the failure of the vast mineral wealth of the province to increase the overall standard of living. The local provincial budget was US$440 million in 2011.

==Mining==

Lubumbashi, the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is a hub for many of the country&#x27;s biggest mining companies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces &quot;more than 3 percent of the world’s copper and half its cobalt, most of which comes from Katanga&quot;.

Major mining concessions include Tilwezembe and Kalukundi.

===Mining companies===
*Gécamines, (&quot;La Générale des Carrières et des Mines&quot;, the former UMHK), the state-owned copper-cobalt mining company, had monopoly concessions in the province.
*Katanga Mining Ltd &quot;TSX:KAT&quot; operates a major mining complex in Katanga province, producing refined copper and cobalt with the &quot;potential of becoming Africa’s largest copper producer and the world’s largest cobalt producer&quot;. Katanga Mining Ltd is majority-owned by Swiss commodity trader Glencore DCC. A joint venture of Katanga Mining (75%) and Gécamines (25%) began mining Tilwezembe, an open-pit copper and cobalt mine, in 2007.

==Geography==

The province bordered Angola and formed the entire Congolese border with Zambia. It also bordered Tanzania – although on Lake Tanganyika rather than on land. Katanga has a wet and dry season. Rainfall is about .

The province was divided in 2015 into five successor provinces, based on the districts of Katanga at that time:
==Education and medical care==
The University of Lubumbashi, located in the northern part of Lubumbashi city, is the largest university in the province and one of the largest in the country.

TESOL, the English Language School of Lubumbashi, is a secondary school that serves the expatriate community. It was founded in 1987 on the grounds of the French School, Lycée Français Blaise Pascal, which suspended operations in 1991 with a new French School starting in 2009.

Katanga province has the highest rate of infant mortality in the world, with 184 of 1000 babies born expected to die before the age of five.
==Transportation==
The Congo Railway provides Katanga Province with limited railway service centered on Lubumbashi. Reliability is limited. Lubumbashi International Airport is located northeast of Lubumbashi. In April 2014, a train derailment killed 63 people.

== People ==
*Laurent-Désiré Kabila, former president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
*Moise Tshombe, former president of the breakaway State of Katanga
*Barbara Kanam, popular singer
*Frédéric Kibassa Maliba, former opposition leader and president of UDPS
*Odilon Kafitwe wa pa Bowa, former national minister of Zaire and leader of UFERI
*Lunda Bululu, former prime minister of Zaire
*Godefroid Munongo, politician

<text>Kathmandu, officially the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, is the seat of federal government and the most populous city in Nepal. As of the 2021 Nepal census, there were 845,767 inhabitants living in 105,649 households and approximately 4 million people in its surrounding agglomeration. It is located in the Kathmandu Valley, a large valley surrounded by hills in central Nepal, at an altitude of 4,344 feet (1,324 metres) above sea level. 

The city is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, founded in the 2nd century AD. The valley was historically called the &quot;Nepal Mandala&quot; (the name for the cosmic elements of water Dha mandala in Newari, and cosmos), and has been the home of the Newar people, a cosmopolitan urban civilization in the Himalayan foothills. The city was the royal capital of the Kingdom of Nepal and hosts palaces, mansions and gardens built by the Nepali aristocracy. It has been home to the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) since 1985. Today, it is the seat of government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, established in 2008, and is part of Bagmati Province.

Kathmandu is and has been for many years the centre of Nepal&#x27;s history, art, culture, and economy. It has a multi-ethnic population within a Hindu and Buddhist majority. Religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Tourism is an important part of the economy in the city. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top ten upcoming travel destinations in the world by TripAdvisor, and ranked first in Asia. The city is considered the gateway to the Nepal Himalayas and is home to several World Heritage Sites: the Durbar Square, Swayambhu Mahachaitya, Bouddha and Pashupatinath. Kathmandu valley is growing at 4 per cent per year according to the World Bank in 2010, making it one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in South Asia, and the first region in Nepal to face the unprecedented challenges of rapid urbanization and modernization at a metropolitan scale. It is the largest metropolitan area located in the Himalayas.

== Etymology ==

The indigenous Nepal Bhasa term for Kathmandu is &quot;Yen&quot;. The Nepali name &quot;Kathmandu&quot; comes from Kasthamandap, a building that stood in Kathmandu Durbar Square and was completely destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake (it has since been reconstructed). In Sanskrit, () means &quot;wood&quot; and () means &quot;pavilion&quot;. This public pavilion, also known as &quot;Maru Satta&quot; in Newari, was rebuilt in 1596 by Biseth in the period of King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The three-storey structure was made entirely of wood and used no iron nails nor supports. According to legends, all the timber used to build the pagoda was obtained from a single tree.

The colophons of ancient manuscripts, dated as late as the 20th century, refer to Kathmandu as in Nepal Mandala. Mahānagar means &quot;great city&quot;. The city is called in a vow that Buddhist priests still recite to this day. Thus, Kathmandu is also known as . During medieval times, the city was sometimes called Kāntipur (). This name is derived from two Sanskrit words – and . is a word that stands for &quot;beauty&quot; and is mostly associated with light and means place, thus giving it the meaning, &quot;City of light&quot;.

Among the indigenous Newar people, Kathmandu is known as &quot;Yeṃ Dey&quot; (), and Patan and Bhaktapur are known as &quot;Yala Dey&quot; () and &quot;Khwopa Dey&quot; () respectively. &quot;Yen&quot; is the shorter form of &quot;Yambu&quot; (), which originally referred to the northern half of Kathmandu. The older northern settlements were referred to as Yambi while the southern settlement was known as Yangala.

== History ==


Archaeological excavations in parts of Kathmandu have found evidence of ancient civilizations. The oldest of these findings is a statue, found in Maligaon, that was dated at 185 AD. The excavation of Dhando Chaitya uncovered a brick with an inscription in Brahmi script. Archaeologists believe that it is two thousand years old. Stone inscriptions are ubiquitous elements at the heritage sites and are key sources for the history of Nepal.

The earliest Western reference to Kathmandu appears in an account of Portuguese Jesuit Father Joao Cabral who passed through the Kathmandu Valley in the spring of 1628 and was received graciously by the king of that time, probably King Lakshminarasimha Malla of Kathmandu on their way from Tibet to India. Father Cabral reported that they reached &quot;Cadmendu&quot;, the capital of Nepal kingdom.

=== Ancient history ===

The ancient history of Kathmandu is described in its traditional myths and legends. According to the Swayambhu Purana, present-day Kathmandu was once a huge and deep lake named &quot;Nagdaha&quot;, as it was full of snakes. The lake was cut drained by Bodhisattva Manjushri with his sword, and the water was evacuated out from there. He then established a city called Manjupattan, and made Dharmakar the ruler of the valley land. After some time, a demon named Banasura closed the outlet, and the valley again turned into a lake. Krishna came to Nepal, killed Banasura, and again drained out the water by cutting the edge of Chobhar hill with this Sudarshana Chakra. He brought some cowherds along with him, and made Bhuktaman the king of Nepal.

Kotirudra Samhita of Shiva Purana, Chapter 11, &quot;Shloka&quot; 18 refers to the place as Nayapala city, which was famous for its Pashupati Shivalinga. The name Nepal probably originates from this city Nayapala.

Very few historical records exists of the period before medieval Licchavi rulers. According to Gopalraj Vansawali, a genealogy of Nepali monarchy, the rulers of Kathmandu Valley before the Licchavis were Gopalas, Mahispalas, Aabhirs, Kirat, and Somavanshi. The Kirata dynasty was established by Yalamber. During the Kirata era, a settlement called Yambu existed in the northern half of old Kathmandu. In some of the Sino-Tibetan languages, Kathmandu is still called Yambu. Another smaller settlement called Yengal was present in the southern half of old Kathmandu, near Manjupattan. During the reign of the seventh Kirata ruler, Jitedasti, Buddhist monks entered Kathmandu valley and established a forest monastery at Sankhu.

==== Licchavi era ====

The Licchavis from Vaisali in modern-day Bihar, migrated north and defeated the Kirats, establishing the Licchavi dynasty, circa 400 AD. During this era, following the genocide of Shakyas in Lumbini by Virudhaka, the survivors migrated north and entered the forest monastery, masquerading as Koliyas. From Sankhu, they migrated to Yambu and Yengal (Lanjagwal and Manjupattan) and established the first permanent Buddhist monasteries of Kathmandu. This created the basis of Newar Buddhism, which is the only surviving Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition in the world. With their migration, Yambu was called Koligram and Yengal was called Dakshin Koligram during most of the Licchavi era.

Eventually, the Licchavi ruler Gunakamadeva merged Koligram and Dakshin Koligram, founding the city of Kathmandu. The city was designed in the shape of &quot;Chandrahrasa&quot;, the sword of Manjushri. The city was surrounded by eight barracks guarded by Ajimas. One of these barracks is still in use at Bhadrakali (in front of Singha Durbar). The city served as an important transit point in the trade between India and Tibet, leading to tremendous growth in architecture. Descriptions of buildings such as Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradiwas Bhawan have been found in the surviving journals of travellers and monks who lived during this era. For example, the famous 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang described Kailaskut Bhawan, the palace of the Licchavi king Amshuverma. 

The trade route also led to cultural exchange as well. The artistry of the Newar people—the indigenous inhabitants of the Kathmandu Valley—became highly sought after during this era, both within the Valley and throughout the greater Himalayas. Newar artists travelled extensively throughout Asia, creating religious art for their neighbours. For example, Araniko led a group of his compatriot artists through Tibet and China. Bhrikuti, the princess of Nepal who married Tibetan monarch Songtsän Gampo, was instrumental in introducing Buddhism to Tibet.

==== Malla era ====
The Licchavi era was followed by the Malla era. Rulers from Tirhut, upon being attacked by the Delhi Sultanate, fled north to the Kathmandu valley. They intermarried with Nepali royalty, and this led to the Malla era. The early years of the Malla era were turbulent, with raids and attacks from Khas and Turk Muslims. There was also a devastating earthquake which claimed the lives of a third of Kathmandu&#x27;s population, including the king Abhaya Malla. These disasters led to the destruction of most of the architecture of the Licchavi era (such as Mangriha and Kailashkut Bhawan), and the loss of literature collected in various monasteries within the city. Despite the initial hardships, Kathmandu rose to prominence again and, during most of the Malla era, dominated the trade between India and Tibet. Nepali currency became the standard currency in trans-Himalayan trade.

During the later part of the Malla era, Kathmandu Valley comprised four fortified cities: Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. These served as the capitals of the Malla confederation of Nepal. These states competed with each other in the arts, architecture, esthetics, and trade, resulting in tremendous development. The kings of this period directly influenced or involved themselves in the construction of public buildings, squares, and temples, as well as the development of waterspouts, the institutionalisation of trusts (called guthis), the codification of laws, the writing of dramas, and the performance of plays in city squares. Evidence of an influx of ideas from India, Tibet, China, Persia, and Europe among other places can be found in a stone inscription farom the time of king Pratap Malla. Books have been found from this era that describe their tantric tradition (e.g. Tantrakhyan), medicine (e.g. Haramekhala), religion (e.g. Mooldevshashidev), law, morals, and history. Amarkosh, a Sanskrit-Nepal Bhasa dictionary from 1381, was also found. Architecturally notable buildings from this era include Kathmandu Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the former durbar of Kirtipur, Nyatapola, Kumbheshwar, the Krishna temple, and others.

=== Medieval era ===
==== Early Shah rule ====

The Gorkha Kingdom ended the Malla confederation after the Battle of Kathmandu in 1768. This marked the beginning of the modern era in Kathmandu. The Battle of Kirtipur was the start of the Gorkha conquest of the Kathmandu Valley. Kathmandu was adopted as the capital of the Gorkha empire, and the empire itself was dubbed Nepal. During the early part of this era, Kathmandu maintained its distinctive culture. Buildings with characteristic Nepali architecture, such as the nine-story tower of Basantapur, were built during this era. However, trade declined because of continual war with neighbouring nations. Bhimsen Thapa supported France against Great Britain; this led to the development of modern military structures, such as modern barracks in Kathmandu. The nine-storey tower Dharahara was originally built during this era.

==== Rana rule ====

Rana rule over Nepal started with the Kot massacre of 1846, which occurred near Hanuman Dhoka Durbar. During this massacre, most of Nepal&#x27;s high-ranking officials were massacred by Jung Bahadur Rana and his supporters. Another massacre, the Bhandarkhal Massacre, was also conducted by Kunwar and his supporters in Kathmandu. During the Rana regime, Kathmandu&#x27;s alliance shifted from anti-British to pro-British; this led to the construction of the first buildings in the style of Western European architecture. The most well-known of these buildings include Singha Durbar, Garden of Dreams, Shital Niwas, and the old Narayanhiti palace. The first modern commercial road in the Kathmandu Valley, the New Road, was also built during this era. Trichandra College (the first college of Nepal), Durbar High School (the first modern school of Nepal), and Bir Hospital (the first hospital of Nepal) were built in Kathmandu during this era. Education was only accessible to the privileged class. Rana rule was marked by despotism, economic exploitation and religious persecution.

== Geography ==
Kathmandu is in the northwestern part of the Kathmandu Valley to the north of the Bagmati River and covers an area of . The average elevation is above sea level. The city is bounded by several other municipalities of the Kathmandu valley: south of the Bagmati by Lalitpur Metropolitan City (Patan), with which it forms one urban area surrounded by a ring road, to the southwest by Kirtipur and to the east by Madyapur Thimi. To the north the urban area extends into several municipalities; Nagarjun, Tarakeshwor, Tokha, Budhanilkantha, Gokarneshwor and Kageshwori Manohara. However, the urban agglomeration extends well beyond the neighbouring municipalities, e.g. to Bhaktapur, and nearly covers the entire Kathmandu Valley.


Kathmandu is dissected by eight rivers, the main river of the valley, the Bagmati and its tributaries, of which the Bishnumati, Dhobi Khola, Manohara Khola, Hanumante Khola, and Tukucha Khola are predominant. The mountains from where these rivers originate are in the elevation range of , and have passes which provide access to and from Kathmandu and its valley. An ancient canal once flowed from Nagarjuna hill through Balaju to Kathmandu; this canal is now extinct.

The city of Kathmandu and the surrounding valley are in the &quot;Deciduous Monsoon Forest Zone&quot; (altitude range of ), one of five vegetation zones defined for Nepal. The dominant tree species in this zone are oak, elm, beech, maple and others, with coniferous trees at higher altitude.

=== Kathmandu administration ===

Kathmandu and adjacent cities are composed of neighbourhoods, which are utilized quite extensively and more familiar among locals. However, administratively the city is divided into 32 wards, numbered from 1 to 32. Earlier, there were 35 wards which made it the metropolitan city with the largest number of the wards.

=== Climate ===

Under Köppen&#x27;s climate classification, portions of the city with lower elevations (1300-1400m) which is 88 per cent of total have a humid subtropical climate (Cwa), while portions of the city with higher elevations generally have a subtropical highland climate (Cwb). In the Kathmandu Valley, which is representative of its valley&#x27;s climate, the average summer temperature varies from . The average winter temperature is .
Five major climatic regions are found in Nepal. Of these, High hills of Kathmandu Valley including Chandragiri hill is in the &quot;Warm Temperate Zone&quot; (elevation ranging from ), where the climate is fairly temperate, atypical for the region. This zone is followed by the &quot;Cool Temperate Zone&quot; with elevation varying between .

The city generally has a climate with warm days followed by cool nights and mornings. Unpredictable weather is expected, given that temperatures can drop to or less during the winter. The lowest ever temperature of −3.5 °C was recorded in 1978. While snowfall is generally confined to the hills surrounding the city, there have been a few instances of snowfall in city, most notably in 1945 and 2007.

Rainfall is mostly monsoon-based (about 65% of the total concentrated during the monsoon months of June to September), and decreases substantially () from eastern Nepal to western Nepal. The average annual rainfall for the city is around 1400 mm (55 in). On average humidity is 75%. The chart below is based on data from the Nepal Bureau of Standards &amp; Meteorology, Weather Meteorology for 2005. The chart provides minimum and maximum temperatures during each month. The annual amount of precipitation was for 2005, as per monthly data included in the table above. The decade of 2000–2010 saw highly variable and unprecedented precipitation anomalies in Kathmandu. This was mostly due to the annual variation of the southwest monsoon. For example, 2001 recorded only of precipitation due to an extraordinarily weak monsoon season. In contrast, 2003 was the wettest year ever in Kathmandu, totaling over of precipitation due to an exceptionally strong monsoon season.
===Air quality===

Air pollution is a major issue in the Kathmandu Valley. According to the 2016 World Health Organization&#x27;s Ambient Air Pollution Database, the annual average PM2.5 (particulate matter) concentration in 2013 was 49 μg/m3, which is 4.9 times higher than recommended by the World Health Organization. 

Starting in early 2017, the Government of Nepal and the Embassy of the United States in Kathmandu have monitored and publicly share real-time air quality data. In Nepal and Kathmandu, the annual premature deaths due to air pollution reached 37,399 and 9,943 respectively, according to a Republica news report published on 23 November 2019. This indicates, around a quarter of the total deaths due to air pollution in Nepal are in Kathmandu.

== Government and public services ==
=== Civic administration ===
Kathmandu Municipal Corporation (KMC) is the chief nodal agency for the administration of Kathmandu. The Municipality of Kathmandu was upgraded to a metropolitan city in 1995.

Metropolitan Kathmandu is divided into five sectors: the Central Sector, the East Sector, the North Sector, the City Core and the West Sector. For civic administration, the city is further divided into 32 administrative wards. The Council administers the Metropolitan area of Kathmandu city through its 177 elected representatives and 20 nominated members. It holds biannual meetings to review, process and approve the annual budget and make major policy decisions. The ward&#x27;s profile documents for the 32 wards prepared by the Kathmandu Metropolitan Council is detailed and provides information for each ward on population, the structure and condition of houses, the type of roads, educational, health and financial institutions, entertainment facilities, parking space, security provisions, etc. It also includes lists of development projects completed, on-going and planned, along with informative data about the cultural heritage, festivals, historical sites and the local inhabitants. Ward 16 is the largest, with an area of 437.4 ha; ward 26 is the smallest, with an area of 4 ha.

Kathmandu is the headquarters of the surrounding Kathmandu District.

=== Law and order ===

The Metropolitan Police is the main law enforcement agency in the city. It is headed by a commissioner of police. The Metropolitan Police is a division of the Nepal Police, and the administrative control lies with the Ministry of Home Affairs.
=== Fire service ===

The fire service, known as the &quot;Barun Yantra Karyalaya&quot; (), opened its first station in Kathmandu in 1937 with a single-vehicle. An iron tower was erected to monitor the city and watch for a fire. As a precautionary measure, firemen were sent to the areas which were designated as accident-prone areas. In 1944, the fire service was extended to the neighbouring cities of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur. In 1966, a fire service was established in Kathmandu central airport. In 1975, a West German government donation added seven fire engines to Kathmandu&#x27;s fire service. The fire service in the city is also overlooked by an international non-governmental organization, the Firefighters Volunteer Association of Nepal (FAN), which was established in 2000 with the purpose of raising public awareness about fire and improving safety.

=== Electricity and water supply ===

Electricity in Kathmandu is regulated and distributed by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). Water supply and sanitation facilities are provided by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL). There is a severe shortage of water for household purposes such as drinking, bathing, cooking and washing and irrigation. People have been using bottled mineral water, water from tank trucks and from the ancient dhunge dharas () for all the purposes related to water. The city water shortage should be solved by the completion of the much plagued Melamchi Water Supply Project by the end of 2019. Despite continued efforts by governmental bodies, Kathmandu is one of the most polluted cities in Nepal, largely due to overpopulation.

=== Waste management ===

Waste management may be through composting in municipal waste management units, and at houses with home composting units. Both systems are common and established in India and neighbouring countries.

== Demographics ==

Kathmandu&#x27;s urban cosmopolitan character has made it the most populous city in Nepal. According to the National Population Census of 2011, the total population of Kathmandu city was 975,543 in 254,292 households with an annual growth rate of 6.12% with respect to the population figure of 2001. 70% of the total population residing in Kathmandu are aged between 15 and 59.

In one decade, the population increased from 427,045 in 1991 to 671,805 in 2001. The population was projected to reach 915,071 in 2011 and 1,319,597 by 2021. To keep up this population growth, the KMC-controlled area of expanded to in 2001. With this new area, the population density which was 85 in 1991 remained 85 in 2001; it is likely to jump to 111 in 2011 and 161 in 2021.

=== Languages ===

As of the 2011 census, Nepali is the most common mother tongue in Kathmandu, with 62% of the population speaking it as their mother tongue. Newari is spoken by 19%, and the other languages spoken in the city include Tamang (6%), Maithili (3%), Bhojpuri (2%), Gurung (2%), Magar (2%) and Sherpa (1%) as their first language. English is also spoken by many.

=== Ethnic groups ===

The largest group is the native Newars, whose various sub-groups combine to make up 24.7% of the population. Almost equal in number is the Bahuns, also known as Hill-Brahmin or Khas Brahmin, representing 24.5% of the population. They are part of the broader Khas community, as are the Chhetri, the third largest group, who account for 18% of the population. Other groups in Kathmandu include the Janajatis, comprising the Tamang (7.8%), Magar (3.8%), Gurung (2.6%), and Rai (2.1%). Nepalese Muslims represent 1.8% of the population. More recently, other Madeshi groups from Terai have come to represent a substantial proportion of the city&#x27;s population, and there are around 12,000 Marwadis, mainly merchants.


== Architecture and cityscape ==

The ancient trade route between India and Tibet that passed through Kathmandu enabled a fusion of artistic and architectural traditions from other cultures to be amalgamated with local art and architecture. The monuments of Kathmandu City have been influenced over the centuries by Hindu and Buddhist religious practices. The architectural treasure of the Kathmandu valley has been categorized under the well-known seven groups of heritage monuments and buildings. In 2006 UNESCO declared these seven groups of monuments as a World Heritage Site (WHS). The seven monuments zones cover an area of , with the buffer zone extending to . The Seven Monument Zones inscribed originally in 1979 and with a minor modification in 2006 are the Durbar squares of Hanuman Dhoka, Patan and Bhaktapur, the Hindu temples of Pashupatinath and Changunarayan, the Buddhist stupas of Swayambhunath and Boudhanath.

=== Durbar Squares ===
The literal meaning of Durbar Square is a &quot;place of palaces&quot;. There are three preserved Durbar Squares in Kathmandu valley and one unpreserved in Kirtipur. The Durbar Square of Kathmandu is in the old city and has heritage buildings representing four kingdoms (Kantipur, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur); the earliest being the Licchavi dynasty. The complex has 50 temples and is distributed in two quadrangles of the Durbar Square. The outer quadrangle has the Kasthamandap, Kumari Ghar, and Shiva-Parvati Temple; the inner quadrangle has the Hanuman Dhoka palace. The squares were severely damaged in the April 2015 earthquake.

Hanuman Dhoka is a complex of structures with the royal palace of the Malla kings and of the Shah dynasty. It is spread over five acres. The eastern wing (with ten courtyards) is the oldest part, dating to the mid-16th century. It was expanded by King Pratap Malla in the 17th century with many temples. The royal family lived in this palace until 1886 when they moved to Narayanhiti Palace. The stone inscription outside is in fifteen languages.

Kumari Ghar is a palace in the centre of the Kathmandu city, next to the Durbar square where a royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides. Kumari (or Kumari Devi), is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy (or &quot;devi&quot;) in South Asian countries. In Nepal, the selection process is very rigorous. Previously, during the time of the monarchy, the queen and the priests used to appoint the proposed Kumari with delicate process of astrological examination and physical examination of 32 &#x27;gunas&#x27;. The &quot;china&quot; (), an ancient Hindu astrological report of the Kumari and the reigning king, has been said to be similar. The Kumari is believed to be a bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury also causes her to revert to common status. The current Kumari, Trishna Shakya, age three at the time of appointment, was installed in September 2017 succeeding Matina Shakya who was the first Kumari of Kathmandu after the end of the monarchy.

Kasthamandap is a three-storeyed temple enshrining an image of Gorakhnath. It was built in the 16th century in the pagoda style. The name of Kathmandu is a derivative of the word &quot;Kasthamandap&quot;. It was built under the reign of King Laxmi Narsingha Malla. Kasthamandap stands at the intersection of two ancient trade routes linking India and Tibet at Maru square. It was originally built as a rest house for travellers.

=== Pashupatinath temple ===


The Pashupatinath Temple () is a famous 5th century Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. Located on the banks of the Bagmati River, the Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu. It served as the seat of national deity, Pashupatinath, until Nepal was secularized. However, a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior. The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century, although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old. The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shivaratri, or the night of Shiva, is the most important festival that takes place here, attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus.

Believers in Pashupatinath (mainly Hindus) are allowed to enter the temple premises, but non-Hindu visitors are allowed to view the temple only from the across the Bagmati River. The priests who perform the services at this temple have been Brahmins from Karnataka in southern India since the time of Malla king Yaksha Malla. This tradition is believed to have been started at the request of Adi Shankara who sought to unify the states of Bhāratam, a region in south Asia believed to be ruled by a mythological king Bharata, by encouraging cultural exchange. This procedure is followed in other temples around India, which were sanctified by Adi Shankara.

The temple is built in the pagoda style of architecture, with cubic constructions and carved wooden rafters (tundal) on which they rest, and two-level roofs made of copper and gold.

=== Boudhanath ===
Boudhanath (; also written as &quot;Bouddhanath&quot;, &quot;Bodhnath&quot;, &quot;Baudhanath&quot; or the &quot;Khāsa&quot; &quot;Chaitya&quot;), is one of the holiest Buddhist sites in Nepal, along with the Swayambhunath. It is a very popular tourist site. Boudhanath is known as Khāsti by Newars and as Bauddha or Bodhnāth by speakers of Nepali. About from the centre and northeastern outskirts of Kathmandu, the stupa&#x27;s massive mandala makes it one of the largest spherical stupas in Nepal. Boudhanath became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

The base of the stupa has 108 small depictions of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha. It is surrounded with a brick wall with 147 niches, each with four or five prayer wheels engraved with the mantra, &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot;. At the northern entrance where visitors must pass is a shrine dedicated to Ajima, the goddess of smallpox. Every year the stupa attracts many Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims who perform full body prostrations in the inner lower enclosure, walk around the stupa with prayer wheels, chant, and pray. Thousands of prayer flags are hoisted up from the top of the stupa downwards and dot the perimeter of the complex. The influx of many Tibetan refugees from China has seen the construction of over 50 Tibetan gompas (monasteries) around Boudhanath.
=== Swayambhu ===
Swayambhunath () is a Buddhist stupa atop a hillock at the northwestern part of the city. This is among the oldest religious sites in Nepal. Although the site is considered Buddhist, it is revered by both Buddhists and Hindus. The stupa consists of a dome at the base; above the dome, there is a cubic structure with the eyes of Buddha looking in all four directions. There are pentagonal &quot;toran&quot; above each of the four sides, with statues engraved on them. Behind and above the torana there are thirteen tiers. Above all the tiers, there is a small space above which lies a &quot;gajur&quot;.
=== Rani Pokhari ===

Ranipokhari () is a historic artificial pond nestled in the heart of Kathmandu. It was built by king Pratap Malla in 1670 for his beloved queen after she lost her son and could not recover from her loss. A large stone statue of an elephant in the south signifies the image of Pratap Malla and his two sons. Balgopaleshwor Temple stands still inside the temple above the pond. Rani Pokhari is opened once a year during the final day of Tihar i.e. Bhai Tika and Chhath festival. The world&#x27;s largest Chhath takes place every year in Ranipokhari. The pond is one of Kathmandu&#x27;s most famous landmarks and is known for its religious and aesthetic significance. After sustaining damages from the 2015 earthquake, Ranipokhari went under development, which began in 2019 and the reconstruction was completed in October 2020.

== Culture ==
=== Arts ===
Kathmandu valley the City of Newars is described as &quot;an enormous treasure house of art and sculptures&quot;, which are made of wood, stone, metal, and terracotta, and found in profusion in temples, shrines, stupas, gompas, chaityas and palaces. The art objects are also seen in street corners, lanes, private courtyards, and in open ground. Most art is in the form of icons of gods and goddesses. Kathmandu valley has had this art treasure for a very long time, but received worldwide recognition only after the country opened to the outside world in 1950.

The religious art of Nepal and Kathmandu in particular consists of an iconic symbolism of the Mother Goddesses such as: Bhavani, Durga, Gaja-Lakshmi, Hariti-Sitala, Mahsishamardini, Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses), and Sri-Lakshmi (wealth-goddess). From the 3rd century BCE, apart from the Hindu gods and goddesses, Buddhist monuments from the Ashokan period (it is said that Ashoka visited Nepal in 250 BC) have embellished Nepal in general and the valley in particular. These art and architectural edifices encompass three major periods of evolution: the Licchavi or classical period (500 to 900 AD), the post-classical period (1000 to 1400 AD), with strong influence of the Palla art form; the Malla period (1400 onwards) that exhibited explicitly tantric influences coupled with the art of Tibetan Demonology.

A broad typology has been ascribed to the decorative designs and carvings created by the people of Nepal. These artists have maintained a blend of Hinduism and Buddhism. The typology, based on the type of material used are: stone art, metal art, wood art, terracotta art, and painting.

==== Museums ====
Kathmandu is home to a number of museums and art galleries, including the National Museum of Nepal and the Natural History Museum of Nepal. Nepal&#x27;s art and architecture is an amalgamation of two ancient religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. These are amply reflected in the many temples, shrines, stupas, monasteries, and palaces in the seven well-defined Monument Zones of the Kathmandu valley are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This amalgamation is also reflected in the planning and exhibitions in museums and art galleries throughout Kathmandu and its sister cities of Patan and Bhaktapur. The museums display unique artefacts and paintings from the 5th century CE to the present day, including archaeological exportation.

Museums and art galleries in Kathmandu include:

* The National Museum
* The Natural History Museum
* Hanuman Dhoka Palace Complex
* The Kaiser Library
* The National Art Gallery
* The NEF-ART (Nepal Fine Art) Gallery
* The Nepal Art Council Gallery
* Narayanhiti Palace Museum
* The Taragaon Museum

The National Museum is in the western part of Kathmandu, near the Swayambhunath stupa in a historical building constructed in the early 19th century by General Bhimsen Thapa. It is the most important museum in the country, housing an extensive collection of weapons, art and antiquities of historic and cultural importance. The museum was established in 1928 as a collection house of war trophies and weapons, and the initial name of this museum was &quot;Chhauni Silkhana&quot;, meaning &quot;the stone house of arms and ammunition&quot;. Given its focus, the museum contains many weapons, including locally made firearms used in wars, leather cannons from the 18th–19th century, and medieval and modern works in wood, bronze, stone and paintings.

The Natural History Museum is in the southern foothills of Swayambhunath hill and has a sizeable collection of different species of animals, butterflies, and plants. The museum is noted for its display of species, from prehistoric shells to stuffed animals.

The Tribhuvan Museum contains artifacts related to King Tribhuvan (1906–1955). It has a variety of pieces including his personal belongings, letters, and papers, memorabilia related to events he was involved in and a rare collection of photos and paintings of Royal family members. The Mahendra Museum is dedicated to the King Mahendra (1920–1972). Like the Tribhuvan Museum, it includes his personal belongings such as decorations, stamps, coins and personal notes and manuscripts, but it also has structural reconstructions of his cabinet room and office chamber. The Hanumandhoka Palace, a lavish medieval palace complex in the Durbar, contains three separate museums of historic importance. These museums include the Birendra museum, which contains items related to the second-last monarch, King Birendra.

The enclosed compound of the Narayanhiti Palace Museum is in the north-central part of Kathmandu. &quot;Narayanhiti&quot; () comes from &quot;Narayana&quot; (), a form of the Hindu god Vishnu, and &quot;Hiti&quot; (), meaning &quot;water spout&quot; (the temple of lord Vishnu is opposite to the palace, and the water spout is east of the main entrance to the precinct). The current palace building was built in 1970 in front of the old palace, built in 1915, in the form of a contemporary pagoda. It was built on the occasion of the marriage of the then crown prince and heir apparent to the throne, Birendra. The southern gate of the palace is at the crossing of Prithvipath and Durbar Marg roads. The palace area covers and is fully secured with gates on all sides. This palace was the scene of the Nepali royal massacre. After the fall of the monarchy, it has been converted into a museum.

The Taragaon Museum presents the modern history of the Kathmandu valley. It seeks to document 50 years of research and cultural heritage conservation of the Kathmandu Valley, documenting what artists, photographers, architects, and anthropologists from abroad had contributed in the second half of the 20th century. The actual structure of the museum showcases restoration and rehabilitation efforts to preserve the built heritage of Kathmandu. It was designed by Carl Pruscha (master-planner of the Kathmandu Valley) in 1970 and constructed in 1971. Restoration works began in 2010 to rehabilitate the Taragaon hostel into the Taragaon Museum. The design uses local brick along with modern architectural design elements, as well as the use of circle, triangles and squares. The museum is within a short walk from the Boudhanath stupa, which itself can be seen from the museum tower.

==== Art galleries ====

Kathmandu is a centre for art in Nepal, displaying the work of contemporary artists in the country and also collections of historical artists. Patan in particular is an ancient city noted for its fine arts and crafts. Art in Kathmandu is vibrant, demonstrating a fusion of traditionalism and modern art, derived from a great number of national, Asian, and global influences. Nepali art is commonly divided into two areas: the idealistic traditional painting known as Paubhas in Nepal and perhaps more commonly known as Thangkas in Tibet, closely linked to the country&#x27;s religious history and on the other hand the contemporary western-style painting, including nature-based compositions or abstract artwork based on Tantric elements and social themes of which painters in Nepal are well noted for. Internationally, the British-based charity, the Kathmandu Contemporary Art Centre is involved with promoting arts in Kathmandu.

Kathmandu houses many notable art galleries. The NAFA Gallery, operated by the Arts and crafts Department of the Nepal Academy is housed in Sita Bhavan, a neo-classical old Rana palace.

The Srijana Contemporary Art Gallery, inside the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition grounds, hosts the work of contemporary painters and sculptors, and regularly organizes exhibitions. It also runs morning and evening classes in the schools of art. Also of note is the Moti Azima Gallery, in a three-storied building in Bhimsenthan which contains an impressive collection of traditional utensils and handmade dolls and items typical of a medieval Newar house, giving an important insight into Nepali history. The J Art Gallery near the former royal palace in Durbarmarg displays the artwork of eminent, established Nepali painters. The Nepal Art Council Gallery, in the Babar Mahal, on the way to Tribhuvan International Airport contains artwork of both national and international artists and extensive halls regularly used for art exhibitions.

==== Literature ====

The National Library of Nepal is located in Patan. It is the largest library in the country with more than 70,000 books in English, Nepali, Sanskrit, Hindi, and Nepal Bhasa. The library is in possession of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century. Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library, in the Kaiser Mahal on the ground floor of the Ministry of Education building. This collection of around 45,000 books is derived from a personal collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, and philosophy, as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra, which is believed to be over 1,000 years old. The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building, and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated.
The Asa Archives are also noteworthy. They specialize in medieval history and religious traditions of the Kathmandu valley. The archives, in Kulambhulu, have a collection of some 6,000 loose-leaf handwritten books and 1,000 palm-leaf manuscripts (mostly in Sanskrit or Nepal Bhasa) and a manuscript dated to 1464.

==== Cinema and theatre ====

Kathmandu is home to Nepali cinema and theatres. The city contains several theatres, including the National Dance Theatre in Kanti Path, the Ganga Theatre, the Himalayan Theatre and the Aarohan Theater Group founded in 1982. The M. Art Theater is based in the city. The Gurukul School of Theatre organizes the Kathmandu International Theater Festival, attracting artists from all over the world. A mini theatre has been opened at the Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, established by the Durbar Conservation and Promotion Committee.

Kathmandu has a number of cinemas (old single screen establishments and some new multiplexes) showing Nepali, Bollywood and Hollywood films. Some old establishments include Vishwajyoti Cinema Hall, Jai Nepal Hall, Kumari Cinema Hall, Gopi Krishna Cinema Hall and Guna Cinema Hall. Kathmandu also houses some international standard cinema theatres and multiplexes, such as QFX Cinemas, Cine De Chef, Fcube Cinemas, Q&#x27;s Cinemas, Big Movies, BSR Movies and many more.

In October 2023, Kathmandu was named a UNESCO City of Film and joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.

==== Music ====
Kathmandu is the center of music and dance in Nepal, and these art forms are integral to understanding the city. Musical performances are organized in cultural venues. Music is a part of the traditional aspect of Kathmandu. Gunla is the traditional music festival according to Nepal Sambat. Newar music originated in Kathmandu. Furthermore, music from all over Nepal can be found in Kathmandu.

A number of hippies visited Kathmandu during the 1970s and introduced rock music and jazz to the city. Kathmandu is noted internationally for its jazz festival, popularly known as Jazzmandu. It is the only jazz festival in the Himalayan region and was established in March 2002. The festival attracts musicians from countries worldwide, such as Australia, Denmark, United States, Benin, and India.

The city has been referenced in numerous songs, including works by Cat Stevens (&#x27;Katmandu&#x27;, &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; (1970), Bob Seger (&#x27;Katmandu&#x27;, &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot; (1975)), Rush (&#x27;A Passage to Bangkok&#x27;, &quot;Pulling into Kathmandu&quot;; &quot;2112&quot;, 1976), John Lennon (&#x27;Nobody Told Me&#x27; (1984, posthumously)), Krematorij (&#x27;Kathmandu&#x27;, &quot;Three Springs&quot; (2000)), Fito Páez (&quot;Tráfico por Katmandú&quot; – &quot;Traffic through Kathmandu&quot;) and Cavalcade (&#x27;Kathmandu Kid&#x27;) 2019.

=== Cuisine ===
The staple food of most people in Kathmandu is dal bhat. This consists of rice and lentil soup, generally served with vegetable curries, achar and sometimes chutney. Momo, a type of Nepali version of Tibetan dumpling, has become prominent in Nepal with many street vendors and restaurants selling it. It is one of the most popular fast foods in Kathmandu. Various Nepali variants of momo including buff (i.e. buffalo) dumplings, chicken dumplings, and vegetarian momo are famous in Kathmandu.

Most of the cuisines found in Kathmandu are non-vegetarian. However, the practice of vegetarianism is not uncommon, and vegetarian cuisines can be found throughout the city. Consumption of beef is very uncommon and considered taboo in many places. &quot;Buff&quot; (meat of water buffalo) is very common. There is a strong tradition of &quot;buff&quot; consumption in Kathmandu, especially among Newars, which is not found in other parts of Nepal. Consumption of pork was considered taboo until a few decades ago. Due to the intermixing with Kirat cuisine from eastern Nepal, pork has found a place in Kathmandu dishes. A fringe population of devout Hindus and Muslims consider it taboo. The Muslims forbid eating &quot;buff&quot; as from Quran while Hindus eat all varieties except beef as they consider cow to be a goddess and symbol of purity. The chief lunch/snack for locals and visitors is mostly &quot;Momo&quot; or &quot;Chowmein&quot;.

Kathmandu had only one western-style restaurant in 1955. A large number of restaurants in Kathmandu have since opened, catering Nepali cuisine, Tibetan cuisine, Chinese cuisine and Indian cuisine in particular. Many other restaurants have opened to accommodate locals, expatriates, and tourists. The growth of tourism in Kathmandu has led to culinary creativity and the development of hybrid foods to accommodate for tourists such as American chop suey, which is a sweet-and-sour sauce with crispy noodles with a fried egg commonly added on top and other westernized adaptations of traditional cuisine. Continental cuisine can be found in selected places.

Kathmandu has a larger proportion of tea drinkers than coffee drinkers. Tea, locally known as Chiya, is widely served. It is richer and contains tea leaves boiled with milk, sugar, and spices. Tea shops that specially serve tea with other snacks are widely available. Alcohol is widely drunk, and there are numerous local variants of alcoholic beverages. Drinking and driving is illegal, and authorities have a zero-tolerance policy. Ailaa and thwon (alcohol made from rice) are the alcoholic beverages of Kathmandu, found in all the local bhattis (alcohol serving eateries). Chhyaang, tongba (fermented millet or barley) and raksi are alcoholic beverages from other parts of Nepal which are found in Kathmandu. However, shops and bars in Kathmandu widely sell western and Nepali beers.

=== Festivals ===


Most of the fairs and festivals in Kathmandu originated in the Malla period or earlier. Traditionally, these festivals were celebrated by Newars. In recent years, these festivals have found wider participation from other Kathmanduites as well. As the capital of the Nepal, various national festivals are celebrated in Kathmandu. With mass migration to the city, the cultures of Khas from the west, Kirats from the east, Bon/Tibetan from the north, and Mithila from the south meet in the capital and mingle harmoniously. The festivities such as the Ghode (horse) Jatra, Indra Jatra, Dashain Durga Puja festivals, Shivratri and many more are observed by all Hindu and Buddhist communities of Kathmandu with devotional fervor and enthusiasm. Social regulation in the codes enacted incorporates Hindu traditions and ethics. These were followed by the Shah kings and previous kings, as devout Hindus and protectors of the Buddhist religion.
The cultural continuity has been maintained for centuries in the exclusive worship of goddesses and deities in Kathmandu and the rest of the country. These deities include the Ajima, Taleju (or Tulja Bhavani or Taleju Bhawani) and her other form : Digu Taleju (or Degu Taleju) and Kumari (the living goddess). The artistic edifices have now become places of worship in the everyday life of the people, therefore a roster is maintained to observe annual festivals. There are 133 festivals held in the year.

Some of the traditional festivals observed in Kathmandu, apart from those previously mentioned, are Bada Dashain, Tihar, Chhath, Maghe Sankranti, Nag Panchami, Janai Purnima, Pancha Dan, Teej/Rishi Panchami, Pahan Charhe, Jana Baha Dyah Jatra (White Machchhendranath Jatra), and Matatirtha Aunsi.

==Religions==

=== Hinduism ===
Hinduism is one of the indigenous beliefs of the city. Assumedly, together with the kingdom of Licchhavi (c. 400 to 750), Hinduism and the endogam social stratification of the caste was established in Kathmandu Valley. The Pashupatinath Temple, Changu Narayan Temple, and the Kasthamandap are of particular importance to Hindus. Other notable Hindu temples in Kathmandu and the surrounding valley include Bajrayogini Temple, Dakshinkali Temple, Guhyeshwari Temple, and the Shobha Bhagawati shrine.

The Bagmati River which flows through Kathmandu is considered a holy river both by Hindus and Buddhists, and many Hindu temples are on the banks of this river. The importance of the Bagmati also lies in the fact that Hindus are cremated on its banks, and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. According to the Nepali Hindu tradition, the dead body must be dipped three times into the Bagmati before cremation. The chief mourner (usually the first son) who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy riverwater bath immediately after cremation. Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take bath in the Bagmati or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the end of cremation as the Bagmati is believed to purify people spiritually.
=== Buddhism ===
Buddhism was brought into Kathmandu with the arrival of Buddhist monks during the time of Buddha (c. 563 – 483 BCE). They established a forest monastery in Sankhu. This monastery was renovated by Shakyas after they fled genocide from Virudhaka (r. 491–461 BCE).

During the Hindu Lichchavi era (c. 400 to 750), various monasteries and orders were created which successively led to the formation of Newar Buddhism, which is still practiced in the primary liturgical language of Hinduism, Sanskrit.

Legendary Princess Bhrikuti (7th-century) and artist Araniko (1245–1306 CE) from that tradition of Kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading Buddhism in Tibet and China. There are over 108 traditional monasteries (Bahals and Baháʼís) in Kathmandu based on Newar Buddhism. Since the 1960s, the permanent Tibetan Buddhist population of Kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty Tibetan Buddhist monasteries in the area. Also, with the modernization of Newar Buddhism, various Theravada Bihars have been established.

=== Kirat Mundhum ===
Kirant Mundhum is one of the indigenous animistic practices of Nepal. It is practiced by the Kirat people. Some animistic aspects of Kirant beliefs, such as ancestor worship (worship of Ajima) are also found in Newars of Kirant origin. Ancient religious sites believed to be worshipped by ancient Kirats, such as Pashupatinath, Wanga Akash Bhairabh (Yalambar) and Ajima are now worshipped by people of all Dharmic religions in Kathmandu. Kirats who have migrated from other parts of Nepal to Kathmandu practice Mundhum in the city.

=== Other religions ===
Sikhism is practiced primarily in Gurudwara at Kupundole. An earlier temple of Sikhism is also present in Kathmandu which is now defunct.

Jainism is practiced by a small community. A Jain temple is present in Gyaneshwar, where Jains practice their faith.

According to the records of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of Nepal, there are approximately 300 followers of the Baháʼí Faith in Kathmandu valley. They have a national office in Shantinagar, Baneshwor. The Baháʼís also have classes for children at the National Centre and other localities in Kathmandu.

In Kathmandu alone there are about 170 Christian churches. Christian missionary hospitals, welfare organizations, and schools are also operating. Nepali citizens who served as soldiers in Indian and British armies, who had converted to Christianity while in service, on return to Nepal continue to practice their religion. They have contributed to the spread of Christianity and the building of churches in Nepal and in Kathmandu, in particular.

== Education ==
The oldest modern school in Nepal, the Durbar High School, and the oldest college, the Tri-Chandra College, are both in Kathmandu. The largest (according to number of students and colleges), the oldest and most distinguished university in Nepal, the Tribhuvan University, is located in Kirtipur.

Other major institutions include Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Kathmandu Medical College, Nepal Medical College, KIST Medical College, Nepal Army Institute of Health Sciences, National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS) and Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences (KUSMS), are also in or around Kathmandu.

== Economy ==
The location and terrain of Kathmandu have played a significant role in the development of a stable economy which spans millennia. The city is in an ancient lake basin, with fertile soil and flat terrain. This geography helped form a society based on agriculture. This, combined with its location between India and China, helped establish Kathmandu as an important trading centre over the centuries. Kathmandu&#x27;s trade is an ancient profession that flourished along an offshoot of the Silk Road which linked India and Tibet. From centuries past, Lhasa Newar merchants of Kathmandu have conducted trade across the Himalaya and contributed to spreading art styles and Buddhism across Central Asia. Other traditional occupations are farming, metal casting, woodcarving, painting, weaving, and pottery.

Kathmandu is the most important industrial and commercial centre in Nepal. The Nepal Stock Exchange, the head office of the national bank, the chamber of commerce, as well as head offices of national and international banks, telecommunication companies, the electricity authority, and various other national and international organizations are in Kathmandu. The major economic hubs are the New Road, Durbar Marg, Ason and Putalisadak.

The economic output of the metropolitan area of around Rs. 550 billion approximately per year alone is worth more than one third of national GDP (nominal), while the per capita income of $2200 is approximately three times the national average. Kathmandu exports handicrafts, artworks, garments, carpets, pashmina, paper; trade accounts for 21% of its revenues. Manufacturing is also important and accounts for 19% of the revenue that Kathmandu generates. Garments and woolen carpets are the most notable manufactured products. Other economic sectors in Kathmandu include agriculture (9%), education (6%), transport (6%), and hotels and restaurants (5%). Kathmandu is famous for lokta paper and pashmina shawls.

=== Tourism ===
Tourism in Nepal is considered an important industry. In 1956, air transportation was established and the construction of Tribhuvan Highway, between Kathmandu and Raxaul, was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote the tourism industry, including the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism, and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, the training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the significant growth of this industry in Nepal and in Kathmandu in particular.

Tourism is a major source of income for most of the people in the city, with several hundred thousand visitors annually. Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims from all over the world visit Kathmandu&#x27;s religious sites such as Pashupatinath Temple, Swayambhunath, Boudhanath, Changu Narayan Temple, and Budhanilkantha Temple. From a mere 6,179 tourists in 1961/62, the number increased to 491,504 in 1999/2000. In economic terms, the foreign exchange registered 3.8 percent of the GDP in 1995/96 but then started declining. Following the end of Nepalese Civil War, there was a significant rise in the number of tourist arrivals, with 509,956 tourists recorded in 2009. Since then, tourism has improved as the country transitioned into a republic. The high level of tourism is attributed to the natural grandeur of the Himalayas and the cultural heritage of the country which is continuously preserved and restored at great cost.
The neighbourhood of Thamel is Kathmandu&#x27;s primary go-to place for tourists and is widely regarded as the center of Kathmandu&#x27;s nightlife, packed with guest houses, restaurants, shops, and bookstores, catering to tourists. Another neighbourhood of growing popularity is Jhamel, a name for Jhamsikhel that was coined to rhyme with Thamel. Jhochhen Tol, also known as &quot;Freak Street&quot; remains a traveler haunt. This original meeting place for international guests in Kathmandu became known in the 1960s and 1970s through folklore told by hippies in Europe and North America.
With the opening of the tourist industry after the change in the political scenario of Nepal in 1950, the hotel industry drastically improved. Now Kathmandu boasts several luxury hotels with some including casinos. Ason is a bazaar and ceremonial square on the old trade route to Tibet.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
The total length of roads in Nepal is recorded to be , as of 2003–04.

<text>Kington Magna is a village and civil parish in the Blackmore Vale area of Dorset, England, about southwest of Gillingham.

==History==
The name Kington Magna means &#x27;great King&#x27;s Town&#x27;; it derives from &quot;cyne-&quot; (later &quot;cyning&quot;) and &quot;tūn&quot;, Old English for &#x27;royal estate or manor&#x27;. The affix &quot;magna&quot;, Latin for great, was added to distinguish it from Little Kington, a smaller settlement nearby. In 1086 in the Domesday Book these were recorded together in three entries as &quot;Chintone&quot;, which had 27 households and a total taxable value of 13 geld units, and was in the hundred of Gillingham. In 1243 it was recorded as Magna Kington. Most of the current buildings in the village are no older than the seventeenth century. In 1851 a Primitive Methodist chapel was built in the village; it was on Chapel Hill, which runs parallel to Church Hill. In 1860 a pottery was established at Bye Farm, north of the main village; it manufactured tiles, drainpipes, bricks, and chimney and flower pots. The parish church of All Saints was restored and enlarged in 1862; most of the building, except for the late 15th-century west tower, was rebuilt. Near the church is a pond which was a medieval fishpond.

==Geography==
The parish covers about and, as well as the main village, includes the small settlement of Nyland in the west. The main village is sited on the slopes of a Corallian limestone hill, overlooking the flat Oxford Clay valley of the small River Cale, which drains into the Stour. In 1906 Sir Frederick Treves wrote in his &quot;Highways &amp; Byways in Dorset&quot; that the village &quot;straggles down hill like a small mountain stream.&quot;

==Demography==
In the 2011 census the parish had 180 dwellings, 169 households and a population of 389.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is in Gillingham. Trains run on the Exeter to Waterloo line.

<text>Historically, a kiosk () was a small garden pavilion open on some or all sides common in Persia, the Indian subcontinent, and in the Ottoman Empire from the 13th century onward. Today, several examples of this type of kiosk still exist in and around the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, and they can be seen in Balkan countries.

The word is used in English-speaking countries for small booths offering goods and services. In Australia they usually offer food service. Freestanding computer terminals dispensing information are called interactive kiosks.

==Etymology==
Etymological data points to the Middle Persian word &quot;kōšk&quot; &#x27;palace, portico&#x27; as the origin, via Turkish &quot;köşk&quot; &#x27;pavilion&#x27; and French &quot;kiosque&quot; or Italian &quot;chiosco&quot;.

==History and origins==
A kiosk is an open summer-house or pavilion usually having its roof supported by pillars with screened or totally open walls. As a building type, it was first introduced by the Sasanid and the next used as a small building attached to the main mosque from Seljuks, which consisted of a domed hall with open arched sides. This architectural concept gradually evolved into a small yet grand residence used by Ottoman sultans, the most famous examples of which are quite possibly the Tiled Kiosk (&quot;Çinili Köşk&quot; in Turkish) and Baghdad Kiosk (&quot;Bağdat Köşkü&quot; in Turkish). The former was built in 1473 by Mehmed II (&quot;the Conqueror&quot;) at the Topkapı Palace, Istanbul, and consists of a two storey building topped with a dome and having open sides overlooking the gardens of the palace. The Baghdad Koshk was also built at the Topkapı Palace in 1638–39, by Sultan Murad IV. The building is again domed, offering direct views onto the gardens and park of the Palace as well as the architecture of the city of Istanbul.
Sultan Ahmed III (1703–1730) also built a glass room of the Sofa Kiosk at the Topkapı Palace incorporating some Western elements, such as the gilded brazier designed by Duplessis père, which was given to the Ottoman ambassador by King Louis XV of France.

The first English contact with Turkish Kiosk came through Lady Wortley Montagu (1689–1762), the wife of the English ambassador to Istanbul, who in a letter written on 1 April 1717 to Anne Thistlethwayte, mentions a &quot;chiosk&quot; describing it as &quot;raised by 9 or 10 steps and enclosed with gilded lattices&quot;.
European monarchs adopted the building type. Stanisław Leszczyński, king of Poland and father-in-law of Louis XV, built kiosks for himself based on his memories of his captivity in Turkey. These kiosks were used as garden pavilions serving coffee and beverages but later were converted into band stands and tourist information stands decorating most European gardens, parks and high streets.

Conservatories were in the form of corridors connecting the Pavilion to the stables and consisting of a passage of flowers covered with glass and linked with orangery, a greenhouse, an aviary, a pheasantry and hothouses. The influence of Muslim and Islamo-Indian forms appears clearly in these buildings and particularly in the pheasantry where its higher part is an adaptation of the kiosks found on the roof of Allahabad Palace, as illustrated by Thomas Daniell. Today&#x27;s conservatories incorporate many elements of Islamic architecture, although modern art forms have shifted from the classical art forms that were used in earlier times.

==Small shops and cafés==

In the Western hemisphere and in English-speaking countries, a &quot;kiosk&quot; is also a booth with an open window on one side. Some vendors operate from kiosks (see mall kiosk), selling small, inexpensive consumables such as newspapers, magazines, lighters, street maps, cigarettes, live and frozen fishing bait and confections.

In Australia, the word is commonly used for small buildings that are used to dispense mainly take-away food and drinks, on beaches, in shopping arcades or in parks. Since the 21st century, many of these have been upgraded and serve fancier food and barista-made coffee.

An information kiosk (or information booth) dispenses free information in the form of maps, pamphlets, and other literature, and/or advice offered by an attendant.

==Interactive kiosks==

An electronic kiosk (or computer kiosk or interactive kiosk) houses a computer terminal that often employs custom kiosk software designed to function while preventing users from accessing system functions. Indeed, &quot;kiosk mode&quot; describes such a mode of software operation. Computerized kiosks may store data locally, or retrieve it from a computer network. Some computer kiosks provide a free, informational public service, while others serve a commercial purpose (see mall kiosk). Touchscreens, trackballs, computer keyboards, and pushbuttons are all typical input devices for interactive computer kiosk. Touchscreen kiosks are commercially used as industrial appliances, reducing lines, eliminating paper, improving efficiency and service. Their uses are unlimited from refrigerators to airports, health clubs, movie theaters and libraries.

<text>The Knowbot Information Service (KIS), also known as netaddress, is an Internet user search engine that debuted in December 1989. Although it searched users, not content, it could be argued to be the first search engine on the Internet as it queried more than a single network for information. It provided a uniform user interface to a variety of remote directory services such as whois, finger, X.500, and MCI Mail. By submitting a single query to KIS, a user can search a set of remote white pages services and see the results of the search in a uniform format. There are several interfaces to the KIS service including e-mail and telnet. Another KIS interface imitates the Berkeley whois command.

KIS consists of two distinct types of modules that interact with each other (typically across a network) to provide the service. One module is a user agent module that runs on the KIS mail host machine. The second module is a remote server module (possibly on a different machine) that interrogates various database services across the network and provides the results to the user agent module in a uniform fashion. Interactions between the two modules can be via messages between knowbots or by actual movement of knowbots.

<doc id="17176" wikidata="Q131560" url="?curid=17176" title="KISS principle">
<text>KISS, an acronym for &quot;Keep it simple, stupid!&quot;, is a design principle first noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. First seen partly in American English by at least 1938, KISS implies that simplicity should be a design goal. The phrase has been associated with aircraft engineer Kelly Johnson. The term &quot;KISS principle&quot; was in popular use by 1970. Variations on the phrase (usually as some euphemism for the more churlish &quot;stupid&quot;) include &quot;keep it super simple&quot;, &quot;keep it simple, silly&quot;, &quot;keep it short and simple&quot;, &quot;keep it short and sweet&quot;, &quot;keep it simple and straightforward&quot;, &quot;keep it small and simple&quot;, &quot;keep it simple, soldier&quot;, &quot;keep it simple, sailor&quot;, &quot;keep it simple, sweetie&quot;, &quot;keep it stupidly simple&quot;, or &quot;keep it sweet and simple&quot;.

==Origin==
The acronym was reportedly coined by Kelly Johnson, lead engineer at the Lockheed Skunk Works (creators of the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, among many others). However, the variant &quot;Keep it Short and Simple&quot; is attested from a 1938 issue of the &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot;.

While popular usage has transcribed it for decades as &quot;Keep it simple, stupid&quot;, Johnson transcribed it simply as &quot;Keep it simple stupid&quot; (no comma), and this reading is still used by many authors.

The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with only these tools. Hence, the &quot;stupid&quot; refers to the relationship between the way things break and the sophistication available to repair them.

The acronym has been used by many in the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Navy and United States Air Force, and in the field of software development.

==Variants==
The principle most probably finds its origins in similar minimalist concepts, such as:
* Occam&#x27;s razor;
* &quot;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication&quot;;
* Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Brevity is the soul of wit&quot;;
* Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s &quot;Less is more&quot;;
* Bjarne Stroustrup&#x27;s &quot;Make Simple Tasks Simple!&quot;;
* Dr. Seuss&#x27;s ode to brevity: &quot;So the writer who breeds more words than he needs, is making a chore for the reader who reads&quot;;
* Johan Cruyff&#x27;s &quot;Playing football is very simple but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is&quot;;
* Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away&quot;;
* Colin Chapman, the founder of Lotus Cars, urged his designers to &quot;Simplify, then add lightness&quot;;
* Attributed to Albert Einstein, although this may be an editor&#x27;s paraphrase of a lecture he gave, &quot;Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;;
* Steve Jobs&#x27;s &quot;Simplify, Simplify, Simplify&quot;, which simplified Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s quote &quot;Simplify, simplify, simplify&quot; for emphasis;
* Northcote Parkinson, British academic and sometimes military officer and military critic, expressed this idea as &quot;Parkinson&#x27;s Third Law&quot; (): &quot;Expansion means complexity and complexity, decay; or to put it even more plainly—the more complex, the sooner dead&quot;;

Heath Robinson contraptions and Rube Goldberg&#x27;s machines, intentionally overly-complex solutions to simple tasks or problems, are humorous examples of &quot;non-KISS&quot; solutions.

==Usage==

===In film animation===
Master animator Richard Williams explains the KISS principle in his book &quot;The Animator&#x27;s Survival Kit&quot;, and Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men write about it in &quot;Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life&quot;, a considerable work of the genre. The problem faced is that inexperienced animators may &quot;over-animate&quot; in their works, that is, a character may move too much and do too much. Williams urges animators to &quot;KISS&quot;.

===In software development===
* Don&#x27;t repeat yourself (DRY)
* Minimalism
* Unix philosophy
* Arch Linux
* Slackware Linux
* Chartjunk
* List of software development philosophies
* Reduced instruction set computing
* Rule of least power
* There&#x27;s more than one way to do it
* Worse is better (Less is more)
* You aren&#x27;t gonna need it (YAGNI)

===In politics===
* Keep It Simple Solutions, New Brunswick, a minor political party in New Brunswick, Canada
* Keep It Straight and Simple Party, a minor political party in South Africa

===In popular culture===
In the Filipino neo-noir film &quot;Segurista&quot;, KISS is invoked by Mrs Librada (played by Liza Lorena) as an approach to selling insurance.

In the American version of &quot;The Office&quot;, Michael Scott&#x27;s advice to Dwight Schrute before making any decision is KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid).

<text>The Klamath people are a Native American tribe of the Plateau culture area in Southern Oregon and Northern California. Today Klamath people are enrolled in the federally recognized tribes:

* Klamath Tribes (Klamath, Modoc, and Yahooskin (Yahuskin) Band of Northern Paiute Indians), Oregon
* Quartz Valley Indian Community (Klamath, Karuk (Karok), and Shasta (Chasta) people), California.

==History==
===Pre-contact===
The Klamath people lived in the area around the Upper Klamath Lake (E-ukshi - “Lake”) and the Klamath, Williamson (Kóke - “River”), Wood River (E-ukalksini Kóke), and Sprague (Plaikni Kóke - “River Uphill”) rivers. They subsisted primarily on fish and gathered roots and seeds. While there was knowledge of their immediate neighbors, apparently the Klamath were unaware of the existence of the Pacific Ocean. Gatschet has described this position as leaving the Klamath living in a &quot;protracted isolation&quot; from outside cultures.

North of their tribal territory lived the Molala (&quot;Kuikni maklaks&quot;), in the northeast and east in the desert-like plains were various Northern Paiute bands (&quot;Shá&#x27;ttumi&quot;, collective term for Northern Paiute, Bannock and Northern Shoshone) - among them the &quot;Goyatöka Band&quot; (&quot;Crayfish Eaters&quot;), direct south their Modoc kin (&quot;Mo&#x27;dokni maklaks&quot; - &quot;Southern People, i.e. Tule Lake People&quot;) with whom they shared the Modoc Plateau, in the southwest were living Shasta peoples (&quot;S[h]asti maklaks&quot;) and the Klamath River further downstream the Karuk and Yurok (both: &quot;Skatchpalikni&quot; - &quot;People along the Scott River&quot;), in the west and northwest were the Latgawa (&quot;Upland Takelma&quot;) (according to Spier: &quot;Walumskni&quot; - &quot;Enemy&quot;) and Takelma/Dagelma (&quot;Lowland/River Takelma&quot;) (more likely both were called: &quot;Wálamsknitumi, Wálamskni maklaks&quot; - “Rogue River People”). Beyond the Cascade Range (&quot;Yámakisham Yaina&quot; - “mountains of the Northerners”) in the Rogue River Valley (&quot;Wálamsh&quot;) lived the &quot;Rogue &quot;River&quot; Athabascan (&quot;Wálamsknitumi, Wálamskni maklaks&quot; - “Rogue River People”) and further south along the Pit River (&quot;Moatuashamkshini/Móatni Kóke&quot; - &quot;River of the Southern Dwellers&quot;) lived the Achomawi and Atsugewi (both called: &quot;Móatuash maklaks&quot; - &quot;Southern Dweller&quot;, or &quot;Southern People&quot;).

The Klamath were known to raid neighboring tribes, such as the Achomawi on the Pit River, and occasionally to take prisoners as slaves. They traded with the Wasco-Wishram at The Dalles. However, scholars such as Alfred L. Kroeber and Leslie Spier consider these slaving raids by the Klamath to begin only with the acquisition of the horse.

These natives made southern Oregon their home for long enough to witness the eruption of Mount Mazama. It was a legendary volcanic mountain who is the creator of Crater Lake (&quot;giˑw&quot;), now considered to be a beautiful natural formation.

===Contact===
In 1826, Peter Skene Ogden, an explorer for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, first encountered the Klamath people, and he was trading with them by 1829. The United States frontiersman Kit Carson admired their arrows, which were reported to be able to shoot through a house.

===Treaty with the United States===
The Klamaths, Modocs, and the Yahooskin (Yahuskin) Band of Northern Paiute (in Paiute known as: Goyatöka - &quot;Crayfish eaters&quot;), which was erroneously called &quot;Upper Sprague River Snakes&quot; believed to be a Band of &quot;Snake Indians&quot;, the collective name given to the Northern Paiute, Bannock, and Shoshone Native American tribes, signed a treaty with the United States in 1864, establishing the Klamath Reservation to the northeast of Upper Klamath Lake. This area was largely part of the traditional territory controlled by the ă′ukuckni Klamath band. The treaty required the tribes to cede the land in the Klamath Basin, bounded on the north by the 44th parallel, to the United States. In return, the United States was to make a lump sum payment of $35,000, and annual payments totalling $80,000 over 15 years, as well as providing infrastructure and staff for the reservation. The treaty provided that, if the Indians drank or stored intoxicating liquor on the reservation, the payments could be withheld; the United States could also locate additional tribes on the reservation in the future. The tribes requested Lindsay Applegate as the agent to represent the United States to them. The Indian agent estimated the total population of the three tribes at about 2,000 when the treaty was signed.

===Post-treaty history===
Since termination of recognition of their tribal sovereignty in 1954 (with federal payments not disbursed until 1961), the Klamath and neighboring tribes have reorganized their government and revived tribal identity. The Klamath, along with the Modoc and Yahooskin, have formed the federally recognized Klamath Tribes confederation. Their tribal government is based in Chiloquin, Oregon.

Some Klamath live on the Quartz Valley Indian Community in Siskiyou County, California.

==Culture==

===Subdivisions===
Traditionally there were several cultural subdivisions among the Klamath, based on the location of their residency within the Klamath Basin. Despite this, the five recognized &quot;tribelets&quot; (the Klamath Tribes count six) mutually considered each other the same ethnic group, about 1,200 people in total. Like many Indigenous cultures of the Pacific Northwest, the Klamath lived a semi-sedentary life. Winter settlements were in permanent locations that were reoccupied annually. Construction of the earth-lodges would begin in Autumn, with materials salvaged from abandoned, dilapidated buildings made in previous years. Leslie Spier has detailed some of the winter settlement patterns for Klamath as follows:

The towns are not isolated, compact groups of houses, but stretch along the banks for half a mile or more. In fact, the settlements on Williamson river below the Sprague river junction form a practically continuous string of houses for five or six miles, the house pits being, in many spots, crowded close together. Informants insisted that many of these were occupied at the same time. When we consider that these earth-lodges may have housed several families, there is strong suggestion of a considerable population.

* Ǎ’ukckni („Klamath Marsh People“ or „Klamath Marsh-Williamson River People“)
* P&#x27;laikni (“Sprague River Valley People” or “Upland Klamath”, lit. “highland dwellers”)
* Kowa’cdikni („Agency Lake/Marsh Lake People“) 
* Du’kwakni („[Lower] Williamson River People“) 
* Gu’mbǒtkni („Pelican Bay People“) 
* Iu’laloηkni („Klamath Falls (Link River) People“)

===Marriage===
Marriage was a unique practice for the Klamath, compared to neighboring cultures found in the borderlands of modern Oregon, California, Nevada and Idaho. For example, unlike the Hupa, Karok, and Yurok, the Klamath didn&#x27;t hold formal talks between families for a bride price. Especially notable was the cultural norm that allowed wives to leave husbands, as they were &quot;in no sense chattel ... and certainly cannot be disposed of as a possession.&quot;

===Ethnobotany===
The Klamath use Apocynum cannabinum as a fiber and eat the roots of Lomatium canbyi. They use the rootstocks of Sagittaria cuneata as food. They use Carex, weaving the leaves into mats, using the juice of the pith as a beverage, eating the fresh stems for food and using the tuberous base of the stem for food.

===Dentalium===
Dentalium shells were common among the Klamath prior to colonization. Compared to other native cultures, dentalium didn&#x27;t hold as much financial use among the Klamath. However, longer shells were generally held to be more valuable. Nonetheless, these shells were esteemed primarily for as jewelry and personal adornment. Septum piercings were commonly given to younger members of Klamath families to allow inserting dentalium. Some individuals wouldn&#x27;t however use any shells in their septum. Spier gives the following account for their usage:

The septum of the nose is pierced and the ear lobes, the latter twice or even more frequently. Both sexes insert dentalium shells horizontally through the septum ... Ear pendants are a group of four dentalia hung in a bunch by their tips.

The use of dentalium in septum piercings, in addition to other means of ornamentation, was common among the Wasco-Wishram as well.

==Classifications==
The Klamath people are grouped with the Plateau Indians—the peoples who originally lived on the Columbia River Plateau. They were most closely linked with the Modoc people.

==Language==
The Klamath spoke one dialect of the Klamath–Modoc language - the northern or &quot;fi-ukshikni&quot; dialect, the other - the &quot;southern&quot; dialect being spoken by the Modoc people, who lived south of the Klamath. Once thought to be a language isolate, Klamath–Modoc is now considered a member of the Plateau Penutian language family.

Both the Klamath and the Modoc called themselves &quot;maqlaqs&quot;, &quot;maqlags&quot; or &quot;Maklaks&quot; meaning &quot;people&quot;. When they wanted to distinguish between themselves they added &quot;knii&quot; (&quot;people from/of&quot;), the Klamath were called &quot;?ewksiknii&quot;, &quot;people of the [Klamath] Lake&quot;, and the Modoc were called &quot;moowatdal&#x27;knii&quot;, &quot;people of the south&quot;.

<text>The Klerer–May System is a programming language developed in the mid-1960s, oriented to numerical scientific programming, whose most notable feature is its two-dimensional syntax based on traditional mathematical notation.

For input and output, the Klerer–May system used a Friden Flexowriter modified to allow half-line motions for subscripts and superscripts. The character set included digits, upper-case letters, subsets of 14 lower-case Latin letters and 18 Greek letters, arithmetic operators (codice_1 codice_2 codice_3 codice_4 codice_5) and punctuation (codice_6 codice_7 codice_8 codice_9), and eight special line-drawing characters (resembling codice_10 codice_11 codice_12 codice_13 codice_14 codice_15 codice_16 codice_17) used to construct multi-line brackets and symbols for summation, products, roots, and for multi-line division or fractions.
The system was intended to be forgiving of input mistakes, and easy to learn; its reference manual was only two pages.

The system was developed by Melvin Klerer and Jack May at Columbia University&#x27;s Hudson Laboratories in Dobbs Ferry, New York, for the Office of Naval Research, and ran on GE-200 series computers.

<text>KL-ONE (pronounced &quot;kay ell won&quot;) is a knowledge representation system in the tradition of semantic networks and frames; that is, it is a frame language. The system is an attempt to overcome semantic indistinctness in semantic network representations and to explicitly represent conceptual information as a structured inheritance network.

==Overview==
There is a whole family of KL-ONE-like systems. One of the innovations that KL-ONE initiated was the use of a deductive classifier, an automated reasoning engine that can validate a frame ontology and deduce new information about the ontology based on the initial information provided by a domain expert. 

Frames in KL-ONE are called concepts. These form hierarchies using subsume-relations; in the KL-ONE terminology a super class is said to subsume its subclasses. 
Multiple inheritance is allowed. Actually a concept is said to be well-formed only if it inherits from more than one other concept. All concepts, except the top concept (usually THING), must have at least one super class. 

In KL-ONE descriptions are separated into two basic classes of concepts: primitive and defined. Primitives are domain concepts that are not fully defined. This means that given all the properties of a concept, this is not sufficient to classify it. They may also be viewed as incomplete definitions. Using the same view, defined concepts are complete definitions. Given the properties of a concept, these are necessary and sufficient conditions to classify the concept.

The slot-concept is called roles and the values of the roles are role-fillers. There are several different types of roles to be used in different situations. The most common and important role type is the generic RoleSet that captures the fact that the role may be filled with more than one filler.

<text>Kipchoge Hezekiah Keino (born 17 January 1940) is a retired Kenyan track and field athlete. He was the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee (KOC) until 29 September 2017. A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Keino was among the first in a long line of successful middle and long distance runners to come from the country and has helped and inspired many of his countrymen and women to become the athletics force that they are today. In 2000, he became an honorary member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In 2012, he was one of 24 athletes inducted as inaugural members of the IAAF Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Keino was born in Kipsamo, Nandi District, Kenya. His name, &quot;Kipchoge&quot;, is a Nandi language expression for &quot;born near the grain storage shed&quot;. His parents died when he was a youngster and he was raised by an aunt. After finishing school, he joined the Kenya Police. Before taking up athletics, he played rugby.

==Athletic career==
He began his international career at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia where he came eleventh in the three miles. At the 1964 Summer Olympics he finished fifth in 5000 m and just missed qualification for the 1500 m final.

On 27 August 1965, Keino lowered the 3000 m world record by over 6 seconds to 7:39.6 in his first attempt at the distance. He won two gold medals (1500 and 5000 metres) at the inaugural All-Africa Games. Later in that year, he broke the 5000 m world record held by Ron Clarke, clocking 13:24.2. At the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, he won both the mile run and three-mile run. In the next Commonwealth Games, Keino won the 1500 metres and was third in the 5000 metres.

At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, he won the 1500 metres gold medal (defeating American favourite and world record holder Jim Ryun by 20 metres, the largest winning margin in the history of the event) and 5000 m silver medal. Four years later, he won the 3000 metres steeplechase gold and 1500 metres silver at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Keino was the flag bearer for Kenya in the 1964 Summer Olympics and the 1972 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies. Keino retired in 1973. He is on the cover of the October 1968 issue of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;, the first issue following the Olympics. He shared the cover of the September 1969 issue with Naftali Bon.

==After athletics==
* With his wife, Phyllis Keino, he has dedicated significant efforts to humanitarian work in Eldoret, Kenya. They have established the Lewa Children&#x27;s Home for orphans, the KipKeino Primary School in 1999, and the Kip Keino Secondary School in 2009.
* For his work with orphans, he shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsmen and Sportswomen of the Year&quot; award in 1987 with seven others, characterized as &quot;Athletes Who Care&quot;. In 1996, Kipchoge Keino Stadium in Eldoret was named after him.
* In 2007, he was made an honorary Doctor of Law by the University of Bristol. Earlier, Egerton University in Nakuru had awarded him an honorary degree. In July 2012, he received further recognition from the City of Bristol after the Kenyan Olympic Committee, under his presidency, made Bristol the training base for its athletes in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics. In 2012, Kipchoge Keino was among the inductees in the IAAF Hall of fame. The Bristol City Council awarded him freedom of the city, making him the first to receive this honour from Bristol since Sir Winston Churchill
* On 5 August 2016, at the Olympic opening ceremony in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Keino was awarded the first Olympic Laurel, for outstanding service to the Olympic movement.
* On 14 May 2021, Jovian asteroid 39285 Kipkeino, discovered by astronomers at Spacewatch in 1997, was .

==Personal life==
Keino resides on a farm in Eldoret, Kenya where he controls and runs a charitable organization for orphans. He is married to Phyllis Keino.

<text>Knud Johan Victor Rasmussen (; 7 June 1879 – 21 December 1933) was a Greenlandic-Danish polar explorer and anthropologist. He has been called the &quot;father of Eskimology&quot; (now often known as Inuit Studies or Greenlandic and Arctic Studies) and was the first European to cross the Northwest Passage via dog sled. He remains well known in Greenland, Denmark and among Canadian Inuit.

==Early years==

Rasmussen was born in Jacobshavn, Greenland, the son of a Danish missionary, the vicar Christian Rasmussen, and an Inuk–Danish mother, Lovise Rasmussen (née Fleischer). He had two siblings.

Rasmussen spent his early years in Greenland among the Kalaallit where he learnt to speak Kalaallisut, hunt, drive dog sleds and live in harsh Arctic conditions. &quot;My playmates were native Greenlanders; from the earliest boyhood I played and worked with the hunters, so even the hardships of the most strenuous sledge-trips became pleasant routine for me.&quot;

He was later educated in Lynge, North Zealand, Denmark. Between 1898 and 1900 he pursued an unsuccessful career as an actor and opera singer.

==Career==

He went on his first expedition in 1902–1904, known as The Danish Literary Expedition, with Jørgen Brønlund, Harald Moltke and Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen, to examine Inuit culture. After returning home, he went on a lecture circuit and wrote &quot;The People of the Polar North&quot; (1908), a combination travel journal and scholarly account of Inuit folklore. In 1908, he married Dagmar Andersen.

In 1910, Rasmussen and friend Peter Freuchen established the Thule Trading Station at Cape York (&quot;Qaanaaq&quot;), Greenland, as a trading base. The name Thule was chosen because it was the most northerly trading post in the world, literally the &quot;Ultima Thule&quot;. Thule Trading Station became the home base for a series of seven expeditions, known as the &quot;Thule Expeditions&quot;, between 1912 and 1933.

===The Thule expeditions===
The First Thule Expedition (1912, Rasmussen and Freuchen) aimed to test Robert Peary&#x27;s claim that a channel divided Peary Land from Greenland. They proved this was not the case in a remarkable journey across the inland ice that almost killed them. Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical Society, called the journey the &quot;finest ever performed by dogs.&quot; Freuchen wrote personal accounts of this journey (and others) in &quot;Vagrant Viking&quot; (1953) and &quot;I Sailed with Rasmussen&quot; (1958). In 1915, he translated Mathias Storch&#x27;s novel into Danish (&quot;The Dream&quot; in English; translated as ), the first novel written in Greenlandic.

The Second Thule Expedition (1916–1918) was larger with a team of seven men, which set out to map a little-known area of Greenland&#x27;s north coast. This journey was documented in Rasmussen&#x27;s account &quot;Greenland by the Polar Sea&quot; (1921). The trip was beset with two fatalities, the only in Rasmussen&#x27;s career, namely Thorild Wulff and Hendrik Olsen. The Third Thule Expedition (1919) was depot-laying for Roald Amundsen&#x27;s polar drift in the ship &quot;Maud&quot;. The Fourth Thule Expedition (1919–1920) was in east Greenland where Rasmussen spent several months collecting ethnographic data near Angmagssalik.

Rasmussen&#x27;s &quot;greatest achievement&quot; was the massive Fifth Thule Expedition (1921–1924) which was designed to &quot;attack the great primary problem of the origin of the Eskimo race.&quot; A ten volume account (&quot;The Fifth Thule Expedition 1921–1924&quot; (1946)) of ethnographic, archaeological and biological data was collected, and many artifacts are still on display in museums in Denmark. The team of seven first went to eastern Arctic Canada where they began collecting specimens, taking interviews (including the shaman Aua, who told him of Uvavnuk), and excavating sites.

Rasmussen left the team and traveled for 16 months with two Inuit hunters by dog sled across North America to Nome, Alaska – he tried to continue to Russia but his visa was refused. He was the first European to cross the Northwest Passage via dog sled. His journey is recounted in &quot;Across Arctic America&quot; (1927), considered today a classic of polar expedition literature. This trip has also been called the &quot;Great Sled Journey&quot; and was dramatized in the Canadian film &quot;The Journals of Knud Rasmussen&quot; (2006).

For the next seven years, Rasmussen traveled between Greenland and Denmark giving lectures and writing. In 1931, he went on the Sixth Thule Expedition, designed to consolidate Denmark&#x27;s claim on a portion of eastern Greenland that was contested by Norway.

The Seventh Thule Expedition (1933) was meant to continue the work of the sixth, but Rasmussen contracted pneumonia after an episode of food poisoning attributed to eating kiviaq, dying a few weeks later in Copenhagen at the age of 54. During this expedition Rasmussen worked on the film &quot;The Wedding of Palo&quot;, which Rasmussen wrote the screenplay for. The film was directed by Friedrich Dalsheim and completed in 1934 under the Danish title &quot;Palos brudefærd.&quot;

==Honours==

In addition to several capes and glaciers, Knud Rasmussen Range in Greenland is named after him, as is the Knud Rasmussen-class patrol vessel and its lead ship, the HDMS Knud Rasmussen.

He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the American Geographical Society in 1912, and its Daly Medal in 1924. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him their Founder&#x27;s Medal in 1923 and the Royal Danish Geographical Society their Hans Egede Medal in 1924. He was made honorary doctor at the University of Copenhagen in 1924, and the University of St Andrews in 1927.

<doc id="17195" wikidata="Q1770885" url="?curid=17195" title="Knute Rockne">
<text>Knute Kenneth Rockne (; March 4, 1888 – March 31, 1931) was an American football player and coach at the University of Notre Dame. Leading Notre Dame for 13 seasons, Rockne accumulated over 100 wins and three national championships.

Rockne is regarded as one of the greatest coaches in college football history. His biography at the College Football Hall of Fame, where he was inducted in 1951, identifies him as &quot;without question, American football&#x27;s most-renowned coach&quot;. Rockne helped to popularize the forward pass and made the Notre Dame Fighting Irish a major factor in college football.

In 1931, at the age of 43, Rockne died in a plane crash.

==Early life==
Knute Rockne was born Knut Larsen Rokne, in Voss, Norway, to smith and wagonmaker Lars Knutson Rokne (1858–1912) and his wife, Martha Pedersdatter Gjermo (1859–1944). He immigrated to Chicago with his parents when he was five years old. He grew up in the Logan Square area of Chicago, on the northwest side of the city. Rockne learned to play football in his neighborhood and later played end in a local group called the Logan Square Tigers. He attended Lorenz Brentano elementary school and North West Division High School in Chicago where he played football and ran track.
After Rockne graduated from high school, he took a job as a mail dispatcher with the post office in Chicago for four years. His clerk&#x27;s salary was $600 in 1907 and $900 in 1909. When he was 22, he had saved enough money to continue his education. He was admitted to the University of Notre Dame in Indiana to finish his schooling. Rockne excelled as a football end there, winning All-American honors in 1913. Rockne also worked as a lifeguard at the Cedar Point park near Sandusky, Ohio in the summer of 1913.

Rockne helped to transform the college game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the highly regarded Army team 35–13 in a game played at West Point. Led by quarterback Charlie &quot;Gus&quot; Dorais and Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game was not the &quot;invention&quot; of the forward pass, but it was the first major contest in which a team used the forward pass regularly throughout the game.

===Professional career===
At Notre Dame, Rockne was educated as a chemist, and he graduated in 1914 with a degree in pharmacy. After graduating, he was the laboratory assistant to noted polymer chemist Julius Arthur Nieuwland at Notre Dame and helped out with the football team, but he rejected further work in chemistry after receiving an offer to coach football. In 1914, he was recruited by Peggy Parratt to play for the Akron Indians. There Parratt had Rockne playing both end and halfback and teamed with him on several successful forward pass plays during their title drive. Rockne moved to Massillon, Ohio, in 1915 along with former Notre Dame teammate Dorais to play with the professional Massillon Tigers. Rockne and Dorais brought the forward pass to professional football from 1915 to 1917 when they led the Tigers to the championship in 1915. &quot;Pro Football in the Days of Rockne&quot; by Emil Klosinski maintains the worst loss ever suffered by Rockne was in 1917. He coached the &quot;South Bend Jolly Fellows Club&quot; when they lost 40–0 to the Toledo Maroons.

==Notre Dame coach==

While many trace Knute Rockne&#x27;s debut as a Notre Dame football coach to the war-torn 1918 season, or in 1914 when he became an assistant coach under Jesse Harper, his first position was actually for the Corby and Sorin Hall football teams as a student-athlete in 1912 and 1913. These teams represented residence halls on the university grounds that competed against one another in various sports, the most popular of which was football. The term for these competitions is colloquially known as &quot;interhall&quot; sports. Ironically, while Rockne holds the highest winning-percentage of any major college football coach, his overall record in the interhall football league was a paltry 2–5–4 across two seasons.
During 13 years as head coach, Rockne led Notre Dame to 105 victories, 12 losses, five ties and three consensus national championships, which included five undefeated and untied seasons. Rockne posted the highest all-time winning percentage (.881) for a major college football coach. His schemes utilized the eponymous Notre Dame Box offense and the 7–2–2 defense. Rockne&#x27;s box included a shift. The backfield lined up in a T-formation, then quickly shifted into a box to the left or right just as the ball was snapped.

Rockne also recognized that intercollegiate sports had a show-business aspect. Thus he worked hard promoting Notre Dame football to make it financially successful. He used his charm to court favor from the media, which then consisted of newspapers, wire services and radio stations and networks, to obtain free advertising for Notre Dame football. He was successful as a promoter for South Bend-based Studebaker and other products. Through sustained effort, work with Studebaker, several side jobs, and coaching at the University of Notre Dame Rockne eventually earned an income of $75,000 from all his financial activities combined.

===1918–1930===

During the war-torn season of 1918, Rockne took over from his predecessor Jesse Harper and posted a 3–1–2 record, losing only to the Michigan Aggies. He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, earning a 26–6 victory. In the backfield were Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau. In Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.

Rockne handled the line and Gus Dorais handled the backfield of the 1919 team. The team went undefeated and was a national champion, though the championship is not recognized by Notre Dame.

Gipp died on December 14, 1920, just two weeks after being elected Notre Dame&#x27;s first All-American by Walter Camp. He likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game, on November 20 against Northwestern University. Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to the young and healthy. It was while on his hospital bed and speaking to Rockne that he is purported to have delivered the line &quot;win just one for the Gipper&quot;.
John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns. Grantland Rice wrote, &quot;Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space&quot; and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team &quot;was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game&quot;. Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.

The national champion 1924 team included the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden. The line was known as the &quot;Seven Mules&quot;. The Irish capped an undefeated 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.

For all his success, Rockne also made what an Associated Press writer called &quot;one of the greatest coaching blunders in history&quot;. Instead of coaching his 1926 team against Carnegie Tech, Rockne traveled to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to &quot;write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team&quot;. Carnegie Tech used the coach&#x27;s absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.
The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech. &quot;I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund&quot;, said Rockne. &quot;Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.&quot; Rockne wrote of an attack on his coaching in the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;, &quot;I am surprised that a paper of such fine, high standing [as yours] would allow a zipper to write in his particular vein ... the article by Fuzzy Woodruff was not called for.&quot;

On November 10, 1928, the Fighting Irish were tied with Army 0–0 at the end of the half. Rockne entered the locker room and told the team the words he heard on Gipp&#x27;s deathbed in 1920: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to go, Rock. It&#x27;s all right. I&#x27;m not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they&#x27;ve got and win just one for the Gipper. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;ll be then, Rock. But I&#x27;ll know about it, and I&#x27;ll be happy.&quot; This inspired the team, who then won the game 12–6. The phrase &quot;Win one for the Gipper&quot; was later used as a political slogan by Ronald Reagan, who in 1940 portrayed Gipp in &quot;Knute Rockne, All American.&quot;

Both the 1929 and the 1930 teams went undefeated and were national champions. According to interviews, Rockne considered his 1929 team his strongest overall. Rockne also said he considered his 1930 team to have been his best offensively before the departure of Jumping Joe Savoldi. Rockne was struck with illness in 1929, and the &quot;de facto&quot; head coach was assistant Tom Lieb. Rockne&#x27;s all-time All-America backfield was Jim Thorpe, Red Grange, George Gipp, and George Pfann.

==Personal life==
Rockne met Bonnie Gwendoline Skiles (1891–1956) of Kenton, Ohio, an avid gardener, while the two were employed at Cedar Point. Bonnie was the daughter of George Skiles and Huldah Dry. The two married at Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Sandusky, Ohio, on July 14, 1914, with Father William F. Murphy officiating and Gus Dorais as best man. They had four children: Knute Lars Jr., William Dorias, Mary Jeane and John Vincent. Rockne converted from Lutheranism to the Catholic Church on November 20, 1925. The Rev. Vincent Mooney, C.S.C., baptized Rockne in the Log Chapel on Notre Dame&#x27;s campus.

In 1986 a grandson, Paul Michael Rockne, was killed in the Edmond post office shooting, the deadliest workplace shooting in U.S. history and the deadliest shooting by a lone gunman in the state of Oklahoma.

==Plane crash and public reaction==

Rockne died in the crash of a Transcontinental &amp; Western Air airliner in Kansas on March 31, 1931, while en route to participate in the production of the film &quot;The Spirit of Notre Dame&quot; (released October 13, 1931). He had stopped in Kansas City to visit his two sons, Bill and Knute Jr., who were in boarding school there at the Pembroke-Country Day School. A little over an hour after taking off from Kansas City, one of the Fokker Trimotor&#x27;s wings broke up in flight. The plane crashed into a wheat field near Bazaar, Kansas, killing Rockne and seven others.

Coincidentally, Jess Harper, Rockne&#x27;s friend and the coach he had replaced at Notre Dame, lived approximately from the spot of the crash. Harper was called to make a positive identification of Rockne&#x27;s body. A memorial dedicated to the victims stands on the spot where the plane crashed. The memorial is surrounded by a wire fence with wooden posts and was maintained for many years by James Heathman, who, at the age of 13 in 1931, was one of the first people to arrive at the site of the crash.

Rockne&#x27;s unexpected death startled the nation and triggered a national outpouring of grief, comparable to the death of a president. President Herbert Hoover called Rockne&#x27;s death &quot;a national loss&quot;. King Haakon VII of Norway posthumously knighted Rockne and sent a personal envoy, Olaf Bernts, Norwegian consul in Chicago, to Rockne&#x27;s funeral.

Rockne was buried in Highland Cemetery in South Bend, the city adjacent to the Notre Dame campus. Six of his players from the previous year (Marty Brill, Tom Yarr, Frank Carideo, Marchy Schwartz, Tom Conley and Larry Mullins) carried him to his final resting place. More than 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral procession, and the funeral, held at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, was broadcast live on network radio across the United States and in Europe as well as parts of South America and Asia. In 2024, Rockne was reinterred on the campus of Notre Dame.

Driven by the public feeling for Rockne, the crash story played out at length in nearly all the nation&#x27;s newspapers and public demand for an inquiry into the crash&#x27;s causes and circumstances ensued. The cause of the damage was determined to be that the plane&#x27;s plywood outer skin was bonded to the ribs and spars with water-based aliphatic resin glue, and flight in rain had caused the bond to deteriorate to the point that sections of the plywood suddenly separated. The national outcry over the disaster triggered sweeping changes to aircraft design, manufacturing, operation, inspection, maintenance, regulation and crash investigation, igniting a safety revolution that ultimately transformed airline travel worldwide from one of the most dangerous forms of travel to one of the safest.

==Legacy==

Rockne was not the first coach to use the forward pass, but he helped popularize it nationally. Most football historians agree that a few schools, notably St. Louis University (under coach Eddie Cochems), Michigan, Carlisle and Minnesota, had passing attacks in place before Rockne arrived at Notre Dame. The great majority of passing attacks, however, consisted solely of short pitches and shovel passes to stationary receivers. Additionally, few of the major Eastern teams that constituted the power center of college football at the time used the pass.

In the summer of 1913, while he was a lifeguard on the beach at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, Rockne and his college teammate and roommate Gus Dorais worked on passing techniques. These were employed in games by the 1913 Notre Dame squad and subsequent Harper- and Rockne-coached teams and included many features common in modern passing, including having the passer throw the ball overhand and having the receiver run under a football and catch the ball in stride.

That fall, Notre Dame upset heavily favored Army 35–13 at West Point thanks to a barrage of Dorais-to-Rockne long downfield passes. The game played an important role in displaying the potency of the forward pass and &quot;open offense&quot; and convinced many coaches to add pass plays to their play books. The game is dramatized in the movies &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; and &quot;The Long Gray Line&quot;. In May 1949, Knute Rockne appeared in the Master Man story on Kid Eternity comics, Vol 1, number 15.

There is a Knute Rockne Street in San Antonio, Texas.

=== Memorials ===

* Notre Dame memorializes him in the Knute Rockne Memorial Building, an athletics facility built in 1937, as well as the main football stadium.
* His name appears on streets in South Bend and in Stevensville, Michigan, (where Rockne had a summer home), and a travel plaza on the Indiana Toll Road.
* The Rockne Memorial near Bazaar, Kansas at the site of the airliner crash memorializes Rockne and the seven others who died with him. It was erected by the late Easter Heathman, who as a boy was a crash eyewitness and was among the first to respond at the scene. Every five years since the crash, a memorial ceremony is held there and at a nearby schoolhouse, drawing relatives of the victims and Rockne and Notre Dame fans from around the world. Now part of the Heathman family estate, it is accessible only by arrangement or during memorial commemorations.
* The Matfield Green rest stop travel plaza (center foyer) on the Kansas Turnpike near Bazaar and the airliner crash site where Rockne was killed used to have a large, glassed-in exhibit commemorating Rockne (chiefly), the other crash victims, and the crash itself. The memorial was taken down during renovations of the travel plaza.
* In 1941, Allentown Central Catholic High School in Allentown, Pennsylvania dedicated its gymnasium, Rockne Hall, to Knute Rockne.
* Taylorville, Illinois dedicated the street next to the football field as &quot;Knute Rockne Road&quot;.
* The town of Rockne, Texas was named to honor him. In 1931, the children of Sacred Heart School were given the opportunity to name their town. A vote was taken, with the children electing to name the town after Rockne, who had died in a plane crash earlier that year. On March 10, 1988, Rockne opened its post office for one day during which a Knute Rockne 22-cent commemorative stamp was issued. A life-size bust of Rockne was unveiled on March 4, 2006.
* The Studebaker automobile company of South Bend marketed the Rockne automobile from 1931 to 1933. It was a separate product line of Studebaker and priced in the low-cost market.
* Symphonic composer Ferde Grofe composed a musical suite in Rockne&#x27;s honor shortly after the coach&#x27;s death.
* In 1940, actor Pat O&#x27;Brien portrayed Rockne in the Warner Brothers film &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, in which Rockne used the phrase &quot;win one for the Gipper&quot; in reference to the death bed request of George Gipp, played by Ronald Reagan.
* The short film &quot;I Am an American&quot; (1944) featured Rockne as a foreign-born citizen
* Rockne was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951 as a charter member and in the Indiana Football Hall of Fame.
* In 1988, the United States Postal Service honored Rockne with a 22-cent commemorative postage stamp. President Ronald Reagan, who played George Gipp in the movie &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot;, gave an address at the Athletic &amp; Convocation Center at the University of Notre Dame on March 9, 1988, and officially unveiled the Rockne stamp.
* In 1988, Rockne was inducted posthumously into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame held during Norsk Høstfest.
* A biographical musical of Rockne&#x27;s life premiered at the Theatre at the Center in Munster, Indiana on April 3, 2008. The musical is based on a play and mini-series by Buddy Farmer.
* The U.S. Navy named a ship in the Liberty ship class after Knute Rockne in 1943. The SS Knute Rockne was scrapped in 1972.
* A statue of Rockne, as well as Ara Parseghian, both by the sculptor Armando Hinojosa of Laredo, Texas, are located on the Notre Dame campus.
* He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2014.

<text>The Kariba Dam is a double curvature concrete arch dam in the Kariba Gorge of the Zambezi river basin between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The dam stands tall and long. The dam forms Lake Kariba, which extends for and holds of water.

== Construction ==
The dam was constructed on the orders of the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a &#x27;federal colony&#x27; within the British Empire. The double curvature concrete arch dam was designed by Coyne et Bellier and constructed between 1955 and 1959 by Impresit of Italy at a cost of $135,000,000 for the first stage with only the Kariba South power cavern. Final construction and the addition of the Kariba North Power cavern by Mitchell Construction was not completed until 1977, due to largely political problems, for a total cost of $480,000,000. During construction, 86 construction workers lost their lives.

The dam was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 17 May 1960.

== Power generation ==
The Kariba Dam supplies of electricity to parts of both Zambia (the Copperbelt) and Zimbabwe and generates per annum. Each country has its own power station on the north and south bank of the dam, respectively. The south station belonging to Zimbabwe has been in operation since 1960 and had six generators of capacity each for a total of .

On November 11, 2013 it was announced by Zimbabwe&#x27;s Finance Minister, Patrick Chinamasa that capacity at the Zimbabwean (South) Kariba hydropower station would be increased by 300 megawatts. The cost of upgrading the facility has been supported by a $319m loan from China. The deal is a clear example of Zimbabwe&#x27;s &quot;Look East&quot; policy, which was adopted after falling out with Western powers. Construction on the Kariba South expansion began in mid-2014 and was initially expected to be complete in 2019.

In March 2018, president Emmerson Mnangagwa commissioned the completed expansion of &quot;Kariba South Hydroelectric Power Station&quot;. The addition of two new turbines raised capacity at this station to . The expansion work was done by Sinohydro, at a cost of US$533 million. Work started in 2014, and was completed in March 2018.

The north station belonging to Zambia has been in operation since 1976, and has four generators of each for a total of ; work to expand this capacity by an additional to was completed in December 2013. Two additional 180 MW generators were added.

== Location ==

The Kariba Dam project was planned and carried out by the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The Federation was often referred to as the Central African Federation (CAF). The CAF was a &#x27;federal colony&#x27; within the British Empire in southern Africa that existed from 1953 to the end of 1963, comprising the former self-governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia and the former British protectorates of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Northern Rhodesia had decided earlier in 1953 (before the Federation was founded) to build a dam within its territory, on the Kafue River, a major tributary of the Zambezi. It would have been closer to Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s Copperbelt, which was in need of more power. This would have been a cheaper and less grandiose project, with a smaller environmental impact. Southern Rhodesia, the richest of the three, objected to a Kafue dam and insisted that the dam be sited instead at Kariba. Also, the capacity of the Kafue dam was much lower than that at Kariba. Initially, the dam was managed and maintained by the Central African Power Corporation. The Kariba Dam is now owned and operated by the Zambezi River Authority, which is jointly and equally owned by Zimbabwe and Zambia.

Since Zambia&#x27;s independence, three dams have been built on the Kafue River: the Kafue Gorge Upper Dam, Kafue Gorge Lower Dam and the Itezhi-Tezhi Dam.

== Environmental impacts ==

=== Population displacement and resettlement ===
The creation of the reservoir forced resettlement of about 57,000 Tonga people living along the Zambezi on both sides. 

There are many different perspectives on how much resettlement aid was given to the displaced Tonga. British author David Howarth described the efforts in Northern Rhodesia:

Anthropologist Thayer Scudder, who has studied these communities since the late 1950s, wrote:

American writer Jacques Leslie, in &quot;Deep Water&quot; (2005), focused on the plight of the people displaced by Kariba Dam, and found the situation little changed since the 1970s. In his view, Kariba remains the worst dam-resettlement disaster in African history.

==== Basilwizi Trust ====

In an effort to regain control of their lives, the local people who were displaced by the Kariba dam&#x27;s reservoir formed the Basilwizi Trust in 2002. The Trust seeks mainly to improve the lives of people in the area through organizing development projects and serving as a conduit between the people of the Zambezi Valley and their country&#x27;s decision-making process. 

=== River ecology ===
The Kariba Dam controls 90% of the total runoff of the Zambezi River, thus changing the downstream ecology dramatically.

=== Wildlife rescue ===
From 1958 to 1961, Operation Noah captured and removed around 6,000 large animals and numerous small ones threatened by the lake&#x27;s rising waters.

== Recent activity ==
On 6 February 2008, the BBC reported that heavy rain could lead to a release of water from the dam, which would force 50,000 people downstream to evacuate.
Rising levels led to the opening of the floodgates in March 2010, requiring the evacuation of 130,000 people who lived in the floodplain, and causing concerns that flooding would spread to nearby areas.

In March 2014, at a conference organized by the Zambezi River Authority, engineers warned that the foundations of the dam had weakened and there was a possibility of dam failure unless repairs were made.

On 3 October 2014 the BBC reported that &quot;The Kariba Dam is in a dangerous state. Opened in 1959, it was built on a seemingly solid bed of basalt. But, in the past 50 years, the torrents from the spillway have eroded that bedrock, carving a vast crater that has undercut the dam&#x27;s foundations. … engineers are now warning that without urgent repairs, the whole dam will collapse. If that happened, a tsunami-like wall of water would rip through the Zambezi valley, reaching the Mozambique border within eight hours. The torrent would overwhelm Mozambique&#x27;s Cahora Bassa Dam and knock out 40% of southern Africa&#x27;s hydroelectric capacity. Along with the devastation of wildlife in the valley, the Zambezi River Authority estimates that the lives of 3.5 million people are at risk.&quot;

In June 2015 The Institute of Risk Management South Africa completed a Risk Research Report entitled &quot;Impact of the failure of the Kariba Dam&quot;. It concluded: &quot;Whilst we can debate whether the Kariba
Dam will fail, why it might occur and when, there is no doubt that the impact across the region would be devastating.&quot;

In January 2016 it was reported that water levels at the dam had dropped to 12% of capacity. Levels fell by , which is just above the minimum operating level for hydropower. Low rainfalls and overuse of the water by the power plants have left the reservoir near empty, raising the prospect that both Zimbabwe and Zambia will face water shortages.

In July and September 2018, &quot;The Lusaka Times&quot; reported that work had started relating to the plunge pool and cracks in the dam wall.

On 22 February 2019 Bloomberg reported &quot;Zambia has reduced hydropower production at the Kariba Dam because of rapidly declining water levels&quot; but &quot;Zambia doesn&#x27;t anticipate power cuts as a result of shortages&quot;. On 5 August that year, the same publication reported that the reservoir was near empty, and that it may have to stop hydropower production.

As of November 2020 the water level in the Kariba reservoir has remained steady around the 25% capacity, up from nearly half that in November 2019. The Zambezi River Authority has stated that it is optimistic about rainfall estimates for the 2020/2021 rainfall season, allocating an increased amount of water for power production. At that time, the reservoir held 15.77 billion cubic meters of water, with the water line sitting at around 478.30 metres (1,569.23 ft), just above the minimum capacity for power generation of 475.50 metres (1,560.04 ft).

It was reported in February 2022 that rehabilitation work has been underway since 2017 on the Kariba dam. The Zambezi River Authority (ZRA) said that work on the Kariba Dam Rehabilitation Project (KDRP), which includes efforts to reconfigure the plunge pool and rebuild the spillway gates, is scheduled to be finished in 2025. The rehabilitation of the dam is being financed by the European Union (EU), the World Bank, the Swedish government and the African Development Bank (AfDB), with the Zambian and Zimbabwe governments contributing counterpart funding. The project’s goal is to guarantee the structural integrity of the Kariba Dam, assuring the sustained generation of power primarily for the benefit of the inhabitants of Zimbabwe and Zambia and the broader Southern African Development Community area. The work on redesigning the plunge pool involves bulk excavating the rock in the current pool to assist plunge pool stabilization and avoid additional scouring or erosion along the weak fault zone towards the dam foundation. This reshaping work will be accomplished by constructing a temporary water-tight cofferdam to complete the reshaping work under dry conditions.

An energy crisis due to drought and low water levels continued into January 2023, with water level falling to just 1% of capacity and output limited to 800 MW for a fraction of the day.

Industrial power users have proposed a 250 MW floating solar plant on Lake Kariba to improve electricity reliability.

<text>Sir Kingsley William Amis (16 April 1922 – 22 October 1995) was an English novelist, poet, critic and teacher. He wrote more than 20 novels, six volumes of poetry, a memoir, short stories, radio and television scripts, and works of social and literary criticism. He is best known for satirical comedies such as &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (1954), &quot;One Fat Englishman&quot; (1963), &quot;Ending Up&quot; (1974), &quot;Jake&#x27;s Thing&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Old Devils&quot; (1986).

His biographer Zachary Leader called Amis &quot;the finest English comic novelist of the second half of the twentieth century&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked him ninth on a list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. He was the father of the novelist Martin Amis.

==Life and career==
Kingsley Amis was born on 16 April 1922 in Clapham, south London, the only child of William Robert Amis (1889–1963), a clerk—&quot;quite an important one, fluent in Spanish and responsible for exporting mustard to South America&quot;—for the mustard manufacturer Colman&#x27;s in the City of London, and his wife Rosa Annie (née Lucas). The Amis grandparents were wealthy. William Amis&#x27;s father, the glass merchant Joseph James Amis, owned a mansion called Barchester at Purley, then part of Surrey. Amis considered J. J. Amis—always called &quot;Pater&quot; or &quot;Dadda&quot;—&quot;a jokey, excitable, silly little man&quot;, whom he &quot;disliked and was repelled by&quot;.

His wife Julia &quot;was a large, dreadful, hairy-faced creature ... whom [Amis] loathed and feared&quot;. His mother&#x27;s parents lived at Camberwell. Her father George was an enthusiastic collector of books and Baptist chapel organist who was employed at a Brixton gentleman&#x27;s outfitters as a tailor&#x27;s assistant and was &quot;the only grandparent [Amis] cared for&quot;. Amis hoped to inherit much of his grandfather&#x27;s library, but his grandmother Jemima—whom Amis already disliked for her habit of mocking her husband when he read his favourite passages to Amis, making &quot;faces and gestures at him while his head was lowered to the page&quot;—permitted him to take only five volumes, on condition he wrote &quot;from his grandfather&#x27;s collection&quot; on the flyleaf of each.

Amis was raised at Norbury—in his later estimation &quot;not really a place. It&#x27;s an expression on a map ... really I should say I came from Norbury station.&quot; Having been educated first at St Hilda&#x27;s, an &quot;undistinguished, long-vanished local school ... an independent girls&#x27; school of the kind which also took small boys, before they became pubescent and dangerous&quot;, he then moved to nearby Norbury College.

In 1940, the Amises moved to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, and Amis (like his father before him) won a scholarship to the City of London School. In April 1941, after his first year, he was admitted on a scholarship to St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he read English. There he met Philip Larkin, with whom he formed the most important friendship of his life.

In June 1941, Amis joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. He broke with communism in 1956, in view of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s denunciation of Joseph Stalin in his speech &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;. In July 1942, he was called up for national service and served in the Royal Corps of Signals. He returned to Oxford in October 1945 to complete his degree. Although he worked hard and earned a first in English in 1947, he had decided by then to give much of his time to writing.

In 1946 he met Hilary Bardwell. They married in 1948 after she became pregnant with their first child, Philip. Amis initially arranged for her to have a back-street abortion, but changed his mind, fearing for her safety. He was a lecturer in English at the University College of Swansea from 1949 to 1961. Two other children followed: Martin in August 1949 and Sally in January 1954.

Days after Sally&#x27;s birth, Amis&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot;, was published to great acclaim. Critics felt it had caught the flavour of Britain in the 1950s and ushered in a new style of fiction. By 1972, its impressive sales in Britain had been matched by 1.25 million paperback copies sold in the United States. It was translated into 20 languages, including Polish, Hebrew, Korean, and Serbo-Croat. The novel won the Somerset Maugham Award for fiction and Amis became one of the writers known as the Angry Young Men. &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; was among the first British campus novels, setting a precedent for later generations of writers such as Malcolm Bradbury, David Lodge, Tom Sharpe and Howard Jacobson. As a poet, Amis was associated with The Movement.

In 1958–1959 Amis made the first of two visits to the United States, as visiting fellow in creative writing at Princeton University and a visiting lecturer in other north-eastern universities. On returning to Britain, he fell into a rut, and he began looking for another post. After 13 years at Swansea, Amis became a fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1961, but regretted the move within a year, finding Cambridge an academic and social disappointment. He resigned in 1963, intent on moving to Majorca, although he actually moved no further than London.

In 1963, Hilary discovered that Amis was having an affair with the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard. Hilary and Amis separated in August and he went to live with Howard, divorcing Hilary and marrying Howard in 1965. In 1968 he moved with Howard to Lemmons, a house in Barnet, north London. She and Amis divorced in 1983.

In his last years, Amis shared a house with Hilary and her third husband, Alastair Boyd, 7th Baron Kilmarnock. Martin&#x27;s memoir &quot;Experience&quot; contains much about the life, charm and decline of his father.

Amis was knighted in 1990. In August 1995 he fell, following a suspected stroke. After apparently recovering, he worsened and died on 22 October 1995 at St Pancras Hospital, London. He was cremated and his ashes laid to rest at Golders Green Crematorium.

==Literary work==

Amis is widely known as a comic novelist of life in mid- to late-20th-century Britain, but his literary work covered many genres: poetry, essays, criticism, short stories, food and drink, anthologies, and several novels in genres such as science fiction and mystery. His career initially developed in an inverse pattern to that of his close friend Philip Larkin. Before becoming known as a poet, Larkin had published two novels; Amis originally sought to be a poet and turned to novels only after publishing several volumes of verse. He continued throughout his career to write poetry in a straightforward, accessible style that often masks a nuance of thought.

Amis&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (1954), satirises the highbrow academic set of an unnamed university through the eyes of a struggling young lecturer of history. It was widely perceived as part of the Angry Young Men movement of the 1950s, in reacting against stultification of conventional British life, although Amis never encouraged this interpretation. Amis&#x27;s other novels of the 1950s and early 1960s likewise depict contemporary situations drawn from his experience.

&quot;That Uncertain Feeling&quot; (1955) features a young provincial librarian (perhaps with an eye to Larkin working as a librarian in Hull) and his temptation to adultery. &quot;I Like It Here&quot; (1958) takes a contemptuous view of &quot;abroad&quot;, after Amis&#x27;s own travels on the Continent with a young family. &quot;Take a Girl Like You&quot; (1960) steps away from the immediately autobiographical, but remains grounded in the concerns of sex and love in ordinary modern life, tracing a young schoolmaster&#x27;s courtship and ultimate seduction of the heroine.

With &quot;The Anti-Death League&quot; (1966), Amis begins to show some of the experimentation—in content, if not style—that marked much of his work in the 1960s and 1970s. His departure from the strict realism of his early comedic novels is not so abrupt as it might first appear. He had been avidly reading science fiction since a boy and developed that interest in the Christian Gauss Lectures of 1958, while visiting Princeton University. These were published that year as &quot;New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction&quot;, giving a serious yet light-handed treatment of what the genre had to say about man and society.

Amis was especially keen on the dystopian works of Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth, and in &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot; coined the term &quot;comic inferno&quot; to describe a type of humorous dystopia exemplified by the work of Robert Sheckley. He further displayed his devotion to the genre in editing, with the Sovietologist Robert Conquest, the science-fiction anthology series &quot;Spectrum&quot; I–V, which drew heavily upon 1950s numbers of the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;.

Though not explicitly science fiction, &quot;The Anti-Death League&quot; takes liberties with reality not found in Amis&#x27;s earlier novels. It introduces a speculative bent that continued to develop in others of his genre novels, such as &quot;The Green Man&quot; (1969) (mystery/horror) and &quot;The Alteration&quot; (1976) (alternative history). Much of this speculation concerned the improbability of the existence of any benevolent deity involved in human affairs.

In &quot;The Anti-Death League&quot;, &quot;The Green Man&quot;, &quot;The Alteration&quot; and elsewhere, including poems such as &quot;The Huge Artifice: an interim assessment&quot; and &quot;New Approach Needed&quot;, Amis showed frustration with a God who could lace the world with cruelty and injustice, and championed the preservation of ordinary human happiness—in family, in friendships, in physical pleasure—against the demands of any cosmological scheme. Amis&#x27;s religious views appear in a response reported in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;. To the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko&#x27;s question, &quot;You atheist?&quot;, Amis replied, &quot;It&#x27;s more that I hate Him.&quot;

During this time, Amis had not turned completely away from the comedic realism of &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; and &quot;Take a Girl Like You&quot;. &quot;I Want It Now&quot; (1968) and &quot;Girl, 20&quot; (1971) both depict the &quot;swinging&quot; atmosphere of late-1960s London, in which Amis certainly participated, though neither book is strictly autobiographical. &quot;Girl, 20&quot;, for instance, is set in the world of classical (and pop) music, in which Amis had no part. The book&#x27;s noticeable command of music terminology and opinion shows Amis&#x27;s amateur devotion to music and almost journalistic capacity to explore a subject that interested him. That intelligence is similarly displayed in the ecclesiastical matters in &quot;The Alteration&quot;; Amis was neither a Roman Catholic nor a devotee of any church.

Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Amis regularly produced essays and criticism, principally for periodical publication. Some were collected in 1968 into &quot;What Became of Jane Austen? and Other Essays&quot;, in which Amis&#x27;s wit and literary and social opinions were displayed on books such as Colin Wilson&#x27;s &quot;The Outsider&quot; (panned), Iris Murdoch&#x27;s début novel &quot;Under the Net&quot; (praised), and William Empson&#x27;s &quot;Milton&#x27;s God&quot; (inclined to agreement). Amis&#x27;s opinions on books and people tended to appear, and often were, conservative, and yet, as the title essay of the collection shows, he was not merely reverent of &quot;the classics&quot; and of traditional morals, but more disposed to exercise his own rather independent judgement in all things.

Amis became associated with Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novels, which he admired, in the late 1960s, when he began composing critical works connected with Bond, either under a pseudonym or uncredited. In 1965, he wrote the popular &quot;James Bond Dossier&quot; under his own name. The same year, he wrote &quot;The Book of Bond, or, Every Man His Own 007&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek how-to manual about being a sophisticated spy, under the pseudonym &quot;Lt Col. William (&#x27;Bill&#x27;) Tanner&quot;, Tanner being M&#x27;s chief of staff in many of Fleming&#x27;s novels. In 1968 Amis wrote &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;, which was published under the pseudonym &quot;Robert Markham&quot;.

Amis&#x27;s literary style and tone changed significantly after 1970, with the possible exception of &quot;The Old Devils&quot;, a Booker Prize winner. Several critics found him old-fashioned and misogynistic. His &quot;Stanley and the Women&quot;, an exploration of social sanity, could be said to instance these traits. Others said that his output lacked his earlier work&#x27;s humanity, wit and compassion.

This period also saw Amis as an anthologist, displaying a wide knowledge of all kinds of English poetry. &quot;The New Oxford Book of Light Verse&quot; (1978), which he edited, was a revision of an original volume done by W. H. Auden. Amis took it in a markedly new direction: Auden had interpreted light verse to include &quot;low&quot; verse of working-class or lower-class origin, regardless of subject matter, while Amis defined light verse as essentially light in tone, though not necessarily simple in composition. &quot;The Amis Anthology&quot; (1988), a personal selection of his favourite poems, grew out of his work for a London newspaper, in which he selected a poem a day and gave it a brief introduction.

Amis was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times, for &quot;Ending Up&quot; (1974) and &quot;Jake&#x27;s Thing&quot; (1978), and finally, as prizewinner, for &quot;The Old Devils&quot; in 1986.

In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Amis 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.

==Personal life==
===Political views===
As a young man at Oxford, Amis joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and left it in 1956. He later described this stage of his political life as &quot;the callow Marxist phase that seemed almost compulsory in Oxford&quot;. Amis remained nominally on the political left for some time after the war, declaring in the 1950s that he would always vote for the Labour Party.

Amis eventually moved further to the political right, a development he discussed in the essay &quot;Why Lucky Jim Turned Right&quot; (1967); his conservatism and anti-communism can be seen in works like the dystopian novel &quot;Russian Hide and Seek&quot; (1980). In 1967, Amis, Robert Conquest, John Braine, and several other authors signed a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; entitled &quot;Backing for U.S. Policies in Vietnam&quot;, supporting the US government in the Vietnam War. He spoke at the Adam Smith Institute, arguing against government subsidy to the arts.

===Character===
By his own admission and according to his biographers, Amis was a serial adulterer for much of his life. This was a major contributory factor in the breakdown of his first marriage. A famous photograph of a sleeping Amis on a Yugoslav beach shows the slogan (written in lipstick by wife Hilary) on his back &quot;1 Fat Englishman—I fuck anything.&quot;

In one memoir, Amis wrote, &quot;Now and then I become conscious of having the reputation of being one of the great drinkers, if not one of the great drunks, of our time&quot;. He suggests this reflects a naïve tendency in readers to apply the behaviour of his characters to himself. He enjoyed drink and spent a good deal of time in pubs. Hilary Rubinstein, who accepted &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; for Victor Gollancz, commented, &quot;I doubted whether Jim Dixon would have gone to the pub and drunk ten pints of beer... I didn&#x27;t know Kingsley very well, you see.&quot;

Clive James commented: &quot;All on his own, he had the weekly drinks bill of a whole table at the Garrick Club even before he was elected. After he was, he would get so tight there that he could barely make it to the taxi.&quot; But Amis was adamant that inspiration did not come from a bottle: &quot;Whatever part drink may play in the writer&#x27;s life, it must play none in his or her work.&quot;

This matched a disciplined approach to writing. For &quot;many years&quot; Amis imposed a rigorous daily schedule on himself, segregating writing and drink. Mornings were spent on writing, with a minimum daily output of 500 words. Drinking began about lunchtime, when this had been achieved. Such self-discipline was essential to Amis&#x27;s prodigious output.

Yet according to James, Amis reached a turning point when his drinking ceased to be social and became a way of dulling his remorse and regret at his behaviour towards Hilly. &quot;Amis had turned against himself deliberately... It seems fair to guess that the troubled grandee came to disapprove of his own conduct.&quot; His friend Christopher Hitchens said: &quot;The booze got to him in the end, and robbed him of his wit and charm as well as of his health.&quot;

===Antisemitism===
Amis had an unclear relationship with antisemitism, which he sometimes expressed but also claimed to dislike. He occasionally speculated on the commonly advanced Jewish stereotypes. Antisemitism was sometimes present in his conversations and letters to friends and associates, such as &quot;The great Jewish vice is glibness, fluency ... also possibly just bullshit, as in Marx, Freud, Marcuse&quot;, or &quot;Chaplin [who was not Jewish] is a horse&#x27;s arse. He&#x27;s a Jeeeew you see, like the Marx Brothers, like Danny Kaye.&quot; It is a minor theme in his &quot;Stanley and the Women&quot; novel about a paranoid schizophrenic. As for the cultural complexion of the United States, Amis had this to say: &quot;I&#x27;ve finally worked out why I don&#x27;t like Americans ... . Because everyone there is either a Jew or a hick.&quot; Amis himself described his antisemitism as &quot;very mild&quot;.

==Family==
Amis&#x27;s first, 15-year marriage was to Hilary Bardwell, the daughter of a civil servant, by whom he had two sons and one daughter: Philip Amis, a graphics designer; Martin Amis, a novelist who died in 2023; and Sally Amis, who died in 2000.

Amis was married a second time, to the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard from 1965 to 1983, with whom he had no children. At the end of that marriage, he went to live with his former wife Hilary and her third husband, in a deal brokered by their two sons Philip and Martin to ensure he could be cared for until his death.

<text>are syllabaries used to write Japanese phonological units, morae. In current usage, &quot;kana&quot; most commonly refers to &quot;hiragana&quot; and &quot;katakana&quot;. It can also refer to their ancestor , which were Chinese characters used phonetically to transcribe Japanese (e.g. &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;); and &quot;hentaigana&quot;, which are historical variants of the now-standard hiragana.

Katakana, with a few additions, are also used to write Ainu. A number of systems exist to write the Ryūkyūan languages, in particular Okinawan, in hiragana. Taiwanese kana were used in Taiwanese Hokkien as ruby text for Chinese characters in Taiwan when it was under Japanese rule.

Each kana character corresponds to one sound or whole syllable in the Japanese language, unlike kanji regular script, which corresponds to a meaning. Apart from the five vowels, it is always CV (consonant onset with vowel nucleus), such as &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ki&quot;, &quot;sa&quot;, &quot;shi&quot;, etc., with the sole exception of the C grapheme for nasal codas usually romanised as &quot;n&quot;. The structure has led some scholars to label the system &quot;moraic&quot;, instead of &quot;syllabic&quot;, because it requires the combination of two syllabograms to represent a CVC syllable with coda (e.g. CV&quot;n&quot;, CV&quot;m&quot;, CV&quot;ng&quot;), a CVV syllable with complex nucleus (i.e. multiple or expressively long vowels), or a CCV syllable with complex onset (i.e. including a glide, C&quot;y&quot;V, C&quot;w&quot;V).

The limited number of phonemes in Japanese, as well as the relatively rigid syllable structure, makes the kana system a very accurate representation of spoken Japanese.

==Etymology==
&#x27;Kana&#x27; is a compound of and , which eventually collapsed into &quot;kanna&quot; and ultimately &#x27;kana&#x27;.

Today it is generally assumed that &#x27;kana&#x27; were considered &quot;false&quot; kanji due to their purely phonetic nature, as opposed to which were &quot;true&quot; kanji used for their meanings. Yet originally, &quot;mana&quot; and &quot;kana&quot; were purely calligraphic terms with &quot;mana&quot; referring to Chinese characters written in the regular script (&quot;kaisho&quot;) and &quot;kana&quot; referring to those written in the cursive (&quot;sōsho&quot;) style (see &quot;hiragana&quot;). It was not until the 18th century that the early-nationalist movement which wanted to move away from Sinocentric academia began to reanalyze the script from a phonological point of view. In the following centuries, contrary to the traditional Sinocentric view, &quot;kana&quot; began to be considered a national Japanese writing system that was distinct from Chinese characters, which is the dominant view today.

==Terms==
Although the term &#x27;kana&#x27; is now commonly understood as hiragana and katakana, it actually has broader application as listed below:
* or : a syllabary.
** or : phonetic kanji used as syllabary characters, historically used by men (who were more educated).
***: the most prominent system of magana.
****: cursive man&#x27;yōgana.
*****, , , or : a syllabary derived from simplified sōgana, historically used by women (who were less educated), historically sorted in &quot;Iroha&quot; order.
****** or : obsolete variants of hiragana.
**** or : a syllabary derived by using bits of characters in man&#x27;yōgana, historically sorted in &quot;gojūon&quot; order.
****: hiragana and katakana, as opposed to kanji.
***: magana for transcribing Japanese words, using, strict or loose, Chinese-derived readings (&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;). For example, would be spelt as , with two magana with on&#x27;yomi for &quot;ya&quot; and &quot;ma&quot;; likewise, spelt as 比登 for &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;to&quot;.
***: magana for transcribing Japanese words, using native words ascribed to kanji (native &quot;readings&quot; or &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;). For example, would be spelt as , with three magana with kun&#x27;yomi for &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;ma&quot; and &quot;to&quot;; likewise, spelt as 夏樫 for &quot;natsu&quot; and &quot;kashi&quot;.
* , , or : kanji used for meanings, historically used by men (who were more educated).
* : mixed script including only kanji and katakana.

== Hiragana and katakana ==
The following table reads, in gojūon order, as &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;o&quot; (down first column), then &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ki&quot;, &quot;ku&quot;, &quot;ke&quot;, &quot;ko&quot; (down second column), and so on. &quot;n&quot; appears on its own at the end. Asterisks mark unused combinations.

*There are presently no kana for &quot;ye&quot;, &quot;yi&quot; or &quot;wu&quot;, as corresponding syllables do not occur natively in modern Japanese.
**The (&quot;ye&quot;) sound is believed to have existed in pre-Classical Japanese, mostly before the advent of kana, and can be represented by the man&#x27;yōgana kanji 江. There was an archaic Hiragana () derived from the man&#x27;yōgana &quot;ye&quot; kanji 江, which is encoded into Unicode at code point U+1B001 (𛀁), but it is not widely supported. It is believed that &quot;e&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; first merged to &quot;ye&quot; before shifting back to &quot;e&quot; during the Edo period. As demonstrated by 17th century-era European sources, the syllable &quot;we&quot; (ゑ・ヱ ) also came to be pronounced as (&quot;ye&quot;). If necessary, the modern orthography allows [je] (&quot;ye&quot;) to be written as いぇ (イェ), but this usage is limited and nonstandard.
**The modern Katakana &quot;e&quot;, エ, derives from the man&#x27;yōgana 江, originally pronounced &quot;ye&quot;; a &quot;Katakana letter Archaic E&quot; () derived from the man&#x27;yōgana 衣 (&quot;e&quot;) is encoded into Unicode at code point U+1B000 (𛀀), due to being used for that purpose in scholarly works on classical Japanese.
**Some gojūon tables published during the 19th century list additional Katakana in the &quot;ye&quot; (), &quot;wu&quot; () and &quot;yi&quot; () positions. These are not presently used, and the latter two sounds never existed in Japanese. They were added to Unicode in version 14.0 in 2021. These sources also list (Unicode U+1B006, 𛀆) in the Hiragana &quot;yi&quot; position, and in the &quot;ye&quot; position.
*Although removed from the standard orthography with the &quot;gendai kanazukai&quot; reforms, &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; still see stylistic use, as in ウヰスキー for &quot;whisky&quot; and ヱビス or ゑびす for Japanese kami Ebisu, and Yebisu, a brand of beer named after Ebisu. Hiragana &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; are preserved in certain Okinawan scripts, while katakana &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; are preserved in the Ainu language.
*&quot;wo&quot; is preserved only as the accusative particle, normally occurring only in hiragana.
*&quot;si&quot;, &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;tu&quot;, &quot;hu&quot;, &quot;wi&quot;, &quot;we&quot; and &quot;wo&quot; are usually romanized respectively as &quot;shi&quot;, &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;tsu&quot;, &quot;fu&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; instead, according to contemporary pronunciation.
*the sokuon or small &quot;tsu&quot; (っ/ッ) indicates gemination and is romanized by repeating the following consonant. For example, って is romanized &quot;tte&quot; (exception: っち becomes &quot;tchi&quot;).

=== Diacritics ===

Syllables beginning with the voiced consonants [g], [z], [d] and [b] are spelled with kana from the corresponding unvoiced columns (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;h&quot;) and the voicing mark, &quot;dakuten&quot;. Syllables beginning with [p] are spelled with kana from the &quot;h&quot; column and the half-voicing mark, &quot;handakuten&quot;.
* Note that the か゚, ら゚ and the remaining entries in the two rightmost columns, though they exist, are not used in standard Japanese orthography.
*&quot;zi&quot;, &quot;di&quot;, and &quot;du&quot; are often transcribed into English as &quot;ji&quot;, &quot;ji&quot;, and &quot;zu&quot; instead, respectively, according to contemporary pronunciation.
* Usually, [va], [vi], [vu], [ve], [vo] are represented respectively by バ[ba], ビ[bi], ブ[bu], ベ[be], and ボ[bo], for example, in loanwords such as (&quot;baiorin&quot; &quot;violin&quot;), but (less usually) the distinction can be preserved by using [w-] with voicing marks or by using [wu] and a vowel kana, as in ヴァ(ヷ), ヴィ(ヸ), ヴ, ヴェ(ヹ), and ヴォ(ヺ). Note that ヴ did not have a JIS-encoded Hiragana form (ゔ) until JIS X 0213, meaning that many Shift JIS flavours (including the Windows and HTML5 version) can only represent it as a katakana, although Unicode supports both.

=== Digraphs ===
Syllables beginning with palatalized consonants are spelled with one of the seven consonantal kana from the &quot;i&quot; row followed by small &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;yu&quot; or &quot;yo&quot;. These digraphs are called yōon.
* There are no digraphs for the semivowel &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; columns.
* The digraphs are usually transcribed with three letters, leaving out the &quot;i&quot;: C&quot;y&quot;V. For example, きゃ is transcribed as &quot;kya&quot; to distinguish it from the two-kana きや, &quot;kiya&quot;.
* &quot;si&quot;+&quot;y&quot;* and &quot;ti&quot;+&quot;y&quot;* are often transcribed &quot;sh*&quot; and &quot;ch*&quot; instead of &quot;sy*&quot; and &quot;ty*&quot;. For example, しゃ is transcribed as &quot;sha&quot;, and ちゅ is transcribed as &quot;chu&quot;.
* In earlier Japanese, digraphs could also be formed with &quot;w&quot;-kana. Although obsolete in modern Japanese, the digraphs くゎ (/kʷa/) and くゐ/くうぃ(/kʷi/), are preserved in certain Okinawan orthographies. In addition, the kana え can be used in Okinawan to form the digraph くぇ, which represents the /kʷe/ sound.
* In loanwords, digraphs with a small &quot;e&quot;-kana can be formed. For example, キェ (or きぇ in hiragana), which is transcribed as &quot;kye&quot;.
* Note that the き゚ゃ, き゚ゅ and remaining entries in the rightmost column, though they exist, are not used in standard Japanese orthography.
* &quot;zi&quot;+&quot;y&quot;* and &quot;di&quot;+&quot;y&quot;* are often transcribed &quot;j*&quot; instead of &quot;zy*&quot; and &quot;dy*&quot;, according to contemporary pronunciation. The form &quot;jy*&quot; is also used in some cases.

== Modern usage ==
The difference in usage between hiragana and katakana is stylistic. Usually, hiragana is the default syllabary, and katakana is used in certain special cases. Hiragana is used to write native Japanese words with no kanji representation (or whose kanji is thought obscure or difficult), as well as grammatical elements such as particles and inflections (okurigana). Today katakana is most commonly used to write words of foreign origin that do not have kanji representations, as well as foreign personal and place names. Katakana is also used to represent onomatopoeia and interjections, emphasis, technical and scientific terms, transcriptions of the Sino-Japanese readings of kanji, and some corporate branding.

Kana can be written in small form above or next to lesser-known kanji in order to show pronunciation; this is called furigana. Furigana is used most widely in children&#x27;s or learners&#x27; books. Literature for young children who do not yet know kanji may dispense with it altogether and instead use hiragana combined with spaces.

Systems supporting only a limited set of characters, such as Wabun code for Morse code telegrams and single-byte digital character encodings such as JIS X 0201 or EBCDIK, likewise dispense with kanji, instead using only katakana. This is not necessary in systems supporting double-byte or variable-width encodings such as Shift JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8 or UTF-16.

== History ==
Old Japanese was written entirely in kanji, and a set of kanji called &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; were first used to represent the phonetic values of grammatical particles and morphemes. As there was no consistent method of sound representation, a phoneme could be represented by multiple kanji, and even those kana&#x27;s pronunciations differed in whether they were to be read as or , making decipherment problematic. The , a poetry anthology assembled sometime after 759 and the eponym of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;, exemplifies this phenomenon, where as many as almost twenty kanji were used for the mora &quot;ka&quot;. The consistency of the kana used was thus dependent on the style of the writer. Hiragana developed as a distinct script from cursive &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;, whereas katakana developed from abbreviated parts of regular script &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; as a glossing system to add readings or explanations to Buddhist sutras. Both of these systems were simplified to make writing easier. The shapes of many hiragana resembled the Chinese cursive script, as did those of many katakana the Korean &quot;gugyeol&quot;, suggesting that the Japanese followed the continental pattern of their neighbors.

Kana is traditionally said to have been invented by the Buddhist priest Kūkai in the ninth century. Kūkai certainly brought the Siddhaṃ script of India home on his return from China in 806; his interest in the sacred aspects of speech and writing led him to the conclusion that Japanese would be better represented by a phonetic alphabet than by the kanji which had been used up to that point. The modern arrangement of kana reflects that of Siddhaṃ, but the traditional &quot;iroha&quot; arrangement follows a poem which uses each kana once.

However, hiragana and katakana did not quickly supplant &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;. It was only in 1900 that the present set of kana was codified. All the other forms of hiragana and katakana developed before the 1900 codification are known as . Rules for their usage as per the spelling reforms of 1946, the , which abolished the kana for &quot;wi&quot; (ゐ・ヰ), &quot;we&quot; (ゑ・ヱ), and &quot;wo&quot; (を・ヲ) (except that the last was reserved as the accusative particle).

==Collation==
Kana are the basis for collation in Japanese. They are taken in the order given by the &quot;gojūon&quot; (あ い う え お ... わ を ん), though iroha (い ろ は に ほ へ と ... せ す (ん)) ordering is used for enumeration in some circumstances. Dictionaries differ in the sequence order for long/short vowel distinction, small &quot;tsu&quot; and diacritics. As Japanese does not use word spaces (except as a tool for children), there can be no word-by-word collation; all collation is kana-by-kana.

== In Unicode ==
The hiragana range in Unicode is U+3040 ... U+309F, and the katakana range is U+30A0 ... U+30FF. The obsolete and rare characters (&quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot;) also have their proper code points.

Characters U+3095 and U+3096 are hiragana small &quot;ka&quot; and small &quot;ke&quot;, respectively. U+30F5 and U+30F6 are their katakana equivalents. Characters U+3099 and U+309A are combining dakuten and handakuten, which correspond to the spacing characters U+309B and U+309C. U+309D is the hiragana iteration mark, used to repeat a previous hiragana. U+309E is the voiced hiragana iteration mark, which stands in for the previous hiragana but with the consonant voiced (&quot;k&quot; becomes &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot; becomes &quot;b&quot;, etc.). U+30FD and U+30FE are the katakana iteration marks. U+309F is a ligature of &quot;yori&quot; (より) sometimes used in vertical writing. U+30FF is a ligature of &quot;koto&quot; (コト), also found in vertical writing.

Additionally, there are halfwidth equivalents to the standard fullwidth katakana. These are encoded within the Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms block (U+FF00–U+FFEF), starting at U+FF65 and ending at U+FF9F (characters U+FF61–U+FF64 are halfwidth punctuation marks):
There is also a small &quot;Katakana Phonetic Extensions&quot; range (U+31F0 ... U+31FF), which includes some additional small kana characters for writing the Ainu language. Further small kana characters are present in the &quot;Small Kana Extension&quot; block.

Unicode also includes &quot;Katakana letter archaic E&quot; (U+1B000), as well as 255 archaic Hiragana, in the Kana Supplement block. It also includes a further 31 archaic Hiragana in the Kana Extended-A block.

The Kana Extended-B block was added in September, 2021 with the release of version 14.0:

<text>The Knights of the Lambda Calculus is a semi-fictional organization of expert Lisp and Scheme hackers. The name refers to the lambda calculus, a mathematical formalism invented by Alonzo Church, with which Lisp is intimately connected, and references the Knights Templar.

There is no actual organization that goes by the name &quot;Knights of the Lambda Calculus&quot;; it mostly only exists as a hacker culture in-joke. The concept most likely originated at MIT. For example, in the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs video lectures, Gerald Jay Sussman presents the audience with the button, saying they are now members of this special group. However, according to the Jargon File, a &quot;well-known LISPer&quot; has been known to give out buttons with Knights insignia on them, and some people have claimed to have membership in the Knights.

== In popular culture ==
A group that evolved from, or is similar to them, called &quot;The Knights of Eastern Calculus&quot;, makes a major appearance in the anime series &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, the logo of which is a reference to Freemasonry. References to MIT professors and other American computer scientists are prominent in Episode 9 of the series. At one point in the anime, Lain is seen with code displayed on her handheld device that appears to be Lisp.

<text>A knowbot is a kind of bot that collects information by automatically gathering certain specified information from web sites.

KNOWBOT is the acronym for Knowledge-Based Object Technology. This term, used as early as 1988 and known to have been implemented by December 1989 at the latest describes computer-based objects developed for collecting and storing specific information, to use that information to accomplish a particular task, and to enable sharing that information with other objects or processes. An early use of knowbots was to provide a computerized assistant to users to complete redundant detailed tasks without a need to train the user in computer technology.

<text>KornShell (codice_1) is a Unix shell which was developed by David Korn at Bell Labs in the early 1980s and announced at USENIX on July 14, 1983. The initial development was based on Bourne shell source code. Other early contributors were Bell Labs developers Mike Veach and Pat Sullivan, who wrote the Emacs and vi-style line editing modes&#x27; code, respectively. KornShell is backward-compatible with the Bourne shell and includes many features of the C shell, inspired by the requests of Bell Labs users.

==Features==
KornShell complies with POSIX.2, Shell and Utilities, Command Interpreter (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992.) Major differences between KornShell and the traditional Bourne shell include:
* job control, command aliasing, and command history designed after the corresponding C shell features; job control was added to the Bourne Shell in 1989
* a choice of three command line editing styles based on vi, Emacs, and Gosling Emacs
* associative arrays and built-in floating-point arithmetic operations (only available in the version of KornShell)
* dynamic search for functions
* mathematical functions
* process substitution and process redirection
* C-language-like expressions
* enhanced expression-oriented and loops
* dynamic extensibility of (dynamically loaded) built-in commands (since )
* reference variables
* hierarchically nested variables
* variables can have member functions associated with them
* object-oriented-programming (since )
** variables can be objects with member (sub-)variables and member methods
** object methods are called with the object variable name followed (after a dot character) by the method name
** special object methods are called on: object initialization or assignment, object abandonment ()
** composition and aggregation is available, as well as a form of inheritance

==History==

KornShell was originally proprietary software. In 2000 the source code was released under a license particular to AT&amp;T, but since the ksh93q release in early 2005 it has been licensed under the Eclipse Public License. KornShell is available as part of the AT&amp;T Software Technology (AST) Open Source Software Collection. As KornShell was initially only available through a proprietary license from AT&amp;T, a number of free and open source alternatives were created. These include , , Bash, and Z shell.

The functionality of the original KornShell, , was used as a basis for the standard POSIX.2, Shell and Utilities, Command Interpreter (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992).

Some vendors still ship their own versions of the older variant, sometimes with extensions. is maintained on GitHub.

As &quot;Desktop KornShell&quot; (), is distributed as part of the Common Desktop Environment. This version also provides shell-level mappings for Motif widgets. It was intended as a competitor to Tcl/Tk.

The original KornShell, , became the default shell on AIX in version 4, with ksh93 being available separately.

UnixWare 7 includes both and . The default Korn shell is , which is supplied as , and the older version is available as . UnixWare also includes when CDE is installed.

The ksh93 distribution underwent a less stable fate after the authors left AT&amp;T around 2012 at stable version ksh93u+. The primary authors continued working on a ksh93v- beta branch until around 2014. That work was eventually taken up primarily by Red Hat in 2017 (due to customer requests) and resulted in the eventual initial release of ksh2020 in the fall of 2019. That initial release (although fixing several prior stability issues) introduced breakage and compatibility issues. In March 2020, AT&amp;T decided to roll back the community changes, stash them in a branch, and restart from ksh93u+, as the changes were too broad and too ksh-focused for the company to absorb into a project in maintenance mode. ksh2020 was released as a &quot;major release for several reasons&quot; such as removal of EBCDIC support, dropping support for binary plugins written for ksh93u+ and removal of some broken math functions, but has never been maintained or supported by AT&amp;T (not even on its initial release date). The ksh2020 source code has received no commits since February 2020 and it was archived read only in October 2021.

Following the issues with the ksh2020 branch and its abandonment, a new repository was created in May 2020 for the ksh93u+m branch, based on the last stable AT&amp;T release (ksh93u+ 2012-08-01) where bugfix development actively continues.

==Primary contributions to the main software branch==
For the purposes of the lists below, the main software branch of KSH is defined as the original program, dating from July 1983, up and through the release of KSH2020 in late 2019.
Continuing development of follow-on versions (branches) of KSH have split into different groups starting in 2020 and are not elaborated on below.

==Variants==
There are several forks and clones of KornShell:
*  – a fork of included as part of CDE.
*  – a fork of that provides access to the Tk widget toolkit.
*  – a port of OpenBSD&#x27;s variant of KornShell, intended to be maximally portable across operating systems. It was used as the default shell in DeLi Linux 7.2.
*  – a Linux port of OpenBSD&#x27;s variant of KornShell, with minimal changes.
*  – a free implementation of the KornShell language, forked from OpenBSD . It was originally developed for MirOS BSD and is licensed under permissive (though not public domain) terms; specifically, the MirOS Licence. In addition to its usage on BSD, this variant has replaced on Debian, and is the default shell on Android.
*  – an AmigaOS variant that provides several Amiga-specific features, such as ARexx interoperability. In this tradition MorphOS uses in its SDK.
* MKS Inc.&#x27;s MKS Korn shell – a proprietary implementation of the KornShell language from Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) up to version 2.0; according to David Korn, the MKS Korn shell was not fully compatible with KornShell in 1998. In SFU version 3.0 Microsoft replaced the MKS Korn shell with a new POSIX.2-compliant shell as part of Interix.
* KornShell is included in UWIN, a Unix compatibility package by David Korn.
* in Doug Gwyn&#x27;s (US Army BRL) System V on BSD package included Ron Natalie&#x27;s version of the SVR2 that had both job control and command line editing. This was a contemporary of the original at a time when it had not escaped AT&amp;T. This was subsequently the that shipped with all the CMU Mach-derived systems.

<doc id="17214" wikidata="Q151948" url="?curid=17214" title="Kilt">
<text>A kilt ( ) is a garment resembling a wrap-around knee-length skirt, made of twill-woven worsted wool with heavy pleats at the sides and back and traditionally a tartan pattern. Originating in the Scottish Highland dress for men, it is first recorded in the 16th century as the great kilt, a full-length garment whose upper half could be worn as a cloak. The small kilt or &quot;modern kilt&quot; emerged in the 18th century, and is essentially the bottom half of the great kilt. Since the 19th century, it has become associated with the wider culture of Scotland, and more broadly with Gaelic or Celtic heritage. 

Although the kilt is most often worn by men on formal occasions and at Highland games and other sports events, it has also been adapted as an item of informal male clothing, returning to its roots as an everyday garment. Kilts are now made for casual wear in a variety of materials. Alternative fastenings may be used and pockets inserted to avoid the need for a sporran. Kilts have also been adopted as female wear for some sports.

== History ==
The kilt first appeared as the great kilt, the &#x27; or belted plaid, during the 16th century. The &#x27; or great kilt was a full-length garment whose upper half could be worn as a cloak draped over the shoulder, or brought up over the head. A version of the &quot;&quot; (philibeg), or small kilt (also known as the walking kilt), similar to the modern kilt was invented by an English Quaker from Lancashire named Thomas Rawlinson some time in the 1720s. He felt that the belted plaid was &quot;cumbrous and unwieldy&quot;, and his solution was to separate the skirt and convert it into a distinct garment with pleats already sewn, which he himself began making. His associate, Iain MacDonnell, chief of the MacDonnells of Inverness, also began making it, and when clansmen employed in logging, charcoal manufacture and iron smelting saw their chief making the new apparel, they soon followed making the kilt. From there its making use spread &quot;in the shortest space&quot; amongst the Highlanders, and even amongst some of the Northern Lowlanders. It has been suggested there is evidence that the philibeg with unsewn pleats was made from the 1690s.

== Variants ==

The name &quot;kilt&quot; is applied to a range of garments:

* The traditional garment, either in its historical form, or in the modern adaptation now usual in Scotland (&quot;see History of the kilt&quot;), usually in a tartan pattern
* The kilts worn by Irish pipe bands are based on the traditional Scottish garment but now in a single (solid) colour
* Variants of the Scottish kilt adopted in other Celtic nations, such as the Welsh &quot;cilt&quot; and the Cornish &quot;cilt&quot;

According to the &quot;Dictionary of the Scots Language&quot; and &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the noun derives from a verb &quot;to kilt&quot;, originally meaning &quot;to gird up; to tuck up (the skirts) round the body&quot;, which is apparently of Scandinavian origin.

=== Scotland ===

Organisations that sanction and grade the competitions in Highland dancing and piping all have rules governing acceptable attire for the competitors. These rules specify that kilts are to be worn (except that in the national dances, the female competitors will be wearing the Aboyne dress).

==== Design and construction ====

The Scottish kilt displays uniqueness of design, construction, and convention which differentiate it from other garments fitting the general description. It is a tailored garment that is wrapped around the wearer&#x27;s body at the natural waist (between the lowest rib and the hip) starting from one side (usually the wearer&#x27;s left), around the front and back and across the front again to the opposite side. The fastenings consist of straps and buckles on both ends, the strap on the inside end usually passing through a slit in the waistband to be buckled on the outside; alternatively it may remain inside the waistband and be buckled inside.

A kilt covers the body from the waist down to the centre of the knees. The overlapping layers in front are called &quot;aprons&quot; and are flat; the single layer of fabric around the sides and back is pleated. A kilt pin may be fastened to the front apron on the free corner (but is not passed through the layer below, as its function is to add weight). Underwear may or may not be worn, as the wearer prefers, although tradition has it that a &quot;true Scotsman&quot; should wear nothing under his kilt. The Scottish Tartans Authority, however, warns that in some circumstances the practice could be &quot;childish and unhygienic&quot; and flying &quot;in the face of decency&quot;.

==== Fabrics ====

The typical kilt as seen at modern Highland games events is made of twill woven worsted wool. The twill weave used for kilts is a &quot;2–2 type&quot;, meaning that each weft thread passes over and under two warp threads at a time. The result is a distinctive diagonal-weave pattern in the fabric which is called the twill line. This kind of twill, when woven according to a given sett or written colour pattern &quot;(see below)&quot; is called tartan. In contrast kilts worn by Irish pipers are made from solid-colour cloth, with saffron or green being the most widely used colours.

Kilting fabric weights are given in ounces per yard and run from the very-heavy, regimental worsted of approximately down to a light worsted of about . The most common weights for kilts are and . The heavier weights are more appropriate for cooler weather, while the lighter weights would tend to be selected for warmer weather or for active use, such as Highland dancing. Some patterns are available in only a few weights.

A modern kilt for a typical adult uses about 6–8 yards of single-width (about 26–30 inches) or about 3–4 yards of double-width (about 54–60 inches) tartan fabric. Double-width fabric is woven so that the pattern exactly matches on the selvage. Kilts are usually made without a hem because a hem would make the garment too bulky and cause it to hang incorrectly. The exact amount of fabric needed depends upon several factors including the size of the sett, the number of pleats put into the garment, and the size of the person. For a full kilt, 8 yards of fabric would be used regardless of size and the number of pleats and depth of pleat would be adjusted according to their size. For a very large waist, it may be necessary to use 9 yards of cloth.

==== Setts ====
One of the most-distinctive features of the authentic Scots kilt is the tartan pattern, the &quot;sett&quot;, it exhibits. The association of particular patterns with individual clans and families can be traced back perhaps one or two centuries. It was only in the 19th-century Victorian era that the system of named tartans known today began to be systematically recorded and formalised, mostly by weaving companies for mercantile purposes. Up until this point, Highland tartans held regional associations rather than being identified with any particular clan.

Today there are also tartans for districts, counties, societies and corporations. There are also setts for states and provinces; schools and universities; sporting activities; individuals; and commemorative and simple generic patterns that anybody can wear (see History of the kilt for the process by which these associations came about).

Setts are always arranged horizontally and vertically, never diagonally (except when adapted for women&#x27;s skirts). They are specified by their thread counts, the sequence of colours and their units of width. As an example, the Wallace tartan has a thread count given as &quot;K/4 R32 K32 Y/4&quot; (K is black, R is red, and Y is yellow). This means that 4 units of black thread will be succeeded by 32 units of red, etc., in both the warp and the weft. Typically, the units are the actual number of threads, but as long as the proportions are maintained, the resulting pattern will be the same. This thread count also includes a pivot point indicated by the slash between the colour and thread number. The weaver is supposed to reverse the weaving sequence at the pivot point to create a mirror image of the pattern. This is called a symmetrical tartan. Some tartans, like Buchanan, are asymmetrical, which means they do not have a pivot point. The weaver weaves the sequence all the way through and then starts at the beginning again for the next sett.

Setts are further characterised by their size, the number of inches (or centimetres) in one full repeat. The size of a given sett depends on not only the number of threads in the repeat but also the weight of the fabric. This is because the heavier the fabric, the thicker the threads will be, and thus the same number of threads of a heavier-weight fabric will occupy more space. The colours given in the thread count are specified as in heraldry, although tartan patterns are not heraldic. The exact shade which is used is a matter of artistic freedom and will vary from one fabric mill to another as well as in dye lot to another within the same mill.

Tartans are commercially woven in four standard colour variations that describe the overall tone. &quot;Ancient&quot; or &quot;Old&quot; colours may be characterised by a slightly faded look intended to resemble the vegetable dyes that were once used, although in some cases &quot;Old&quot; simply identifies a tartan that was in use before the current one. Ancient greens and blues are lighter while reds appear orange. &quot;Modern&quot; colours are bright and show off modern aniline dyeing methods. The colours are bright red, dark hunter green, and usually navy blue. &quot;Weathered&quot; or &quot;Reproduction&quot; colours simulate the look of older cloth weathered by the elements. Greens turn to light brown, blues become grey, and reds are a deeper wine colour. The last colour variation is &quot;Muted&quot; which tends toward earth tones. The greens are olive, blues are slate blue, and red is an even deeper wine colour. This means that of the approximately 3500 registered tartans available in the Scottish Tartans Authority database as of 2004 there are four possible colour variations for each, resulting in around 14,000 recognised tartan choices.

Setts were registered until 2008, with the &quot;International Tartan Index&quot; (&quot;ITI&quot;) of the charitable organisation Scottish Tartans Authority (STA), which maintained a collection of fabric samples characterised by name and thread count, for free, which had its register, combined with others to form the &quot;Scottish Register of Tartans&quot; (&quot;SRT&quot;) of the statutory body the National Archives of Scotland (NAS), if the tartan meets SRT&#x27;s criteria, for £70 as of 2010. Although many tartans are added every year, most of the registered patterns available today were created in the 19th century onward by commercial weavers who worked with a large variety of colours. The rise of Highland romanticism and the growing Anglicisation of Scottish culture by the Victorians at the time led to registering tartans with clan names. Before that, most of these patterns were more connected to geographical regions than to any clan. There is therefore nothing symbolic about the colours, and nothing about the patterns is a reflection of the status of the wearer.

==== Measurements ====
Although ready-to-wear kilts can be obtained in standard sizes, a custom kilt is tailored to the individual proportions of the wearer. At least three measurements, the waist, hips, and length of the kilt, are usually required. Sometimes the rise (distance above the waist) or the fell (distance from waistline to the widest part of the hips) is also required.

A properly made kilt, when buckled on the tightest holes of the straps, is not so loose that the wearer can easily twist the kilt around their body, nor so tight that it causes &quot;scalloping&quot; of the fabric where it is buckled. Additionally, the length of the kilt when buckled at the waist reaches a point no lower than halfway across the kneecap and no higher than about an inch above it.

==== Pleating and stitching ====

A kilt can be pleated with either box or knife pleats. A knife pleat is a simple fold, while the box pleat is bulkier, consisting of two knife pleats back-to-back. Knife pleats are the most common in modern civilian kilts. Regimental traditions vary. The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders use box pleats, while the Black Watch make their kilts of the same tartan with knife pleats. These traditions were also passed on to affiliated regiments in the Commonwealth, and were retained in successor battalions to these regiments in the amalgamated Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Pleats can be arranged relative to the pattern in two ways. In &quot;pleating to the stripe&quot;, one of the vertical stripes in the tartan is selected and the fabric is then folded so that this stripe runs down the center of each pleat. The result is that along the pleated section of the kilt (the back and sides) the pattern appears different from the unpleated front, often emphasising the horizontal bands rather than creating a balance between horizontal and vertical. This is often called military pleating because it is the style adopted by many military regiments. It is also widely used by pipe bands.

In &quot;pleating to the sett&quot;, the fabric is folded so that the pattern of the sett is maintained and is repeated all around the kilt. This is done by taking up one full sett in each pleat, or two full setts if they are small. This causes the pleated sections to have the same pattern as the unpleated front.

Any pleat is characterised by depth and width. The portion of the pleat that protrudes under the overlying pleat is the size or width. The pleat width is selected based on the size of the sett and the amount of fabric to be used in constructing the kilt, and will generally vary from about 1/2&quot; to about 3/4&quot;.

The depth is the part of the pleat which is folded under the overlying pleat. It depends solely on the size of the tartan sett even when pleating to the stripe, since the sett determines the spacing of the stripes.

The number of pleats used in making kilts depends upon how much material is to be used in constructing the garment and upon the size of the sett.

The pleats across the fell are tapered slightly since the wearer&#x27;s waist is usually narrower than the hips and the pleats are usually stitched down either by machine or by hand.

In Highland dancing, it is easy to see the effect of the stitching on the action of a kilt. The kilt hugs the dancer&#x27;s body from the waist down to the hipline and, from there, in response to the dancer&#x27;s movements, it breaks sharply out. The way the kilt moves in response to the dance steps is an important part of the dance. If the pleats were not stitched down in this portion of the kilt, the action, or movement, would be quite different. Kilts made for Highland dancing are typically pleated to the sett, as opposed to the stripe. 

==== Accessories ====


The Scottish kilt is usually worn with kilt hose (woollen socks), turned down at the knee, often with garters and flashes, and a (Gaelic for &quot;purse&quot;: a type of pouch), which hangs around the waist from a chain or leather strap. This may be plain or embossed leather, or decorated with sealskin, fur, or polished metal plating.

Other common accessories, depending on the formality of the context, include:

* A belt (usually with embossed buckle)
* A jacket (of various traditional designs)
* A kilt pin
* A (Gaelic: &quot;black knife&quot;: a small sheathed knife worn in the top of the hose)
* Ghillie brogues
* Occasionally worn with a ghillie shirt, although this is more casual and, being a relatively modern invention, should not be confused with actual historic garments.

==== Styles of kilt wear ====
Today most Scottish people regard kilts as formal dress or national dress. Although there are still a few people who wear a kilt daily, it is generally owned or hired to be worn at weddings or other formal occasions and may be worn by anyone regardless of nationality or descent. For semi-formal wear, kilts are usually worn with a Prince Charlie coatee (worn with a black bow tie) or an Argyll jacket (worn with a black bow tie or a regular necktie). Full formal is white-tie and calls for a more formal coat, such as the Sherrifmuir doublet or regulation doublet. Irish formal dress is distinguished from Highland dress by the Brian Boru jacket, a modified Prince Charlie with a shawl collar, chain closure and round buttons. In all these cases, the coats are worn with an accompanying waistcoat (vest).

Kilts are also used for parades by groups such as the Boys&#x27; Brigade and Scouts, and in many places kilts are seen in force at Highland games and pipe band championships as well as being worn at Scottish country dances and ceilidhs.

Certain regiments and other units of the British Army and armies of other Commonwealth nations (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa) with a Scottish heritage still continue to wear kilts as part of dress or duty uniform, though they have not been used in combat since 1940 Uniforms in which kilts are worn include ceremonial dress, service dress, and barracks dress. Kilts are considered appropriate for ceremonial and less formal parades, office duties, walking out, mess dinners, classroom instruction, and band practice. Ceremonial kilts have also been developed for the US Marine Corps, and the pipe and drum bands of the US Military Academy, US Naval Academy, and Norwich University (the military college of Vermont).

It is not uncommon to see kilts worn at Irish pubs in the United States, and it is becoming somewhat less rare to see them in the workplace. Casual use of kilts dressed down with lace-up boots or moccasins, and with T-shirts or golf shirts, is becoming increasingly familiar at Highland games. The kilt is associated with a sense of Scottish national pride and will often be seen being worn, along with a football top, when members of the Tartan Army are watching a football or rugby match. The small sgian-dubh knife is sometimes replaced by a wooden or plastic alternative or omitted altogether for security concerns; for example, it typically is not allowed to be worn or carried onto a commercial aircraft.

=== Ireland ===
Though the origins of the Irish kilt continue to be a subject of debate, current evidence suggests that kilts originated in the Scottish Highlands and Isles and were worn by Irish nationalists from at least 1850s onwards and then cemented from the early 1900s as a symbol of Gaelic identity.

A garment that has often been mistaken for kilts in early depictions is the Irish (&#x27;saffron shirt&#x27;), a long tunic traditionally made from yellow cloth, but also found in other solid colours (e.g. black, green, red, or brown), or striped. Solid-coloured kilts were first adopted for use by Irish nationalists and thereafter by Irish regiments serving in the British Army, but they could often be seen in late 19th and early 20th century photos in Ireland especially at political and musical gatherings, as the kilt was re-adopted as a symbol of Gaelic nationalism in Ireland during this period. Tartan was rarer in Irish kilts, as it was more expensive to manufacture. For the most part it was usually only used for sashes, trews and shawls. Wealthy Irish such as the Gaelic chieftains and high-ranking soldiers could afford tartan kilts.

Within the world of Irish dancing, boys&#x27; kilts have been largely abandoned, especially since the worldwide popularity of Riverdance and the revival and interest in Irish dancing generally.

The Irish still wear kilts but they are largely restricted to formal events and weddings. Irish marching bands often dress in kilts as well.

=== Other Celtic nations ===

Although not a traditional component of national dress outside Scotland or Ireland, kilts have become recently popular in the other Celtic nations as a sign of Celtic identity. Kilts and tartans can therefore also be seen in Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, Brittany and Galicia. Although not considered a Celtic region, Northumbrian kilts in border tartan have also been adopted.

There are currently sixteen Breton tartans officially recorded in the Scottish tartan registries. The Breton tartans are: Brittany National (Breton National), Brittany Walking, Lead it Of, and a further nine county tartans (Kerne, Leon, Tregor, Gwened, Dol, St. Malo, Rennes, Nantes, St. Brieuc). Others have been recently created for smaller areas in Brittany (Ushent, Bro Vigoudenn and Menez Du &quot;Black Mountain&quot;).

There are three Galician tartans recorded in the Scottish registries: Galicia, &quot;Gallaecia – Galician National&quot;, and Bombeiros Voluntarios De Galicia. There is historical evidence of the use of tartan and kilt in Galicia up to the 18th century.

Kilts are also traditionally worn by some people in Austria, especially in Carinthia and Upper Austria, due to their Celtic heritage.

=== Contemporary designs ===
Kilts and other male skirts in general were relaunched as a trend during the 1980s. Stephen Sprouse introduced a black denim mini-skirt over black denim jeans in 1983. Then in 1984, Jean Paul Gaultier made waves in the fashion industry when he reintroduced mini skirts and kilts for men.

Starting in the late 1990s, contemporary kilts (also known as modern kilts, fashion kilts, and, especially in the United States, utility kilts) have appeared in the clothing marketplace in Scotland, the US, and Canada in a range of fabrics, including leather, denim, corduroy, and cotton. They may be designed for formal or casual dress, for use in sports or outdoor recreation, or as white or blue collar workwear. Some are closely modelled on traditional Scottish kilts, but others are similar only in being knee-length skirt-like garments for men. They may have box pleats, symmetrical knife pleats and be fastened by studs or velcro instead of buckles. Many are designed to be worn without a sporran, and may have pockets or tool belts attached.

In Canada, kilts are widely common as part of female dress at schools with a uniform policy. As well, due to the rich Scottish heritage of the country, they may frequently be seen at weddings and formal events. In Nova Scotia, they may even be worn as common daily attire.

In 2008, a USPS letter carrier, Dean Peterson, made a formal proposal that the kilt be approved as an acceptable postal uniform—for reasons of comfort. The proposal was defeated at the convention of the 220,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers in 2008 by a large margin.

5.11 Tactical produced a &quot;tactical duty kilt&quot; as an April Fools&#x27; joke but has continued producing it. The contemporary hybrid kilts are made up of tartan-woven fabric material.

Female athletes, especially lacrosse and field hockey players, often wear lacrosse kilts, a simple form of contemporary kilt. They will typically wear compression shorts or spandex underneath. Such kilts are popular among many levels of lacrosse, from youth leagues to college leagues, although some teams are replacing the kilt with the more streamlined athletic skirt.

Men&#x27;s kilts are often seen in popular contemporary media. For example, in the Syfy series &quot;Tin Man&quot;, side characters are shown wearing kilts as peasant working clothes. Trends in everyday fashion, especially in the Gothic subculture, have led to a popularisation of the kilt as an alternative to more conventional menswear. Some of these are made of PVC or cotton-polyester blends.

<text>The Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language, or KQML, is a language
and protocol for communication among software agents and knowledge-based systems. It was
developed in the early 1990s as part of the DARPA knowledge Sharing Effort, which was aimed at developing techniques for building large-scale knowledge bases which are 
share-able and re-usable. While originally conceived of as an interface to knowledge based systems, it was soon repurposed as an Agent communication language.

Work on KQML was led by Tim Finin of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Jay Weber of EITech and involved contributions from many researchers.

The KQML message format and protocol can be used to interact with an intelligent system, either by an application program, or by another intelligent system. KQML&#x27;s &quot;performatives&quot; are operations that agents perform on each other&#x27;s knowledge and goal stores. Higher-level interactions such as contract nets and negotiation are built using these. KQML&#x27;s &quot;communication facilitators&quot; coordinate the interactions of other agents to support knowledge sharing. 

Experimental prototype systems support concurrent engineering, intelligent design, intelligent planning, and scheduling.

KQML is superseded by FIPA-ACL.
