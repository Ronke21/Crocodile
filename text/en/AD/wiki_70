<text>Longships were a type of specialised Scandinavian warships that have a long history in Scandinavia, with their existence being archaeologically proven and documented from at least the fourth century BC. Originally invented and used by the Norsemen (commonly known as the Vikings) for commerce, exploration, and warfare during the Viking Age, many of the longship&#x27;s characteristics were adopted by other cultures, like Anglo-Saxons, and continued to influence shipbuilding for centuries.

The longship&#x27;s design evolved over many centuries, and continued up until the sixth century with clinker-built ships like Nydam. The character and appearance of these ships have been reflected in Scandinavian boatbuilding traditions to the present day. The particular skills and methods employed in making longships are still used worldwide, often with modern adaptations. They were all made out of wood, with cloth sails (woven wool), and had several details and carvings on the hull.

==Characteristics==
The longships were characterized as graceful, long, narrow, and light, with a shallow-draft hull designed for speed. The ship&#x27;s shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one meter deep and permitted arbitrary beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages or used bottom-up for shelter in camps. Longships were fitted with oars along almost the entire length of the boat itself. Later versions had a rectangular sail on a single mast, which was used to replace or augment the effort of the rowers, particularly during long journeys. The average speed of Viking ships varied from ship to ship, but lay in the range of and the maximum speed of a longship under favorable conditions was around . The Viking Ship museum in Oslo houses the remains of three such ships, the Oseberg, the Gokstad and the Tune ship.

==History==
The Viking longships were powerful naval weapons in their time and were highly valued possessions. Archaeological finds show that the Viking ships were not standardized. Ships varied from designer to designer and place to place and often had regional characteristics. For example, the choice of material was mostly dictated by the regional forests, such as pine from Norway and Sweden, and oak from Denmark. Moreover, each Viking longship had particular features adjusted to the natural conditions under which it was sailed.

They were owned by coastal farmers, and under the leidang system, every section in the king&#x27;s realm was required to build warships and to provide men to crew them, allowing the king to quickly assemble a large and powerful war fleet. While longships were used by the Norse in warfare, they were mostly used as troop transports, not warships. Their main purpose was to swiftly carry as many warriors as possible to a scene of conflict. In the tenth century, longships would sometimes be tied together in offshore battles to form a steady platform for infantry warfare. During the ninth-century peak of the Viking expansion, large fleets set out to attack the degrading Frankish empire by attacking navigable rivers such as the Rhine, the Seine, the Loire and others. Rouen was sacked in 841, the year after the death of Louis the Pious, a son of Charlemagne. Quentovic, near modern Étaples, was attacked in 842 and 600 Danish ships attacked Hamburg in 845. In the same year, 129 ships returned to attack the Seine. They were called &quot;dragon ships&quot; by enemies such as the English because some had a dragon-shaped decoration atop the bow beam. The Norse had a strong sense of naval architecture, and during the early medieval period, they were advanced for their time.

==Types of longships==
Longships can be classified into a number of different types, depending on size, construction details, and prestige. The most common way to classify longships is by the number of rowing positions on board.

===Karvi===
The Karvi (or &quot;Karve&quot;) is the smallest vessel that is considered a longship. According to the tenth-century Gulating Law, a ship with 13 rowing benches is the smallest ship suitable for military use. A ship with 6 to 16 benches would be classified as a Karvi. These ships were considered to be &quot;general purpose&quot; ships, mainly used for fishing and trade, but occasionally commissioned for military use. While most longships held a length to width ratio of 7:1, the Karvi ships were closer to 9:2. 
The Gokstad Ship is a famous Karvi ship, built around the end of the ninth century, excavated in 1880 by Nicolay Nicolaysen. It was approximately long with 16 rowing positions.

===Snekkja===

The &quot;&quot; (or &quot;snekke&quot;) was typically the smallest longship used in warfare and was classified as a ship with at least 20 rowing benches. A typical snekkja might have a length of , a width of , and a draught of only . It would carry a crew of around 41 men (40 oarsmen and one cox).

The snekkja was one of the most common types of ships. According to Viking lore, Canute the Great used 1,200 in Norway in 1028.

The Norwegian type snekkja typically had more draught than the Danish ships designed for low coasts and beaches. A snekkja was so light that it had no need of ports it could simply be beached, and even carried across a portage.

The snekkja continued to evolve after the end of the Viking age, with later Norwegian examples becoming larger and heavier than Viking age ships. A modern version is still being used in Scandinavia, and is now called &quot;snipa&quot; in Swedish and &quot;snekke&quot; in Norwegian.

===Skeid===

&quot;Skeid&quot; (&quot;skeið&quot;), meaning &#x27;slider&#x27; (referring to a sley, a weavers reed, or to a sheath that a knife slides into) and probably connoting &#x27;speeder&#x27; (referring to a running race) (Zoega, Old Icelandic Dictionary). These ships were larger warships, consisting of more than 30 rowing benches. Ships of this classification are some of the largest (see Busse) longships ever discovered. A group of these ships were discovered by Danish archaeologists in Roskilde during development in the harbour-area in 1962 and 1996–97. The ship discovered in 1962, &quot;Skuldelev 2&quot; is an oak-built Skeid longship. It is believed to have been built in the Dublin area around 1042. &quot;Skuldelev 2&quot; could carry a crew of some 70–80 and measures just less than in length. They had around 30 rowing chairs. In 1996–97 archaeologists discovered the remains of another ship in the harbour. This ship, called the &quot;Roskilde 6&quot;, at is the longest Viking ship ever discovered and has been dated to around 1025. &quot;Skuldelev 2&quot; was replicated as &quot;Seastallion from Glendalough&quot; at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde and launched in 2004. In 2012, a long skeid longship named &quot;Draken Harald Hårfagre&quot; was launched in Norway. It was built from scratch by experts, using original Viking and experimental archaeological methods.

===Dreki===
&quot;Dreki&quot; (singular, meaning &#x27;dragon&#x27;), was used for ships with thirty rowing benches and upwards that are only known from historical sources, such as the 13th-century &quot;Göngu-Hrólfs saga&quot;. Here, the ships are described as most unusual, elegant, ornately decorated, and used by those who went raiding and plundering. These ships were likely skeids that differed only in the carvings of menacing beasts, such as dragons and snakes, carried on the prow of the ship. Judith Jesch, an expert in runic inscriptions, says, &quot;The word &quot;dreki&quot; for a ship derives from this practice of placing carved dragonheads on ships... but there is no evidence that it was a technical term for any particular kind of ship.&quot;

The earliest mentioned dreki was the ship of unstated size owned by Harald Fairhair in the tenth century. The first dreki ship whose size was mentioned in the source was Olav Tryggvason&#x27;s thirty-room Tranin, built at Nidaros circa 995. By far the most famous in this period was his later ship the Ormrinn Langi (&#x27;Long Serpent&#x27;) of thirty-four rooms, built over the winter of 999 to 1000. No true dragon ship, as described in the sagas, has been found by archaeological excavation.

The city seal of Bergen, Norway, created in 1299, depicts a ship with a dragon&#x27;s head at either end, which might be intended to represent a dreki ship.

==Construction==
The first longships can trace their origin back to between 500 and 300 BC, when the Danish Hjortspring boat was built. It was fastened with cord, not nailed, and paddled, not rowed. It had rounded cross sections and although long was only wide. The rounded sections gave maximum displacement for the lowest wetted surface area, similar to a modern narrow rowing skiff, so were very fast but had little carrying capacity. The shape suggests mainly river use. Unlike later boats, it had a low bow and stern. A distinctive feature is the two-prong cutaway bow section.
The earliest rowed true longship that has been found is the Nydam ship, built in Denmark around 350 AD. It also had very rounded underwater sections but had more pronounced flare in the topsides, giving it more stability as well as keeping more water out of the boat at speed or in waves. It had no sail. It was of lapstrake construction fastened with iron nails. The bow and stern had slight elevation. The keel was a flattened plank about twice as thick as a normal strake plank but still not strong enough to withstand the downwards thrust of a mast.

Sails started to be used from possibly the eighth century. The earliest had either plaited or chequered pattern, with narrow strips sewn together.

In the late eighth century, the Kvalsund ship was built. It is the first with a true keel. Its cross sectional shape was flatter on the bottom with less flare to the topsides. This shape is far more stable and able to handle rougher seas. It had the high prow of the later longships. After several centuries of evolution, the fully developed longship emerged some time in the middle of the ninth century. Its long, graceful, menacing head figure carved in the stern, such as the Oseburg ship, echoed the designs of its predecessors. The mast was now square in section and located toward the middle of the ship, and could be lowered and raised. The hull&#x27;s sides were fastened together to allow it to flex with the waves, combining lightness and ease of handling on land. The ships were large enough to carry cargo and passengers on long ocean voyages, but still maintained speed and agility, making the longship a versatile warship and cargo carrier.

===Keel, stems and hull===

The Viking shipbuilders had no written diagrams or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder pictured the longship before its construction, based on previous builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel was made up of several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes—the lines of planks joined endwise from stem to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about . The planks were riven (radially hewn) so that the grain is approximately at right angles to the surface of the plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the &quot;meginhufr&quot;, was about thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. Amidships, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.

As the planks reached the desired height, the interior frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, which is an enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about . Part of the reason for this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about of iron nails in a long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard () of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, trunnels) were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.

The longship&#x27;s narrow deep keel provided strength beneath the waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was amidships, tapering in width at the bow and stern. Sometimes there was a false outer keel to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened to the top of the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. Evidence of small scale domestic tar production dates from between 100 AD and 400 AD. Larger industrial scale tar pits, estimated to be capable of producing up to of tar in a single firing have been dated to between 680 AD and 900 AD. A drain plug hole about was drilled in the garboard plank on one side to allow rain water drainage.

The oars did not use rowlocks or thole pins but holes cut below the gunwale line. To keep seawater out, these oar holes were sealed with wooden disks from the inside, when the oars were not in use. The holes were also used for belaying mooring lines and sail sheets. At the bow the forward upper futtock protruded about above the sheerline and was carved to retain anchor or mooring lines.

===Timber===
Analysis of timber samples from Viking long boats shows that a variety of timbers were used, but there was strong preference for oak, a tree associated with Thor in Viking mythology. Oak is a heavy, durable timber that can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (wet/unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Other timber used were ash, elm, pine, spruce and larch. Spruce is light and seems to have been more common in later designs for internal hull battens (stringers). Although it is used for spars in modern times there is as yet no evidence the Vikings used spruce for masts. All timber was used unseasoned. The bark was removed by a bark spade. This consisted of a wooden handle with a T crossbar at the upper end, fitted with a broad chisel-like cutting edge of iron. The cutting edge was wide and long with a neck where the handle was inserted. It appears that in cold winters wood work stopped and partly completed timber work was buried in mud to prevent it drying out. Timber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a side axe. Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, drawknives, planes and saws. Iron saws were probably very rare. The Domesday Book in England (1086 AD) records only 13 saws. Possibly these were pit saws and it is uncertain if they were used in longship construction.

===Sail and mast===
Even though no longship sail has been found, accounts and depictions verify that longships had square sails. Sails measured perhaps across, and were made of rough wool cloth. Unlike in knarrs, a longship sail was not stitched.

The sail was held in place by the mast which was up to tall. Its base was about . The mast was supported by a large wooden maststep called a &quot;kerling&quot; (&quot;old woman&quot; in Old Norse) that was semicircular in shape. (Trent) The kerling was made of oak, and about wide and up to long in the larger ships. It usually heavily tapered into a joint with the internal keelson, although keelsons were by no means universal. The kerling lay across two strong frames that ran width-wise above the keel in the centre of the boat. The kerling also had a companion: the &quot;mast fish&quot;, a wooden timber above the kerling just below deck height that provided extra help in keeping the mast erect. It was a large wooden baulk of timber about long with a slot, facing aft to accommodate the mast as it was raised. This acted as a mechanism to catch and secure the mast before the stays were secured. It was an early form of mast partner but was aligned fore and aft. In later longships there is no mast fish—the mast partner is an athwartwise beam similar to more modern construction. Most masts were about half the length of the ship so that it did not project beyond the hull when unstepped. When lowered the mast foot was kept in the base of the mast step and the top of the mast secured in a natural wooden crook about high, on the port side, so that it did not interfere with steering on the starboard side.

There is a suggestion that the rig was sometimes used in a lateen style with the top cross spar dipped at an angle to aid sailing to windward i.e. the spar became the luff. There is little or no evidence to support this theory. No explanation is offered as to how this could be accomplished with a square sail as the lower reefed portion of the sail would be very bulky and would prevent even an approximation of the laminar flow necessary for windward sailing. There is no evidence of any triangular sails in use. Masts were held erect by side stays and possibly fore and aft stays. Each side stay was fitted at its lower end with a toggle. There were no chain plates. The lower part of the side stay consisted of ropes looped under the end of a knee of upper futtock which had a hole underneath. The lower part of the stay was about long and attached to a combined flat wooden turnblock and multi V jamb cleat called an angel (maiden, virgin). About four turns of rope went between the angel and the toggle to give the mechanical advantage to tighten the side stays. At each turn the v-shape at the bottom of the angel&#x27;s &quot;wings&quot; jambed the stay, preventing slippage and movement.

===Rudder===
Early long boats used some form of steering oar but by the tenth century the side rudder (called a steerboard, the source for the etymology for the word starboard itself) was well established. It consisted of a length of timber about long. The upper section was rounded to a diameter of about . The lower blade was about . The steerboard on the Gokstad ship in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo, Norway, is about wide, completely flat inboard and with about a maximum width at the center of the foil. The head of the rudder shaft had two square holes about apart. When the rudder was in its normal position the tiller was inserted in the upper hole so that the tiller faced athwartwise. The shaft was attached to the gunwale by a U-shaped joint. Near the stern, about halfway down the starboard topsides, was a rounded wooden block about in diameter and high, with a central hole for a rope. This corresponded to a hole in the midsection of the rudder blade. From the outside the rope ran through the blade, through the round block and topsides and was fastened inside the hull. The flexibility of the hemp rope allowed the blade to pivot. When beached or in shallow water the tiller was moved to the lower hole, the blade rope was slackened and the rudder head pulled up so the rudder could operate in shallow waters. Modern facsimiles are reported to steer quite well but require a very large amount of physical effort compared to the modern fore and aft tiller.

===Anchors===
Longships for the most part used two different kinds of anchors. The most common was a natural wood yoke formed from a tree branch. The weight was supplied by a stone passing laterally through the U of the yoke. The top of the yoke was closed by either a length of hardwood or a curved iron head, which kept the stone in place. One side of the head stuck out so it could dig into mud or sand. In the Ladby ship burial in Denmark, a unique iron anchor has been found, resembling the modern fisherman&#x27;s anchor but without the crossbar. The cross bar may have rusted away. This anchor—made of Norwegian iron—has a long iron chain to which the hemp warp was attached. This construction has several advantages when anchored in deep waters or in rough seas.

===Ship builders&#x27; toolkit===

At the height of Viking expansion into Dublin and Jorvik 875–954 AD the longship reached a peak of development such as the Gokstad ship 890. Archaeological discoveries from this period at Coppergate, in York, show the shipwright had a large range of sophisticated woodwork tools. As well as the heavy adze, broad axe, wooden mallets and wedges, the craftsman had steel tools such as anvils, files, snips, awls, augers, gouges, draw knife, knives, including folding knives, chisels and small long bow saws with antler handles. Edged tools were kept sharp with sharpening stones from Norway. One of the most sophisticated tools was a diameter twist drill bit, perfect for drilling holes for treenails. Simple mechanical pole wood lathes were used to make cups and bowls.

==Navigation and propulsion==
===Navigation===

During the Viking Age (900–1200 AD) Vikings were the dominant seafarers of the North Atlantic. One of the keys to their success was the ability to navigate skillfully across the open waters. The Vikings were experts in judging speed and wind direction, and in knowing the current and when to expect high and low tides. Viking navigational techniques are not well understood, but historians postulate that the Vikings probably had some sort of primitive astrolabe and used the stars to plot their course.

Viking Sundial

During an excavation of a Viking Age farm in southern Greenland part of a circular disk with carvings was recovered. The discovery of the so-called Viking Sundial suggested a hypothesis that it was used as a compass. Archaeologists found a piece of stone and a fragment of wooden disk both featuring straight and hyperbolic carvings. It turned out that the two items had been parts of sundials used by the Vikings as a compass during their sea-crossings along latitude 61 degrees North.

Archaeologists have found two devices which they interpret as navigation instruments. Both appear to be sundials with gnomon curves etched on a flat surface. The devices are small enough to be held flat in the hand at diameter. A wooden version dated to about 1000 AD was found in Greenland. A stone version was also found at Vatnahverfi, Greenland. By looking at the place where the shadow from the rod falls on a carved curve, a navigator is able to sail along a line of latitude. Both gnomon curve devices show the curve for 61° north very prominently. This was the approximate latitude that the Vikings would have sailed along to get to Greenland from Scandinavia. The wooden device also has north marked and had 32 arrow heads around the edge that may be the points of a compass. Other lines are interpreted as the solstice and equinox curves. The device was tested successfully, as a sun compass, during a 1984 reenactment when a longship sailed across the North Atlantic. It was accurate to within ±5°.

Hypothesis

The Danish archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou suggested in 1967 that the &quot;sun-stones&quot; referred to in some sagas might have been natural crystals capable of polarizing skylight. The mineral cordierite occurring in Norway has the local name &quot;Viking&#x27;s Compass.&quot; Its changes in colour would allow determining the sun&#x27;s position (azimuth) even through an overcast or foggy horizon. The sunstones are doubly refracting, meaning that objects viewed through them can be seen as double because of positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged carbonate ions. When looking at the sun the stone, it will project two overlapping shadows on the crystal. The opacities of these shadows will vary depending on the sunstone&#x27;s direction to the sun. When the two projected shapes have exactly the same opacity, it means the stone&#x27;s long side is facing directly toward the sun. Since the stone uses light polarization, it works the best when the sun is at lower altitudes, or closer to the horizon. It makes sense that Norsemen were able to make use of sunstones, since much of the area they travelled and explored was near polar, where the sun is very close to the horizon for a good amount of the year. For example, in the Vinland sagas we see long voyages to North America, the majority sailed at over 61 degrees north.

An ingenious navigation method is detailed in &quot;Viking Navigation Using the Sunstone, Polarized Light and the Horizon Board&quot; by Leif K. Karlsen. To derive a course to steer relative to the sun direction, he uses a sun-stone (solarsteinn) made of Iceland spar (optical calcite or silfurberg), and a &quot;horizon-board.&quot; The author constructed the latter from an Icelandic saga source, and describes an experiment performed to determine its accuracy. Karlsen also discusses why on North Atlantic trips the Vikings might have preferred to navigate by the sun rather than by stars, as at high latitudes in summer the days are long and the nights short.

A Viking named Stjerner Oddi compiled a chart showing the direction of sunrise and sunset, which enabled navigators to sail longships from place to place with ease. Almgren, an earlier Viking, told of another method: &quot;All the measurements of angles were made with what was called a &#x27;half wheel&#x27; (a kind of half sun-diameter which corresponds to about sixteen minutes of arc). This was something that was known to every skipper at that time, or to the long-voyage pilot or &quot;kendtmand&quot; (&#x27;man who knows the way&#x27;) who sometimes went along on voyages ... When the sun was in the sky, it was not, therefore, difficult to find the four points of the compass, and determining latitude did not cause any problems either.&quot; (Almgren)

Birds provided a helpful guide to finding land. A Viking legend states that Vikings used to take caged crows aboard ships and let them loose if they got lost. The crows would instinctively head for land, giving the sailors a course to steer.

===Propulsion===

The longships had two methods of propulsion: oars and sail. At sea, the sail enabled longships to travel faster than by oar and to cover long distances overseas with far less manual effort. Sails could be raised or lowered quickly. In a modern facsimile the mast can be lowered in 90 seconds. Oars were used when near the coast or in a river, to gain speed quickly, and when there was an adverse (or insufficient) wind. In combat, the variability of wind power made rowing the chief means of propulsion. The ship was steered by a vertical flat blade with a short round handle, at right angles, mounted over the starboard side of the aft gunwale.

Longships were not fitted with benches. When rowing, the crew sat on sea chests (chests containing their personal possessions) that would otherwise take up space. The chests were made the same size and were the perfect height for a Viking to sit on and row. Longships had hooks for oars to fit into, but smaller oars were also used, with crooks or bends to be used as oarlocks. If there were no holes then a loop of rope kept the oars in place.

An innovation that improved the sail&#x27;s performance was the beitaass, or stretching pole—a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward performance of the ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking the beitaass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached to the luff and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about long on the outside of the hull.

==Legacy==

The Vikings were major contributors to the shipbuilding technology of their day. Their shipbuilding methods spread through extensive contact with other cultures, and ships from the 11th and 12th centuries are known to borrow many of the longships&#x27; design features, despite the passing of many centuries.

Many historians, archaeologists and adventurers have reconstructed longships in an attempt to understand how they worked. These re-creators have been able to identify many of the advances that the Vikings implemented in order to make the longship a superior vessel. The longship was light, fast, and nimble. The true Viking warships, or &quot;langskips&quot;, were long and narrow, frequently with a length-breadth ratio of 7:1; they were very fast under sail or propelled by warriors who served as oarsmen. In Scandinavia, the longship was the usual vessel for war until the 12th–13th centuries. Leidang fleet-levy laws remained in place for most of the Middle Ages, demanding that the freemen should build, man, and furnish ships for war if demanded by the king—ships with at least 20 or 25 oar-pairs (40–50+ rowers). By the late 14th century, these low-boarded vessels were at a disadvantage against newer, taller vessels—when the Victual Brothers, in the employ of the Hansa, attacked Bergen in late 1393, the &quot;great ships&quot; of the pirates could not be boarded by the Norwegian levy ships called out by Margaret I of Denmark, and the raiders were able to sack the town with impunity. While earlier times had seen larger and taller longships in service, by this time the authorities had also gone over to other types of ships for warfare. The last Viking longship was defeated in 1429.

== Notable longships ==

=== Preserved originals ===
Several of the original longships built in the Viking Age have been excavated by archaeologists. A selection of vessels that has been particularly important to our understanding of the longships design and construction, comprise the following:

* The Nydam ship (c. 310–320 AD) is a burial ship from Denmark. This oaken vessel is long and was propelled by oars only. No mast is attached, as it was a later addition to the longship design. The Nydam ship shows a combination of building styles and is important to our understanding of the evolution of the early Viking ships.
* &quot;&quot;Puck 2&quot; is the name given to a longship found in the Bay of Gdansk in Poland in 1977. It has been dated to the first half of the tenth century and was long in its day. It is peculiar and important because it was constructed by Western Slavic craftsmen, not Scandinavian. The design only differs very slightly from the Scandinavian built longships.
* &quot;Hedeby 1&quot; is the name given to a longship found in the harbour of Hedeby in 1953. At nearly long, it is of the Skeid type, built around 985 AD. With a maximum width of just it has a width-to-length ratio of more than 11, making it the slimmest longship ever discovered. It is made of oaken wood and its construction would have required a very high level of craftsmanship.
* The Oseberg ship and the Gokstad ship – both from Vestfold in Norway. They both represent the longship design of the later Viking Age.
* &quot;&quot; is the name given to the longest longship ever found at approximately . It was discovered in 1996–97 at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. The ship was constructed around 1025.
* The Gjellestad ship, built in Norway around 732, was discovered in 2018. Excavations were completed in December 2022, and the remains of the keel are undergoing preservation.

A selection of important longships known only from written sources includes:
* The Ormen Lange (&quot;The Long Serpent&quot;&quot;) was the most famous longship of Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason.
* The Mora was the ship given to William the Conqueror by his wife, Matilda, and used as the flagship in the Norman conquest of England. It is said to be of the &quot;dreki&quot; type.
* The Mariasuda, flagship of Norwegian king Sverre at the Battle of Fimreite, the largest recorded longship.

=== Replicas ===

There are many replicas of Viking ships – including longships – in existence. Some are just inspired by the longship design in general, while others are intricate works of experimental archaeology, trying to replicate the originals as accurately as possible. Replicas important to our understanding of the original longships design and construction include:

* &quot;Viking&quot;, the very first Viking ship replica, was built by the Rødsverven shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway, modelled after the Gokstad ship. In 1893, it sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to Chicago in the United States for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.
* The Skuldelev replicas. All the five Skuldelev ships have been replicated, some of them several times. They are each of a different design and only Skuldelev 1, 2 and 5 are longships.
* The &quot;Sea Stallion&quot; is a replica of the Skuldelev 2 ship, constructed by authentic methods. At , it is the second longest Viking ship replica ever made. Skuldelev 2 was originally built near Dublin around 1042, and was rediscovered in Roskilde, Denmark in 1962. The &quot;Sea Stallion&quot; sailed from Roskilde to Dublin in mid-2007, to commemorate the voyage of the original. In late 2007 and early 2008, the ship was exhibited outside the National Museum in Dublin. In mid-2008, it returned to Roskilde on a sea route south of England.
* &quot;Dragon Harald Fairhair&quot; is the largest longship built in modern times at . The ship is not a replica of any specific original longship, but was built by authentic construction methods. It was constructed in Haugesund, Norway and launched in 2012.
* The &quot;Íslendingur (Icelander)&quot; is a replica of the Gokstad ship that was built using traditional building techniques. In 2000, it was sailed from Iceland to L&#x27;Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, to participate in the 1000th anniversary of Leif Erikson&#x27;s discovery of America.
* &quot;The Munin&quot; is a half-sized replica of the Gokstad ship. Berthed at the Vancouver Maritime Museum, built at the Scandinavian Community Centre, Burnaby, British Columbia and launched in 2001.
*The Myklebust Ship is a replica of the original ship of the same name found in Nordfjordeid, Norway. The replica is in the Sagastad knowledge center, and is the largest replica based on an original find. The replica was christened in 2019, as part of the opening of Sagastad.

<text>Luigi Alamanni (sometimes spelt Alemanni) (6 March 149518 April 1556) was an Italian poet and statesman. He was regarded as a prolific and versatile poet. He was credited with introducing the epigram into Italian poetry.

==Biography==
Alamanni was born in Florence. His father was a devoted adherent of the Medici party, but Luigi, smarting under a supposed injustice, joined an unsuccessful conspiracy against Giulio de&#x27; Medici, soon to be elected Pope Clement VII. Consequently, he was forced to take refuge in Venice, and, on the accession of Medici to pope, to flee to France. When Florence had exiled the Medici in 1527, Alamanni returned, and took a prominent part in the management of the affairs of the short-lived republic. 

The Florentines had thrown off Medici rule and established a republic after the Sack of Rome in 1527; the Florentine Republic had continued to participate in the war on the side of the French. The French defeats at Naples in 1528 and Landriano in 1529, however, led to Francis I of France concluding the Treaty of Cambrai with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. When Pope Clement VII and the Republic of Venice also concluded treaties with the Emperor, Florence was left to fight alone. Charles, attempting to gain Clement&#x27;s favor, ordered his armies to seize Florence and return the Medici to power.

After the siege of Florence in 1530 by Imperial forces, succeeded in restoring the Medici to the duchy, Alamanni again fled, this time to France, where he composed the greater part of his works. He was a favourite with the French King Francis I, who sent him as ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V after the Peace of Crépy in 1544.

An instance of Alammani&#x27;s diplomatic tact is reflected in an encounter with the emperor. Alamanni, while giving a complimentary address to Charles, was interrupted by the emperor who quoted a line from a satirical poem of Alamanni: &quot;l&#x27;aquila grifagna, Che per piu devorar, duoi rostri porta&quot; (&quot;Two crooked bills the ravenous eagle bears, The better to devour&quot;). The double eagle was a symbol of the Hapsburg monarchy. Upon this interruption, Alamanni immediately replied that he spoke that line only as a poet using fictions, now as an ambassador, he could only speak the truth. The ready reply pleased Charles, who added some complimentary words.

After the death of Francis, Alamanni enjoyed the confidence of his successor Henry II, and in 1551 was sent as his ambassador to Genoa. He died at Amboise on 18 April 1556.

He wrote a large number of poems, distinguished by the purity and excellence of their style. The best is a didactic poem, &quot;La Coltivazione&quot; (Paris, 1546; see 1546 in poetry), written in imitation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;. His &quot;Opere Toscane&quot; (Lyon, 1532) consists of satirical pieces written in blank verse. His use of Horatian epistolary satire is important and his tenth satire was used as a model by Sir Thomas Wyatt in his poem &#x27;Mine own John Poyntz&#x27; which introduced the form into English literature. An unfinished poem, &quot;Avarchide&quot;, in imitation of the Iliad, was the work of his old age and has little merit.

It has been said by some that Alamanni was the first to use blank verse in Italian poetry, but that distinction belongs rather to his contemporary Giangiorgio Trissino.

The contemporary poet Isabella di Morra dedicated a sonnet to Alamanni called &quot;Non sol il ciel vi fu largo e cortese&quot; (&quot;Not only was heaven generous and courteous to you&quot;).

Alamanni is a minor speaker in Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;, a book structured as a dialogue between real people known to Machiavelli, and set in the gardens of Cosimo Rucellai. In this book, Alamanni is present as a loyal friend of the host, and is mentioned to be the youngest of Rucellai&#x27;s friends present.

<text>Louis Aleman (16 September 1450) was a French Roman Catholic cardinal and a professed member of the now-suppressed Canons Regular of Saint John Baptist. He served as the Archbishop of Arles from 1423 until his resignation in 1440 when he had resigned from the cardinalate. But he was later reinstated as a cardinal on 19 December 1449 at which point he served as the Protopriest and also reclaimed his titular church.

Aleman served as the Bishop of Maguelonne from 1418 until his archepiscopal elevation at which point he was later named a cardinal. Aleman once led opposition to Pope Eugene IV while pledging allegiance to an antipope which led to Eugene IV stripping Aleman of all ecclesiastical dignities that he had been entitled to. But he later convinced the antipope to abdicate as a means of ending the Western Schism at which stage Aleman was restored to the cardinalate and returned to full communion with the Roman see under Pope Nicholas V. He has often been dubbed as the &quot;Cardinal of Arles&quot;.

His beatification received approval on 9 April 1527 from Pope Clement VII.

==Life==
Louis Aleman was born to nobles circa 1390 at the castle in Arbent to Jean Aleman and Marie de Châtillon de Michaille. His archbishop grand-uncle was François de Conzie (c.1356-31.12.1431/2).

He was present at the Council of Pisa in 1409. He studied canon law and graduated in that area with a doctorate in 1414 at the college in Avignon. In 1417 he was made the abbot commendatario of Saint-Pierre de la Tour.

Aleman served as the governor of the Romagna since 1424 and had to face the ongoing struggles between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines in Bologna. One of the Guelph families - the Canetols - even imprisoned Aleman for several weeks but Aleman was later released and moved to Rome to serve in the court of Pope Martin V. Aleman served as a noted advisor to the pope and also served as a courtier while in the papal court. He had served in the papal court for Martin V since July 1417.

On 22 June 1418 he was appointed as the Bishop of Maguelonne and he was installed into his new see on 17 May 1419. The pope himself granted episcopal consecration to Aleman in Mantua. He later became a diplomat to Siena in 1422. Aleman was later promoted as the newest Archbishop of Arles on 3 December 1423 and was installed in that see on 16 May 1424. Martin V named him a cardinal on 24 May 1426 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Cecilia - he received that title on 27 May. From 1427 until 1431 he served as the Camerlengo for the College of Cardinals. He served as a legate to Bologna from 1426 to 1428 and did not participate in the conclave of 1431.

He was a prominent member of the Council of Basel since 1432 and together with Cardinal Julian Cesarini led the forces that maintained the power of the general councils over the pope&#x27;s own control of the Church. It was while the council was proceeding that he tended to victims of the plague. He later led opposition to the pope but Cesarini was reconciled with Pope Eugene IV and had a prominent part in the pope&#x27;s convoked Council of Florence. In 1439 he led the effort to depose Eugene IV and the election of a successor. In 1440 he placed the tiara upon Antipope Felix V and consecrated him as a bishop. This was a misguided attempt at reforming the Church which Aleman believed was vital. Eugene IV was responded to this and excommunicated the antipope while also depriving Aleman of all his ecclesiastical dignities. This also meant that Aleman could no longer be considered a cardinal and he was deprived of the dignities that came with the cardinalate. This occurred on 11 April 1440: he was stripped of Arles as his archdiocese and was stripped of his titular church.

Antipope Felix V made him the legate to the Diet of Frankfurt to the court of Emperor Friedrich III. He was further involved in the unsuccessful efforts to win over Europe&#x27;s princes to Basel&#x27;s antipope. In order to make an end of the schism the former cardinal advised Felix V to abdicate at which stage Pope Nicholas V restored the cardinal to all his honors and appointed him as a papal legate to the German kingdom] in 1449; his full restoration was on 19 December 1449. He was granted back his titular church as well and from that moment until his death served as the Protopriest of the College of Cardinals. It was due to his estrangement to the Roman see that he was not permitted to participate in the conclave of 1447. He returned to his former archdiocese where he dedicated himself with great zeal to the catechetical formation of the people.

He died on 16 September 1450 at the Franciscan convent in Salon at Arles. Aleman&#x27;s remains are housed in Saint-Trophine d&#x27;Arles.

==Beatification==
His beatification was approved and celebrated on 9 April 1527 after Pope Clement VII confirmed that there had been a longstanding and popular cultus (otherwise known as an enduring public veneration) of the late cardinal.

<doc id="18030" wikidata="Q1756442" url="?curid=18030" title="LR parser">
<text>In computer science, LR parsers are a type of bottom-up parser that analyse deterministic context-free languages in linear time. There are several variants of LR parsers: SLR parsers, LALR parsers, canonical LR(1) parsers, minimal LR(1) parsers, and generalized LR parsers (GLR parsers). LR parsers can be generated by a parser generator from a formal grammar defining the syntax of the language to be parsed. They are widely used for the processing of computer languages.

An LR parser (left-to-right, rightmost derivation in reverse) reads input text from left to right without backing up (this is true for most parsers), and produces a rightmost derivation in reverse: it does a bottom-up parse – not a top-down LL parse or ad-hoc parse. The name &quot;LR&quot; is often followed by a numeric qualifier, as in &quot;LR(1)&quot; or sometimes &quot;LR(&quot;k&quot;)&quot;. To avoid backtracking or guessing, the LR parser is allowed to peek ahead at &quot;k&quot; lookahead input symbols before deciding how to parse earlier symbols. Typically &quot;k&quot; is 1 and is not mentioned. The name &quot;LR&quot; is often preceded by other qualifiers, as in &quot;SLR&quot; and &quot;LALR&quot;. The &quot;LR(&quot;k&quot;)&quot; notation for a grammar was suggested by Knuth to stand for &quot;translatable from left to right with bound &quot;k&quot;.&quot;

LR parsers are deterministic; they produce a single correct parse without guesswork or backtracking, in linear time. This is ideal for computer languages, but LR parsers are not suited for human languages which need more flexible but inevitably slower methods. Some methods which can parse arbitrary context-free languages (e.g., Cocke–Younger–Kasami, Earley, GLR) have worst-case performance of O(3) time. Other methods which backtrack or yield multiple parses may even take exponential time when they guess badly.

The above properties of L, R, and k are actually shared by all shift-reduce parsers, including precedence parsers. But by convention, the LR name stands for the form of parsing invented by Donald Knuth, and excludes the earlier, less powerful precedence methods (for example Operator-precedence parser).
LR parsers can handle a larger range of languages and grammars than precedence parsers or top-down LL parsing. This is because the LR parser waits until it has seen an entire instance of some grammar pattern before committing to what it has found. An LL parser has to decide or guess what it is seeing much sooner, when it has only seen the leftmost input symbol of that pattern.

== Overview ==

===Bottom-up parse tree for example ===

An LR parser scans and parses the input text in one forward pass over the text. The parser builds up the parse tree incrementally, bottom up, and left to right, without guessing or backtracking. At every point in this pass, the parser has accumulated a list of subtrees or phrases of the input text that have been already parsed. Those subtrees are not yet joined together because the parser has not yet reached the right end of the syntax pattern that will combine them.

At step 6 in an example parse, only &quot;A*2&quot; has been parsed, incompletely. Only the shaded lower-left corner of the parse tree exists. None of the parse tree nodes numbered 7 and above exist yet. Nodes 3, 4, and 6 are the roots of isolated subtrees for variable A, operator *, and number 2, respectively. These three root nodes are temporarily held in a parse stack. The remaining unparsed portion of the input stream is &quot;+ 1&quot;.

===Shift and reduce actions===

As with other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser works by doing some combination of Shift steps and Reduce steps. 
* A Shift step advances in the input stream by one symbol. That shifted symbol becomes a new single-node parse tree.
* A Reduce step applies a completed grammar rule to some of the recent parse trees, joining them together as one tree with a new root symbol.
If the input has no syntax errors, the parser continues with these steps until all of the input has been consumed and all of the parse trees have been reduced to a single tree representing an entire legal input.

LR parsers differ from other shift-reduce parsers in how they decide when to reduce, and how to pick between rules with similar endings. But the final decisions and the sequence of shift or reduce steps are the same.

Much of the LR parser&#x27;s efficiency is from being deterministic. To avoid guessing, the LR parser often looks ahead (rightwards) at the next scanned symbol, before deciding what to do with previously scanned symbols. The lexical scanner works one or more symbols ahead of the parser. The lookahead symbols are the &#x27;right-hand context&#x27; for the parsing decision.

===Bottom-up parse stack===

Like other shift-reduce parsers, an LR parser lazily waits until it has scanned and parsed all parts of some construct before committing to what the combined construct is. The parser then acts immediately on the combination instead of waiting any further. In the parse tree example, the phrase A gets reduced to Value and then to Products in steps 1-3 as soon as lookahead * is seen, rather than waiting any later to organize those parts of the parse tree. The decisions for how to handle A are based only on what the parser and scanner have already seen, without considering things that appear much later to the right.

Reductions reorganize the most recently parsed things, immediately to the left of the lookahead symbol. So the list of already-parsed things acts like a stack. This parse stack grows rightwards. The base or bottom of the stack is on the left and holds the leftmost, oldest parse fragment. Every reduction step acts only on the rightmost, newest parse fragments. (This accumulative parse stack is very unlike the predictive, leftward-growing parse stack used by top-down parsers.)

===Bottom-up parse steps for example A*2 + 1 ===

Step 6 applies a grammar rule with multiple parts:
: Products → Products * Value
This matches the stack top holding the parsed phrases &quot;... Products * Value&quot;. The reduce step replaces this instance of the rule&#x27;s right hand side, &quot;Products * Value&quot; by the rule&#x27;s left hand side symbol, here a larger Products. If the parser builds complete parse trees, the three trees for inner Products, *, and Value are combined by a new tree root for Products. Otherwise, semantic details from the inner Products and Value are output to some later compiler pass, or are combined and saved in the new Products symbol.

===LR parse steps for example A*2 + 1 ===

In LR parsers, the shift and reduce decisions are potentially based on the entire stack of everything that has been previously parsed, not just on a single, topmost stack symbol. If done in an unclever way, that could lead to very slow parsers that get slower and slower for longer inputs. LR parsers do this with constant speed, by summarizing all the relevant left context information into a single number called the LR(0) parser state. For each grammar and LR analysis method, there is a fixed (finite) number of such states. Besides holding the already-parsed symbols, the parse stack also remembers the state numbers reached by everything up to those points.

At every parse step, the entire input text is divided into a stack of previously parsed phrases, a current look-ahead symbol, and the remaining unscanned text. The parser&#x27;s next action is determined by its current LR(0) (rightmost on the stack) and the lookahead symbol. In the steps below, all the black details are exactly the same as in other non-LR shift-reduce parsers. LR parser stacks add the state information in purple, summarizing the black phrases to their left on the stack and what syntax possibilities to expect next. Users of an LR parser can usually ignore state information. These states are explained in a later section.

At initial step 0, the input stream &quot;A*2 + 1&quot; is divided into
* an empty section on the parse stack,
* lookahead text &quot;A&quot; scanned as an &quot;id&quot; symbol, and
* the remaining unscanned text &quot;*2 + 1&quot;.
The parse stack begins by holding only initial state 0. When state 0 sees the lookahead &quot;id&quot;, it knows to shift that &quot;id&quot; onto the stack, and scan the next input symbol *, and advance to state 9.

At step 4, the total input stream &quot;A*2 + 1&quot; is currently divided into 
* the parsed section &quot;A *&quot; with 2 stacked phrases Products and *,
* lookahead text &quot;2&quot; scanned as an &quot;int&quot; symbol, and
* the remaining unscanned text &quot; + 1&quot;.
The states corresponding to the stacked phrases are 0, 4, and 5. The current, rightmost state on the stack is state 5. When state 5 sees the lookahead &quot;int&quot;, it knows to shift that &quot;int&quot; onto the stack as its own phrase, and scan the next input symbol +, and advance to state 8.

At step 12, all of the input stream has been consumed but only partially organized. The current state is 3. When state 3 sees the lookahead &quot;eof&quot;, it knows to apply the completed grammar rule
::Sums → Sums + Products
by combining the stack&#x27;s rightmost three phrases for Sums, +, and Products into one thing. State 3 itself doesn&#x27;t know what the next state should be. This is found by going back to state 0, just to the left of the phrase being reduced. When state 0 sees this new completed instance of a Sums, it advances to state 1 (again). This consulting of older states is why they are kept on the stack, instead of keeping only the current state.

===Grammar for the example A*2 + 1===

LR parsers are constructed from a grammar that formally defines the syntax of the input language as a set of patterns. The grammar doesn&#x27;t cover all language rules, such as the size of numbers, or the consistent use of names and their definitions in the context of the whole program. LR parsers use a context-free grammar that deals just with local patterns of symbols.

The example grammar used here is a tiny subset of the Java or C language:

::r0: Goal → Sums &quot;eof&quot;
::r1: Sums → Sums + Products
::r2: Sums → Products
::r3: Products → Products * Value
::r4: Products → Value
::r5: Value → &quot;int&quot;
::r6: Value → &quot;id&quot;

The grammar&#x27;s terminal symbols are the multi-character symbols or &#x27;tokens&#x27; found in the input stream by a lexical scanner. Here these include + * and &quot;int&quot; for any integer constant, and &quot;id&quot; for any identifier name, and &quot;eof&quot; for end of input file. The grammar doesn&#x27;t care what the &quot;int&quot; values or &quot;id&quot; spellings are, nor does it care about blanks or line breaks. The grammar uses these terminal symbols but does not define them. They are always leaf nodes (at the bottom bushy end) of the parse tree.

The capitalized terms like Sums are nonterminal symbols. These are names for concepts or patterns in the language. They are defined in the grammar and never occur themselves in the input stream. They are always internal nodes (above the bottom) of the parse tree. They only happen as a result of the parser applying some grammar rule. Some nonterminals are defined with two or more rules; these are alternative patterns. Rules can refer back to themselves, which are called &quot;recursive&quot;. This grammar uses recursive rules to handle repeated math operators. Grammars for complete languages use recursive rules to handle lists, parenthesized expressions, and nested statements.

Any given computer language can be described by several different grammars. An LR(1) parser can handle many but not all common grammars. It is usually possible to manually modify a grammar so that it fits the limitations of LR(1) parsing and the generator tool.

The grammar for an LR parser must be unambiguous itself, or must be augmented by tie-breaking precedence rules. This means there is only one correct way to apply the grammar to a given legal example of the language, resulting in a unique parse tree with just one meaning, and a unique sequence of shift/reduce actions for that example. LR parsing is not a useful technique for human languages with ambiguous grammars that depend on the interplay of words. Human languages are better handled by parsers like Generalized LR parser, the Earley parser, or the CYK algorithm that can simultaneously compute all possible parse trees in one pass.

===Parse table for the example grammar===

Most LR parsers are table driven. The parser&#x27;s program code is a simple generic loop that is the same for all grammars and languages. The knowledge of the grammar and its syntactic implications are encoded into unchanging data tables called parse tables (or parsing tables). Entries in a table show whether to shift or reduce (and by which grammar rule), for every legal combination of parser state and lookahead symbol. The parse tables also tell how to compute the next state, given just a current state and a next symbol.

The parse tables are much larger than the grammar. LR tables are hard to accurately compute by hand for big grammars. So they are mechanically derived from the grammar by some parser generator tool like Bison.

Depending on how the states and parsing table are generated, the resulting parser is called either a SLR (simple LR) parser, LALR (look-ahead LR) parser, or canonical LR parser. LALR parsers handle more grammars than SLR parsers. Canonical LR parsers handle even more grammars, but use many more states and much larger tables. The example grammar is SLR.

LR parse tables are two-dimensional. Each current LR(0) parser state has its own row. Each possible next symbol has its own column. Some combinations of state and next symbol are not possible for valid input streams. These blank cells trigger syntax error messages.

The Action left half of the table has columns for lookahead terminal symbols. These cells determine whether the next parser action is shift (to state &quot;n&quot;), or reduce (by grammar rule rn).

The Goto right half of the table has columns for nonterminal symbols. These cells show which state to advance to, after some reduction&#x27;s Left Hand Side has created an expected new instance of that symbol. This is like a shift action but for nonterminals; the lookahead terminal symbol is unchanged.

The table column &quot;Current Rules&quot; documents the meaning and syntax possibilities for each state, as worked out by the parser generator. It is not included in the actual tables used at parsing time. The (pink dot) marker shows where the parser is now, within some partially recognized grammar rules. The things to the left of have been parsed, and the things to the right are expected soon. A state has several such current rules if the parser has not yet narrowed possibilities down to a single rule.

In state 2 above, the parser has just found and shifted-in the + of grammar rule
::r1: Sums → Sums + Products
The next expected phrase is Products. Products begins with terminal symbols &quot;int&quot; or &quot;id&quot;. If the lookahead is either of those, the parser shifts them in and advances to state 8 or 9, respectively. When a Products has been found, the parser advances to state 3 to accumulate the complete list of summands and find the end of rule r0. A Products can also begin with nonterminal Value. For any other lookahead or nonterminal, the parser announces a syntax error.

In state 3, the parser has just found a Products phrase, that could be from two possible grammar rules:
::r1: Sums → Sums + Products 
::r3: Products → Products * Value
The choice between r1 and r3 can&#x27;t be decided just from looking backwards at prior phrases. The parser has to check the lookahead symbol to tell what to do. If the lookahead is *, it is in rule 3, so the parser shifts in the * and advances to state 5. If the lookahead is &quot;eof&quot;, it is at the end of rule 1 and rule 0, so the parser is done.

In state 9 above, all the non-blank, non-error cells are for the same reduction r6. Some parsers save time and table space by not checking the lookahead symbol in these simple cases. Syntax errors are then detected somewhat later, after some harmless reductions, but still before the next shift action or parser decision.

Individual table cells must not hold multiple, alternative actions, otherwise the parser would be nondeterministic with guesswork and backtracking. If the grammar is not LR(1), some cells will have shift/reduce conflicts between a possible shift action and reduce action, or reduce/reduce conflicts between multiple grammar rules. LR(k) parsers resolve these conflicts (where possible) by checking additional lookahead symbols beyond the first.

=== LR parser loop ===

The LR parser begins with a nearly empty parse stack containing just the start state 0, and with the lookahead holding the input stream&#x27;s first scanned symbol. The parser then repeats the following loop step until done, or stuck on a syntax error:

The topmost state on the parse stack is some state &quot;s&quot;, and the current lookahead is some terminal symbol &quot;t&quot;. Look up the next parser action from row &quot;s&quot; and column &quot;t&quot; of the Lookahead Action table. That action is either Shift, Reduce, Accept, or Error:
* Shift &quot;n&quot;:
::Shift the matched terminal &quot;t&quot; onto the parse stack and scan the next input symbol into the lookahead buffer.
::Push next state &quot;n&quot; onto the parse stack as the new current state.
* Reduce rm: Apply grammar rule rm: Lhs → S1 S2 ... SL
::Remove the matched topmost L symbols (and parse trees and associated state numbers) from the parse stack.
::This exposes a prior state &quot;p&quot; that was expecting an instance of the Lhs symbol.
::Join the L parse trees together as one parse tree with new root symbol Lhs.
::Lookup the next state &quot;n&quot; from row &quot;p&quot; and column &quot;Lhs&quot; of the LHS Goto table.
::Push the symbol and tree for Lhs onto the parse stack.
::Push next state &quot;n&quot; onto the parse stack as the new current state.
::The lookahead and input stream remain unchanged.
* Accept: Lookahead &quot;t&quot; is the &quot;eof&quot; marker. End of parsing. If the state stack contains just the start state report success. Otherwise, report a syntax error.
* Error: Report a syntax error. The parser ends, or attempts some recovery.

LR parser stack usually stores just the LR(0) automaton states, as the grammar symbols may be derived from them (in the automaton, all input transitions to some state are marked with the same symbol, which is the symbol associated with this state). Moreover, these symbols are almost never needed as the state is all that matters when making the parsing decision.

==LR generator analysis==

This section of the article can be skipped by most users of LR parser generators.

===LR states===

State 2 in the example parse table is for the partially parsed rule 
::r1: Sums → Sums + Products
This shows how the parser got here, by seeing Sums then + while looking for a larger Sums. The marker has advanced beyond the beginning of the rule. It also shows how the parser expects to eventually complete the rule, by next finding a complete Products. But more details are needed on how to parse all the parts of that Products.

The partially parsed rules for a state are called its &quot;core LR(0) items&quot;. The parser generator adds additional rules or items for all the possible next steps in building up the expected Products:
::r3: Products → Products * Value
::r4: Products → Value
::r5: Value → &quot;int&quot;
::r6: Value → &quot;id&quot;
The marker is at the beginning of each of these added rules; the parser has not yet confirmed and parsed any part of them. These additional items are called the &quot;closure&quot; of the core items. For each nonterminal symbol immediately following a , the generator adds the rules defining that symbol. This adds more markers, and possibly different follower symbols. This closure process continues until all follower symbols have been expanded. The follower nonterminals for state 2 begins with Products. Value is then added by closure. The follower terminals are &quot;int&quot; and &quot;id&quot;.

The kernel and closure items together show all possible legal ways to proceed from the current state to future states and complete phrases. If a follower symbol appears in only one item, it leads to a next state containing only one core item with the marker advanced. So &quot;int&quot; leads to next state 8 with core
::r5: Value → &quot;int&quot; 

If the same follower symbol appears in several items, the parser cannot yet tell which rule applies here. So that symbol leads to a next state that shows all remaining possibilities, again with the marker advanced. Products appears in both r1 and r3. So Products leads to next state 3 with core
::r1: Sums → Sums + Products 
::r3: Products → Products * Value
In words, that means if the parser has seen a single Products, it might be done, or it might still have even more things to multiply together. All the core items have the same symbol preceding the marker; all transitions into this state are always with that same symbol.

Some transitions will be to cores and states that have been enumerated already. Other transitions lead to new states. The generator starts with the grammar&#x27;s goal rule. From there it keeps exploring known states and transitions until all needed states have been found.

These states are called &quot;LR(0)&quot; states because they use a lookahead of &quot;k&quot;=0, i.e. no lookahead. The only checking of input symbols occurs when the symbol is shifted in. Checking of lookaheads for reductions is done separately by the parse table, not by the enumerated states themselves.

===Finite state machine===

The parse table describes all possible LR(0) states and their transitions. They form a finite-state machine (FSM). An FSM is a simple engine for parsing simple unnested languages, without using a stack. In this LR application, the FSM&#x27;s modified &quot;input language&quot; has both terminal and nonterminal symbols, and covers any partially parsed stack snapshot of the full LR parse.

Recall step 5 of the Parse Steps Example:

The parse stack shows a series of state transitions, from the start state 0, to state 4 and then on to 5 and current state 8. The symbols on the parse stack are the shift or goto symbols for those transitions. Another way to view this, is that the finite state machine can scan the stream &quot;Products * &quot;int&quot; + 1&quot; (without using yet another stack) and find the leftmost complete phrase that should be reduced next. And that is indeed its job!

How can a mere FSM do this when the original unparsed language has nesting and recursion and definitely requires an analyzer with a stack? The trick is that everything to the left of the stack top has already been fully reduced. This eliminates all the loops and nesting from those phrases. The FSM can ignore all the older beginnings of phrases, and track just the newest phrases that might be completed next. The obscure name for this in LR theory is &quot;viable prefix&quot;.

===Lookahead sets===

The states and transitions give all the needed information for the parse table&#x27;s shift actions and goto actions. The generator also needs to calculate the expected lookahead sets for each reduce action.

In SLR parsers, these lookahead sets are determined directly from the grammar, without considering the individual states and transitions. For each nonterminal S, the SLR generator works out Follows(S), the set of all the terminal symbols which can immediately follow some occurrence of S. In the parse table, each reduction to S uses Follow(S) as its LR(1) lookahead set. Such follow sets are also used by generators for LL top-down parsers. A grammar that has no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts when using Follow sets is called an SLR grammar.

LALR parsers have the same states as SLR parsers, but use a more complicated, more precise way of working out the minimum necessary reduction lookaheads for each individual state. Depending on the details of the grammar, this may turn out to be the same as the Follow set computed by SLR parser generators, or it may turn out to be a subset of the SLR lookaheads. Some grammars are okay for LALR parser generators but not for SLR parser generators. This happens when the grammar has spurious shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflicts using Follow sets, but no conflicts when using the exact sets computed by the LALR generator. The grammar is then called LALR(1) but not SLR.

An SLR or LALR parser avoids having duplicate states. But this minimization is not necessary, and can sometimes create unnecessary lookahead conflicts. Canonical LR parsers use duplicated (or &quot;split&quot;) states to better remember the left and right context of a nonterminal&#x27;s use. Each occurrence of a symbol S in the grammar can be treated independently with its own lookahead set, to help resolve reduction conflicts. This handles a few more grammars. Unfortunately, this greatly magnifies the size of the parse tables if done for all parts of the grammar. This splitting of states can also be done manually and selectively with any SLR or LALR parser, by making two or more named copies of some nonterminals. A grammar that is conflict-free for a canonical LR generator but has conflicts in an LALR generator is called LR(1) but not LALR(1), and not SLR.

SLR, LALR, and canonical LR parsers make exactly the same shift and reduce decisions when the input stream is the correct language. When the input has a syntax error, the LALR parser may do some additional (harmless) reductions before detecting the error than would the canonical LR parser. And the SLR parser may do even more. This happens because the SLR and LALR parsers are using a generous superset approximation to the true, minimal lookahead symbols for that particular state.

===Syntax error recovery===

LR parsers can generate somewhat helpful error messages for the first syntax error in a program, by simply enumerating all the terminal symbols that could have appeared next instead of the unexpected bad lookahead symbol. But this does not help the parser work out how to parse the remainder of the input program to look for further, independent errors. If the parser recovers badly from the first error, it is very likely to mis-parse everything else and produce a cascade of unhelpful spurious error messages.

In the yacc and bison parser generators, the parser has an ad hoc mechanism to abandon the current statement, discard some parsed phrases and lookahead tokens surrounding the error, and resynchronize the parse at some reliable statement-level delimiter like semicolons or braces. This often works well for allowing the parser and compiler to look over the rest of the program.

Many syntactic coding errors are simple typos or omissions of a trivial symbol. Some LR parsers attempt to detect and automatically repair these common cases. The parser enumerates every possible single-symbol insertion, deletion, or substitution at the error point. The compiler does a trial parse with each change to see if it worked okay. (This requires backtracking to snapshots of the parse stack and input stream, normally unneeded by the parser.) Some best repair is picked. This gives a very helpful error message and resynchronizes the parse well. However, the repair is not trustworthy enough to permanently modify the input file. Repair of syntax errors is easiest to do consistently in parsers (like LR) that have parse tables and an explicit data stack.

===Variants of LR parsers===

The LR parser generator decides what should happen for each combination of parser state and lookahead symbol. These decisions are usually turned into read-only data tables that drive a generic parser loop that is grammar- and state-independent. But there are also other ways to turn those decisions into an active parser.

Some LR parser generators create separate tailored program code for each state, rather than a parse table. These parsers can run several times faster than the generic parser loop in table-driven parsers. The fastest parsers use generated assembler code.

In the recursive ascent parser variation, the explicit parse stack structure is also replaced by the implicit stack used by subroutine calls. Reductions terminate several levels of subroutine calls, which is clumsy in most languages. So recursive ascent parsers are generally slower, less obvious, and harder to hand-modify than recursive descent parsers.

Another variation replaces the parse table by pattern-matching rules in non-procedural languages such as Prolog.

GLR Generalized LR parsers use LR bottom-up techniques to find all possible parses of input text, not just one correct parse. This is essential for ambiguous grammar such as used for human languages. The multiple valid parse trees are computed simultaneously, without backtracking. GLR is sometimes helpful for computer languages that are not easily described by a conflict-free LALR(1) grammar.

LC Left corner parsers use LR bottom-up techniques for recognizing the left end of alternative grammar rules. When the alternatives have been narrowed down to a single possible rule, the parser then switches to top-down LL(1) techniques for parsing the rest of that rule. LC parsers have smaller parse tables than LALR parsers and better error diagnostics. There are no widely used generators for deterministic LC parsers. Multiple-parse LC parsers are helpful with human languages with very large grammars.

===Theory===

LR parsers were invented by Donald Knuth in 1965 as an efficient generalization of precedence parsers. Knuth proved that LR parsers were the most general-purpose parsers possible that would still be efficient in the worst cases. 
:&quot;LR(&quot;k&quot;) grammars can be efficiently parsed with an execution time essentially proportional to the length of the string.&quot;
:For every &quot;k&quot;≥1, &quot;a language can be generated by an LR(&quot;k&quot;) grammar if and only if it is deterministic [and context-free], if and only if it can be generated by an LR(1) grammar.&quot;

In other words, if a language was reasonable enough to allow an efficient one-pass parser, it could be described by an LR(&quot;k&quot;) grammar. And that grammar could always be mechanically transformed into an equivalent (but larger) LR(1) grammar. So an LR(1) parsing method was, in theory, powerful enough to handle any reasonable language. In practice, the natural grammars for many programming languages are close to being LR(1).

The canonical LR parsers described by Knuth had too many states and very big parse tables that were impractically large for the limited memory of computers of that era. LR parsing became practical when Frank DeRemer invented SLR and LALR parsers with much fewer states.

For full details on LR theory and how LR parsers are derived from grammars, see &quot;The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling, Volume 1&quot; (Aho and Ullman).

Earley parsers apply the techniques and notation of LR parsers to the task of generating all possible parses for ambiguous grammars such as for human languages.

While LR(&quot;k&quot;) grammars have equal generative power for all &quot;k&quot;≥1, the case of LR(0) grammars is slightly different.
A language &quot;L&quot; is said to have the &quot;prefix property&quot; if no word in &quot;L&quot; is a proper prefix of another word in &quot;L&quot;.
A language &quot;L&quot; has an LR(0) grammar if and only if &quot;L&quot; is a deterministic context-free language with the prefix property.
As a consequence, a language &quot;L&quot; is deterministic context-free if and only if &quot;L&quot;$ has an LR(0) grammar, where &quot;$&quot; is not a symbol of &quot;L&quot;″s alphabet.

==Additional example 1+1==


This example of LR parsing uses the following small grammar with goal symbol E:

: (1) E → E * B
: (2) E → E + B
: (3) E → B
: (4) B → 0
: (5) B → 1

to parse the following input:
: 1 + 1

=== Action and goto tables ===

The two LR(0) parsing tables for this grammar look as follows:

The action table is indexed by a state of the parser and a terminal (including a special terminal $ that indicates the end of the input stream) and contains three types of actions:
* &quot;shift&quot;, which is written as &quot;s&quot;n&quot;&quot; and indicates that the next state is &quot;n&quot;
* &quot;reduce&quot;, which is written as &quot;r&quot;m&quot;&quot; and indicates that a reduction with grammar rule &quot;m&quot; should be performed
* &quot;accept&quot;, which is written as &quot;acc&quot; and indicates that the parser accepts the string in the input stream.

The goto table is indexed by a state of the parser and a nonterminal and simply indicates what the next state of the parser will be if it has recognized a certain nonterminal. This table is important to find out the next state after every reduction. After a reduction, the next state is found by looking up the goto table entry for top of the stack (i.e. current state) and the reduced rule&#x27;s LHS (i.e. non-terminal).

=== Parsing steps ===

The table below illustrates each step in the process. Here the state refers to the element at the top of the stack (the right-most element), and the next action is determined by referring to the action table above. A $ is appended to the input string to denote the end of the stream.

=== Walkthrough ===

The parser starts out with the stack containing just the initial state (&#x27;0&#x27;):

: [0]

The first symbol from the input string that the parser sees is &#x27;1&#x27;. To find the next action (shift, reduce, accept or error), the action table is indexed with the current state (the &quot;current state&quot; is just whatever is on the top of the stack), which in this case is 0, and the current input symbol, which is &#x27;1&#x27;. The action table specifies a shift to state 2, and so state 2 is pushed onto the stack (again, all the state information is in the stack, so &quot;shifting to state 2&quot; is the same as pushing 2 onto the stack). The resulting stack is

: [0 &#x27;1&#x27; 2]

where the top of the stack is 2. For the sake of explaining the symbol (e.g., &#x27;1&#x27;, B) is shown that caused the transition to the next state, although strictly speaking it is not part of the stack.

In state 2, the action table says to reduce with grammar rule 5 (regardless of what terminal the parser sees on the input stream), which means that the parser has just recognized the right-hand side of rule 5. In this case, the parser writes 5 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has one symbol), and pushes on the stack the state from the cell in the goto table for state 0 and B, i.e., state 4. The resulting stack is:

: [0 B 4]

However, in state 4, the action table says the parser should now reduce with rule 3. So it writes 3 to the output stream, pops one state from the stack, and finds the new state in the goto table for state 0 and E, which is state 3. The resulting stack:

: [0 E 3]

The next terminal that the parser sees is a &#x27;+&#x27; and according to the action table it should then shift to state 6:

: [0 E 3 &#x27;+&#x27; 6]

The resulting stack can be interpreted as the history of a finite-state machine that has just read a nonterminal E followed by a terminal &#x27;+&#x27;. The transition table of this automaton is defined by the shift actions in the action table and the goto actions in the goto table.

The next terminal is now &#x27;1&#x27; and this means that the parser performs a shift and go to state 2:

: [0 E 3 &#x27;+&#x27; 6 &#x27;1&#x27; 2]

Just as the previous &#x27;1&#x27; this one is reduced to B giving the following stack:

: [0 E 3 &#x27;+&#x27; 6 B 8]

The stack corresponds with a list of states of a finite automaton that has read a nonterminal E, followed by a &#x27;+&#x27; and then a nonterminal B. In state 8 the parser always performs a reduce with rule 2. The top 3 states on the stack correspond with the 3 symbols in the right-hand side of rule 2. This time we pop 3 elements off of the stack (since the right-hand side of the rule has 3 symbols) and look up the goto state for E and 0, thus pushing state 3 back onto the stack

: [0 E 3]

Finally, the parser reads a &#x27;$&#x27; (end of input symbol) from the input stream, which means that according to the action table (the current state is 3) the parser accepts the input string. The rule numbers that will then have been written to the output stream will be [5, 3, 5, 2] which is indeed a rightmost derivation of the string &quot;1 + 1&quot; in reverse.

== Constructing LR(0) parsing tables ==
=== Items ===

The construction of these parsing tables is based on the notion of &quot;LR(0) items&quot; (simply called &quot;items&quot; here) which are grammar rules with a special dot added somewhere in the right-hand side. For example, the rule E → E + B has the following four corresponding items:
: E → E + B
: E → E + B
: E → E + B
: E → E + B 
Rules of the form &quot;A&quot; → ε have only a single item &quot;A&quot; → . The item E → E + B, for example, indicates that the parser has recognized a string corresponding with E on the input stream and now expects to read a &#x27;+&#x27; followed by another string corresponding with B.

=== Item sets ===

It is usually not possible to characterize the state of the parser with a single item because it may not know in advance which rule it is going to use for reduction. For example, if there is also a rule E → E * B then the items E → E + B and E → E * B will both apply after a string corresponding with E has been read. Therefore, it is convenient to characterize the state of the parser by a set of items, in this case the set { E → E + B, E → E * B }.

=== Extension of Item Set by expansion of non-terminals ===

An item with a dot before a nonterminal, such as E → E + B, indicates that the parser expects to parse the nonterminal B next. To ensure the item set contains all possible rules the parser may be in the midst of parsing, it must include all items describing how B itself will be parsed. This means that if there are rules such as B → 1 and B → 0 then the item set must also include the items B → 1 and B → 0. In general this can be formulated as follows:

: If there is an item of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;v&quot; &quot;Bw&quot; in an item set and in the grammar there is a rule of the form &quot;B&quot; → &quot;w&#x27; &quot; then the item &quot;B&quot; → &quot;w&#x27; &quot; should also be in the item set.

=== Closure of item sets ===

Thus, any set of items can be extended by recursively adding all the appropriate items until all nonterminals preceded by dots are accounted for. The minimal extension is called the &quot;closure&quot; of an item set and written as clos(&quot;I&quot;) where &quot;I&quot; is an item set. It is these closed item sets that are taken as the states of the parser, although only the ones that are actually reachable from the begin state will be included in the tables.

=== Augmented grammar ===

Before the transitions between the different states are determined, the grammar is augmented with an extra rule

: (0) S → E eof

where S is a new start symbol and E the old start symbol. The parser will use this rule for reduction exactly when it has accepted the whole input string.

For this example, the same grammar as above is augmented thus:

: (0) S → E eof
: (1) E → E * B
: (2) E → E + B
: (3) E → B
: (4) B → 0
: (5) B → 1

It is for this augmented grammar that the item sets and the transitions between them will be determined.

== Table construction ==

=== Finding the reachable item sets and the transitions between them ===

The first step of constructing the tables consists of determining the transitions between the closed item sets. These transitions will be determined as if we are considering a finite automaton that can read terminals as well as nonterminals. The begin state of this automaton is always the closure of the first item of the added rule: S → E eof:

: Item set 0
: S → E eof
: + E → E * B
: + E → E + B
: + E → B
: + B → 0
: + B → 1

The boldfaced &quot;+&quot; in front of an item indicates the items that were added for the closure (not to be confused with the mathematical &#x27;+&#x27; operator which is a terminal). The original items without a &quot;+&quot; are called the &quot;kernel&quot; of the item set.

Starting at the begin state (S0), all of the states that can be reached from this state are now determined. The possible transitions for an item set can be found by looking at the symbols (terminals and nonterminals) found following the dots; in the case of item set 0 those symbols are the terminals &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27; and the nonterminals E and B. To find the item set that each symbol formula_1 leads to, the following procedure is followed for each of the symbols:
# Take the subset, &quot;S&quot;, of all items in the current item set where there is a dot in front of the symbol of interest, &quot;x&quot;.
# For each item in &quot;S&quot;, move the dot to the right of &quot;x&quot;.
# Close the resulting set of items.

For the terminal &#x27;0&#x27; (i.e. where x = &#x27;0&#x27;) this results in:

: Item set 1
: B → 0 

and for the terminal &#x27;1&#x27; (i.e. where x = &#x27;1&#x27;) this results in:

: Item set 2
: B → 1 

and for the nonterminal E (i.e. where x = E) this results in:

: Item set 3
: S → E eof
: E → E * B
: E → E + B

and for the nonterminal B (i.e. where x = B) this results in:

: Item set 4
: E → B 

The closure does not add new items in all cases - in the new sets above, for example, there are no nonterminals following the dot.

Above procedure is continued until no more new item sets are found. For the item sets 1, 2, and 4 there will be no transitions since the dot is not in front of any symbol. For item set 3 though, we have dots in front of terminals &#x27;*&#x27; and &#x27;+&#x27;. For symbol formula_2 the transition goes to:

: Item set 5
: E → E * B
: + B → 0
: + B → 1

and for formula_3 the transition goes to:

: Item set 6
: E → E + B
: + B → 0
: + B → 1

Now, the third iteration begins.

For item set 5, the terminals &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27; and the nonterminal B must be considered, but the resulting closed item sets for the terminals are equal to already found item sets 1 and 2, respectively. For the nonterminal B, the transition goes to:

: Item set 7
: E → E * B 

For item set 6, the terminal &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;1&#x27; and the nonterminal B must be considered, but as before, the resulting item sets for the terminals are equal to the already found item sets 1 and 2. For the nonterminal B the transition goes to:

: Item set 8
: E → E + B 

These final item sets 7 and 8 have no symbols beyond their dots so no more new item sets are added, so the item generating procedure is complete. The finite automaton, with item sets as its states is shown below.

The transition table for the automaton now looks as follows:

=== Constructing the action and goto tables ===

From this table and the found item sets, the action and goto table are constructed as follows:
# The columns for nonterminals are copied to the goto table.
# The columns for the terminals are copied to the action table as shift actions.
# An extra column for &#x27;$&#x27; (end of input) is added to the action table. An &quot;acc&quot; action is added to the &#x27;$&#x27; column for each item set that contains an item of the form S → w eof.
# If an item set &quot;i&quot; contains an item of the form &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; and &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; is rule &quot;m&quot; with &quot;m&quot; &gt; 0 then the row for state &quot;i&quot; in the action table is completely filled with the reduce action r&quot;m&quot;.
The reader may verify that these steps produce the action and goto table presented earlier.

==== A note about LR(0) versus SLR and LALR parsing ====

Only step 4 of the above procedure produces reduce actions, and so all reduce actions must occupy an entire table row, causing the reduction to occur regardless of the next symbol in the input stream. This is why these are LR(0) parse tables: they don&#x27;t do any lookahead (that is, they look ahead zero symbols) before deciding which reduction to perform. A grammar that needs lookahead to disambiguate reductions would require a parse table row containing different reduce actions in different columns, and the above procedure is not capable of creating such rows.
Refinements to the LR(0) table construction procedure (such as SLR and LALR) are capable of constructing reduce actions that do not occupy entire rows. Therefore, they are capable of parsing more grammars than LR(0) parsers.

=== Conflicts in the constructed tables ===

The automaton is constructed in such a way that it is guaranteed to be deterministic. However, when reduce actions are added to the action table it can happen that the same cell is filled with a reduce action and a shift action (a &quot;shift-reduce conflict&quot;) or with two different reduce actions (a &quot;reduce-reduce conflict&quot;). However, it can be shown that when this happens the grammar is not an LR(0) grammar. A classic real-world example of a shift-reduce conflict is the dangling else problem.

A small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a shift-reduce conflict is:

: (1) E → 1 E
: (2) E → 1

One of the item sets found is:

: Item set 1
: E → 1 E
: E → 1 
: + E → 1 E
: + E → 1

There is a shift-reduce conflict in this item set: when constructing the action table according to the rules above, the cell for [item set 1, terminal &#x27;1&#x27;] contains s1 (shift to state 1) and r2 (reduce with grammar rule 2).

A small example of a non-LR(0) grammar with a reduce-reduce conflict is:

: (1) E → A 1
: (2) E → B 2
: (3) A → 1
: (4) B → 1

In this case the following item set is obtained:

: Item set 1
: A → 1 
: B → 1 

There is a reduce-reduce conflict in this item set because in the cells in the action table for this item set there will be both a reduce action for rule 3 and one for rule 4.

Both examples above can be solved by letting the parser use the follow set (see LL parser) of a nonterminal &quot;A&quot; to decide if it is going to use one of &quot;A&quot;s rules for a reduction; it will only use the rule &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot; for a reduction if the next symbol on the input stream is in the follow set of &quot;A&quot;. This solution results in so-called Simple LR parsers.

<doc id="18031" wikidata="Q182046" url="?curid=18031" title="Leon Battista Alberti">
<text>Leon Battista Alberti (; 14 February 1404 – 25 April 1472) was an Italian Renaissance humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher, and cryptographer; he epitomised the nature of those identified now as polymaths. He is considered the founder of Western cryptography, a claim he shares with Johannes Trithemius.

He is often considered primarily an architect. However, according to James Beck, &quot;to single out one of Leon Battista&#x27;s &#x27;fields&#x27; over others as somehow functionally independent and self-sufficient is of no help at all to any effort to characterize Alberti&#x27;s extensive explorations in the fine arts&quot;. Although Alberti is known mostly as an artist, he was also a mathematician
and made significant contributions to that field. Among the most famous buildings he designed are the churches of San Sebastiano (1460) and Sant&#x27;Andrea (1472), both in Mantua.

Alberti&#x27;s life was told in Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Leon Battista Alberti was born in 1404 in Genoa. His mother was Bianca Fieschi. His father, Lorenzo di Benedetto Alberti, was a wealthy Florentine who had been exiled from his own city, but allowed to return in 1428. Alberti was sent to boarding school in Padua, then studied law at Bologna. He lived for a time in Florence, then in 1431 travelled to Rome, where he took holy orders and entered the service of the papal court. During this time he studied the ancient ruins, which excited his interest in architecture and strongly influenced the form of the buildings that he designed.

Leon Battista Alberti was gifted in many ways. He was tall, strong, and a fine athlete who could ride the wildest horse and jump over a person&#x27;s head. He distinguished himself as a writer while still a child at school, and by the age of twenty had written a play that was successfully passed off as a genuine piece of Classical literature. In 1435 he began his first major written work, &quot;Della pittura&quot;, which was inspired by the burgeoning pictorial art in Florence in the early fifteenth century. In this work he analysed the nature of painting and explored the elements of perspective, composition, and colour.

In 1438 he began to focus more on architecture and was encouraged by the Marchese Leonello d&#x27;Este of Ferrara, for whom he built a small triumphal arch to support an equestrian statue of Leonello&#x27;s father. In 1447 Alberti became architectural advisor to Pope Nicholas V and was involved in several projects at the Vatican.

===First major commission===
His first major architectural commission was in 1446 for the façade of the Rucellai Palace in Florence. This was followed in 1450 by a commission from Sigismondo Malatesta to transform the Gothic church of San Francesco in Rimini into a memorial chapel, the Tempio Malatestiano. In Florence, he designed the upper parts of the façade for the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, famously bridging the nave and lower aisles with two ornately inlaid scrolls, solving a visual problem and setting a precedent to be followed by architects of churches for four hundred years. In 1452, he completed , a treatise on architecture, using as its basis the work of Vitruvius and influenced by the ancient roman buildings. The work was not published until 1485. It was followed in 1464 by his less influential work, &quot;De statua&quot;, in which he examines sculpture. Alberti&#x27;s only known sculpture is a self-portrait medallion, sometimes attributed to Pisanello.

Alberti was employed to design two churches in Mantua, San Sebastiano, which was never completed and for which Alberti&#x27;s intention can only be speculated upon, and the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea. The design for the latter church was completed in 1471, a year before Alberti&#x27;s death: the construction was completed after his death and is considered as his most significant work.

===Alberti as artist===
As an artist, Alberti distinguished himself from the contemporary ordinary craftsmen educated in workshops. He was a humanist who studied Aristotle and Plotinus. He was among the rapidly growing group of intellectuals and artists who at that time were supported by the courts of nobility. As a member of a noble family and as part of the Roman curia, Alberti enjoyed special status. He was a welcomed guest at the Este court in Ferrara, and spent time with the soldier-prince Federico III da Montefeltro in Urbino. The Duke of Urbino was a shrewd military commander, who generously funded artists. Alberti planned to dedicate his treatise on architecture to him.

Among Alberti&#x27;s minor but pioneering studies, were an essay on cryptography, &quot;De componendis cifris&quot;, and the first Italian grammar. He collaborated with the Florentine cosmographer Paolo Toscanelli in astronomy, a science close to geography at that time. He also wrote a small Latin work on geography, &quot;Descriptio urbis Romae&quot; (&quot;The Panorama of the City of Rome&quot;). Just a few years before his death, Alberti completed &quot;De iciarchia&quot; (&quot;On Ruling the Household&quot;), a dialogue about Florence during the Medici rule.

Alberti took holy orders and never married. He loved animals and had a pet dog, a mongrel, about whom he wrote a panegyric (&quot;Canis&quot;). Vasari describes Alberti as &quot;an admirable citizen, a man of culture... a friend of talented men, open and courteous with everyone. He always lived honourably and like the gentleman he was.&quot; Alberti died in Rome on 25 April 1472 at the age of 68.

==Publications==

Alberti considered mathematics as the foundation of arts and sciences. &quot;To make clear my exposition in writing this brief commentary on painting,&quot; Alberti began his treatise, &quot;Della Pittura&quot; (On Painting) dedicated to Brunelleschi, &quot;I will take first from the mathematicians those things with which my subject is concerned.&quot;

&quot;Della pittura&quot; (also known in Latin as &quot;De Pictura&quot;) relied on the study classical optics to approach the perspective in artistic and architectural representations. Alberti was well-versed in the sciences of his age. His knowledge of optics was connected to the tradition of the &quot;Kitab al-manazir&quot; (&quot;The Optics&quot;; &quot;De aspectibus&quot;) of the Arab polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham, d. ), which was transmitted by Franciscan optical workshops of the thirteenth-century &quot;Perspectivae&quot; traditions of scholars such as Roger Bacon, John Peckham, and Witelo (similar influences are also traceable in the third commentary of Lorenzo Ghiberti, &quot;Commentario terzo&quot;).

In both &quot;Della pittura&quot; and &quot;De statua&quot;, Alberti stressed that &quot;all steps of learning should be sought from nature&quot;. The ultimate aim of an artist is to imitate nature. Painters and sculptors strive &quot;through by different skills, at the same goal, namely that as nearly as possible the work they have undertaken shall appear to the observer to be similar to the real objects of nature&quot;. However, Alberti did not mean that artists should imitate nature objectively, as it is, but the artist should be especially attentive to beauty, &quot;for in painting beauty is as pleasing as it is necessary&quot;. The work of art is, according to Alberti, so constructed that it is impossible to take anything away from it or to add anything to it, without impairing the beauty of the whole. Beauty was for Alberti &quot;the harmony of all parts in relation to one another,&quot; and subsequently &quot;this concord is realized in a particular number, proportion, and arrangement demanded by harmony&quot;. Alberti&#x27;s thoughts on harmony were not new—they could be traced back to Pythagoras—but he set them in a fresh context, which fit in well with the contemporary aesthetic discourse.

In Rome, Alberti spent considerable time studying its ancient sites, ruins, and arts. His detailed observations, included in his (1452, &quot;On the Art of Building&quot;), were inspired by the essay &quot;De architectura&quot; written by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius (fl. 46–30 BC). Alberti&#x27;s work was the first architectural treatise of the Renaissance. It covered a wide range of subjects, from history to town planning, from engineering to the aesthetics. , a large and expensive book, was not published until 1485, after which it became a major reference for architects. However, the book was written &quot;not only for craftsmen but also for anyone interested in the noble arts&quot;, as Alberti put it. Originally published in Latin, the first Italian edition came out in 1546. and the standard Italian edition by Cosimo Bartoli was published in 1550. Pope Nicholas V, to whom Alberti dedicated the whole work, dreamed of rebuilding the city of Rome, but he managed to realize only a fragment of his visionary plans. Through his book, Alberti opened up his theories and ideals of the Florentine Renaissance to architects, scholars, and others.

Alberti wrote &quot;I Libri della famiglia&quot;—which discussed education, marriage, household management, and money—in the Tuscan dialect. The work was not printed until 1843. Like Erasmus decades later, Alberti stressed the need for a reform in education. He noted that &quot;the care of very young children is women&#x27;s work, for nurses or the mother&quot;, and that at the earliest possible age children should be taught the alphabet. With great hopes, he gave the work to his family to read, but in his autobiography Alberti confesses that &quot;he could hardly avoid feeling rage, moreover, when he saw some of his relatives openly ridiculing both the whole work and the author&#x27;s futile enterprise along it&quot;. &quot;Momus&quot;, written between 1443 and 1450, was a notable comedy about the Olympian deities. It has been considered as a roman à clef—Jupiter has been identified in some sources as Pope Eugenius IV and Pope Nicholas V. Alberti borrowed many of its characters from Lucian, one of his favorite Greek writers. The name of its hero, Momus, refers to the Greek word for blame or criticism. After being expelled from heaven, Momus, the god of mockery, is eventually castrated. Jupiter and the other deities come down to earth also, but they return to heaven after Jupiter breaks his nose in a great storm.

==Architectural works==
Alberti did not concern himself with engineering, and very few of his major projects were built . As a designer and a student of Vitruvius and of ancient Roman architecture, he studied column and lintel based architecture, from a visual rather than structural viewpoint. He correctly employed the Classical orders, unlike his contemporary, Brunelleschi, who used the Classical column and pilaster in a free interpretation. Alberti reflected on the social effects of architecture, and was attentive to the urban landscape. This is demonstrated by his inclusion, at the Rucellai Palace, of a continuous bench for seating at the level of the basement. Alberti anticipated the principle of street hierarchy, with wide main streets connected to secondary streets, and buildings of equal height.

In Rome he was employed by Pope Nicholas V for the restoration of the Roman aqueduct of Acqua Vergine, which debouched into a simple basin designed by Alberti, which was later replaced by the Baroque Trevi Fountain.

Some researchers suggested that the Villa Medici in Fiesole might have been designed by Alberti, rather than by Michelozzo. This hilltop residence commissioned by Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, Cosimo il Vecchio&#x27;s second son, with its view over the city, is sometimes considered the first example of a Renaissance villa: it reflects the writing by Alberti about country residential buildings as &quot;villa suburbana&quot;. The building later inspired numerous other similar projects buildings from the end of the fifteenth century.

===Tempio Malatestiano, Rimini===
The Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini (1447, 1453–60) is the rebuilding of a Gothic church. The façade, with its dynamic play of forms, was left incomplete.

===Façade of Palazzo Rucellai===
The design of the façade of the Palazzo Rucellai (1446–51) was one of several commissioned by the Rucellai family. The design overlays a grid of shallow pilasters and cornices in classical style onto rusticated masonry, and is surmounted by a heavy cornice. The inner courtyard has Corinthian columns. The palace introduced set the use of classical building elements in civic buildings in Florence, and became very influential. The work was executed by Bernardo Rossellino.

===Santa Maria Novella===
At Santa Maria Novella, Florence, between (1448–70) the upper façade was constructed to the design of Alberti. It was a challenging task, as the lower level already had three doorways and six Gothic niches containing tombs and employing the polychrome marble typical of Florentine churches, such as San Miniato al Monte and the Baptistery of Florence. The design also incorporates an ocular window that was already in place. Alberti introduced Classical features around the portico and spread the polychromy over the entire façade in a manner that includes Classical proportions and elements such as pilasters, cornices, and a pediment in the Classical style, ornamented with a sunburst in tesserae, rather than sculpture. The best known feature of this typically aisled church is the manner in which Alberti has solved the problem of visually bridging the different levels of the central nave and much lower side aisles. He employed two large scrolls, which were to become a standard feature of church façades in the later Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical Revival buildings.

===Pienza===

Alberti is considered to have been the consultant for the design of the Piazza Pio II, Pienza. The village, previously called Corsignano, was redesigned beginning around 1459. It was the birthplace of Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, Pope Pius II, in whose employ Alberti served. Pius II wanted to use the village as a retreat, but needed for it to reflect the dignity of his position.

The piazza is a trapezoid shape defined by four buildings, with a focus on Pienza Cathedral and passages on either side opening onto a landscape view. The principal residence, &quot;Palazzo Piccolomini&quot;, is on the western side. It has three stories, articulated by pilasters and entablature courses, with a twin-lighted cross window set within each bay. This structure is similar to Alberti&#x27;s Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and other later palaces. Noteworthy is the internal court of the palazzo. The back of the palace, to the south, is defined by loggia on all three floors that overlook an enclosed Italian Renaissance garden with &quot;Giardino all&#x27;italiana&quot; era modifications, and spectacular views into the distant landscape of the Val d&#x27;Orcia and Pope Pius&#x27;s beloved Mount Amiata beyond. Below this garden is a vaulted stable that had stalls for a hundred horses. The design, which radically transformed the center of the town, included a palace for the pope, a church, a town hall, and a building for the bishops who would accompany the Pope on his trips. Pienza is considered an early example of Renaissance urban planning.

===Sant&#x27; Andrea, Mantua===
The Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea, Mantua was begun in 1471, the year before Alberti&#x27;s death. It was brought to completion and is his most significant work employing the triumphal arch motif, both for its façade and interior, and influencing many works that were to follow. Alberti perceived the role of architect as designer. Unlike Brunelleschi, he had no interest in the construction, leaving the practicalities to builders and the oversight to others.

===Other buildings===
* San Sebastiano, Mantua, (begun 1458) the unfinished façade of which has promoted much speculation as to Alberti&#x27;s intention
* Sepolcro Rucellai in San Pancrazio, 1467)

Giorgio Vasari, who argued that historical progress in art reached its peak in Michelangelo, emphasized Alberti&#x27;s scholarly achievements, not his artistic talents: &quot;He spent his time finding out about the world and studying the proportions of antiquities; but above all, following his natural genius, he concentrated on writing rather than on applied work.&quot; In &quot;On Painting&quot;, Alberti uses the expression &quot;We Painters&quot;, but as a painter, or sculptor, he was a dilettante. &quot;In painting Alberti achieved nothing of any great importance or beauty&quot;, wrote Vasari. &quot;The very few paintings of his that are extant are far from perfect, but this is not surprising since he devoted himself more to his studies than to draughtsmanship.&quot; Jacob Burckhardt portrayed Alberti in &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot; as a truly universal genius. &quot;And Leonardo Da Vinci was to Alberti as the finisher to the beginner, as the master to the dilettante. Would only that Vasari&#x27;s work were here supplemented by a description like that of Alberti! The colossal outlines of Leonardo&#x27;s nature can never be more than dimly and distantly conceived.&quot;

Alberti is said to appear in Mantegna&#x27;s great frescoes in the Camera degli Sposi, as the older man dressed in dark red clothes, who whispers in the ear of Ludovico Gonzaga, the ruler of Mantua. In Alberti&#x27;s self-portrait, a large plaquette, he is clothed as a Roman. To the left of his profile is a winged eye. On the reverse side is the question, &quot;Quid tum?&quot; (what then), taken from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;: &quot;So what, if Amyntas is dark? (&quot;quid tum si fuscus Amyntas?&quot;) Violets are black, and hyacinths are black.&quot;

==Contributions and cultural influence==

Alberti made a variety of contributions to several fields:
* Alberti was the creator of a theory called &quot;historia&quot;. In his treatise &quot;De pictura&quot; (1435) he explains the theory of the accumulation of people, animals, and buildings, which create harmony amongst each other, and &quot;hold the eye of the learned and unlearned spectator for a long while with a certain sense of pleasure and emotion&quot;. &quot;De pictura&quot; (&quot;On Painting&quot;) contained the first scientific study of perspective. An Italian translation of &quot;De pictura&quot; (&quot;Della pittura&quot;) was published in 1436, one year after the original Latin version and addressed Filippo Brunelleschi in the preface. The Latin version had been dedicated to Alberti&#x27;s humanist patron, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga of Mantua. He also wrote works on sculpture, &quot;De statua&quot;.
* Alberti used his artistic treatises to propound a new humanistic theory of art. He drew on his contacts with early Quattrocento artists such as Brunelleschi, Donatello, and Ghiberti to provide a practical handbook for the renaissance artist.
* Alberti wrote an influential work on architecture, , which by the sixteenth century had been translated into Italian (by Cosimo Bartoli), French, Spanish, and English. An English translation was by Giacomo Leoni in the early eighteenth century. Newer translations are now available.
* Whilst Alberti&#x27;s treatises on painting and architecture have been hailed as the founding texts of a new form of art, breaking from the Gothic past, it is impossible to know the extent of their practical impact during his lifetime. His praise of the &quot;Calumny of Apelles&quot; led to several attempts to emulate it, including paintings by Botticelli and Signorelli. His stylistic ideals have been put into practice in the works of Mantegna, Piero della Francesca, and Fra Angelico. But how far Alberti was responsible for these innovations and how far he was simply articulating the trends of the artistic movement, with which his practical experience had made him familiar, is impossible to ascertain.
* He was so a skilled composer of Latin verse: a comedy he wrote when twenty years old, entitled &quot;Philodoxius&quot;, would later deceive the younger Aldus Manutius, who edited and published it as the genuine work of &#x27;Lepidus Comicus&#x27;.

* He has been credited with being the author, or alternatively, the designer of the woodcut illustrations, of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;, a strange fantasy novel.
* Apart from his treatises on the arts, Alberti also wrote: &quot;Philodoxus&quot; (&quot;Lover of Glory&quot;, 1424), &quot;De commodis litterarum atque incommodis&quot; (&quot;On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Literary Studies&quot;, 1429), &quot;Intercoenales&quot; (&quot;Table Talk&quot;, c. 1429), &quot;Della famiglia&quot; (&quot;On the Family&quot;, begun 1432), &quot;Vita S. Potiti&quot; (&quot;Life of St. Potitus&quot;, 1433), &quot;De iure&quot; (On Law, 1437), &quot;Theogenius&quot; (&quot;The Origin of the Gods&quot;, c. 1440), &quot;Profugorium ab aerumna&quot; (&quot;Refuge from Mental Anguish&quot;,), &quot;Momus&quot; (1450), and &quot;De Iciarchia&quot; (&quot;On the Prince&quot;, 1468). These and other works were translated and printed in Venice by the humanist Cosimo Bartoli in 1586.
* Alberti was an accomplished cryptographer by the standard of his day and invented the first polyalphabetic cipher, which is now known as the Alberti cipher, and machine-assisted encryption using his Cipher Disk. The polyalphabetic cipher was, at least in principle (for it was not properly used for several hundred years) the most significant advance in cryptography since classical times. Cryptography historian David Kahn called him the &quot;Father of Western Cryptography&quot;, pointing to three significant advances in the field that can be attributed to Alberti: &quot;the earliest Western exposition of cryptanalysis, the invention of polyalphabetic substitution, and the invention of enciphered code&quot;.
* According to Alberti, in a short autobiography written c. 1438 in Latin and in the third person, (many but not all scholars consider this work to be an autobiography) he was capable of &quot;standing with his feet together, and springing over a man&#x27;s head.&quot; The autobiography survives thanks to an eighteenth-century transcription by Antonio Muratori. Alberti also claimed that he &quot;excelled in all bodily exercises; could, with feet tied, leap over a standing man; could in the great cathedral, throw a coin far up to ring against the vault; amused himself by taming wild horses and climbing mountains&quot;. Needless to say, many in the Renaissance promoted themselves in various ways and Alberti&#x27;s eagerness to promote his skills should be understood, to some extent, within that framework. 
* Alberti claimed in his &quot;autobiography&quot; to be an accomplished musician and organist, but there is no hard evidence to support this claim. In fact, musical posers were not uncommon in his day (see the lyrics to the song &quot;Musica Son&quot;, by Francesco Landini, for complaints to this effect.) He held the appointment of canon in the metropolitan church of Florence, and thus – perhaps – had the leisure to devote himself to this art, but this is only speculation. Vasari also agreed with this.
* He was interested in the drawing of maps and worked with the astronomer, astrologer, and cartographer Paolo Toscanelli.
* In the domain of Aesthetics Alberti is recognized for his definition of art as imitation of nature, exactly as a selection of its most beautiful parts: &quot;So let&#x27;s take from nature what we are going to paint, and from nature we choose the most beautiful and worthy things&quot;.
* Borsi states that Alberti&#x27;s writings on architecture continue to influence modern and contemporary architecture stating: &quot;The organicism and nature-worship of Wright, the neat classicism of van der Mies, the regulatory outlines and anthropomorphic, harmonic, modular systems of Le Corbusier, and Kahn&#x27;s revival of the &#x27;antique&#x27; are all elements that tempt one to trace Alberti&#x27;s influence on modern architecture.&quot;

<doc id="18033" wikidata="Q113531" url="?curid=18033" title="Little Nemo">
<text>Little Nemo is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Winsor McCay. He originated in an early comic strip by McCay, &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, before receiving his own spin-off series, Little Nemo in Slumberland. The full-page weekly strip depicted Nemo having fantastic dreams that were interrupted by his awakening in the final panel. The strip is considered McCay&#x27;s masterpiece for its experiments with the form of the comics page, its use of color and perspective, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, and its architectural and other details.

&quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; ran in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; from October 15, 1905 until July 23, 1911. The strip was renamed In the Land of Wonderful Dreams when McCay brought it to William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot;, where it ran from September 3, 1911 until July 26, 1914. When McCay returned to the &quot;Herald&quot; in 1924, he revived the strip, and it ran under its original title from August 3, 1924 until January 9, 1927, when McCay returned to Hearst.

==Concept==
A weekly fantasy adventure, &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; featured the young Nemo (&quot;No one&quot; in Latin) who dreamed himself into wondrous predicaments from which he awoke in bed in the last panel.

The first episode begins with a command from King Morpheus of Slumberland to a minion to collect Nemo. Nemo was to be the playmate of Slumberland&#x27;s Princess, but it took months of adventures before Nemo finally arrived. A green, cigar-chewing clown named Flip was determined to disturb Nemo&#x27;s sleep with a top hat emblazoned with the words &quot;Wake Up&quot;. Nemo and Flip eventually become companions and are joined by an African Imp whom Flip finds in the Candy Islands. The group travels far and wide, from shanty towns to Mars, to Jack Frost&#x27;s palace, to the bizarre architecture and distorted funhouse-mirror illusions of Befuddle Hall.
The strip shows McCay&#x27;s understanding of dream psychology, particularly of dream fears—falling, drowning, impalement. This dream world has its own moral code, perhaps difficult to understand. Breaking it has terrible consequences as when Nemo ignores instructions not to touch Queen Crystalette who inhabits a cave of glass. Overcome with his infatuation, he causes her and her followers to shatter and awakens with &quot;the groans of the dying guardsmen still ringing in his ears&quot;.
Although the strip began October 15, 1905, with King Morpheus, ruler of Slumberland, making his first attempt to bring Little Nemo to his realm. Nemo did not get into Slumberland until March 4, 1906. Due to Flip&#x27;s interfering, Nemo did not get to see the Princess until July 8. His dream quest is always interrupted, either by his falling out of bed, Nemo suddenly waking up, or by his parents forcing him to wake up.

On July 12, 1908, McCay made a major change of direction: Flip visits Nemo and tells him that he has had his uncle destroy Slumberland (it had been dissolved before, into day, but this time it appeared to be permanent). After this, Nemo&#x27;s dreams take place in his home town, though Flip—and a curious-looking boy named the Professor—accompany him. These adventures range from the down-to-earth to Rarebit-fiend type fantasy; one very commonplace dream had the Professor pelting people with snowballs. The famous &quot;walking bed&quot; story was in this period. Slumberland continued to make sporadic appearances until it returned for good on December 26, 1909.

Story-arcs included Befuddle Hall, a voyage to Mars (with a well-realized Martian civilization), and a trip around the world (including a tour of New York City).

==Style==
McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, and architectural and other detail. From the second installment, McCay had the panel sizes and layouts conform to the action in the strip: as a forest of mushrooms grew, so did the panels, and the panels shrank as the mushrooms collapsed on Nemo. In an early Thanksgiving episode, the focal action of a giant turkey gobbling Nemo&#x27;s house receives an enormous circular panel in the center of the page. McCay also accommodated a sense of proportion with panel size and shape, showing elephants and dragons at a scale the reader could feel in proportion to the regular characters. McCay controlled narrative pacing through variation or repetition, as with equally-sized panels whose repeated layouts and minute differences in movement conveyed a feeling of buildup to some climactic action.

In his familiar Art Nouveau-influenced style, McCay outlined his characters in heavy blacks. Slumberland&#x27;s ornate architecture was reminiscent of the architecture designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White for the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, as well as Luna Park and Dreamland in Coney Island, and the Parisian Luxembourg Palace.

McCay made imaginative use of color, sometimes changing the backgrounds&#x27; or characters&#x27; colors from panel to panel in a psychedelic imitation of a dream experience. The colors were enhanced by the careful attention and advanced Ben Day lithographic process employed by the &quot;Herald&quot;″s printing staff. McCay annotated the &quot;Nemo&quot; pages for the printers with the precise color schemes he wanted.

For the first five months the pages were accompanied with captions beneath them, and at first the captions were numbered. In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in the speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility, and &quot;disfigur otherwise flawless work&quot;, according to critic R. C. Harvey. The level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering highlights what seems to be the little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition.

McCay used ethnic stereotypes prominently in &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, as in the ill-tempered Irishman Flip, and the nearly-mute African Impie.

==Background==
Winsor McCay ( – 1934) had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist in carnivals and dime museums before he began working for newspapers and magazines in 1898. In 1903, he joined the staff of the &quot;New York Herald&quot; family of newspapers, where he had success with comic strips such as &quot;Little Sammy Sneeze&quot; (1904–06). and &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; (1904–11)

In 1905, McCay got &quot;an idea from the &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; to please the little folk&quot;. That October, the full-page Sunday strip &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; debuted in the &quot;Herald&quot;. Considered McCay&#x27;s masterpiece, its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay&#x27;s son Robert, had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel. McCay experimented with the form of the comics page, its timing and pacing, the size and shape of its panels, perspective, architectural and other detail.

==Publication history==
&quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; debuted on the last page of the Sunday comics section of &quot;The New York Herald&quot; newspaper, on October 15, 1905. The full-page, color comic strip ran until July 23, 1911. In spring 1911, McCay moved to William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot; and took &quot;Little Nemo&quot;″s characters with him. The &quot;Herald&quot; held the strip&#x27;s copyright, but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters. In the &quot;American&quot;, the strip ran under the title &quot;In the Land of Wonderful Dreams&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot; was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.

McCay left Hearst in May 1924 and returned to the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;. He began &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; afresh on August 3 of that year. The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid. Nemo took a more passive role in the stories, and there was no continuity. The strip came to an end in January 1927, as it was not popular with readers. Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the &quot;American&quot;, and they succeeded in 1927. Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo&#x27;s success, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.

In 1937, McCay&#x27;s son Robert attempted to carry on his father&#x27;s legacy by reviving &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. Comic book packager Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler&#x27;s syndicate announced a Sunday and daily &quot;Nemo&quot; strip, credited to &quot;Winsor McCay, Jr.&quot; Robert also drew a comic-book version for Chesler called &quot;Nemo in Adventureland&quot; featuring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. Production continued on both after the syndicate was closed in 1938, being utilized in various comic books including Cocomalt Comics and Blue Ribbon, published by MLJ Publications (later Archie Publications). Chesler closed his shop (the first of several times) around 1940. Street &amp; Smith ran Little Nemo in 1942 in &quot;Shadow Comics&quot;. In 1945, McCay was again with Chesler’s shop, producing Little Nemo in Adventureland for Red Seal and Punch Comics until 1947, when the shop closed down for the final time.

In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original &quot;Nemo&quot; strip from McCay&#x27;s original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last. The McCay-Richardson Syndicate distributed this version from approximately March to December 1947.

In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many &quot;Little Nemo&quot; strips at a cartoon studio where McCay&#x27;s son Bob had worked. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of &quot;Little Nemo&quot; strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University.

In 2005, collector Peter Maresca self-published a volume of &quot;Nemo&quot; Sundays as &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland: So Many Splendid Sundays!&quot; via his Sunday Press Books. The volume was large enough to reproduce the pages at their original size, as they appeared in newspapers. Restoration work took Maresca between five and twenty hours per page. A second volume, &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland: Many More Splendid Sundays!&quot;, appeared in 2008.

==Adaptations==
===Theatre===
As early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to put &quot;Little Nemo&quot; on stage. In summer 1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant &quot;Little Nemo&quot; show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. It starred Gabriel Weigel, an actor with dwarfism, as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip. Reviews were positive, and it played to sold-out houses in New York. It went on the road for two seasons. McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where &quot;Little Nemo&quot; played. When a Keith circuit refused to let McCay perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise. In several cities, McCay brought his son, who sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo as publicity.

As part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a &quot;Whiffenpoof&quot;. The word stuck with the public, and became the name of a and a singing group. One reviewer of the 1908 operetta gave a paragraph of praise to the comic hunting tales presented in a scene in which three hunters are trying to outdo each other with hunting stories about the &quot;montimanjack&quot;, the &quot;peninsula&quot;, and the &quot;whiffenpoof&quot;. He calls it &quot;one of the funniest yarns ever spun&quot; and compares it favorably to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s The Hunting of the Snark. One source indicates that the dialogue in fact began as an ad lib by actor Joseph Cawthorn, covering for some kind of backstage problem during a performance. The whiffenpoof is also referred in one of the Little Nemo comic strips published in 1909 (April 11). After being held down by nine policemen during a hysteria crisis, Nemo&#x27;s father tells the doctor: &quot;Just keep those whiffenpoofs away. Will you?&quot;.
The strip for September 26 starts with a hunt for whiffenpoofs but instead the hunters find a &quot;montemaniac&quot; and a &quot;peninsula&quot;.

Despite the show&#x27;s success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses, and came to an end in December 1910. In mid-2012 Toronto-based theatre company Frolick performed an adaptation of the strip into &quot;Adventures in Slumberland&quot;, a multimedia show featuring puppets large and small and a score that included as a refrain &quot;Wake Up Little Nemo&quot;, set to the tune of The Everly Brothers&#x27; 1957 hit &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot;. Talespinner Children&#x27;s Theatre in Cleveland, OH produced a scaled-down, &quot;colorful and high-energy 45-minute&quot; adaptation in 2013, &quot;Adventures In Slumberland&quot; by David Hansen.

In March 2017, a short, one-act adaptation of the &quot;Little Nemo&quot; adventures was staged at Fordham University in New York City. The play, simply entitled &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot;, was written by Aladdin Lee Grant Rutledge Collar, and directed by student Peter McNally. The six person cast, as well as creative team, consisted of students and alums at the university.

===Film===
McCay played an important role in the early history of animation. In 1911, he completed his first film, &quot;Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics&quot; (also known as &quot;Little Nemo&quot;), first in theatres and then as part of his vaudeville act. McCay made the 4,000 rice-paper drawings for the animated portion of the film. The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film&#x27;s total length. Photography was done at the Vitagraph Studios under the supervision of animation pioneer James Stuart Blackton. During the live-action portion of the film, McCay bets his colleagues he can make his drawings move. He wins the bet by animating his &quot;Little Nemo&quot; characters, who shapeshift and transform.

In 1984, Arnaud Sélignac produced and directed a film titled &quot;Nemo&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Dream One&quot;, starring Jason Connery, Harvey Keitel, and Carole Bouquet. It involves a little boy called Nemo, who wears pajamas and travels to a fantasy world, but otherwise the connection to McCay&#x27;s strip is a loose one. The fantasy world is a dark and dismal beach, and Nemo encounters characters from other works of fiction rather than those from the original strip. Instead of Flip or the Princess, Nemo meets Zorro, Alice, and Jules Verne&#x27;s Nautilus (which was led by Captain Nemo).

A joint American-Japanese feature-length film &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; was released in Japan in 1989 and in the United States in August 1992 from Hemdale Film Corporation, with contributions by Ray Bradbury, Chris Columbus, and Moebius, and music by the Sherman Brothers. The story tells of a quest by Nemo and friends to rescue King Morpheus from the Nightmare King. The Princess is named Princess Camille, Flip has a bird companion named Flap, and Nemo has a pet flying squirrel named Icarus. It received mixed reviews from critics, where it earned $11.4 million on a $35 million budget and was a box-office bomb, but it sold well on home video and has since developed into a cult film.

A live-action film adaptation, &quot;Slumberland&quot;, directed by Francis Lawrence, was released in 2022. It features a gender-swapped version of the title character played by Marlow Barkley. Jason Momoa stars as a radically altered version of Flip, who is described as a &quot;nine-foot tall creature that is half-man, half-beast, has shaggy fur and long curved tusks&quot;. The plot centers on Nemo and Flip traveling to Slumberland in search of the former&#x27;s father.

===Opera===
The Sarasota Opera commissioned composer Daron Hagen and librettist J. D. McClatchy to create an opera based on &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. Two casts of children alternated performances when it debuted in November 2012. The dreamlike nonlinear story told of Nemo, the Princess, and their comrades trying to prevent the Emperor of Sol and the Guardian of Dawn from bringing daylight to Slumberland. Special effects and shifting backgrounds were produced with projections onto a scaffolding of boxes. The work was first performed on November 10 and 11, by members of the Sarasota Opera, Sarasota Youth Opera, Sarasota Prep Chorus, The Sailor Circus and students from Booker High school.

===Other media===
In 1990, Capcom produced a video game for the NES, titled &quot;Little Nemo: The Dream Master&quot; (known as &quot;Pajama Hero Nemo&quot; in Japan), a licensed game based on the 1989 film. The film would not see a US release until 1992, two years after the game&#x27;s Japanese release, so the game is often thought to be a standalone adaptation of &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, not related to the film. An arcade game called simply &quot;Nemo&quot; was also released in 1990. In 2021, a new game, titled &quot;Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends&quot; based on the original comic strip was launched on Kickstarter. It is developed by Chris Totten of Pie For Breakfast Studios and Benjamin Cole of PXLPLZ. In 2022, a new game, titled &quot;Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland&quot; based on the original comic strip was launched on Kickstarter. It is developed by Dave Mauro of DIE SOFT. 

Throughout the years, various pieces of Little Nemo merchandise have been produced. In 1941, Rand, McNally &amp; Co. published a Little Nemo children&#x27;s storybook. &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland in 3-D&quot; was released by Blackthorne Publishing in 1987; this reprinted Little Nemo issues with 3-D glasses. A set of 30 Little Nemo postcards was available through Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang in 1996. In 1993, as promotion for the 1989 animated film, Hemdale produced a Collector&#x27;s Set which includes a VHS movie, illustrated storybook, and cassette soundtrack. In 2001, Dark Horse Comics released a Little Nemo statue and tin lunchbox.

== Cultural influences ==
Little Nemo itself is influenced by children stories in general, and some French comic pages in particular. Since its publishing, &quot;Little Nemo&quot; has had an influence on other artists, including Peter Newell (&quot;The Naps of Polly Sleepyhead&quot;), Frank King (&quot;Bobby Make-Believe&quot;), Clare Briggs (&quot;Danny Dreamer&quot;) or George McManus (&quot;Nibsy the Newsboy in Funny Fairyland&quot;). Through the Paris edition of the New York Herald, his influence reached France and other European countries.

In children&#x27;s literature, Maurice Sendak said that this strip inspired his book &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot;, and William Joyce included several elements from Little Nemo in his children&#x27;s book &quot;Santa Calls&quot;, including appearances by Flip and the walking bed. Another tribute to Little Nemo is the comic, then made into a short film, &quot;Little Remo in Pinchmeland&quot;, by Ellen Duthie and Daniela Martagón.

The character and themes from the comic strip &quot;Little Nemo&quot; were used in a song &quot;Scenes from a Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; written by Tony Banks and Phil Collins of the progressive rock group Genesis on their 1978 recording, &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;.

A progressive rock group from Germany named Scara Brae also recorded a musical impression of the comic on their rare self-titled disc from 1981 (the track was actually recorded 2 years earlier). Their concept piece was revived on the second album by the Greek band Anger Department, titled &quot;The Strange Dreams of a Rarebit Fiend&quot;, again after a McCay-comic. Their &quot;Little Nemo&quot; was chosen for a theatre play, which was suggested for the cultural program for the Olympic Games in 2004.

In 1984, Italian comic artist Vittorio Giardino started producing a number of stories under the title &quot;Little Ego&quot;, a parodic adaptation of &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, in the shape of adult-oriented erotic comics. Brian Bolland&#x27;s early comic strip &quot;Little Nympho in Slumberland&quot; employed a similar technique.

The bar in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; is called &#x27;Little Nemo&#x27;s&#x27;.

The strip influenced Alan Moore, in &quot;Miracleman&quot; #4, when the Miracleman family end up in a palace called &quot;Sleepy Town&quot;, which has imagery similar to Little Nemo&#x27;s. In Moore (and J.H. Williams III)&#x27;s &quot;Promethea&quot;, a more direct pastiche – &quot;Little Margie in Misty Magic Land&quot; – showed Moore&#x27;s inspiration and debt to McCay&#x27;s landmark 1905 strip. Little Nemo makes a visual cameo in Volume 4, issue #4 of Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentleman&quot;, during the Shakespearean Theatre scene that includes many other cameos.

The Sandman comics and graphic novel series occasionally references &quot;Little Nemo&quot; as well. Examples include &quot;The Sandman: The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, where an abused child escapes into dreams styled after McCay&#x27;s comics and using a similar &quot;wake-up&quot; mechanism, and &quot;The Sandman: Book of Dreams&quot; (pub. 1996), which features George Alec Effinger&#x27;s short &quot;Seven Nights in Slumberland&quot; (where Nemo interacts with Neil Gaiman&#x27;s characters The Endless).

In 1989, teen comic book Power Pack ran an issue (#47) which paid direct homage to one of McCay&#x27;s Nemo storylines, featuring a castle that was drawn sideways and Katie Power re-enacting a classic Nemo panel with a sideways-drawn hallway that served as a bottomless pit with the line &quot;Don&#x27;t fall in, y&#x27;hear?&quot;

The video of the 1989 song for &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot; by Tom Petty is directly inspired by &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; by Winsor McCay, which features a drawing style reminiscent of McCay&#x27;s and showing Petty and a character who resembles Flip travelling through Slumberland.

The band Queensrÿche paid homage to Little Nemo in their 1990 video Silent Lucidity.

In 1994–1995, French artist Moebius wrote the story to a sequel comic series, &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, drawn by Bruno Marchand in two albums. In 2000–2002, Marchand continued the story with two additional albums.

In 2006, electronic artist Daedelus used Little Nemo artwork for his album &quot;Denies the Day&#x27;s Demise&quot;.

The comic strip &quot;Cul de Sac&quot; includes a strip-within-the-strip, &quot;Little Neuro&quot;, a parody of Little Nemo. Neuro is a little boy who hardly ever leaves his bed.

In 2009, the Pittsburgh ToonSeum established its NEMO Award, given to notable individuals &quot;for excellence in the cartoon arts&quot;. Recipients to date include veteran comic-book artist, Ron Frenz, editorial and comic-strip artist, Dick Locher, cartoonist and comics historian, Trina Robbins, and comics artist, editorial cartoonist and artists&#x27; rights advocate Jerry Robinson.

On October 15, 2012, celebrating the 107th anniversary of the first &quot;Little Nemo&quot; story, Google displayed an interactive animated &quot;Google Doodle&quot; called &quot;Little Nemo in Google-land&quot; on its homepage. The doodle showed a typical Little Nemo adventure through a series of panels, each featuring a letter from the word &quot;Google&quot;. The doodle also ends in the same way as the comic strips, with Nemo falling from his bed.

Eric Shanower and Gabriel Rodriguez revived the characters in 2014 in an IDW comic book series entitled &quot;Little Nemo: Return to Slumberland&quot;. That same year, Locust Moon Press released a new anthology and Taschen published the complete series (1905–1926).

A comic strip &quot;Mutts&quot; has one of the strip&#x27;s recurring characters, a naughty squirrel, &quot;bonking&quot; Nemo with an acorn, and wishing him &quot;sweet dreams&quot;.

==Legacy==

Comics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay &quot;the first original genius of the comic strip medium&quot;. Harvey claims that McCay&#x27;s contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon. Cartoonist Robert Crumb called McCay a &quot;genius&quot; and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot; (2004) appropriated some of McCay&#x27;s imagery, and included a page of &quot;Little Nemo&quot; in its appendix. Federico Fellini read &quot;Little Nemo&quot; in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Il corriere dei piccoli&quot;, and the strip was a &quot;powerful influence&quot; on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella.

McCay&#x27;s original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection survived him, but much of it was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection into his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay&#x27;s surviving artwork remained in family hands.

<doc id="18039" wikidata="Q620765" url="?curid=18039" title="Lydia">
<text>Lydia (; ) was an Iron Age kingdom situated in the west of Asia Minor, in modern-day Turkey. Later, it became an important province of the Achaemenid Empire and then the Roman Empire. Its capital was Sardis.

At some point before 800 BC, the Lydian people achieved some sort of political cohesion, and existed as an independent kingdom by the 600s BC. At its greatest extent, during the 7th century BC, it covered all of western Anatolia. In 546 BC, it became a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, known as &quot;Sparda&quot; in Old Persian. In 133 BC, it became part of the Roman province of Asia.

Lydian coins, made of electrum, are among the oldest in existence, dated to around the 7th century BC.

== Geography ==


Lydia is generally located east of ancient Ionia in the modern western Turkish provinces of Uşak, Manisa and inland Izmir.

The boundaries of historical Lydia varied across the centuries. It was bounded first by Mysia, Caria, Phrygia and coastal Ionia. Later, the military power of Alyattes and Croesus expanded Lydia, which, with its capital at Sardis, controlled all Asia Minor west of the River Halys, except Lycia. After the Persian conquest the River Maeander was regarded as its southern boundary, and during imperial Roman times Lydia comprised the country between Mysia and Caria on the one side and Phrygia and the Aegean Sea on the other.

== Language ==
The Lydian language was an Indo-European language in the Anatolian language family, related to Luwian and Hittite. Due to its fragmentary attestation, the meanings of many words are unknown but much of the grammar has been determined. Similar to other Anatolian languages, it featured extensive use of prefixes and grammatical particles to chain clauses together. Lydian had also undergone extensive syncope, leading to numerous consonant clusters atypical of most Indo-European languages. Lydian became extinct during the 1st century BC.

The Lydian language is usually not categorized as part of the Luwic subgroup, unlike the other nearby Anatolian languages Luwian, Carian, and Lycian.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Lydia&#x27;s early history remains shrouded in obscurity. During the Late Bronze Age (1600 BC-1200 BC), the territory that later became Lydia overlapped with two kingdoms called Mira and Šeḫa, themselves part of a broader political entity called Arzawa. Like the other Arzawa Lands, these kingdoms had tumultuous relations with the Hittite Empire, acting both as allies, enemies, and vassals at various points in time.

By roughly 800 BC, the Lydian people appear to have established their presence and achieved some degree of political cohesion. However, precise dates and events are impossible to determine due to the absence of contemporary written records. The only firm evidence for this early period comes from the archaeological excavations at Sardis. Although certain literary accounts purport the existence of two early Lydian dynasties, namely the house of Atys - after whose son Lydus the Lydians were supposedly named - and the Heraclids, who allegedly ruled for twenty-two generations before 685 BC, these sources are steeped in mythology and lack historical credibility.

===Kingdom of Lydia===

Lydia was an independent kingdom from an unknown time until 546 BC. 

==== Candaules ====
According to Herodotus, one of Lydus&#x27;s descendants was Iardanus, with whom Heracles was in service at one time. Heracles had an affair with one of Iardanus&#x27; slave-girls and their son Alcaeus was the first of the Heraclid Dynasty said to have ruled Lydia for 22 generations starting with Agron. In the 8th century BC, Meles became the 21st and penultimate Heraclid king and the last was his son Candaules (died c. 687 BC).

====The Mermnad Empire (680-546 BC)====

=====Gyges=====
Gyges was the first Lydian king whose existence is demonstrable from contemporary records. According to semi-mythical accounts of his reign, he was the son of a man named Dascylus and came to power by overthrowing King Candaules with the assistance of a Carian prince from Mylasa named Arselis. Gyges&#x27;s rise to power happened in the context of a period of turmoil following the invasion of the Cimmerians, a nomadic people from the Pontic steppe who had invaded Western Asia, who around 675 BC destroyed the previous major power in Anatolia, the kingdom of Phrygia.

Gyges took advantage of the power vacuum created by the Cimmerian invasions to consolidate his kingdom and make it a military power, he contacted the Neo-Assyrian court by sending diplomats to Nineveh to seek help against the Cimmerian invasions, and he attacked the Ionian Greek cities of Miletus, Smyrna, and Colophon. Gyges&#x27;s extensive alliances with the Carian dynasts allowed him to recruit Carian and Ionian Greek soldiers to send overseas to assist the Egyptian king Psamtik I of the city of Sais, with whom he had established contacts around 662 BC. With the help of these armed forces, Psamtik I united Egypt under his rule after eliminating the eleven other kinglets with whom he had been co-ruling Lower Egypt.

In 644 BC, Lydia faced a third attack by the Cimmerians, led by their king Lygdamis. This time, the Lydians were defeated, Sardis was sacked, and Gyges was killed.

=====Ardys and Sadyattes=====

Gyges was succeeded by his son Ardys, who resumed diplomatic activity with Assyria and would also have to face the Cimmerians. Ardys attacked the Ionian Greek city of Miletus and succeeded in capturing the city of Priene, after which Priene would remain under direct rule of the Lydian kingdom until its end.

Ardys&#x27;s reign was short-lived, and in 637 BC, that is in Ardys&#x27;s seventh regnal year, the Thracian Treres tribe who had migrated across the Thracian Bosporus and invaded Anatolia, under their king Kobos, and in alliance with the Cimmerians and the Lycians, attacked Lydia. They defeated the Lydians again and for a second time sacked the Lydian capital of Sardis, except for its citadel. It is probable that Ardys was killed during this Cimmerian attack.

Ardys was succeeded by his son, Sadyattes, who had an even more short-lived reign. Sadyattes died in 635 BC, and it is possible that, like his grandfather Gyges and maybe his father Ardys as well, he died fighting the Cimmerians.

=====Alyattes=====

Amidst extreme turmoil, Sadyattes was succeeded in 635 BC by his son Alyattes, who would transform Lydia into a powerful empire.

Soon after Alyattes&#x27;s ascension and early during his reign, with Assyrian approval and in alliance with the Lydians, the Scythians under their king Madyes entered Anatolia, expelled the Treres from Asia Minor, and defeated the Cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat again, following which the Scythians extended their domination to Central Anatolia until they were themselves expelled by the Medes from Western Asia in the 590s BC. This final defeat of the Cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of Madyes, whom Strabo credits with expelling the Treres and Cimmerians from Asia Minor, and of Alyattes, whom Herodotus and Polyaenus claim finally defeated the Cimmerians.
Alyattes turned towards Phrygia in the east, where extended Lydian rule eastwards to Phrygia. Alyattes continued his expansionist policy in the east, and of all the peoples to the west of the Halys River whom Herodotus claimed Alyattes&#x27;s successor Croesus ruled over - the Lydians, Phrygians, Mysians, Mariandyni, Chalybes, Paphlagonians, Thyni and Bithyni Thracians, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians, and Pamphylians - it is very likely that a number of these populations had already been conquered under Alyattes, and it is not impossible that the Lydians might have subjected Lycia, given that the Lycian coast would have been important for the Lydians because it was close to a trade route connecting the Aegean region, the Levant, and Cyprus.

Alyattes&#x27;s eastern conquests brought the Lydian Empire in conflict in the 590s BC with the Medes, and a war broke out between the Median and Lydian Empires in 590 BC which was waged in eastern Anatolia lasted five years, until a solar eclipse occurred in 585 BC during a battle (hence called the Battle of the Eclipse) opposing the Lydian and Median armies, which both sides interpreted as an omen to end the war. The Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II and the king Syennesis of Cilicia acted as mediators in the ensuing peace treaty, which was sealed by the marriage of the Median king Cyaxares&#x27;s son Astyages with Alyattes&#x27;s daughter Aryenis, and the possible wedding of a daughter of Cyaxares with either Alyattes or with his son Croesus.

=====Croesus=====
Alyattes died shortly after the Battle of the Eclipse, in 585 BC itself, following which Lydia faced a power struggle between his son Pantaleon, born from a Greek woman, and his other son Croesus, born from a Carian noblewoman, out of which the latter emerged successful.

Croesus brought Caria under the direct control of the Lydian Empire, and he subjugated all of mainland Ionia, Aeolis, and Doris, but he abandoned his plans of annexing the Greek city-states on the islands of the Aegean Sea and he instead concluded treaties of friendship with them, which might have helped him participate in the lucrative trade the Aegean Greeks carried out with Egypt at Naucratis. According to Herodotus, Croesus ruled over all the peoples to the west of the Halys River, although the actual border of his kingdom was further to the east of the Halys, at an undetermined point in eastern Anatolia.

Croesus continued the friendly relations with the Medes concluded between his father Alyattes and the Median king Cyaxares, and he continued these good relations with the Medes after he succeeded Alyattes and Astyages succeeded Cyaxares. And, under Croesus&#x27;s rule, Lydia continued its good relations started by Gyges with the Saite Egyptian kingdom, then ruled by the pharaoh Amasis II. Croesus also established trade and diplomatic relations with the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nabonidus, and he further increased his contacts with the Greeks on the European continent by establishing relations with the city-state of Sparta.

In 550 BC, Croesus&#x27;s brother-in-law, the Median king Astyages, was overthrown by his own grandson, the Persian king Cyrus the Great, and Croesus responded by attacking Pteria, the capital of a Phrygian state vassal to the Lydians which might have attempted to declare its allegiance to the new Persian Empire of Cyrus. Cyrus retaliated by intervening in Cappadocia and defeated the Lydians at Pteria in a battle, and again at Thymbra before besieging and capturing the Lydian capital of Sardis, thus bringing an end to the rule of the Mermnad dynasty and to the Lydian Empire. Lydia would never regain its independence and would remain a part of various successive empires.

Although the dates for the battles of Pteria and Thymbra and of end of the Lydian empire have been traditionally fixed to 547 BC, more recent estimates suggest that Herodotus&#x27;s account being unreliable chronologically concerning the fall of Lydia means that there are currently no ways of dating the end of the Lydian kingdom; theoretically, it may even have taken place after the fall of Babylon in 539 BC.

===Persian Empire===

In 547 BC, the Lydian king Croesus besieged and captured the Persian city of Pteria in Cappadocia and enslaved its inhabitants. The Persian king Cyrus The Great marched with his army against the Lydians. The Battle of Pteria resulted in a stalemate, forcing the Lydians to retreat to their capital city of Sardis. Some months later the Persian and Lydian kings met at the Battle of Thymbra. Cyrus won and captured the capital city of Sardis by 546 BC. Lydia became a province (satrapy) of the Persian Empire.

=== Hellenistic Empire ===
Lydia remained a satrapy after Persia&#x27;s conquest by the Macedonian king Alexander III (the Great) of Macedon.
When Alexander&#x27;s empire ended after his death, Lydia was possessed by the major Asian diadoch dynasty, the Seleucids, and when it was unable to maintain its territory in Asia Minor, Lydia was acquired by the Attalid dynasty of Pergamum. Its last king avoided the spoils and ravage of a Roman war of conquest by leaving the realm by testament to the Roman Empire.

=== Roman province of Asia ===

When the Romans entered the capital Sardis in 133 BC, Lydia, as the other western parts of the Attalid legacy, became part of the province of Asia, a very rich Roman province, worthy of a governor with the high rank of proconsul. The whole west of Asia Minor had Jewish colonies very early, and Christianity was also soon present there. Acts of the Apostles 16:14–15 mentions the baptism of a merchant woman called &quot;Lydia&quot; from Thyatira, known as Lydia of Thyatira, in what had once been the satrapy of Lydia. Christianity spread rapidly during the 3rd century AD, based on the nearby Exarchate of Ephesus.

=== Roman province of Lydia ===

Under the tetrarchy reform of Emperor Diocletian in 296 AD, Lydia was revived as the name of a separate Roman province, much smaller than the former satrapy, with its capital at Sardis.
Together with the provinces of Caria, Hellespontus, Lycia, Pamphylia, Phrygia prima and Phrygia secunda, Pisidia (all in modern Turkey) and the Insulae (Ionian islands, mostly in modern Greece), it formed the diocese (under a &quot;vicarius&quot;) of Asiana, which was part of the praetorian prefecture of Oriens, together with the dioceses Pontiana (most of the rest of Asia Minor), Oriens proper (mainly Syria), Aegyptus (Egypt) and Thraciae (on the Balkans, roughly Bulgaria).

=== Eastern Roman Empire (and Crusader) age ===
Under the Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius (610–641), Lydia became part of Anatolikon, one of the original &quot;themata&quot;, and later of Thrakesion. Although the Seljuk Turks conquered most of the rest of Anatolia, forming the Sultanate of Ikonion (Konya), Lydia remained part of the Byzantine Empire. While the Venetians occupied Constantinople and Greece as a result of the Fourth Crusade, Lydia continued as a part of the Eastern Roman rump state called the Nicene Empire based at Nicaea until 1261.

=== Under Turkish rule ===
Lydia was captured finally by Turkish &quot;beyliks&quot;, which were all absorbed by the Ottoman state in 1390. The area became part of the Ottoman Aidin Vilayet (&quot;province&quot;), and is now in the modern republic of Turkey.

=== Legacy ===

==== First coinage ====

According to Herodotus, the Lydians were the first people to use gold and silver coins and the first to establish retail shops in permanent locations. It is not known, however, whether Herodotus meant that the Lydians were the first to use coins of pure gold and pure silver or the first precious metal coins in general. Despite this ambiguity, this statement of Herodotus is one of the pieces of evidence most often cited on behalf of the argument that Lydians invented coinage, at least in the West, although the first coins (under Alyattes I, reigned c.591–c.560 BC) were neither gold nor silver but an alloy of the two called electrum.

The dating of these first stamped coins is one of the most frequently debated topics of ancient numismatics, with dates ranging from 700 BC to 550 BC, but the most common opinion is that they were minted at or near the beginning of the reign of King Alyattes (sometimes referred to incorrectly as Alyattes II). The first coins were made of electrum, an alloy of gold and silver that occurs naturally but that was further debased by the Lydians with added silver and copper.

The largest of these coins are commonly referred to as a 1/3 stater (&quot;trite&quot;) denomination, weighing around 4.7 grams, though no full staters of this type have ever been found, and the 1/3 stater probably should be referred to more correctly as a stater, after a type of a transversely held scale, the weights used in such a scale (from ancient Greek ίστημι=to stand), which also means &quot;standard.&quot; These coins were stamped with a lion&#x27;s head adorned with what is likely a sunburst, which was the king&#x27;s symbol. The most prolific mint for early electrum coins was Sardis which produced large quantities of the lion head thirds, sixths and twelfths along with lion paw fractions. To complement the largest denomination, fractions were made, including a &quot;hekte&quot; (sixth), &quot;hemihekte&quot; (twelfth), and so forth down to a 96th, with the 1/96 stater weighing only about 0.15 grams. There is disagreement, however, over whether the fractions below the twelfth are actually Lydian.

Alyattes&#x27; son was Croesus (Reigned c.560–c.546 BC), who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the &quot;Croeseid&quot;, the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, and the world&#x27;s first bimetallic monetary system circa 550 BC.

It took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day&#x27;s subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. The first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, Hemiobol, Ancient Greek coinage minted in Cyme (Aeolis) under Hermodike II then by the Ionian Greeks in the late sixth century BC.

Sardis was renowned as a beautiful city. Around 550 BC, near the beginning of his reign, Croesus paid for the construction of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, which became one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world. Croesus was defeated in battle by Cyrus II of Persia in 546 BC, with the Lydian kingdom losing its autonomy and becoming a Persian satrapy.

==== In Greek mythology ====
For the Greeks, Tantalus was a primordial ruler of mythic Lydia, and Niobe his proud daughter; her husband Amphion associated Lydia with Thebes in Greece, and through Pelops the line of Tantalus was part of the founding myths of Mycenae&#x27;s second dynasty. (In reference to the myth of Bellerophon, Karl Kerenyi remarked, in &quot;The Heroes of The Greeks&quot; 1959, p. 83. &quot;As Lykia was thus connected with Crete, and as the person of Pelops, the hero of Olympia, connected Lydia with the Peloponnesos, so Bellerophontes connected another Asian country, or rather two, Lykia and Karia, with the kingdom of Argos&quot;.)
In Greek myth, Lydia had also adopted the double-axe symbol, that also appears in the Mycenaean civilization, the &quot;labrys&quot;. Omphale, daughter of Iardanos, was a princess of Lydia, whom Heracles was required to serve for a time. His adventures in Lydia are the adventures of a Greek hero in a peripheral and foreign land: during his stay, Heracles enslaved the Itones; killed Syleus, who forced passers-by to hoe his vineyard; slew the serpent of the river Sangarios (which appears in the heavens as the constellation Ophiucus) and captured the simian tricksters, the Cercopes. Accounts tell of at least one son of Heracles who was born to either Omphale or a slave-girl: Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; i. 7) says this was Alcaeus who began the line of Lydian Heracleidae which ended with the death of Candaules c. 687 BC. Diodorus Siculus (4.31.8) and Ovid (&quot;Heroides&quot; 9.54) mentions a son called Lamos, while pseudo-Apollodorus (&quot;Bibliotheke&quot; 2.7.8) gives the name Agelaus and Pausanias (2.21.3) names Tyrsenus as the son of Heracles by &quot;the Lydian woman&quot;. All three heroic ancestors indicate a Lydian dynasty claiming Heracles as their ancestor. Herodotus (1.7) refers to a Heraclid dynasty of kings who ruled Lydia, yet were perhaps not descended from Omphale. He also mentions (1.94) the legend that the Etruscan civilization was founded by colonists from Lydia led by Tyrrhenus, brother of Lydus. Dionysius of Halicarnassus was skeptical of this story, indicating that the Etruscan language and customs were known to be totally dissimilar to those of the Lydians. In addition, the story of the &quot;Lydian&quot; origins of the Etruscans was not known to Xanthus of Lydia, an authority on the history of the Lydians.

Later chronologists ignored Herodotus&#x27; statement that Agron was the first Heraclid to be a king, and included his immediate forefathers Alcaeus, Belus, and Ninus in their list of kings of Lydia. Strabo (5.2.2) has Atys, father of Lydus and Tyrrhenus, as a descendant of Heracles and Omphale but that contradicts virtually all other accounts which name Atys, Lydus, and Tyrrhenus among the pre-Heraclid kings and princes of Lydia. The gold deposits in the river Pactolus that were the source of the proverbial wealth of Croesus (Lydia&#x27;s last king) were said to have been left there when the legendary king Midas of Phrygia washed away the &quot;Midas touch&quot; in its waters.
In Euripides&#x27; tragedy &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, Dionysus, while maintaining his human disguise, declares his country to be Lydia.

==== Lydians, the Tyrrhenians and the Etruscans ====

The relationship between the Etruscans of northern and central Italy and the Lydians has long been a subject of conjecture. The Greek historian Herodotus believed they came from Lydia, but Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a 1st-century BC historian, argued that the Etruscans were indigenous to Italy and unrelated to the Lydians. Dionysius pointed out that the 5th-century historian Xanthus of Lydia, who was regarded as an important source and authority for the history of Lydia, never linked the Etruscans to Lydia or mentioned Tyrrhenus as a Lydian ruler.

In contemporary scholarship, Etruscologists overwhelmingly support an indigenous origin for the Etruscans, dismissing Herodotus&#x27; account as based on erroneous etymologies. Michael Grant argue that the Etruscans may have propagated this narrative to facilitate their trading in Asia Minor, when many cities in Asia Minor, and the Etruscans themselves, were at war with the Greeks. The French scholar Dominique Briquel contends that &quot;the story of an exodus from Lydia to Italy was a deliberate political fabrication created in the Hellenized milieu of the court at Sardis in the early 6th century BC.&quot; Ultimately, these Greek-authored accounts of the Etruscan origins are only the expression of the image that Etruscans&#x27; allies or adversaries wanted to divulge and should not be considered historical.

Archaeological evidence does not support the idea of Lydian migration to Etruria. The Etruscan civilization&#x27;s earliest phase, the Villanovan culture, emerged around 900 BC, which itself developed from the previous Proto-Villanovan culture of Italy in the late Bronze Age. This culture has no ties to Asia Minor or the Near East. Linguists have identified an Etruscan-like language in a set of inscriptions on Lemnos island, in the Aegean Sea. Since the Etruscan language was a Pre-Indo-European language and neither Indo-European or Semitic, Etruscan was not related to Lydian, which was a part of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European languages. Instead, Etruscan language is considered part of the pre-Indo-European Tyrrhenian language family, along with the Lemnian and Rhaetian language.

A 2013 genetic study suggested that the maternal lineages of western Anatolians and modern Tuscans had been largely separate for 5,000 to 10,000 years, with Etruscan mtDNA closely resembling modern Tuscans and Neolithic Central European populations. This suggests Etruscans descended from the Villanovan culture, indicating their indigenous roots, and a link between Etruria, modern Tuscany, and Lydia dating back to the Neolithic period during the migration of Early European Farmers from Anatolia to Europe. A 2019 genetic study revealed that Etruscans (900–600 BC) and Latins (900–500 BC) from Latium vetus shared genetic similarities, with both groups having a mixture of two-thirds Copper Age ancestry and one-third Steppe-related ancestry. This study also suggested indigenous origins for the Etruscans, despite their pre-Indo-European language.

A 2021 study confirmed these findings, showing that Etruscans and Latins in the Iron Age had similar genetic profiles and were part of the European cluster. The Etruscan DNA was completely absent a signal of recent admixture with Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean. Etruscans exhibited a blend of WHG, EEF, and Steppe ancestry, with 75% of males belonging to haplogroup R1b and the most common mitochondrial DNA haplogroup being H.

===Religion===
==== Early Lydian religion ====

The Lydians in early Antiquity adhered to a religion which remains marginally attested due to the known sources covering it being largely of Greek origin, while Lydian inscriptions regarding religion are small in number and no Lydian corpus of ritual texts like the Hittite ritual tablets have been recovered.

Despite the small size of the recorded Lydian corpus, the various inscriptions relating to religion date from to , thus covering the period beginning with the establishment of the Mermnad dynasty under Gyges and ending with the aftermath of the Macedonian conquest under Alexander III and the beginning of the Hellenistic period. Based on limited evidence, Lydian religious practices were centred around the fertility of nature, as was common among ancient societies which depended on the successful cultivation of land.

The early Lydian religion exhibited strong connections to Anatolian as well as Greek traditions, and its pantheon was composed of native Lydian deities who were reflexes of earlier Aegean-Balkan ones, as well as Anatolian deities, the latter of whom held lesser roles.

Although Lydia had been conquered by the Achaemenid Empire in , native Lydian traditions were not destroyed by Persian rule, and most Lydian inscriptions were written during this period.

The Lydian religion was polytheistic in nature and was composed of a number of deities:
*unlike traditionally Anatolian pantheons but similarly to the Phrygian one, the Lydian pantheon was headed by the goddess Artimus (), who was a deity of wild nature as well as the Lydian variant of an earlier Aegean-Balkan goddess whose other reflexes included the Greek Artemis () and the Phrygian Artimis: Artimus is the most well-attested Lydian deities both in the Lydian corpus and archaeologically;
*the identity of the figure of Qaλdãns or Qaλiyãns () is still uncertain, and has been variously interpreted as the Lydian king of the gods, or a Moon-god who was the main masculine deity of the Lydian pantheon and the consort of Artimus, or the Lydian equivalent of the Greek god Apollo (), or a high status or royal title. While &quot;Qldans&quot; was once thought to be a theonymic, and referring to Apollo, it has recently become known that a Lydian coin also mentions the name &quot;Qλdãns&quot; in its legend. Thus, the earlier interpretations as a deity should be revised.

*The Lydian equivalent of the Greek god Zeus () and the Phrygian god Tiws was Lews () or Lefs (): Unlike the Anatolian storm-god Tarḫuntas, Lews held a less prominent role in the Lydian religion, although his role as the bringer of rain followed the tradition surrounding the Anatolian Tarḫuntas;
*the goddess Lamẽtrus () was the Lydian reflex of an earlier Aegean-Balkan goddess whose Greek iteration was Dēmētēr ();
*the frenzy god Pakiš () to whom was performed an orgiastic cult was also a Lydian variant of an older Aegean-Balkan god whose Greek reflex was Bakkhos ();
*the goddess Kufaws () or Kuwaws (), referred by the Greeks as (), was a young goddess of divine frenzy, as well as a prominent Lydian deity possessing an important temple in Sardis;
*the existence of the goddess Korē () is attested only during the Hellenistic and Roman periods, when the festival of Khrysanthina () was celebrated at Sardis in her honour, and she appears to have had some vegetative aspects;
*the god Sãntas (), whose name corresponds to that of the Luwian Šandas (), might have been the consort of Kufaws;
**accompanying Sãntas were several lesser demon-like figures called the Mariwdas (), who were the Lydian equivalent of the deities attested in Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions as the Marwainzi ();
*the goddess Maλiš (), who corresponded to the Anatolian goddess Maliya, attested in Hittite as () and Lycian as (), possessed a vegetative aspect, being a goddess of vegetation, especially of wine and corn.

Because of a lack of evidence, little is known on the organisation of Lydian cults.

Due to the meagre evidence for Lydian religious spaces, little is known about their shapes, sizes, administration, and location: Lydian cultic spaces ranged from small places of worship to prestigious temples of the state cult which also had a political role, although the evidence for them dates from after the end of Lydian independence, while those from the Lydian empire are primarily known from Greek literature rather than from archaeological evidence.

The early Lydian religion possessed at least three cultic officiants, consisting of:
* (), who were priests and priestesses;
* (), who were involved in the cult of Artimus;
* (), who might have been prophets.

In addition to these clerical offices, the religious role of the kings among other Anatolian peoples suggests that Lydian kings were also religious high functionaries who participated in the cult as a representative of divine power on earth and claimed their legitimacy to rule from the gods. Anatolian and Hellenistic Greek parallels also suggest that Lydian kings might have been deified after their deaths.

==== Christianity ====
Lydia later had numerous Christian communities and, after Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Lydia became one of the provinces of the diocese of Asia in the Patriarchate of Constantinople. 
The ecclesiastical province of Lydia had a metropolitan diocese at Sardis and suffragan dioceses for Philadelphia, Thyatira, Tripolis, Settae, Gordus, Tralles, Silandus, Maeonia, Apollonos Hierum, Mostene, Apollonias, Attalia, Hyrcania, Bage, Balandus, Hermocapella, Hierocaesarea, Acrassus, Dalda, Stratonicia, Cerasa, Gabala, Satala, Aureliopolis and Hellenopolis. Bishops from the various dioceses of Lydia were well represented at the Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.

<text>Land&#x27;s End ( or &quot;Pedn an Wlas&quot;) is a headland and tourist and holiday complex in western Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, on the Penwith peninsula about west-south-west of Penzance at the western end of the A30 road. To the east of it is the English Channel, and to the west the Celtic Sea.

Land&#x27;s End is the most westerly point of mainland England. However, it is not the westernmost point on mainland Great Britain. This title narrowly goes to Corrachadh Mòr in the Scottish Highlands.

==Geography==
The actual Land&#x27;s End, or Peal Point, is a modest headland compared with nearby headlands such as Pedn-men-dhu overlooking Sennen Cove and Pordenack, to the south. The present hotel and tourist complex is at Carn Kez, south of the actual Land&#x27;s End. Land&#x27;s End has a particular resonance because it is often used to suggest distance. Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats in Scotland is a distance of by road and this &quot;Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats&quot; distance is often used to define charitable events such as end-to-end walks and races in the UK. Land&#x27;s End to the northernmost point of England is a distance of by road.

The westernmost promontory at Land&#x27;s End is known as Dr Syntax&#x27;s Head. The character Dr Syntax was invented by the writer William Combe in his 1809 comic verse &quot;The Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque&quot;, which satirised the work of seekers of the &quot;picturesque&quot; such as William Gilpin. A nearby promontory is called Dr Johnson&#x27;s Head after Samuel Johnson, who referred to a hypothetical Cornish declaration of independence in his 1775 essay &quot;Taxation no Tyranny&quot;.

The area around Land&#x27;s End has been designated part of an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for rare species of flora.

Land&#x27;s End is a popular venue for rock climbers.

The Longships, a group of rocky islets are just over offshore, and together with the Seven Stones Reef and the Isles of Scilly which lie about southwest – are part of the mythical lost land of Lyonesse, referred to in Arthurian literature.

==Geology==
The cliffs are made of granite, an igneous rock, which means they are resistant to weathering, and have steep cliff faces. There are two varieties of granite represented at Land&#x27;s End. Adjacent to the hotel the granite is coarse-grained with large phenocrysts of orthoclase, sometimes more than in length. To the north, at the First and Last House, there is a finer-grained granite with fewer and smaller phenocrysts, and the different granites can be seen from a distance by the smoother weathering of the finer variety. The granite dates to 268–275 million years ago of the Permian period. The contact zone between the Land&#x27;s End granite pluton and the altered &quot;country rocks&quot; is nearby and the Longships Lighthouse, offshore, is built on the country rock.

==History==
In 1769, the antiquarian William Borlase wrote:
Of this time we are to understand what Edward I. says (Sheringham. p. 129.) that Britain, Wales, and Cornwall, were the portion of Belinus, elder son of Dunwallo, and that that part of the Island, afterwards called England, was divided in three shares, viz. Britain, which reached from the Tweed, Westward, as far as the river Ex; Wales inclosed by the rivers Severn, and Dee; and Cornwall from the river Ex to the Land&#x27;s-End.

Tourists have been visiting Land&#x27;s End for over three hundred years. In 1649, an early visitor was the poet John Taylor, who was hoping to find subscribers for his new book &quot;Wanderings to see the Wonders of the West&quot;. In 1878 people left Penzance by horse-drawn vehicles from outside the Queens and Union hotels and travelled via St Buryan and Treen, to see the Logan Rock. There was a short stop to look at Porthcurno and the Eastern Telegraph Company followed by refreshments at the First and Last Inn in Sennen. They then headed for Land&#x27;s End, often on foot or horse, because of the uneven and muddy lanes. Over one hundred people could be at Land&#x27;s End at any one time. At Carn Kez, the First and Last Inn owned a small house which looked after the horses while visitors roamed the cliffs. The house at Carn Kez developed into the present hotel. The earliest part of the house was damaged by the Luftwaffe when a plane returning from a raid on Cardiff jettisoned its remaining bombs. 53 fisherman were injured or killed. In the build-up to D-Day American troops were billeted in the hotel leaving the building in a bad state.
Land&#x27;s End was owned by a Cornish family until 1982, when it was sold to David Goldstone. In 1987, Peter de Savary outbid the National Trust to purchase Land&#x27;s End for almost £7 million from David Goldstone. He had two new buildings erected and much of the present theme park development was instigated by him. He sold both Land&#x27;s End and John o&#x27; Groats to businessman Graham Ferguson Lacey in 1991. The current owners purchased Land&#x27;s End in 1996 and formed a company named Heritage Great Britain PLC. Attractions at the theme park include children&#x27;s playgrounds and recorded music. Twice a week in August, Land&#x27;s End hosts &#x27;Magic in the Skies&#x27;, a night-time firework spectacular with music by British composer Christopher Bond and narrated by actress Miriam Margolyes. Within the complex is the Land&#x27;s End Hotel.

On 6 May 1985, four schoolchildren died in what is known as the Land&#x27;s End disaster.

In May 2012, Land&#x27;s End received worldwide publicity as the starting point of the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay.

===End to end===
Land&#x27;s End is either the start or finishing point of end to end journeys with John o&#x27; Groats in Scotland. One of the earliest was by Carlisle who left Land&#x27;s End on 23 September 1879, went to John O&#x27;Groats House and arrived back at Land&#x27;s End on 15 December; taking 72 days (exclusive of Sundays); covering . To prove his journey, he kept a log book which was stamped at any post office he passed. An early end to end on bicycle was completed by Messrs Blackwell and Harman of Canonbury Bicycle Club. Starting at Land&#x27;s End they covered in thirteen days in July/August 1880. Nearly two years later the Hon I Keith-Falconer travelled from Land&#x27;s End, in twelve days, 23 hours, on a bicycle.

==Greeb==
On the south side of Carn Kez the land slopes away to a shallow valley containing a small stream and the former Greeb Farm. In 1879 a derrick was used for hauling seaweed from the beach 40 feet below for use as a soil improver.

== Portrayal in literature, music and film ==
*On the 1980 album &quot;Gradually Going Tornado&quot; by British jazzrock band Bruford, a song written by keyboardist Dave Stewart lasting 10.20 is featured.

<doc id="18041" wikidata="Q30027082" url="?curid=18041" title="Liber Memorialis">
<text>The Liber Memorialis is an ancient book in Latin featuring an extremely concise summary—a kind of index—of universal history from earliest times to the reign of Trajan. It was written by Lucius Ampelius, who was possibly a tutor or schoolmaster. 

==Description==
The book is dedicated to a Macrinus, who may have been the emperor who reigned 217–218, but that name was not uncommon, and it seems more likely he was simply a young man with a thirst for universal knowledge, which the book was compiled to satisfy.

The book&#x27;s object and scope are indicated in its dedication:
The &quot;Liber Memorialis&quot; seems to have been intended as a textbook to be learned by heart. This little work, in fifty chapters, gives a sketch of cosmography, geography, mythology (Chapters I-X), and history (Chapters X to end). The historical portion, dealing mainly with the republican period, is untrustworthy and the text in many places corrupt; the earlier chapters are more valuable, and contain some interesting information.

Chapter VIII (&quot;Miracula Mundi&quot;) contains the following, the only reference by an ancient writer to the famous sculptures of the Pergamon Altar, which were discovered in 1871, excavated in 1878, and are now in Berlin:

==Date==
Nothing is known of the date at which the work was written; the times of Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, the beginning of the 3rd century have all been suggested. However, in Chapter V De Orbe Terrarum (The World), Ampelius refers to the &quot;Tigris and Euphrates in Parthia,&quot; which suggests that Ampelius wrote before the Sassanians overthrew the Parthians in 224.

==Editions==
The first edition of the &quot;Liber Memorialis&quot; was published in 1638 by Claudius Salmasius (Saumaise) from the Dijon manuscript, now lost, together with the &quot;Epitome&quot; of Florus. An 1873 edition by Wölfflin was based on Salmasius&#x27;s copy of the lost codex. The more recent editions are
* Erwin Assmann&#x27;s Teubner edition of 1935
* Nicola Terzaghi&#x27;s edition, published by Chiantore in Turin ca. 1947 (preface dated 1943)
* Marie-Pierre Arnaud-Lidet&#x27;s 1993 edition for the Collection Budé (includes French translation)

<doc id="18043" wikidata="Q1801816" url="?curid=18043" title="Lancelot Andrewes">
<text>Lancelot Andrewes (155525 September 1626) was an English bishop and scholar, who held high positions in the Church of England during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. During the latter&#x27;s reign, Andrewes served successively as Bishop of Chichester, of Ely, and of Winchester and oversaw the translation of the King James Version of the Bible (or Authorized Version). In the Church of England he is commemorated on 25 September with a lesser festival.

== Early life, education and ordination ==

Andrewes was born in 1555 near All Hallows, Barking, by the Tower of London, of an ancient Suffolk family later domiciled at Chichester Hall, at Rawreth in Essex; his father, Thomas, was master of Trinity House. Andrewes attended the Cooper&#x27;s free school in Ratcliff in the parish of Stepney and then the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School under Richard Mulcaster. In 1571 he entered Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, proceeding to a Master of Arts degree in 1578. His academic reputation spread so quickly that on the foundation in 1571 of Jesus College, Oxford he was named in the charter as one of the founding scholars &quot;without his privity&quot; (Isaacson, 1650); his connection with the college seems to have been purely notional, however. In 1576 he was elected fellow of Pembroke College; on 11 June 1580 he was ordained a priest by William Chaderton, Bishop of Chester, and in 1581 was incorporated Master of Arts (MA) at Oxford. As catechist at his college he read lectures on the Decalogue (published in 1630), which aroused great interest.

Once a year he would spend a month with his parents and, during this vacation, he would find a master from whom he would learn a language of which he had no previous knowledge. In this way, after a few years, he acquired most of the modern languages of Europe.

Andrewes was the elder brother of the scholar and cleric Roger Andrewes, who also served as a translator for the King James Version of the Bible.

== During Elizabeth&#x27;s reign ==

In 1588, following a period as chaplain to Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, Lord President of the Council in the North, he became vicar of St Giles, Cripplegate, in the City of London, where he delivered striking sermons on the temptation in the wilderness and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. In a sermon (during Easter week) on 10 April 1588, he stoutly vindicated the Reformed character of the Church of England against the claims of Roman Catholicism and adduced John Calvin as a new writer, with lavish praise and affection.

Yet, Andrewes was certainly no Calvinist. It has been said that he developed a proto-Arminian soteriology while at Cambridge and that he maintained this non-Calvinist theology throughout his life. He made it a point to refuse to repeat the common Calvinist slogans of his time. During the first half of the seventeenth century, he claimed that Calvinism was incompatible with civil government, preaching, and ministry. Throughout his sermons, he unashamedly criticized Calvinist doctrine and practice. He has been referred to as an avant-garde conformist, which is understood as an implicitly proto-Arminian precursor to Laudianism and explicit English-Arminianism. He outright decried the translation and Calvinistic notes in the Geneva translation of the Bible. He taught that God condemned Cain for his own freely chosen sin and he denied that God unconditionally predestined any to salvation or that he unconditionally condemned anyone. He argued for soteriological synergism, using Lot&#x27;s wife as a picture that one&#x27;s salvation is not secure post-conversion apart from an ongoing and freely chosen cooperation with God&#x27;s saving grace. John Overall and Andrewes were more sympathetic to the Remonstrants than the Calvinists at the time of the Synod of Dort. Andrewes, out of fear, denied his support for the Remonstrants when letters sent to him from that party were intercepted. He was not on friendly terms with the delegates to the synod and he made it clear that he did not support the results. He and the Remonstrants attempted to use the ecclesiological similarities between the Contra-Remonstrants and the Puritans to persuade James I not to involve himself in the Synod of Dort or to support the Remonstrant cause if he did.

Through the influence of Francis Walsingham, Andrewes was appointed prebendary of St Pancras in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, in 1589, and subsequently became master of his own college of Pembroke, as well as a chaplain to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury. From 1589 to 1609 he was prebendary of Southwell. On 4 March 1590, as a chaplain of Elizabeth I, he preached before her an outspoken sermon and, in October that year, gave his introductory lecture at St Paul&#x27;s, undertaking to comment on the first four chapters of the Book of Genesis. These were later compiled as &quot;The Orphan Lectures&quot; (1657).

Andrewes liked to move among the people, yet found time to join a society of antiquaries, of which Walter Raleigh, Philip Sidney, Burghley, Arundel, the Herberts, Saville, John Stow and William Camden were members. Elizabeth I had not advanced him further on account of his opposition to the alienation of ecclesiastical revenues. In 1598 he declined the bishoprics of Ely and Salisbury, because of the conditions attached. On 23 November 1600, he preached at Whitehall a controversial sermon on justification. In July 1601 he was appointed Dean of Westminster and gave much attention to the school there.

When plague struck in 1603 he retreated to Chiswick to teach the boys of Westminster School, where he preached a plague sermon on 21 August arguing in favour of leaving London under such circumstances. His argumentation rested on the Old Testament&#x27;s commands to avoid exposing oneself to contagion, to avoid contact with lepers, etc. Andrewes claimed that the plague was caused by &quot;inventions&quot; like &quot;new meats in diet&quot; and &quot;new fashions in apparel&quot; that had roused the wrath of God. He condemns changes in Christian tradition that &quot;our fathers never knew of&quot;.

== During the reign of James I ==

On the accession of James I, Andrewes rose into great favour. He assisted at the coronation of James I and Anne, and in 1604 took part in the Hampton Court Conference.

Andrewes&#x27; name is the first on the list of divines appointed to compile the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; of the Bible, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611. He headed the &quot;First Westminster Company&quot; which took charge of the first books of the Old Testament (Genesis to 2 Kings). He acted, furthermore, as a sort of general editor for the project as well.

On 31 October 1605 his election as Bishop of Chichester was confirmed, he was consecrated a bishop on 3 November, installed at Chichester Cathedral on 18 November and made Lord High Almoner (until 1619). Following the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, Andrewes was asked to prepare a sermon to be presented to the king in 1606 (Sermons Preached upon the V of November, in Lancelot Andrewes, XCVI Sermons, 3rd. Edition (London,1635) pp. 889, 890, 900–1008 ). In this sermon Andrewes justified the need to commemorate the deliverance and defined the nature of celebrations. This sermon became the foundation of celebrations which continue 400 years later. In 1609 he published &quot;Tortura Torti&quot;, a learned work which grew out of the Gunpowder Plot controversy and was written in answer to Bellarmine&#x27;s &quot;Matthaeus Tortus&quot;, which attacked James I&#x27;s book on the oath of allegiance. After moving to Ely (his election to that see was confirmed on 22 September), he again controverted Bellarmine in the &quot;Responsio ad Apologiam&quot;.

In 1617 he accompanied James I to Scotland with a view to persuading the Scots that Episcopacy was preferable to Presbyterianism. He was made dean of the Chapel Royal and translated (by the confirmation of his election to that see in February 1619) to Winchester, a diocese that he administered with great success. 

Following his death in 1626 in Winchester Palace, the bishop&#x27;s residence in Southwark, he was mourned alike by leaders in church and state, and buried in St Saviour&#x27;s Church (now Southwark Cathedral, then in the Diocese of Winchester). He was buried in a small chapel at the east end. After the destruction of the Bishop&#x27;s Chapel in 1830, his tomb was moved to a new position, immediately behind the high altar. His monument is by Gerard Janssen; the canopy was restored by Arthur Blomfield with colouring by Ninian Comper.

== Legacy ==

Two generations later, Richard Crashaw caught up the universal sentiment, when in his lines &quot;Upon Bishop Andrewes&#x27; Picture before his Sermons&quot; he exclaims:

:: This reverend shadow cast that setting sun,
:: Whose glorious course through our horizon run,
:: Left the dim face of this dull hemisphere,
:: All one great eye, all drown&#x27;d in one great teare.

Andrewes was a friend of Hugo Grotius, and one of the foremost contemporary scholars, but is chiefly remembered for his style of preaching. As a churchman he was typically Anglican, equally removed from the Puritan and the Roman positions. A good summary of his position is found in his &quot;First Answer to Cardinal Perron&quot;, who had challenged James I&#x27;s use of the title &quot;Catholic&quot;. His position in regard to the Eucharist is naturally more mature than that of the first reformers.

As to the Real Presence we are agreed; our controversy is as to the mode of it. As to the mode we define nothing rashly, nor anxiously investigate, any more than in the Incarnation of Christ we ask how the human is united to the divine nature in One Person. There is a real change in the elements—we allow &quot;ut panis iam consecratus non-sit panis quem natura formavit; sed, quem benedictio consecravit, et consecrando etiam immutavit&quot; [i.e., &quot;that the bread once consecrated is not the bread which nature has formed, but that which the blessing has consecrated and, by consecrating it, has also changed&quot;]. (&quot;Responsio&quot;, p. 263).
Adoration is permitted, and the use of the terms &quot;sacrifice&quot; and &quot;altar&quot; maintained as being consonant with scripture and antiquity. Christ is &quot;a sacrifice—so, to be slain; a propitiatory sacrifice—so, to be eaten.&quot; (&quot;Sermons&quot;, vol. ii. p. 296).

By the same rules that the Passover was, by the same may ours be termed a sacrifice. In rigour of speech, neither of them; for to speak after the exact manner of divinity, there is but one only sacrifice, &quot;veri nominis&quot;, that is Christ&#x27;s death. And that sacrifice but once actually performed at His death, but ever before represented in figure, from the beginning; and ever since repeated in memory to the world&#x27;s end. That only absolute, all else relative to it, representative of it, operative by it ... Hence it is that what names theirs carried, ours do the like, and the Fathers make no scruple at it—no more need we.(&quot;Sermons,&quot; vol. ii. p. 300).

Andrewes preached regularly and submissively before James I and his court on the anniversaries of the Gowrie Conspiracy and the Gunpowder Plot. These sermons were used to promulgate the doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings.

His &quot;Life&quot; was written by Alexander Whyte (Edinburgh, 1896), M. Wood (New York, 1898), and Robert Lawrence Ottley (Boston, 1894). His services to his church have been summed up thus: (1) he has a keen sense of the proportion of the faith and maintains a clear distinction between what is fundamental, needing ecclesiastical commands, and subsidiary, needing only ecclesiastical guidance and suggestion; (2) as distinguished from the earlier protesting standpoint, e.g. of the Thirty-nine Articles, he emphasised a positive and constructive statement of the Anglican position.

His best-known work is the &quot;Preces Privatae&quot; or &quot;Private Prayers&quot;, edited by Alexander Whyte (1896), which has widespread appeal and has remained in print since renewed interest in Andrewes developed in the 19th century. The &quot;Preces Privatae&quot; were first published by R. Drake in 1648; an improved edition by F. E. Brightman appeared in 1903. John Rutter set some of those prayers to music. Andrewes&#x27;s other works occupy eight volumes in the &quot;Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology&quot; (1841–1854). Ninety-six of his sermons were published in 1631 by command of Charles I, have been occasionally reprinted, and are considered among the most rhetorically developed and polished sermons of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries. Because of these, Andrewes has been commemorated by literary greats including T. S. Eliot.

Andrewes was considered, next to James Ussher, to be the most learned churchman of his day, and enjoyed a great reputation as an eloquent and impassioned preacher, but the stiffness and artificiality of his style render his sermons unsuited to modern taste. Nevertheless, there are passages of extraordinary beauty and profundity. His doctrine was High Church, and in his life he was humble, pious and charitable. He continues to influence religious thinkers to the present day, and was cited as an influence by T. S. Eliot, among others. Eliot borrowed, almost word for word and without his usual acknowledgement, a passage from Andrewes&#x27; 1622 Christmas Day sermon for the opening of his poem &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;. In his 1997 novel &quot;Timequake&quot;, Kurt Vonnegut suggested that Andrewes was &quot;the greatest writer in the English language&quot;, citing as proof the first few verses of the 23rd Psalm. His translation work has also led him to appear as a character in three plays dealing with the King James Bible, Howard Brenton&#x27;s &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; (2010), Jonathan Holmes&#x27; &quot;Into Thy Hands&quot; (2011) and David Edgar&#x27;s &quot;Written on the Heart&quot; (2011).

He has an academic cap named after him, known as the Bishop Andrewes cap, which is like a mortarboard but made of velvet, floppy and has a tump or tuff instead of a tassel. This was in fact the ancient version of the mortarboard before the top square was stiffened and the tump replaced by a tassel and button. This cap is still used by Cambridge DDs and at certain institutions as part of their academic dress.

A block of flats in the Barbican Residential Estate, central London, is named Andrewes House. All the Barbican&#x27;s residential buildings are named after famous people with a connection to the locale.

There is a stained glass window depicting Bishop Andrewes in Grays Inn Chapel, central London

<doc id="18046" wikidata="Q212671" url="?curid=18046" title="Lucius Tarquinius Priscus">
<text>Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (), or Tarquin the Elder, was the legendary fifth king of Rome and first of its Etruscan dynasty. He reigned for thirty-eight years. Tarquinius expanded Roman power through military conquest and grand architectural constructions. His wife was the prophetess Tanaquil.

Not much is known about the early life of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. According to Livy, Tarquin came from Etruria. Livy claims that his original Etruscan name was , but since &quot;lucumo&quot; is the latinized form of the Etruscan word &quot;king&quot;, there is reason to believe that his name and title have been confused in the official tradition. After inheriting his father&#x27;s entire fortune, Lucius attempted to gain a political office. However, he was prohibited from obtaining political office in Tarquinii because of the ethnicity of his father, Demaratus, who came from the Greek city of Corinth. As a result, his wife Tanaquil advised him to relocate to Rome. Legend has it that on his arrival in Rome in a chariot, an eagle took his cap, flew away and then returned it back upon his head. Tanaquil, who was skilled in prophecy, interpreted this as an omen of his future greatness. In Rome, he attained respect through his courtesy. King Ancus Marcius noticed Tarquinius and, by his will, appointed Tarquinius guardian of his own sons.

==King of Rome==
=== Rise to power ===
Although Ancus Marcius was the grandson of Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, the principle of hereditary monarchy was not yet established at Rome; none of the first three kings had been succeeded by their sons, and each subsequent king had been acclaimed by the people. Upon the death of Marcius, Tarquin addressed the &quot;Comitia Curiata&quot; and convinced them that he should be elected king over his predecessor&#x27;s natural sons, who were still only youths, making him the first Roman king to ever actively succeed at lobbying for the throne. In one tradition, the sons were away on a hunting expedition at the time of their father&#x27;s death, and were thus unable to affect the assembly&#x27;s choice.

=== Political reform ===
According to Livy, Tarquin increased the number of the Senate to 300 by adding one hundred men from the leading minor families. Among these was the family of the Octavii, from whom the first emperor, Augustus, was descended. He did so with the hope that those added to the Senate would be grateful for their position and thus loyal to him, strengthening his rule as king.

=== Military conquest ===
Lucius Tarquinius Priscus is accredited with expanding Rome&#x27;s borders. He did so through conquest of the surrounding tribes. Those tribes were the Latins, Sabines, and Etruscans.

==== War with the Latins ====
Tarquin&#x27;s first war was waged against the Latins. Tarquinius took the Latin town of Apiolae by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome. According to the &quot;Fasti Triumphales&quot;, this war must have occurred prior to 588 BC. The Latins claimed that peace treaties developed by Romulus and the other Roman kings no longer applied and as such, launched the first set of attacks. Seeing the opportunity to incorporate the Latins into Rome&#x27;s ranks, Tarquin quickly responded by conquering multiple Latin cities. As a result, the Latins requested help from the Sabines and Etruscans. Choosing not to split up his military power, Tarquin chose to keep the attack on the Latins, leading to a Roman victory.

==== War with the Sabines ====
After conquering the Latins Tarquin began his assault on the Sabines. Having their basecamp at the corner of two rivers, the Sabines were able to move their troops quickly and efficiently. Using his military cunning Tarquin chose to launch a surprise attack on the base at night. He did this by setting a fleet of small boats aflame and then sending them down the river to set the Sabine camp on fire. While the Sabines were focused on dousing the flames, Tarquin and his troops moved in to dismantle the camp.

Later, his military ability was then tested by an attack from the Sabines. Tarquin doubled the numbers of equites to help the war effort. The Sabines were defeated after difficult street fighting in the city of Rome. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquin received the town of Collatia, and appointed his nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, better known as &quot;Egerius&quot;, as commander of the garrison there. Tarquin returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph on September 13, 585 BC.

Subsequently, the Latin cities of Corniculum, old Ficulea, Cameria, Crustumerium, Ameriola, Medullia, and Nomentum were subdued and became Roman.

==== War with the Etruscans ====
Tarquin also wished to seek peace with the Etruscans, but they refused. Since Tarquin had kept the captured Etruscan auxiliaries prisoners for meddling in the war with the Sabines, the five Etruscan cities who had taken part declared war on Rome. Seven other Etruscan cities joined forces with them. The Etruscans soon captured the Roman colony at Fidenae, which thereupon became the focal point of the war. After several bloody battles, Tarquin was once again victorious, and he subjugated the Etruscan cities who had taken part in the war. At the successful conclusion of each of his wars, Rome was enriched by Tarquin&#x27;s plunder.

=== Construction ===

Tarquin is said to have built the Circus Maximus, the first and largest stadium at Rome, for chariot racing. The Circus Maximus started out as an underwhelming piece of land, but was built into a grand and beautiful stadium. Raised seating was erected privately by the senators and equites, and other areas were marked out for private citizens. There the king established a series of annual games; according to Livy, the first horses and boxers to participate were brought from Etruria. It received the name Circus Maximus as a way to set it apart from the other stadiums built at this time in a similar fashion.

After a great flood, Tarquin drained the damp lowlands of Rome by constructing the Cloaca Maxima, Rome&#x27;s great sewer. The arch was constructed in 578 BC and took inspiration from Etruscan structures of the earlier period. He also constructed a stone wall around the city, and began the construction of a temple in honour of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. The latter is said to have been funded in part by the plunder seized from the Sabines.

=== Shows of triumph ===
Tarquinius was the first Roman ruler to ever celebrate a Roman triumph. According to Florus, Tarquin celebrated his triumphs in the Etruscan fashion, riding a golden chariot drawn by four horses, while wearing a gold-embroidered toga and the tunica palmata, a tunic upon which palm-leaves were embroidered. He also introduced other Etruscan insignia of civilian authority and military distinction: the sceptre of the king; the trabea, a purple garment that varied in form, but was perhaps most often used as a mantle; the fasces carried by the lictors; the curule chair; the toga praetexta, later worn by various magistrates and officials; the rings worn by senators; the paludamentum, a cloak associated with military command; and the phalera, a disc of metal worn on a soldier&#x27;s breastplate during parades, or displayed on the standards of various military units. Strabo reports that Tarquin introduced Etruscan sacrificial and divinatory rites, as well as the tuba, a straight horn used chiefly for military purposes. As a result, most classical Roman symbols for war harken back to his time as king.

==Death and succession==
Tarquin is said to have reigned for thirty-eight years. According to legend, the sons of his predecessor, Ancus Marcius, believed that the throne should have been theirs. They arranged the king&#x27;s assassination, disguised as a riot, during which Tarquin received a fatal blow to the head by an ax. However, the queen, Tanaquil, gave out that the king was merely wounded, and took advantage of the confusion to establish Servius Tullius as regent; when the death of Tarquin was confirmed, Tullius became king, in place of Tarquin&#x27;s sons, or those of Ancus Marcius.

Tullius, said to have been the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who had fallen in battle against Tarquin, was brought to the palace as a child with his mother, Ocreisia. According to legend, Tanaquil discovered his potential for greatness by means of various omens, and therefore preferred him to her own sons. Tullius married Tarquinia, one of the daughters of Priscus, thus providing a vital link between the families. His own daughters were subsequently married to Tarquin&#x27;s sons (or, in some traditions, grandsons), Lucius and Arruns.

Most ancient writers regarded Tarquin as the father of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, but some stated that the younger Tarquin was his grandson. As the younger Tarquin died about 496 BC, more than eighty years after Tarquinius Priscus, the chronology seems to support the latter tradition. An Etruscan legend related by the emperor Claudius equates Servius Tullius with &quot;Macstarna&quot; (apparently the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin &quot;magister&quot;), a companion of the Etruscan heroes Aulus and Caelius Vibenna, who helped free the brothers from captivity, slaying their captors, including a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius. This episode is depicted in a fresco at the tomb of the Etruscan Saties family at Vulci, now known as the François Tomb. This tradition suggests that perhaps the sons of the elder Tarquin attempted to seize power, but were defeated by the regent, Servius Tullius, and his companions; Tullius would then have attempted to end the dynastic struggle by marrying his daughters to the grandsons of Tarquinius Priscus. However, this plan ultimately failed, as Tullius was himself assassinated at the instigation of his son-in-law, who succeeded him.

<doc id="18047" wikidata="Q193047" url="?curid=18047" title="Lucius Tarquinius Superbus">
<text>Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (died 495 BC) was the legendary seventh and final king of Rome, reigning 25 years until the popular uprising that led to the establishment of the Roman Republic. He is commonly known as Tarquin the Proud, from his cognomen &quot;Superbus&quot; (Latin for &quot;proud, arrogant, lofty&quot;).

Ancient accounts of the regal period mingle history and legend. Tarquin was said to have been either the son or grandson of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome, and to have gained the throne through the murders of both his wife and his elder brother, followed by the assassination of his predecessor, Servius Tullius. His reign has been described as a tyranny that justified the abolition of the monarchy.

==Background==

The most ancient sources, such as that of Quintus Fabius Pictor, assert Tarquin was the son of Tarquinius Priscus, but modern historians believe that to be &quot;impossible&quot; under the traditional chronology, indicating either he was Priscus&#x27; grandson or that the traditional chronology itself is &quot;unsound&quot;.

His mother supposedly was Tanaquil. Tanaquil had engineered her husband&#x27;s succession to the Roman kingdom on the death of Ancus Marcius. When the sons of Marcius subsequently arranged the elder Tarquin&#x27;s assassination in 579 BC, Tanaquil placed Servius Tullius on the throne, in preference to her own sons or grandsons.

According to an Etruscan tradition, the hero Macstarna, usually equated with Servius Tullius, defeated and killed a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius, and rescued the brothers Caelius and Aulus Vibenna from captivity. This may recollect an otherwise forgotten attempt by the sons of Tarquin the Elder to reclaim the throne.

To forestall further dynastic strife, Servius married his daughters, known to history as Tullia Major and Tullia Minor, to Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the future king, and his brother Arruns. One of Tarquin&#x27;s sisters, Tarquinia, married Marcus Junius Brutus, and was the mother of Lucius Junius Brutus, one of the men who would later lead the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom.

The elder sister, Tullia Major, was of mild disposition, yet married the ambitious Tarquin. Her younger sister, Tullia Minor, was of fiercer temperament, but her husband Arruns was not. She came to despise him, and conspired with Tarquin to bring about the deaths of Tullia Major and Arruns. After the murder of their spouses, Tarquin and Tullia were married. They had three sons: Titus, Arruns, and Sextus, and a daughter, Tarquinia, who married Octavius Mamilius, the prince of Tusculum.

==Overthrow of Servius Tullius==
Tullia encouraged her husband to advance his own position, ultimately persuading him to usurp her father, King Servius. Tarquin solicited the support of the patrician senators, especially those from houses that had been raised to senatorial rank under Tarquin the Elder. He bestowed presents upon them, and spread criticism of Servius the king.

In time, Tarquin felt ready to seize the throne. He went to the senate house with a group of armed men, sat himself on the throne, and summoned the senators to attend upon him. He then spoke to the senators, denigrating Servius as a slave born of a slave; for failing to be elected by the senate and the people during an interregnum, as had been the tradition for the election of kings of Rome; for having become king through the machinations of a woman; for favouring the lower classes of Rome over the wealthy, and for taking the land of the upper classes for distribution to the poor; and for instituting the census so that the wealth of the upper classes might be exposed in order to excite popular envy.

When word of this brazen deed reached Servius, he hurried to the curia to confront Tarquin, who levelled the same accusations against his father-in-law, and then in his youth and vigour carried the king outside and flung him down the steps of the senate house and into the street. The king&#x27;s retainers fled, and as he made his way towards the palace, the aged Servius was set upon and murdered by Tarquin&#x27;s assassins, perhaps on the advice of his own daughter.

Tullia drove in her chariot to the senate house, where she was the first to hail her husband as king. But Tarquin bade her return home, concerned that the crowd might do her violence. As she drove toward the Urbian Hill, her driver stopped suddenly, horrified at the sight of the king&#x27;s body lying in the street. But in a frenzy, Tullia herself seized the reins, and drove the wheels of her chariot over her father&#x27;s corpse. The king&#x27;s blood spattered against the chariot and stained Tullia&#x27;s clothes, so that she brought a gruesome relic of the murder back to her house. The street where Tullia disgraced the dead king afterwards became known as the &quot;Vicus Sceleratus,&quot; the Street of Crime.

==Reign==
Tarquin commenced his reign by refusing to bury the dead Servius, and then putting to death several leading senators, whom he suspected of remaining loyal to Servius. By not replacing the slain senators, and not consulting the senate on matters of government, he diminished both the size and the authority of the senate. In another break with tradition, Tarquin judged capital crimes without the advice of counsellors, causing fear amongst those who might think to oppose him. He made a powerful ally when he betrothed his daughter to Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, among the most eminent of the Latin chiefs.

Early in his reign, Tarquin called a meeting of the Latin leaders to discuss the bonds between Rome and the Latin towns. The meeting was held at a grove sacred to the goddess Ferentina. At the meeting, Turnus Herdonius inveighed against Tarquin&#x27;s arrogance, and warned his countrymen against trusting the Roman king. Tarquin then bribed Turnus&#x27; servant to store a large number of swords in his master&#x27;s lodging. Tarquin called together the Latin leaders, and accused Turnus of plotting his assassination. The Latin leaders accompanied Tarquin to Turnus&#x27; lodging and, the swords then being discovered, the Latin&#x27;s guilt was then speedily inferred. Turnus was condemned to be thrown into a pool of water in the grove with a wooden frame, or &quot;cratis&quot;, placed over his head, into which stones were thrown, drowning him. The meeting of the Latin chiefs then continued, and Tarquin persuaded them to renew their treaty with Rome, becoming her allies rather than her enemies. It was agreed that the soldiers of the Latins would attend at the grove on an appointed day, and form a united military force with the Roman army.

Next, Tarquin instigated a war against the Volsci, taking the wealthy town of Suessa Pometia. He celebrated a triumph, and with the spoils of this conquest, he commenced the erection of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which Tarquin the Elder had vowed. He then engaged in a war with Gabii, one of the Latin cities that had rejected the treaty with Rome. Unable to take the city by force of arms, Tarquin resorted to another stratagem. His son, Sextus, pretending to be ill-treated by his father, and covered with the bloody marks of stripes, fled to Gabii. The infatuated inhabitants entrusted him with the command of their troops, and when he had obtained the unlimited confidence of the citizens, he sent a messenger to his father to inquire how he should deliver the city into his hands. The king, who was walking in his garden when the messenger arrived, made no reply but kept striking off the heads of the tallest poppies with his stick. Sextus took the hint, and put to death, or banished on false charges, all the leading men of Gabii, after which he had no difficulty in compelling the city to submit.

Tarquin agreed upon a peace with the Aequi, and renewed the treaty of peace between Rome and the Etruscans. According to the Fasti Triumphales, he won a victory over the Sabines, and established Roman colonies at the towns of Signia and Circeii.

At Rome, Tarquin levelled the top of the Tarpeian Rock, overlooking the Forum, and removed a number of ancient Sabine shrines to make way for the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill. He constructed tiers of seats in the circus, and ordered the excavation of Rome&#x27;s great sewer, the &quot;cloaca maxima&quot;.
According to one story, Tarquin was approached by the Cumaean Sibyl, who offered him nine books of prophecy at an exorbitant price. Tarquin abruptly refused, and the Sibyl proceeded to burn three of the nine. She then offered him the remaining books, but at the same price. He hesitated, but refused again. The Sibyl then burned three more books before offering him the three remaining books at the original price. At last, Tarquin accepted, in this way obtaining the Sibylline Books.

==Overthrow and exile==

In 509 BC, having angered the Roman populace through the pace and burden of constant building, Tarquin embarked on a campaign against the Rutuli. At that time, the Rutuli were a very wealthy nation, and Tarquin was keen to obtain the spoils that would come with victory, in hopes of assuaging the ire of his subjects. Failing to take their capital of Ardea by storm, the king determined to take the city by siege instead.

With little prospect of battle, the young noblemen in the king&#x27;s army fell to drinking and boasting. When the subject turned to the virtue of their wives, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus claimed to have the most dedicated of spouses. With his companions, they secretly visited each other&#x27;s homes, and discovered all of the wives enjoying themselves, except for Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, who was engaged in domestic activities. Lucretia received the princes graciously, and together her beauty and virtue kindled the flame of desire in Collatinus&#x27; cousin, Sextus Tarquinius, the king&#x27;s son.

After a few days, Sextus returned to Collatia, where he implored Lucretia to give herself to him. When she refused, he threatened that if she did not yield herself to him, he would kill her, and claim that he had discovered her in the act of adultery with a slave, for which reason he had slain the unfaithful Lucretia, delivering the punishment as her husband&#x27;s kinsman.

To spare her husband the shame threatened by Sextus, Lucretia submitted to his desire. But when he had departed for the camp, Lucretia sent for her husband and father, revealing the whole matter, and accusing Sextus of raping her. Despite the pleas of her family, Lucretia stabbed herself to spare Collatinus any suspicion that she had betrayed him. Her grieving husband, together with his father-in-law, Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, and his companions, Lucius Junius Brutus and Publius Valerius, swore an oath to expel the king and his family from Rome.

As Tribune of the Celeres, Brutus was head of the king&#x27;s personal bodyguard, and entitled to summon the Roman comitia. This he did, and by recounting the various grievances of the people, the king&#x27;s abuses of power, and by inflaming public sentiment with the tale of the rape of Lucretia, Brutus persuaded the comitia to revoke the king&#x27;s imperium and send him into exile. Tullia fled the city in fear of the mob, while Sextus Tarquinius, his deed revealed, fled to Gabii, where he hoped for the protection of the Roman garrison. However, his previous conduct there had made him many enemies, and he was soon assassinated. In place of the king, the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; resolved to elect two consuls to hold power jointly. Lucretius, the prefect of the city, presided over the election of the first consuls, Brutus and Collatinus.

When word of the uprising reached the king, Tarquin abandoned Ardea and sought support from his allies in Etruria. The cities of Veii and Tarquinii sent contingents to join the king&#x27;s army, and he prepared to march upon Rome. Meanwhile, Brutus prepared a force to meet the returning army. In a surprising reversal, Brutus demanded that his colleague Collatinus resign the consulship and go into exile because he bore the hated name of Tarquinius. Stunned by this betrayal, Collatinus complied, and his father-in-law was chosen to succeed him.

Meanwhile, the king sent ambassadors to the senate, ostensibly to request the return of his personal property, but in reality to subvert a number of Rome&#x27;s leading men. When this plot was discovered, those found guilty were put to death by the consuls. Brutus was forced to condemn his two sons Titus and Tiberius to death because they had taken part in the conspiracy. Leaving Lucretius in charge of the city, Brutus departed to meet the king on the field of battle. At the Battle of Silva Arsia, the Romans won a hard-fought victory over the king and his Etruscan allies. Each side sustained painful losses; the consul Brutus and his cousin, Arruns Tarquinius, fell in battle against each other.

After this failure, Tarquin turned to Lars Porsena, the king of Clusium. Porsena&#x27;s march on Rome and the valiant defence of the Romans achieved legendary status, giving rise to the story of Horatius at the bridge, and the bravery of Gaius Mucius Scaevola. Accounts vary as to whether Porsena finally entered Rome, or was thwarted, but modern scholarship suggests that he was able to occupy the city briefly before withdrawing. Ultimately, his efforts were of no avail to the exiled Roman king.
Tarquin&#x27;s final attempt to regain the Roman kingdom came in 499 or 496 BC, when he persuaded his son-in-law, Octavius Mamilius, dictator of Tusculum, to march on Rome at the head of a Latin army. The Roman army was led by the dictator Aulus Postumius Albus and his Master of the Horse, Titus Aebutius Elva, while the elderly king and his last remaining son, Titus Tarquinius, accompanied by a force of Roman exiles, fought alongside the Latins. Once more the battle was hard-fought and narrowly decided, with both sides suffering great losses. Mamilius was slain, the master of the horse grievously injured, and Titus Tarquinius barely escaped with his life. But in the end, the Latins abandoned the field, and Rome retained her independence.

After the Latin defeat and the death of his son-in-law, Tarquin went to the court of Aristodemus at Cumae, where he died in 495.

==Modern representations==
William Shakespeare describes the events leading to Tarquin&#x27;s downfall in his long poem &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. He also alludes to Tarquin in his plays, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;.

In 1765, Patrick Henry gave a speech before the Virginia House of Burgesses in opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765. Toward the end of his speech, he inserted as a rhetorical flourish a comparison between King George III and various historical figures who were brought low by their enemies, including Charles I, Caesar, and, in some accounts, Tarquin.

The cultural phenomenon known as &quot;tall poppy syndrome,&quot; in which persons of unusual merit are attacked or resented because of their achievements, derives its name from the episode in Livy in which Tarquin is said to have instructed his son Sextus to weaken the city of Gabii by destroying its leading men. The motif of using an unwitting messenger to deliver such a message through the metaphor of cutting the heads off the tallest poppies may have been borrowed from Herodotus, whose &quot;Histories&quot; contain a similar story involving ears of wheat instead of poppies. A passage concerning Livy&#x27;s version of the story appears in Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;.

Benjamin Britten employed the character in his 1946 chamber opera &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;.

Tarquin also appears in the fourth book of &quot;The Trials of Apollo&quot; series by Rick Riordan. He is depicted as a zombie king who attacks the demigods for trying to rewrite the Sibylline Books.

Tarquin Superbus is a character in Claire-Louis Bennet&#x27;s novel &quot;Checkout-19&quot;.

<doc id="18048" wikidata="Q1852084" url="?curid=18048" title="Libertarian socialism">
<text>Libertarian socialism is an anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist political current that emphasises self-governance and workers&#x27; self-management. It is contrasted from other forms of socialism by its rejection of state ownership and from other forms of libertarianism by its rejection of private property. Broadly defined, it includes schools of both anarchism and Marxism, as well as other tendencies that oppose the state and capitalism.

With its roots in the Age of Enlightenment, libertarian socialism was first constituted as a tendency by the anti-authoritarian faction of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA), during their conflict with the Marxist faction. Libertarian socialism quickly spread throughout Europe and the American continent, reaching its height during the early stages of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and particularly during the Spanish Revolution of 1936. Its defeat during these revolutions led to its brief decline, before its principles were resurrected by the New Left and new social movements of the late 20th century.

While its key principles of decentralisation, workers&#x27; control, and mutual aid are generally shared across the many schools of libertarian socialism, differences have emerged over the questions of revolutionary spontaneity, reformism, and whether to prioritise the abolition of the state or of capitalism.

==Political principles==
Libertarian socialism strives for a free and equal society, aiming to transform work and everyday life. Broadly defined, libertarian socialism encapsulates any political ideology that favours workers&#x27; control of the means of production and the replacement of capitalism with a system of cooperative economics, or common ownership. Libertarian socialists tend to see the working class as agents of social revolution, reject representative democracy and electoralism, and advocate for self-organisation and direct action as means to engage in class conflict.

===Anti-authoritarianism===
Libertarian socialism has a grassroots and direct democratic approach to socialism, rejecting parliamentarism and bureaucracy. Libertarian socialists advocate the empowerment of individuals to control their own lives and encourage them to voluntarily cooperate with each other, rather than allow themselves to be controlled by a state. Libertarian socialists therefore uphold civil liberties such as freedom of choice, freedom of expression and freedom of thought.

In contrast to authoritarian forms of socialism, libertarian socialism rejects state ownership and centralisation. Instead it upholds a decentralised model of self-governance, envisioning free association based on co-operative or participatory economics. Some libertarian socialists see such systems as complementary to statism, while others hold them to be an alternative to the state.

Libertarian socialists tend to reject the view that political institutions such as the state represent an inherently good, or even neutral, power. Some libertarian socialists, such as Peter Kropotkin, consider the state to be an inherent instrument of landlordism and capitalism, therefore opposing the state with equal intensity as they oppose capitalism.

===Anti-capitalism===
Libertarian socialism views corporate power as an institutional problem, rather than as a result of the influence of certain immoral individuals. It thus opposes capitalism, which it sees as an economic system that upholds greed, the exploitation of labour and coercion, and calls for its overthrow in a social revolution.

Libertarian socialists reject private property, as they consider capitalist property relations to be incompatible with freedom. Instead, libertarian socialism upholds individual self-ownership, as well as the collective ownership of the means of production. In the place of capitalism, libertarian socialists favour an economic system based on workers&#x27; control of production, advocating for a system of cooperative economics, or common ownership. They also advocate for workers&#x27; self-management, as they consider workers able to cooperate productively without supervisors, whether appointed by employers or by the state.

They also tend to see free trade as inevitably resulting in the redistribution of income and wealth from workers to their corporate employers. They advocate for the elimination of social and economic inequality through the coercive expropriation of property from the wealthy.

== History ==
The roots of libertarian socialism extend back to the classical radicalism of the early modern period, claiming the English Levellers and the French Encyclopédistes as their intellectual forerunners, and admiring figures of the Age of Enlightenment such as Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine. According to Mikhail Bakunin and Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, while authoritarian socialism had its origins in Germany, libertarian socialism was born in France. The modern foundations of libertarian socialism lay in the utopian socialism expounded by Charles Fourier, Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon, who envisioned a democratic socialism guided by communitarianism, moralism and feminism.

===Emergence===

Libertarian socialism first emerged from the anti-authoritarian faction of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA), after it was expelled from the organisation by the Marxist faction at the Hague Congress of 1872. The libertarian socialist Mikhail Bakunin had rejected Karl Marx&#x27;s calls for a &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, as he predicted it would only create a new ruling class, composed of a privileged minority, which would use the state to oppress the working classes. He concluded that: &quot;no dictatorship can have any other aim than to perpetuate itself, and it can only give rise to and instill slavery in the people that tolerates it.&quot; Marxists responded to this by insisting on the eventual &quot;withering away of the state&quot;, in which society would transition from dictatorship to anarchy, in an apparent attempt to synthesise authoritarian and libertarian forms of socialism.

This put libertarian socialists into direct competition with social democrats and communists for influence over left-wing politics, in a contest which lasted for over fifty years. Libertarian socialism proved attractive to British writers such as Edward Carpenter, Oscar Wilde, and William Morris, the latter of whom developed a kind of libertarian socialism based in a strong critique of civilisation, which he aimed to overthrow and replace with what he called a &quot;beautiful society&quot;. Morris drove the development of impossibilism, which became increasingly concerned with the bureaucratisation and moderation of the socialist movement, leading to the establishment of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.

By the early 20th century, libertarian socialists had gained a leading influence over the left-wing in the Netherlands, France and Italy and went on to play major roles in the Mexican and Russian Revolutions. In India, the libertarian socialist tradition was represented in the early twentieth century anti-colonial movement by Bhagat Singh.

=== Russian Revolution ===

Russian libertarian socialists, including anarchists, populists and left socialist-revolutionaries, led the opposition to the Tsarist autocracy throughout the late-19th century. They created a network of both clandestine and legal organisations throughout Russia, with the aim of overthrowing the Russian nobility and bringing land under the common ownership of the mir. Their agitation for land reform in the Russian countryside culminated with the establishment of rural soviets during the 1905 Revolution.

Anarchists also organised among the urban proletariat, forming clandestine factory committees that proved more attractive to revolution-minded workers than the more reformist trade unions favoured by the Bolsheviks. During the 1917 Revolution, in which libertarian socialists played a leading role, the Bolsheviks changed tack and adopted elements of the libertarian socialist programme in their appeals to the workers. But by 1919, the new Bolshevik government had come to view the libertarian socialists as a threat to their power and moved to eliminate their influence. Libertarian socialist organisations were banned and many of their members were arrested, deported to Siberia or executed by the Cheka.

The Revolutions of 1917–1923 ended in defeat for the libertarian socialists, with either the social democrats, the Bolsheviks or nationalists rising to power. Libertarian socialists responded by reevaluating their positions, emphasising mass organisation over intellectual vanguardism and revolutionary spontaneity over substitutionism. They also came to conceive the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; as a form of class power, rather than as the dictatorship of a political party. Many Marxists of the period were attracted to this position, including Rosa Luxemburg in Germany, Antonie Pannekoek in the Netherlands, Sylvia Pankhurst in Britain, György Lukács in Hungary and Antonio Gramsci in Italy.

=== Spanish Revolution ===

Libertarian socialism reached its apex of popularity with the Spanish Revolution of 1936, during which libertarian socialists led &quot;the largest and most successful revolution against capitalism to ever take place in any industrial economy&quot;.

In Spain, traditional forms of self-management and common ownership dated back to the 15th century. The Levante, where collective self-management of irrigation was commonplace, became the hotbed of anarchist collectivisation. Building on this traditional collectivism, from 1876, the Spanish libertarian socialist movement grew through sustained agitation and the establishment of alternative institutions that culminated in the Spanish Revolution. During this period, a series of workers&#x27; congresses, first convoked by the Spanish Regional Federation of the IWA, debated and refined proposals for the construction of a libertarian socialist society. Over several decades, resolutions from these congresses formed the basis of a specific program on a range of issues, from the structure of communes and the post-revolutionary economy to libertarian cultural and artistic initiatives. These proposals were published in the pages of widely distributed libertarian socialist periodicals, such as &quot;Solidaridad Obrera&quot; and &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;, which each circulated tens of thousands of copies. By the outbreak of the revolution, the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) enjoyed widespread popularity, counting 1.5 million members within its ranks.

During the revolution, the means of production were brought under workers&#x27; control and worker cooperatives formed the basis for the new economy. According to Gaston Leval, the CNT established an agrarian federation in the Levante that encompassed 78% of Spain&#x27;s most arable land. The regional federation was populated by 1,650,000 people, 40% of whom lived on the region&#x27;s 900 agrarian collectives, which were self-organised by peasant unions.

Although industrial and agricultural production was at its highest in the anarchist-controlled areas of the Spanish Republic, and the anarchist militias displayed the strongest military discipline, liberals and Communists alike blamed the &quot;sectarian&quot; libertarian socialists for the defeat of the Republic in the Spanish Civil War. These charges have been disputed by contemporary libertarian socialists, such as Robin Hahnel and Noam Chomsky, who have accused such claims of lacking substantial evidence.

=== Decline ===
Following the defeat of the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, libertarian socialism fell into decline. Left-wing politics throughout the world came to be dominated either by social democracy or Marxism-Leninism, which attained power in a number of countries and thus had the means to support their ideological allies. In contrast, Hahnel argues, libertarian socialists were not able to gain influence within the labour movement. At a time when reformist trade unions were consistently winning concessions, the libertarian socialists&#x27; anti-reformist message gained little traction. Their platform of workers&#x27; self-management also failed to appeal to industrial workers. Until the 1960s, libertarian socialists were limited mostly to making critiques of authoritarian socialism and capitalism, although Hahnel asserts that these arguments were largely overshadowed by those from neoconservatives and Marxists respectively.

=== New Left ===

Libertarian socialist themes received a revival during the 1960s, when it was reconstituted as part of the nascent New Left. This revival occurred largely unconsciously, as new leftists were often unaware of their libertarian socialist predecessors. The concepts of grassroots democracy, workers&#x27; control, solidarity and autonomy were thus reinvented by the new generation. They also picked up the principles of decentralisation, participatory democracy and mutual aid. These libertarian socialist themes drove the growth of the New Left, which by this point was disillusioned by the mainstream social democratic and Marxist-Leninist political groupings, due to the capitalistic tendencies of the former and the rigid authoritarianism of the latter.

Sociologist C. Wright Mills, who displayed strong libertarian socialist tendencies in his appeals to the New Left, reformulated Marxism for the modern age in his work on &quot;The Power Elite&quot; (1956). Wilhelm Reich&#x27;s Freudo-Marxist theses on the authoritarian personality were also rediscovered by the New Left, who developed his programme for individual self-governance into a libertarian system of education used by the Summerhill School. Drawing on the Freudo-Marxist conception of civilisation as &quot;organised domination&quot;, Herbert Marcuse developed a critique of alienation in modern Western societies, concluding that creativity and political dissent had been undermined by social repression. Meanwhile, Lewis Mumford published denunciations of the military-industrial complex and Paul Goodman advocated for decentralisation. In the process, the new generation of Marxists gravitated towards libertarian tendencies, sometimes closely resembling anarchism. Following on from Marcuse, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, E. P. Thompson, Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall all adopted forms of &quot;libertarian Marxism&quot;, opposed to the bureaucracy and parliamentarism of statist tendencies.

A specific and explicit libertarian socialist tendency also began to emerge. While some more libertarian Marxists adopted the term in order to distinguish themselves from authoritarian socialists, anarchists began calling themselves &quot;libertarian socialist&quot; in order to avoid the negative connotations associated with anarchism. The libertarian socialist Daniel Guérin specifically attempted to synthesise anarchism and Marxism into a single tendency, which inspired the growth of the French libertarian communist movement. For a time, even the American anarcho-capitalist theorist Murray Rothbard attempted to make common cause with libertarian socialists, but later shifted away from socialism and towards right-wing populism.

Many libertarian socialists of this period were particularly influenced by the analysis of Cornelius Castoriadis and his group Socialisme ou Barbarie. This new generation included the non-vanguardist Marxist organisation Facing Reality, the British libertarian socialist group Solidarity, and the Australian councilists of the Self-Management Group. Some of this new generation of libertarian socialists also joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), swelling the old union&#x27;s numbers, organising agricultural workers and launching a new journal, &quot;The Rebel Worker&quot;. This libertarian socialist milieu, with their criticisms of democratic centralism and trade unionism, and their advocacy of workers&#x27; self-management and council democracy, went on to inspire the French situationists and Italian autonomists.

Of the figures in the New Left, the American linguist Noam Chomsky became the most prominent spokesperson for libertarian socialism. Inspired by the humanism of Bertrand Russell, the individualism of Wilhelm von Humboldt and the syndicalism of Rudolf Rocker, Chomsky championed a libertarian socialism that upheld individual liberty and self-ownership. Chomsky has been outspoken advocate of anti-authoritarianism, opposing limits on individual freedoms by the state. He has also focused much of his libertarian socialist critique on mass media in the United States, due to its role in the military-industrial complex.

While most sections of the New Left expressed a form of libertarian socialism, others were instead being inspired by the Cuban and Chinese Communist Revolutions to embrace forms of authoritarian socialism such as Maoism–Third Worldism. As such, according to Hahnel, the New Left failed to form a coherent ideological program or establish lasting support to carry forward the momentum of the late 1960s, resulting in many dropping out of activism altogether.

===New social movements===
A minority from the New Left continued their radical activism within the new social movements of the 1970s and 1980s, becoming involved in second-wave feminism, the gay liberation movement, environmental movement and eventually the anti-globalization movement. In this period, many libertarian socialists, such as Murray Bookchin, Cornelius Castoriadis, André Gorz, Ivan Illich, E.P. Thompson and Raymond Williams, were committed to &quot; in rethinking what socialism might come to mean in an age of ecological limit&quot;.

According to Robin Hahnel, new social movements continued the New Left&#x27;s tendency of failing to develop a &quot;comprehensive libertarian socialist theory and practice&quot;. Libertarian socialist activism became focused on achieving practical reforms and theoretical developments centred around common &quot;core values&quot; such as economic democracy, economic justice and sustainable development, without building a coherent critique of capitalism. Activists from the 1970s and 1980s influenced by libertarian socialism did not advance coherent alternatives to markets and central planning, and had no reformist campaign. Eventually, Hahnel argues, they turned to traditional single-issue campaigns and abandoned their &quot;big picture&quot; libertarian socialist approach.

These movements were somewhat successful in achieving their goals: the movements for gay and women&#x27;s rights changed societal outlook on gender oppression; the anti-racist movement proved it necessary to tackle the social aspects of racialisation; the anti-imperialist movement reconceived of anti-imperialism outside of economic terms; and the environmentalist movement launched a wave of ecological defense and restoration. Together, Hahnel argues, they broke from the class reductionism prevalent in traditional forms of libertarian socialism, proving intersectional oppressions other than class also demanded attention. Through the new social movements, libertarian socialism developed an awareness of different aspects of oppression, beyond class analysis.

===Contemporary era===
Libertarian socialism again received a revival of interest in the wake of the fall of communism and concurrent rise of neoliberalism. It proved particularly attractive to people from the former Eastern Bloc, who saw it as an alternative both to western capitalism and Marxism-Leninism. Since the end of the Cold War, there have been two major experiments in libertarian socialism: the Zapatista uprising in Mexico and the Rojava Revolution in Syria. 

In reaction against the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the privatisation of indigenous lands by the Mexican state, in 1994, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) rose up against the government, enabling the formation of a self-governing autonomous territory in the Mexican state of Chiapas. The Zapatistas have roundly rejected political sectarianism and ideological doctrine, including the state socialist model of seizing state power, with spokesman Subcomandante Marcos famously declaring &quot;I shit on all the revolutionary vanguards of this planet.&quot; As such, they have commonly been characterised as libertarian socialist, or inspired by libertarian socialism. They have in turn become a source of inspiration for libertarian socialists, including the autonomist Marxists Harry Cleaver and John Holloway, as well as some anarchists.

In 2012, the Rojava Revolution established the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES; or &quot;Rojava&quot;) to put &quot;libertarian socialist ideas ... into practice&quot;, and whose cantons present themselves as a &quot;libertarian socialist alternative to the colonially established state boundaries in the Middle East.&quot; Various sources have drawn parallels between the Rojava Revolution and the Zapatista uprising of 1994 or the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and noted the influence of libertarian socialist Murray Bookchin, specifically his concept of libertarian municipalism, on the revolution.

Libertarian socialist ideas have influenced some currents of the anti-austerity and new municipalist movements, such as Ada Colau&#x27;s Barcelona en Comú party, in which they ally with democratic socialists. 

In Chile, there have been several libertarian socialist movements active since the 2010s in groups including Libertarian Left and the Broad Front (FA). Gabriel Boric founded Social Convergence in 2018, bringing together the Autonomist Movement, Libertarian Left and other libertarian socialist groups. Boric, who describes himself as libertarian socialist, was elected president in 2021.

== Notable tendencies ==
Libertarian socialism encompasses both the libertarian wing of socialism and the socialist wing of libertarianism, including many different schools of thought under its banner. The most commonly cited tendencies of libertarian socialism are anarchist communism, anarcho-syndicalism, and council communism. Other Marxist strands of libertarian socialism include Western Marxism, Bordigism and impossibilism. Additionally, utopian socialism, guild socialism, socialist feminism and social ecology, as well as various strands of the New Left, new social movements and contemporary anarchism, have been listed among the other wings of libertarian socialism.

=== Anarchist ===

The currents of classical anarchism that developed in the 19th century were committed to autonomy and freedom, decentralization, opposing hierarchy, and opposing the vanguardism of authoritarian socialism.

In the 20th century, social anarchism emerged as a significant current of anarchism and explicitly identified as libertarian socialist. Anarcho-syndicalist Gaston Leval explained: &quot;We therefore foresee a Society in which all activities will be coordinated, a structure that has, at the same time, sufficient flexibility to permit the greatest possible autonomy for social life, or for the life of each enterprise, and enough cohesiveness to prevent all disorder. [...] In a well-organised society, all of these things must be systematically accomplished by means of parallel federations, vertically united at the highest levels, constituting one vast organism in which all economic functions will be performed in solidarity with all others and that will permanently preserve the necessary cohesion&quot;.

Significant thinkers in the anarchist tradition who are described as libertarian socialist include Colin Ward.

=== Marxist ===

A broad scope of economic and political philosophies that draw on the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism have been described as &quot;libertarian Marxism&quot;, a tendency which emphasises autonomy, federalism and direct democracy. Wayne Price identified it most closely with the tendency of autonomist Marxism and identified libertarian characteristics within council communism, the Johnson–Forest Tendency, the Socialisme ou Barbarie group and the Situationist International, contrasting them with orthodox Marxism, social democracy, and Marxism–Leninism. Michael Löwy and Olivier Besancenot have identified Rosa Luxemburg, Walter Benjamin, André Breton and Daniel Guérin as prominent figures of libertarian Marxism. Ojeili identifies William Morris, Daniel De Leon, the Socialist Party of Great Britain, Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Korsch Anton Pannekoek, Roland Holst, Hermann Gorter, Sylvia Pankhurst, Antonio Gramsci, György Lukács, Socialisme ou Barbarie, Henri Simon, Échanges et mouvement and Paul Mattick as significant Marxian libertarian socialists.

===Democratic socialist===
There was a strong left-libertarian current in the British labour movement and the term &quot;libertarian socialist&quot; has been applied to a number of democratic socialists, including some prominent members of the British Labour Party. The Socialist League was formed in 1885 by William Morris and others critical of the authoritarian socialism of the Social Democratic Federation. It was involved in the new unionism, the rank-and-file union militancy of the 1880s–1890s, which anticipated syndicalism in some key ways (Tom Mann, a New Unionist leader, was one of the first British syndicalists). The Socialist League was dominated by anarchists by the 1890s. The Common Wealth Party was inspired by Christian socialism as well as libertarian socialism. Others in the tradition of the ILP and described as libertarian socialists included G. D. H. Cole (the founder of guild socialism and influenced by Morris), George Orwell, Michael Foot, Raymond Williams, and Tony Benn. Another is former Labour Party minister Peter Hain, who has written in support of libertarian socialism, identifying an axis involving a &quot;bottom-up vision of socialism, with anarchists at the revolutionary end and democratic socialists [such as himself] at its reformist end&quot; as opposed to the axis of state socialism with Marxist–Leninists at the revolutionary end and social democrats at the reformist end. Another recent mainstream Labour politician who has been described as a libertarian socialist is Robin Cook.

==Debates==

===Reasons for decline===
American economist Robin Hahnel claimed that libertarian socialists &quot;were by far the worst underachievers among 20th century anti-capitalists.&quot; He contrasted libertarian socialist failings with those of social democracy, arguing that while the latter had abandoned their principles of economic democracy and justice in favour of reformism, the former had proved incapable of sustaining anti-capitalist uprisings and largely ignored the importance of political and economic reform. Hahnel consequently suggested that, in the 21st century, libertarian socialists should work together with other anti-capitalist social movements, organize for reform without abandoning anti-capitalist principles and strive to build grassroots institutions of self-management, even if those projects are &quot;imperfect&quot;.

===Priorities===
While most libertarian socialists consider it necessary to combat both economic and political power in tandem, regarding each as fundamental to the survival of the other, some consider it a priority to combat one or the other first. Some, such as Mikhail Bakunin and Alexander Berkman, considered capitalism to rely on the support and protection of the state. They thus concluded that if the state were to be abolished, capitalism would naturally dissolve in its wake. But others, including Noam Chomsky, believe that the state is only inherently oppressive because of its control by a plutocratic class and that &quot;society is governed by those who own it&quot;. Chomsky holds that government, while not benign, can at least be held accountable, while corporate power is neither benign nor accountable. Though he holds the abolition of the state to be desirable, Chomsky considers the abolition of capitalism to be of greater urgency.

<text>Titus Livius (; 59 BC – AD 17), known in English as Livy ( ), was a Roman historian. He wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people, titled , covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional founding in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy&#x27;s own lifetime. He was on good terms with members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and was a friend of Augustus, whose young grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, he encouraged to take up the writing of history.

==Life==
Livy was born in Patavium in northern Italy, now modern Padua, probably in 59 BC. At the time of his birth, his home city of Patavium was the second wealthiest on the Italian peninsula, and the largest in the province of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy). Cisalpine Gaul was merged into Italy proper during his lifetime and its inhabitants were given Roman citizenship by Julius Caesar. In his works, Livy often expressed his deep affection and pride for Patavium, and the city was well known for its conservative values in morality and politics.

Livy&#x27;s teenage years were during the 40s BC, a period of civil wars throughout the Roman world. The governor of Cisalpine Gaul at the time, Asinius Pollio, tried to sway Patavium into supporting Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony), the leader of one of the warring factions during Caesar&#x27;s Civil War (49-45 BC). The wealthy citizens of Patavium refused to contribute money and arms to Asinius Pollio, and went into hiding. Pollio then attempted to bribe the slaves of those wealthy citizens to expose the whereabouts of their masters; his bribery did not work, and the citizens instead pledged their allegiance to the Senate. It is therefore likely that the Roman civil wars prevented Livy from pursuing a higher education in Rome or going on a tour of Greece, which was common for adolescent males of the nobility at the time. Many years later, Asinius Pollio derisively commented on Livy&#x27;s &quot;patavinity&quot;, saying that Livy&#x27;s Latin showed certain &quot;provincialisms&quot; frowned on at Rome. Pollio&#x27;s dig may have been the result of bad feelings he harboured toward the city of Patavium from his experiences there during the civil wars.

Livy probably went to Rome in the 30s BC, and it is likely that he spent a large amount of time in the city after this, although it may not have been his primary home. During his time in Rome, he was never a senator nor held a government position. His writings contain elementary mistakes on military matters, indicating that he probably never served in the Roman army. However, he was educated in philosophy and rhetoric. It seems that Livy had the financial resources and means to live an independent life, though the origin of that wealth is unknown. He devoted a large part of his life to his writings, which he was able to do because of his financial freedom.

Livy was known to give recitations to small audiences, but he was not heard of to engage in declamation, then a common pastime. He was familiar with the emperor Augustus and the imperial family. Augustus was considered by later Romans to have been the greatest Roman emperor, benefiting Livy&#x27;s reputation long after his death. Suetonius described how Livy encouraged the future emperor Claudius, who was born in 10 BC, to write historiographical works during his childhood.

Livy&#x27;s most famous work was his history of Rome. In it he narrates a complete history of the city of Rome, from its foundation to the death of Augustus. Because he was writing under the reign of Augustus, Livy&#x27;s history emphasizes the great triumphs of Rome. He wrote his history with embellished accounts of Roman heroism in order to promote the new type of government implemented by Augustus when he became emperor. In Livy&#x27;s preface to his history, he said that he did not care whether his personal fame remained in darkness, as long as his work helped to &quot;preserve the memory of the deeds of the world’s preeminent nation.&quot; Because Livy was mostly writing about events that had occurred hundreds of years earlier, the historical value of his work was questionable, although many Romans came to believe his account to be true.

Livy was married and had at least one daughter and one son. He also produced other works, including an essay in the form of a letter to his son, and numerous dialogues, most likely modelled on similar works by Cicero. One of his sons wrote a book on geography and a daughter married Lucius Magius, a rhetorician.

Titus Livius died at his home city of Patavium in AD 17. The tombstone of Livy and his wife might have been found in Padua.

==Works==
Livy&#x27;s only surviving work is commonly known as &quot;History of Rome&quot; (or ). Together with Polybius it is considered one of the main accounts of the Second Punic War. 

When he began this work he was already past his youth, probably 33; presumably, events in his life prior to that time had led to his intense activity as a historian. He continued working on it until he left Rome for Padua in his old age, probably in the reign of Tiberius after the death of Augustus. Seneca the Younger says he was an orator and philosopher and had written some historical treatises in those fields.

&quot;History of Rome&quot; also served as the driving force behind the &quot;northern theory&quot; regarding the Etruscans&#x27; origins. This is because in the book Livy states, &quot;The Greeks also call them the &#x27;Tyrrhene&#x27; and the &#x27;Adriatic ... The Alpine tribes are undoubtedly of the same kind, especially the Raetii, who had through the nature of their country become so uncivilized that they retained no trace of their original condition except their language, and even this was not free from corruption&quot;. Thus, many scholars, like Karl Otfried Müller, utilized this statement as evidence that the Etruscans or the Tyrrhenians migrated from the north and were descendants of an Alpine tribe known as the Raeti.

==Reception==
===Imperial era===
Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; was in high demand from the time it was published and remained so during the early years of the empire. Pliny the Younger reported that Livy&#x27;s celebrity was so widespread, a man from Cádiz travelled to Rome and back for the sole purpose of meeting him. Livy&#x27;s work was a source for the later works of Aurelius Victor, Cassiodorus, Eutropius, Festus, Florus, Granius Licinianus and Orosius. Julius Obsequens used Livy, or a source with access to Livy, to compose his &quot;De Prodigiis&quot;, an account of supernatural events in Rome from the consulship of Scipio and Laelius to that of Paulus Fabius and Quintus Aelius.

Livy wrote during the reign of Augustus, who came to power after a civil war with generals and consuls claiming to be defending the Roman Republic, such as Pompey. Patavium had been pro-Pompey. To clarify his status, the victor of the civil war, Octavian Caesar, had wanted to take the title &quot;Romulus&quot; (the first king of Rome) but in the end accepted the senate proposal of &quot;Augustus&quot;. Rather than abolishing the republic, he adapted it and its institutions to imperial rule.

The historian Tacitus, writing about a century after Livy&#x27;s time, described the Emperor Augustus as his friend. Describing the trial of Cremutius Cordus, Tacitus represents him as defending himself face-to-face with the frowning Tiberius as follows:

Livy&#x27;s reasons for returning to Padua after the death of Augustus (if he did) are unclear, but the circumstances of Tiberius&#x27;s reign certainly allow for speculation.

===Later===

During the Middle Ages, due to the length of the work, the literate class was already reading summaries rather than the work itself, which was tedious to copy, expensive, and required a lot of storage space. It must have been during this period, if not before, that manuscripts began to be lost without replacement. The Renaissance was a time of intense revival; the population discovered that Livy&#x27;s work was being lost and large amounts of money changed hands in the rush to collect Livian manuscripts. The poet Beccadelli sold a country home for funding to purchase one manuscript copied by Poggio. Petrarch and Pope Nicholas V launched a search for the now missing books. Laurentius Valla published an amended text initiating the field of Livy scholarship. Dante speaks highly of him in his poetry, and Francis I of France commissioned extensive artwork treating Livian themes; Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s work on republics, the &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;, is presented as a commentary on the &quot;History of Rome&quot;. Respect for Livy rose to lofty heights. Walter Scott reports in &quot;Waverley&quot; (1814) as an historical fact that a Scotsman involved in the first Jacobite uprising of 1715 was recaptured (and executed) because, having escaped, he yet lingered near the place of his captivity in &quot;the hope of recovering his favourite &quot;Titus Livius&quot;&quot;.

==Dates==

The authority supplying information from which possible vital data on Livy can be deduced is Eusebius of Caesarea, a bishop of the early Christian Church. One of his works was a summary of world history in ancient Greek, termed the &quot;Chronikon,&quot; dating from the early 4th century AD. This work was lost except for fragments (mainly excerpts), but not before it had been translated in whole and in part by various authors such as St. Jerome. The entire work survives in two separate manuscripts, Armenian and Greek (Christesen and Martirosova-Torlone 2006). St. Jerome wrote in Latin. Fragments in Syriac exist.

Eusebius&#x27; work consists of two books: the &quot;Chronographia&quot;, a summary of history in annalist form, and the &quot;Chronikoi Kanones&quot;, tables of years and events. St. Jerome translated the tables into Latin as the &quot;Chronicon&quot;, probably adding some information of his own from unknown sources. Livy&#x27;s dates appear in &quot;Jerome&#x27;s Chronicon.&quot;

The main problem with the information given in the manuscripts is that, between them, they often give different dates for the same events or different events, do not include the same material entirely, and reformat what they do include. A date may be in &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot; or in Olympiads or in some other form, such as age. These variations may have occurred through scribal error or scribal license. Some material has been inserted under the aegis of Eusebius.

The topic of manuscript variants is a large and specialized one, on which authors of works on Livy seldom care to linger. As a result, standard information in a standard rendition is used, which gives the impression of a standard set of dates for Livy. There are no such dates. A typical presumption is of a birth in the 2nd year of the 180th Olympiad and a death in the first year of the 199th Olympiad, which are coded 180.2 and 199.1 respectively. All sources use the same first Olympiad, 776/775–773/772 BC by the modern calendar. By a complex formula (made so by the 0 reference point not falling on the border of an Olympiad), these codes correspond to 59 BC for the birth, 17 AD for the death. In another manuscript the birth is in 180.4, or 57 BC.

<text>Labour Day is an annual day of celebration of the achievements of workers. It has its origins in the labour union movement, specifically the eight-hour day movement, which advocated eight hours for work, eight hours for recreation, and eight hours for rest.

For most countries, Labour Day is synonymous with, or linked with, International Workers&#x27; Day, which occurs on 1 May. For other countries, Labour Day is celebrated on a different date, often one with special significance for the labour movement in that country. Labour Day is a public holiday in many countries.

==International Workers&#x27; Day==
For most countries, &quot;Labour Day&quot; is synonymous with, or linked with, International Workers&#x27; Day, which occurs on 1 May. Some countries vary the actual date of their celebrations so that the holiday occurs on a Monday close to 1 May.

Some countries have a holiday at or around this date, but it is not a &#x27;Labour Day&#x27; celebration.

==Other dates==

===Australia===

Labour Day is a public holiday in Australia on dates which vary between states and territories. In some states the date commemorates the Eight Hours Day march (see below). It is the first Monday in October in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and South Australia. In Victoria and Tasmania, it is the second Monday in March (though the latter calls it the Eight Hours Day). In Western Australia, Labour Day is the first Monday in March. In Queensland and the Northern Territory, Labour Day occurs on the first Monday in May (though the latter calls it May Day). It is on the fourth Monday of March in the territory of Christmas Island.

====Victoria====

The first march for an eight-hour day by the labour movement occurred in Melbourne on 21 April 1856. On this day, stonemasons and building workers on building sites around Melbourne stopped work and marched from the University of Melbourne to Parliament House to achieve an eight-hour day. Their direct action protest was a success, and they are noted as being among the first organised workers in the world to achieve an eight-hour day, with no loss of pay.

====Queensland====
Labour Day was first celebrated with a public holiday in Queensland in 1865 as Eight Hours Celebration Day. It occurred on 1 March (Saint David&#x27;s Day) and celebrated the winning of an eight-hour work day by Brisbane workers in 1858. The date was moved to May Day around 1896, in solidarity with the attack on United States workers on the first May Day parade in the Haymarket affair. In 1901, the holiday was moved to the first Monday in May, to ensure a long weekend.

=== Bangladesh ===
Bangladesh Garment Sramik Sanghati, an organisation working for the welfare of garment workers, has requested that 24 April be declared Labour Safety Day in Bangladesh, in memory of the victims of the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse. However, Bangladesh does observe May Day on 1 May.

===The Bahamas===
Labour Day is a national holiday in The Bahamas, celebrated on the first Friday in June in order to create a long weekend for workers. The traditional date of Labour Day in The Bahamas, however, is 7 June, in commemoration of a significant workers&#x27; strike that began on that day in 1942. Labour Day is meant to honour and celebrate workers and the importance of their contributions to the nation and society. In the capital city, Nassau, thousands of people come to watch a parade through the streets, which begins at mid-morning. Bands in colourful uniforms, traditional African Junkanoo performers, and members of various labour unions and political parties are all part of the procession, which ends up at the Southern Recreation Grounds, where government officials make speeches for the occasion.

===Canada===
Labour Day () has been marked as a statutory public holiday in Canada on the first Monday in September since 1894. Its origins can be traced back to numerous local demonstrations and celebrations in earlier decades. Such events assumed political significance when a labour demonstration in Toronto in April 1872, in support of striking printers, led directly to the enactment of the Trade Union Act, a law that confirmed the legality of unions. On 22 July 1882, a labour celebration in Toronto attracted the attention of American labour leader Peter J. McGuire, who organised a similar parade in New York City on 5 September that year. Labour parades were held in several Canadian cities that day as well. 

Unions associated with the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor in both Canada and the United States subsequently promoted parades and festivals on the first Monday in September. In Canada, local celebrations took place in Hamilton, Oshawa, Montreal, St. Catharines, Halifax, Ottawa, Vancouver and London during these years. Montreal declared a civic holiday in 1889. In Nova Scotia, coal miners had been holding picnics and parades since 1880 to celebrate the anniversary of their union, the Provincial Workmen&#x27;s Association, first organised in 1879. 

In addition, in 1889, the Royal Commission on the Relations of Labour and Capital in Canada, chaired by James Sherrard Armstrong (1886–88) and Augustus Toplady Freed (1888–89), recommended recognition of an official &quot;labour day&quot; by the federal government. In March and April 1894, unions lobbied Parliament to recognise Labour Day as a public holiday. Legislation was introduced in May by prime minister Sir John Thompson and received royal assent in July 1894.

===China===
1 May is a statutory holiday in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It was a three-day holiday until 2008, but was only one day after 2008. However, the actual time off is often longer than the time off in the regulations, and the extra time off is usually supplemented by another two weekends, but since the extra time is not under an official holiday, the extra days must be &quot;made up&quot; by working on the preceding or following weekend. For example, in 2013, 1 May fell on Wednesday. Most workplaces, including all government offices, took 29 April (Monday) to 1 May (Wednesday) as days off. As the first two days were not statutory holidays, they had to be &quot;made up&quot; by working the preceding weekend (27 and 28 April).

===Hong Kong S.A.R.===
Labour Day, observed 1 May, has been considered a public holiday in Hong Kong since 1999.

===India===
The first Labour Day was celebrated in India on 1 May 1923, in Chennai (then known as Madras), organised by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan.

===Jamaica===
Before 1961, 24 May was celebrated in Jamaica as Empire Day in honour of the birthday of Queen Victoria and her emancipation of slaves in Jamaica and the West Indies. As its name suggests, the day was used to celebrate the British Empire, complete with flag-raising ceremonies and the singing of patriotic songs. In 1961, Chief Minister, Norman Manley, proposed the replacement of Empire Day with Labour Day, a celebration in commemoration of 23 May 1938, when Alexander Bustamante led a labour rebellion leading to Jamaican independence.

In 1972, prime minister Michael Manley promoted Labour Day as a showcase for the importance of labour to the development of Jamaica, and a day of voluntary community participation to beneficial projects. Since then, Labour Day has been not only a public holiday in Jamaica, but also a day of mass community involvement around the country.

===Japan===
A public holiday in Japan, Labour Day is officially conflated with Thanksgiving on 23 November, as Labor Thanksgiving Day.

=== Kazakhstan ===
Labour Day, a public holiday in Kazakhstan, is celebrated on the last Sunday in September. The holiday was officially established in late 2013. In 1995, the government of Kazakhstan replaced International Workers&#x27; Day with Kazakhstan People&#x27;s Unity Day. Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev also instituted a special medal that is awarded to veterans of labour on the occasion of the holiday. Labour Day it is widely celebrated across the country with official speeches, award ceremonies, cultural events, etc. It is a non-working holiday for most citizens of Kazakhstan because it always falls on a weekend.

=== Kenya ===
A public holiday in Kenya, Labour Day is commemorated yearly every 1 May. This celebration is usually marked with song and dance as Kenyans gather at designated locations to celebrate and listen to speeches from the leadership of the country. Francis Atwoli, Secretary General of the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) has been vocal in spearheading the celebrations in the country while advocating for favourable working conditions for the Kenyan people.

===Macau S.A.R.===
In Macau, 1 May is a public holiday and is officially known as (Portuguese for &#x27;Workers&#x27; Day&#x27;).

===Malaysia===
On 1 May, people in Malaysia take the time to remember the economic and social accomplishments of the labour movement.

Also known as May Day, this public holiday is sometimes celebrated with groups organising parades, rallies or both, to promote and protect workers&#x27; rights. 

===New Zealand===
Labour Day () is a public holiday in New Zealand and is held on the fourth Monday in October. Its origins are traced back to the eight-hour working day movement that arose in the newly founded Wellington colony in 1840, primarily because of carpenter Samuel Duncan Parnell&#x27;s refusal to work more than eight hours a day. That year, Parnell reportedly told a prospective employer: &quot;There are twenty-four hours per day given us; eight of these should be for work, eight for sleep, and the remaining eight for recreation&quot;.

The first Labour Day in New Zealand was celebrated on 28 October 1890, which marked the first anniversary of the Maritime Council, an organisation of transport and mining unions. Several thousand trade union members and supporters attended parades in the main city centres. Government employees were given the day off to attend, and many businesses closed for at least part of the day. Initially, the day was variously called Labour Day or Labour Demonstration Day.

In 1899, the government legislated that the day be a public holiday through the Labour Day Act of 1899. The day was set as the second Wednesday in October and first celebrated the following year, in 1900. In 1910, the holiday was moved to the fourth Monday in October.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, 1 May is Labour Day and is a public holiday all over the nation.

===Poland===
Poland celebrates Labour Day on 1 May. Since 3 May is the Constitution Day (and Catholic holiday - The Most Holy Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland), also a public holiday, they are often combined to generate the &quot;May long weekend&quot; because 2 May is Polish National Flag Day.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Labor Day is a public holiday commemorated nationwide on 1 May. Initially observed in 1903 through a protest by the Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina in Manila during the American colonial era, it was officially recognised as a holiday in 1908, with the first official commemoration taking place in 1913.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, Labour Day on 1 May is not a federal holiday across the entire country, but several of the Swiss cantons have made it one of their cantonal holidays. In the Canton of Fribourg, it is traditional for children to go singing at people&#x27;s doors in exchange for sweets and money.

===Taiwan===
Labour Day, observed 1 May, in Taiwan, is an official holiday, though not everybody gets a day off. Public servants, teachers and students do not have this day off.

===Tajikistan===
Labour Day was celebrated on 1 May in the Soviet Union, and the tradition lives on in Tajikistan as International Labour Day Although Labour Day is a working day, folk festivals, performances and fairs organised throughout the country create a holiday atmosphere.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
In Trinidad and Tobago, Labour Day is celebrated every 19 June. This public holiday was proposed in 1973 to be commemorated on the anniversary of the labour riots led by Tubal Uriah Butler in 1937, part of the British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–1939.

=== Turkey ===
In Turkey, 1 May () is an official holiday known as Labour and Solidarity Day. However, the state prohibits some demonstrations made by left-wing protesters, particularly those in Taksim, which carries historical significance due to the Taksim Square Massacre on 1 May 1977.

===United States===
In the United States, Labor Day is a federal holiday and public holiday observed on the first Monday of September. It is customarily viewed as the end of the summer vacation season. Many schools open for the year on the day after Labor Day. The origins of Labor Day can be traced back to 1872.

<doc id="18053" wikidata="Q2908463" url="?curid=18053" title="Bodyline">
<text>Bodyline, also known as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia. It was designed to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia&#x27;s leading batsman, Don Bradman. A bodyline delivery was one in which the cricket ball was bowled at pace, aimed at the body of the batsman in the expectation that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders deliberately placed nearby on the leg side.

At the time, no helmets or other upper-body protective gear was worn, and critics of the tactic considered it intimidating, and physically threatening in a game traditionally supposed to uphold conventions of sportsmanship. The England team&#x27;s use of the tactic was perceived by some, both in Australia and England, as overly aggressive or even unfair. It caused a controversy that rose to such a level that it threatened diplomatic relations between the two countries before the situation was calmed.

Although no serious injuries arose from any short-pitched deliveries while a leg theory field was set, the tactic led to considerable ill feeling between the two teams, particularly when Australian batsmen were struck, inflaming spectators. After the introduction of helmets, short-pitched fast bowling, sometimes exceeding , continues to be permitted in cricket, even when aimed at the batsman, and is considered to be a legitimate bowling tactic when used sparingly. Over time, several Laws of Cricket were changed to render the bodyline tactic less effective—and increase player safety—such as a legside field restriction, concussion breaks and inspections.

==Definition and etymology==
Bodyline is a tactic devised for and primarily used in the Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932–33. The tactic involved bowling at the leg stump or just outside it, but pitching the ball short so that, on bouncing, it reared up threateningly at the body of a batsman standing in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflection from the bat. The batsman&#x27;s options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike his body, or attempt to play the ball with his bat. The last course carried additional risks, as defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough to be caught by fielders on the leg side, and pull and hook shots could be caught near the boundary of the field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.

Bodyline bowling is intended to be intimidatory, and it was primarily designed as an attempt to curb the unusually prolific scoring of Donald Bradman, although other Australian batsmen such as Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford, and Alan Kippax were also targeted.

Several terms were used to describe this style of bowling before the name &#x27;bodyline&#x27; was used. Among the first to use it was the writer and former Australian Test cricketer Jack Worrall in the match between the English team and an Australian XI. When &#x27;bodyline&#x27; was first used in full, he referred to &quot;half-pitched slingers on the body line&quot; and first used it in print after the first Test. Other writers used a similar phrase around this time, but the first use of &#x27;bodyline&#x27; in print seems to have been by the journalist Hugh Buggy in the Melbourne &quot;Herald&quot;, in his report on the first day&#x27;s play of the first Test.

==Genesis==
===Leg theory bowling===
In the 19th century, most cricketers considered it unsportsmanlike to bowl the ball at the leg stump or for batsmen to hit on the leg side. But by the early years of the 20th century, some bowlers, usually slow or medium-paced, used leg theory as a tactic; the ball was aimed outside the line of leg stump and the fielders placed on that side of the field, the object being to test the batsman&#x27;s patience and force a rash stroke. Two English left-arm bowlers, George Hirst in 1903–04 and Frank Foster in 1911–12, bowled leg theory to packed leg side fields in Test matches in Australia; Warwick Armstrong also used it regularly for Australia. In the years immediately before the First World War, several bowlers used leg theory in English county cricket. Amongst these was the South African Basil Melle, who utilised leg theory bowling playing for Oxford University during the 1913 season, in which he took 55 wickets and in The University Match dominated the Cambridge University batsmen.

When cricket resumed after the war, few bowlers maintained the tactic, which was unpopular with spectators owing to its negativity. Fred Root, the Worcestershire bowler, used it regularly and with considerable success in county cricket. Root later defended the use of leg theory—and bodyline—observing that when bowlers bowled outside off stump, the batsmen always had the option to let the ball pass them without playing a shot, so they could scarcely complain.

Some fast bowlers experimented with leg theory prior to 1932, sometimes accompanying the tactic with short-pitched bowling. In 1925, Australian Jack Scott first bowled a form of what would later have been called bodyline in a state match for New South Wales; his captain Herbie Collins disliked it and would not let him use it again. Other Australian captains were less particular, including Vic Richardson, who asked the South Australian bowler Lance Gun to use it in 1925, and later let Scott use it when he moved to South Australia. Scott repeated the tactics against the MCC in 1928–29. In 1927, in a Test trial match, &quot;Nobby&quot; Clark bowled short to a leg-trap (a cluster of fielders placed close on the leg side). He was representing England in a side captained by Douglas Jardine. In 1928–29, Harry Alexander bowled fast leg theory at an England team, and Harold Larwood briefly used a similar tactic on that same tour in two Test matches. Freddie Calthorpe, the England captain, criticised Learie Constantine&#x27;s use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field in a Test match in 1930; one such ball struck Andy Sandham, but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a complaint from the England team.

===Donald Bradman===

The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-Test series 2–1, and Donald Bradman scored 974 runs at a batting average of 139.14, an aggregate record that still stands to this day. By the time of the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman&#x27;s average hovered around 100, approximately twice that of all other world-class batsmen. The English cricket authorities felt that specific tactics would be required to curtail Bradman from being even more successful on his own Australian pitches; some believed that Bradman was at his most vulnerable against leg-spin bowling as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; consequently two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.

Gradually, the idea developed that Bradman was possibly vulnerable to pace bowling. In the final Test of the 1930 Ashes series, while he was batting, the pitch became briefly difficult following rain. Bradman was observed to be uncomfortable facing deliveries which bounced higher than usual at a faster pace, being seen to consistently step back out of the line of the ball. Former England player and Surrey captain Percy Fender was one who noticed this, and the incident was much discussed by cricketers. Given that Bradman scored 232, it was not initially thought that a way to curb his prodigious scoring had been found. When Douglas Jardine later saw film footage of the Oval incident and noticed Bradman&#x27;s discomfort, according to his daughter he shouted, &quot;I&#x27;ve got it! He&#x27;s yellow!&quot; The theory of Bradman&#x27;s vulnerability developed further when Fender received correspondence from Australia in 1932, describing how Australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off side to play the ball on the on side. Fender showed these letters to his Surrey team-mate Jardine when it became clear that Jardine was to captain the English team in Australia during the 1932–33 tour, and he also discussed Bradman&#x27;s discomfort at the Oval. It was also known in England that Bradman was dismissed for a four-ball duck by fast bowler Eddie Gilbert, and had looked very uncomfortable. Bradman had also appeared uncomfortable against the pace of Sandy Bell in his innings of 299 not out at the Adelaide Oval in South Africa&#x27;s tour of Australia earlier in 1932, when the desperate bowler decided to bowl short to him, and fellow South African Herbie Taylor, according to Jack Fingleton, may have mentioned this to English cricketers in 1932. Fender felt Bradman might be vulnerable to fast, short-pitched deliveries on the line of leg stump. Jardine felt that Bradman was nervous about standing his ground against intimidatory bowling, citing instances in 1930 when he shuffled about, contrary to orthodox batting technique.

===Douglas Jardine===

Jardine&#x27;s first experience against Australia came when he scored an unbeaten 96 to secure a draw against the 1921 Australian touring side for Oxford University. The tourists were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred, but had tried to help him with some easy bowling. There has been speculation that this incident helped develop Jardine&#x27;s antipathy towards Australians, although Jardine&#x27;s biographer Christopher Douglas denies this. Jardine&#x27;s attitude towards Australia hardened after he toured the country in 1928–29. When he scored three consecutive hundreds in the early games, he was frequently jeered by the crowd for slow play; the Australian spectators took an increasing dislike to him, mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear—a Harlequin cap that was given to successful Oxford cricketers. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators; his general demeanour drew one comment of &quot;Where&#x27;s the butler to carry the bat for you?&quot; By this stage Jardine had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century at the start of the tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to Hunter Hendry that &quot;All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob&quot;. After the innings, when teammate Patsy Hendren remarked that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied &quot;It&#x27;s fucking mutual&quot;. During the tour, Jardine fielded next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked for his awkward fielding, particularly when chasing the ball. On one occasion, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.

Jardine was appointed captain of England for the 1931 season, replacing Percy Chapman who had led the team in 1930. He defeated New Zealand in his first series, but opinion was divided as to how effective he had been. The following season, he led England again and was appointed to lead the team to tour Australia for the 1932–33 Ashes series. A meeting was arranged between Jardine, Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr and his two fast bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Hotel to discuss a plan to combat Bradman. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl on leg stump and make the ball rise into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed they could, and that it might prove effective. Jardine also visited Frank Foster to discuss his field-placing in Australia in 1911–12.

Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with varying but increasing success and several injuries to batsmen. Ken Farnes experimented with short-pitched, leg-theory bowling but was not selected for the tour. Bill Bowes also used short-pitched bowling, notably against Jack Hobbs.

==Ashes series of 1932–33==

===Early development on tour===

The England team which toured Australia in 1932–33 contained four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers; such a heavy concentration on pace was unusual at the time, and drew comment from the Australian press and players, including Bradman. On the journey, Jardine instructed his team on how to approach the tour and discussed tactics with several players, including Larwood; at this stage, he seems to have settled on leg theory, if not full bodyline, as his main tactic. Some players later reported that he told them to hate the Australians in order to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as &quot;the little bastard.&quot; Upon arrival, Jardine quickly alienated the press and crowds through his manner and approach.

In the early matches, although there were instances of the English bowlers pitching the ball short and causing problems with their pace, full bodyline tactics were not used. There had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine. The English tactics changed in a game against an Australian XI team at Melbourne in mid-November, when full bodyline tactics were deployed for the first time. Jardine had left himself out of the English side, which was led instead by Bob Wyatt who later wrote that the team experimented with a diluted form of bodyline bowling. He reported to Jardine that Bradman, who was playing for the opposition, seemed uncomfortable against the bowling tactics of Larwood, Voce and Bowes. The crowd, press and Australian players were shocked by what they experienced and believed that the bowlers were targeting the batsmen&#x27;s heads. Bradman adopted unorthodox tactics—ducking, weaving and moving around the crease—which did not meet with universal approval from Australians and he scored just 36 and 13 in the match.

The tactic continued to be used in the next game by Voce (Larwood and Bowes did not play in this game), against New South Wales, for whom Jack Fingleton made a century and received several blows in the process. Bradman again failed twice, and had scored just 103 runs in six innings against the touring team; many Australian fans were now worried by Bradman&#x27;s form. Meanwhile, Jardine wrote to tell Fender that his information about the Australian batting technique was correct and that it meant he was having to move more and more fielders onto the leg side: &quot;if this goes on I shall have to move the whole bloody lot to the leg side.&quot;

The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were ethically wrong. But at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated bodyline but would not speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments at the start of the tour that cricket &quot;has become a synonym for all that is true and honest. To say &#x27;that is not cricket&#x27; implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals ... all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm.&quot;

===First two Test matches===

Bradman missed the first Test at Sydney, worn out by constant cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control. Jardine later wrote that the real reason was that the batsman had suffered a nervous breakdown. The English bowlers used bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd&#x27;s vocal displeasure, and the Australians lost the game by ten wickets. Larwood was particularly successful, returning match figures of ten wickets for 124 runs. One of the English bowlers, Gubby Allen, refused to bowl with fielders on the leg side, clashing with Jardine over these tactics. The only Australian batsman to make an impact was Stan McCabe, who hooked and pulled everything aimed at his upper body, to score 187 not out in four hours from 233 deliveries. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling.

Meanwhile, Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, not least by members of his own side such as Vic Richardson, or to include pace bowlers such as Eddie Gilbert or Laurie Nash to match the aggression of the opposition. But Woodfull refused to consider doing so. He had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.

For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman&#x27;s reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.

===Third Test match===

The controversy reached its peak during the Third Test at Adelaide. On the second day, a Saturday, before a crowd of 50,962 spectators, Australia bowled out England who had batted through the first day. In the third over of the Australian innings, Larwood bowled to Woodfull. The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull&#x27;s head and the final ball, delivered short on the line of middle stump, struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest, bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: &quot;Well bowled, Harold!&quot; Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, who was also batting at the time, Woodfull was appalled. Play resumed after a brief delay, once it was certain the Australian captain was fit to carry on and, since Larwood&#x27;s over had ended, Woodfull did not have to face the bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had done so. Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the angry spectators became extremely volatile. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. The fury of the crowd was such that a riot might have occurred had another incident taken place and several writers suggested that the anger of the spectators was the culmination of feelings built up over the two months that bodyline had developed.

During the over, another rising Larwood delivery knocked the bat out of Woodfull&#x27;s hands. He batted for 89 minutes, being hit a few more times before Allen bowled him for 22. Later in the day, Pelham Warner, one of the England managers, visited the Australian dressing room. He expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian&#x27;s response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not.&quot; Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, &quot;This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it.&quot; Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.

There was no play on the following day, Sunday being a rest day, but on Monday morning, the exchange between Warner and Woodfull was reported in several Australian newspapers. The players and officials were horrified that a sensitive private exchange had been reported to the press. Leaks to the press were practically unknown in 1933. David Frith notes that discretion and respect were highly prized and such a leak was &quot;regarded as a moral offence of the first order.&quot; Woodfull made it clear that he severely disapproved of the leak, and later wrote that he &quot;always expected cricketers to do the right thing by their team-mates.&quot; As the only full-time journalist in the Australian team, suspicion immediately fell on Fingleton, although as soon as the story was published, he told Woodfull he was not responsible. Warner offered Larwood a reward of one pound if he could dismiss Fingleton in the second innings; Larwood obliged by bowling him for a duck. Fingleton later claimed that Sydney Sun reporter Claude Corbett had received the information from Bradman; for the rest of their lives, Fingleton and Bradman made claim and counter-claim that the other man was responsible for the leak.
The following day, as Australia faced a large deficit on the first innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in support of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. In the course of the innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but lost sight of the ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and fell to his knees and play stopped as Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field. The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued. Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield&#x27;s wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.

===The cable exchange===
At the end of the fourth day&#x27;s play of the third Test match, the Australian Board of Control sent a cable to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), cricket&#x27;s ruling body and the club that selected the England team, in London:

Not all Australians, including the press and players, believed that the cable should have been sent, particularly immediately following a heavy defeat. The suggestion of unsportsmanlike behaviour was deeply resented by the MCC, and was one of the worst accusations that could have been levelled at the team at the time. Additionally, members of the MCC believed that the Australians had over-reacted to the English bowling. The MCC took some time to draft a reply:

At this point, the remainder of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; accusation.

The Australian Board met to draft a reply cable, which was sent on 30 January, indicating that they wished the series to continue and offering to postpone consideration of the fairness of bodyline bowling until after the series. The MCC&#x27;s reply, on 2 February, suggested that continuing the series would be impossible unless the accusation of unsporting behaviour was withdrawn.

The situation escalated into a diplomatic incident. Figures high up in both the British and Australian government saw bodyline as potentially fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs James Henry Thomas that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled when the Australian prime minister, Joseph Lyons, met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Following considerable discussion and debate in the English and Australian press, the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which, while maintaining its opposition to bodyline bowling, stated &quot;We do not regard the sportsmanship of your team as being in question&quot;. Even so, correspondence between the Australian Board and the MCC continued for almost a year.

===The end of the series===
Voce missed the fourth Test of the series, being replaced by a leg spinner, Tommy Mitchell. Larwood continued to use bodyline, but he was the only bowler in the team using the tactic; even so, he used it less frequently than usual and seemed less effective in high temperatures and humidity. England won the game by eight wickets, thanks in part to an innings of 83 by Eddie Paynter who had been admitted to hospital with tonsillitis but left in order to bat when England were struggling in their innings. Voce returned for the final Test, but neither he nor Allen were fully fit, and despite the use of bodyline tactics, Australia scored 435 at a rapid pace, aided by several dropped catches. Australia included a fast bowler for this final game, Harry Alexander who bowled some short deliveries but was not allowed to use many fielders on the leg side by his captain, Woodfull. England built a lead of 19 but their tactics in Australia&#x27;s second innings were disrupted when Larwood left the field with an injured foot; Hedley Verity, a spinner, claimed five wickets to bowl Australia out; England won by eight wickets and won the series by four Tests to one.

==In England==
Bodyline continued to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. Jardine himself had to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The West Indian cricket team toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at Old Trafford, Jackie Grant, their captain, decided to try bodyline. He had a couple of fast bowlers, Manny Martindale and Learie Constantine. Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with Wally Hammond being hit on the chin, though he recovered to continue his innings. Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine. Jardine never flinched. With Les Ames finding himself in difficulties, Jardine said, &quot;You get yourself down this end, Les. I&#x27;ll take care of this bloody nonsense.&quot; He played right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and played them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. While the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55. Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century. In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. The match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning English opinion against bodyline. &quot;The Times&quot; used the word bodyline, without using inverted commas or using the qualification &quot;so-called&quot;, for the first time. &quot;Wisden&quot; also said that &quot;most of those watching it for the first time must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice.&quot;

In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England&#x27;s new captain, Bob Wyatt, agreements were put in place so that bodyline would not be used. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.

In a match between the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, one of the bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed the strategy with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height. Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce&#x27;s leg-side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would not return to the country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.

==Changes to the laws of cricket==
As a direct consequence of the 1932–33 tour, the MCC introduced a new rule to the Laws of Cricket for the 1935 English cricket season. Originally, the MCC hoped that captains would ensure that the game was played in the correct spirit, and passed a resolution that bodyline bowling would breach this spirit. When this proved to be insufficient, the MCC passed a law that &quot;direct attack&quot; bowling was unfair and became the responsibility of the umpires to identify and stop. In 1957, the laws were altered to prevent more than two fielders standing behind square on the leg side; the intention was to prevent negative bowling tactics whereby off spinners and slow inswing bowlers aimed at the leg stump of batsmen with fielders concentrated on the leg side. However, an indirect effect was to make bodyline fields impossible to implement.

Later law changes, under the heading of &quot;Intimidatory Short Pitched Bowling&quot;, also restricted the number of &quot;bouncers&quot; which might be bowled in an over. Nevertheless, the tactic of intimidating the batsman is still used to an extent that would have been shocking in 1933, although it is less dangerous now because today&#x27;s players wear helmets and generally far more protective gear. The West Indies teams of the 1980s, who regularly fielded a bowling attack comprising some of the best fast bowlers in cricket history, were perhaps the most feared exponents.

==Reaction==
The English players and management were consistent in referring to their tactic as &quot;fast leg theory&quot;, considering it to be a variant of the established and unobjectionable leg theory tactic. The inflammatory term &quot;bodyline&quot; was coined and perpetuated by the Australian press (see above). English writers used the term &quot;fast leg theory&quot;. The terminology reflected differences in understanding, as neither the English public nor the Board of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—the governing body of English cricket—could understand why the Australians were complaining about what they perceived as a commonly used tactic. Some concluded that the Australian cricket authorities and public were sore losers. Of the four fast bowlers in the tour party, Gubby Allen was a voice of dissent in the English camp, refusing to bowl short on the leg side, and writing several letters home to England critical of Jardine, although he did not express this in public in Australia. A number of other players, while maintaining a united front in public, also deplored bodyline in private. The amateurs Bob Wyatt (the vice-captain), Freddie Brown and the Nawab of Pataudi opposed it, as did Wally Hammond and Les Ames among the professionals.

During the season, Woodfull&#x27;s physical courage, stoic and dignified leadership won him many admirers. He flatly refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did not publicly complain even though he and his men were repeatedly hit.

Jardine however insisted his tactic was not designed to cause injury and that he was leading his team in a sportsmanlike and gentlemanly manner, arguing that it was up to the Australian batsmen to play their way out of trouble.

It was subsequently revealed that several of the players had private reservations, but they did not express them publicly at the time.

==Legacy==
Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, including many of the players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many argued that it was a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and it was voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, &quot;In Quest of the Ashes&quot;, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.

Outside the sport, there were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country avoided goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the &quot;North China Daily News&quot; published a pro-bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in Hong Kong and Shanghai were lost by Australians because of local reactions. English immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly. In 1934–35 a statue of Prince Albert in Sydney was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word &quot;BODYLINE&quot; painted on it. Both before and after World War II, numerous satirical cartoons and comedy skits were written, mostly in Australia, based on events of the bodyline tour. Generally, they poked fun at the English.

In 1984, Australia&#x27;s Network Ten produced a television mini-series titled &quot;Bodyline&quot;, dramatising the events of the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred Gary Sweet as Don Bradman, Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine, Jim Holt as Harold Larwood, Rhys McConnochie as Pelham Warner, and Frank Thring as Jardine&#x27;s mentor Lord Harris. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a British flag at the Adelaide Oval, an event which was never documented. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, was largely welcomed with open arms, although received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired. The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism.

To this day, the bodyline tour remains one of the most significant events in the history of cricket, and it is still strong in the consciousness of many cricket followers. In a poll of cricket journalists, commentators, and players in 2004, the bodyline tour was ranked the most important event in cricket history.

<doc id="18056" wikidata="Q6504905" url="?curid=18056" title="Laws of infernal dynamics">
<text>The laws of infernal dynamics are an adage about the cursedness of the universe. Attributed to science fiction author David Gerrold, the laws are as follows:

#An object in motion will be moving in the wrong direction.
#An object at rest will be in the wrong place.
#The energy required to move an object in the correct direction, or put it in the right place, will be more than you wish to expend but not so much as to make the task impossible.

The laws are a parody on the first and second of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion in the spirit of Murphy&#x27;s law. Newton&#x27;s first law of motion has here been split into two parts, the first two laws. Newton&#x27;s third law of motion is left unparodied, though a separate adage states that &quot;for every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism.&quot;

<text>Karen Louise Erdrich ( ; born June 7, 1954) is a Native American author of novels, poetry, and children&#x27;s books featuring Native American characters and settings. She is an enrolled citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians of North Dakota, a federally recognized Ojibwe people.

Erdrich is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant writers of the second wave of the Native American Renaissance. She has written 28 books in all, including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and children&#x27;s books. In 2009, her novel &quot;The Plague of Doves&quot; was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and received an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. In November 2012, she received the National Book Award for Fiction for her novel &quot;The Round House&quot;. She is a 2013 recipient of the Alex Awards. She was awarded the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction at the National Book Festival in September 2015. In 2021, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel &quot;The Night Watchman&quot;.

She was married to author Michael Dorris and the two collaborated on a number of works. The couple separated in 1995 and then divorced in 1996; Dorris would also take his own life in 1997 as allegations that he sexually abused at least three of the daughters whom he raised with Erdrich were under investigation.

She is also the owner of Birchbark Books, a small independent bookstore in Minneapolis that focuses on Native American literature and the Native community in the Twin Cities.

== Personal life ==
Erdrich was born on June 7, 1954, in Little Falls, Minnesota. She was the oldest of seven children born to Ralph Erdrich, a German-American, and Rita (née Gourneau), an Ojibwe woman of French descent. Both parents taught at a boarding school in Wahpeton, North Dakota, set up by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Erdrich&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Patrick Gourneau, served as tribal chairman for the federally recognized tribe of Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians for many years. Though not raised in a reservation, she often visited relatives there. She was raised &quot;with all the accepted truths&quot; of Catholicism.

While Erdrich was a child, her father paid her a nickel for every story she wrote. Her sister Heidi became a poet and also lives in Minnesota; she publishes under the name Heid E. Erdrich. Their sister Lise Erdrich has written children&#x27;s books and collections of fiction and essays.

Erdrich attended Dartmouth College from 1972 to 1976. She was a part of the first class of women admitted to the college and earned a B.A. in English. During her first year, Erdrich met Michael Dorris, an anthropologist, writer, and then-director of the new Native American Studies program. While attending Dorris&#x27; class, she began to look into her own ancestry, which inspired her to draw from it for her literary work, such as poems, short stories, and novels. During that time, she worked as a lifeguard, waitress, researcher for films, and as an editor for the Boston Indian Council newspaper &quot;The Circle.&quot;

In 1978, Erdrich enrolled in a Master of Arts program at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. She earned the Master of Arts in the Writing Seminars in 1979. Erdrich later published some of the poems and stories she wrote while in the M.A. program. She returned to Dartmouth as a writer-in-residence.

After graduating from Dartmouth, Erdrich remained in contact with Michael Dorris. He attended one of her poetry readings, became impressed with her work, and developed an interest in working with her. Although Erdrich and Dorris were on two different sides of the world, Erdrich in Boston and Dorris in New Zealand for field research, the two began to collaborate on short stories.

The pair&#x27;s literary partnership led them to a romantic relationship. They married in 1981, and raised three children whom Dorris had adopted as a single parent (Reynold Abel, Madeline, and Sava) and three biological children together (Persia, Pallas, and Aza Marion). Reynold Abel suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and in 1991, at age 23, he was killed when he was hit by a car. In 1995, their son Sava accused Dorris of committing child abuse; in 1997, after Dorris&#x27; death, his adopted daughter Madeline claimed that Dorris had sexually abused her and Erdrich had neglected to stop the abuse.

Dorris and Erdrich separated in 1995, and would divorce in 1996. Dorris, who was accused of sexually abusing two of the biological daughters he had with Erdrich, died by suicide in 1997. In his will, he omitted Erdrich and his adopted children Sava and Madeline; Madeline accused Dorris of sexually abusing her as well.

In 2001, at age 47, Erdrich gave birth to a daughter, Azure, whose Native American father Erdrich declines to identify publicly. She discusses her pregnancy with Azure, and Azure&#x27;s father, in her 2003 nonfiction book, &quot;Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country&quot;. She uses the name &quot;Tobasonakwut&quot; to refer to him. He is described as a traditional healer and teacher, who is eighteen years Erdrich&#x27;s senior and a married man. In a number of publications, Tobasonakwut Kinew, who died in 2012, is referred to as Erdrich&#x27;s partner and the father of Azure.

When asked in an interview if writing is a lonely life for her, Erdrich replied, &quot;Strangely, I think it is. I am surrounded by an abundance of family and friends and yet I am alone with the writing. And that is perfect.&quot; Erdrich lives in Minneapolis.

==Work==
In 1979, she wrote &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Fisherman&quot;, a short story about June Kashpaw, a divorced Ojibwe woman whose death by hypothermia brought her relatives home to a fictional North Dakota reservation for her funeral. She wrote this while &quot;barricaded in the kitchen.&quot; At her husband&#x27;s urging, she submitted it to the Nelson Algren Short Fiction competition in 1982 for which it won the $5,000 prize, and eventually it became the first chapter of her debut novel, &quot;Love Medicine&quot;, published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1984.

&quot;When I found out about the prize I was living on a farm in New Hampshire near the college I&#x27;d attended,&quot; Erdrich told an interviewer. &quot;I was nearly broke and driving a car with bald tires. My mother knitted my sweaters, and all else I bought at thrift stores ... The recognition dazzled me. Later, I became friends with Studs Terkel and Kay Boyle, the judges, toward whom I carry a lifelong gratitude. This prize made an immense difference in my life.&quot;

&quot;Love Medicine&quot; won the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award. It is the only debut novel ever to receive that honor. Erdrich later turned &quot;Love Medicine&quot; into a tetralogy that includes &quot;The Beet Queen&quot; (1986), &quot;Tracks&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Bingo Palace&quot; (1994). It has also been featured on the National Advanced Placement Test for Literature.

In the early years of their marriage, Erdrich and Michael Dorris often collaborated on their work, saying they plotted the books together, &quot;talk about them before any writing is done, and then we share almost every day, whatever it is we&#x27;ve written&quot; but &quot;the person whose name is on the books is the one who&#x27;s done most of the primary writing.&quot; They got started with &quot;domestic, romantic stuff&quot; published under the shared pen name of &quot;Milou North&quot; (Michael + Louise + where they live).

During the publication of &quot;Love Medicine&quot;, Erdrich produced her first collection of poems, &quot;Jacklight&quot; (1984), which highlights the struggles between Native and non-Native cultures, as well as celebrating family, ties of kinship, autobiographical meditations, monologues, and love poetry. She incorporates elements of Ojibwe myths and legends. Erdrich continues to write poems, which have been included in her collections.

Erdrich is best known as a novelist, and has published a dozen award-winning and best-selling novels. She followed &quot;Love Medicine&quot; with &quot;The Beet Queen&quot; (1986), which continued her technique of using multiple narrators and expanded the fictional reservation universe of &quot;Love Medicine&quot; to include the nearby town of Argus, North Dakota. The action of the novel takes place mostly before World War II. Leslie Marmon Silko accused Erdrich&#x27;s &quot;The Beet Queen&quot; of being more concerned with postmodern technique than with the political struggles of Native peoples.

&quot;Tracks&quot; (1988) goes back to the early 20th century at the formation of the reservation. It introduces the trickster figure of Nanapush, who owes a clear debt to Ojibwe figure Nanabozho. There are many studies of the trickster figure in Erdrich&#x27;s novels. &quot;Tracks&quot; shows early clashes between traditional ways and the Roman Catholic Church. &quot;The Bingo Palace&quot; (1994), set in the 1980s, describes the effects of a casino and a factory on the reservation community. &quot;Tales of Burning Love&quot; (1997) finishes the story of Sister Leopolda, a recurring character from all the previous books, and introduces a new set of European-American people into the reservation universe.
&quot;The Antelope Wife&quot; (1998), Erdrich&#x27;s first novel after her divorce from Dorris, was the first of her novels to be set outside the continuity of the previous books. Erdrich heavily revised the book in 2009 and published the revision as &quot;The Antelope Woman&quot; in 2016.

She subsequently returned to the reservation and nearby towns. She has published five novels since 1998 dealing with events in that fictional area. Among these are &quot;The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Master Butchers Singing Club&quot; (2003). Both novels have geographic and character connections with &quot;The Beet Queen&quot;. In 2009, Erdrich was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for &quot;The Plague of Doves&quot; and a National Book Award finalist for &quot;The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse&quot;. &quot;The Plague of Doves&quot; focuses on the historical lynching of four Native people wrongly accused of murdering a White family, and the effect of this injustice on the following generations. Her Pulitzer Prize–winning novel &quot;The Night Watchman&quot; (2020) concerns a campaign to defeat the &#x27;termination bill&#x27; (introduced by Senator Arthur Vivian Watkins), and Erdrich acknowledged her sources and its inspiration being her maternal grandfather&#x27;s life. Her most recent novel, &quot;The Sentence&quot;, tells the fictional story of a haunting at Erdrich&#x27;s Minneapolis bookstore, set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, George Floyd&#x27;s murder, and the resulting protests.

She also writes for younger audiences; she has a children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Grandmother&#x27;s Pigeon,&quot; and her children&#x27;s book &quot;The Birchbark House&quot;, was a National Book Award finalist. She continued the series with &quot;The Game of Silence&quot;, winner of the Scott O&#x27;Dell Award for Historical Fiction, &quot;The Porcupine Year&quot;, &quot;Chickadee&quot;, and &quot;Makoons&quot;.

===Nonfiction and teaching===
In addition to fiction and poetry, Erdrich has published nonfiction. &quot;The Blue Jay&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1995) is about her pregnancy and the birth of her third child. &quot;Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country&quot; (2003) traces her travels in northern Minnesota and Ontario&#x27;s lakes following the birth of her youngest daughter.

===Influence and style===
Her heritage from both parents is influential in her life and prominent in her work. Although many of Erdrich&#x27;s works explore her Native American heritage, her novel &quot;The Master Butchers Singing Club&quot; (2003) featured the European, specifically German, side of her ancestry. The novel includes stories of a World War I veteran of the German Army and is set in a small North Dakota town. The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award. 
Erdrich&#x27;s interwoven series of novels have drawn comparisons with William Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha novels. Like Faulkner&#x27;s, Erdrich&#x27;s successive novels created multiple narratives in the same fictional area and combined the tapestry of local history with current themes and modern consciousness.

==Birchbark Books==

Erdrich&#x27;s bookstore hosts literary readings and other events. Her new works are read here, and events celebrate the works and careers of other writers as well, particularly local Native writers. Erdrich and her staff consider Birchbark Books to be a &quot;teaching bookstore&quot;.

<text>Latin literature includes the essays, histories, poems, plays, and other writings written in the Latin language. The beginning of formal Latin literature dates to 240 BC, when the first stage play in Latin was performed in Rome. Latin literature flourished for the next six centuries. The classical era of Latin literature can be roughly divided into several periods: Early Latin literature, The Golden Age, The Imperial Period and Late Antiquity.

Latin was the language of the ancient Romans as well as being the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Western and Central Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Latin literature features the work of Roman authors, such as Cicero, Virgil, Ovid and Horace, but also includes the work of European writers after the fall of the Empire; from religious writers like Aquinas (1225–1274), to secular writers like Francis Bacon (1561–1626), Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727).

== History ==

=== Early Latin literature ===
Although literature in Latin followed a continual development over several centuries, the beginnings of formal Latin literature started with the regular performance of comedies and tragedies in Rome in 240 BC, one year after the conclusion of the First Punic War. These initial comedies and tragedies were adapted from Greek drama by Livius Andronicus, a Greek prisoner of war who had been brought to Rome as a slave in 272 BC. Andronicus translated Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; into Latin using a traditional Latin verse form called Saturnian meter. In 235 BC, Gnaeus Naevius, a Roman citizen, continued this tradition of producing dramas that were reworkings of Greek originals, or &quot;fabula palliata&quot;, and he expanded on this by producing a new type of drama, &quot;fabula praetexta&quot;, or tragedies based on Roman myths and history, starting in 222 BC. Later in life, Naevius composed an epic poem in Saturnian meter on the first Punic War, in which he had fought.

Other epic poets followed Naevius. Quintus Ennius wrote an historical epic, the &quot;Annals&quot; (soon after 200 BC), describing Roman history from the founding of Rome to his own time. He adopted the Greek dactylic hexameter, which became the standard verse form for Roman epics. He became well known for his tragic dramas. Successors in this field include Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius. These three writers rarely used episodes from Roman history, but they wrote Latin versions of tragic themes that the Greeks had already written about. Even when they copied the Greeks, their translations were not straightforward replicas of the original Greek works. Only fragments of their plays have survived.

Considerably more is known about early Latin comedy, as 26 Early Latin comedies are extant – 20 of which were written by Plautus; the remaining six were written by Terence. These men modeled their comedies on Greek plays known as New Comedy, but treated the plots and wording of the originals freely. Plautus scattered songs throughout his plays and added to the humor with puns and wisecracks, as well as comic actions by the actors. Terence&#x27;s plays were more austere in tone, dealing with domestic situations. His works provided the chief inspiration for French and English comedies of the 17th century AD.

The prose of the period is best known through &quot;On Agriculture&quot; (160 BC) by Cato the Elder. Cato wrote the first Latin history of Rome and of other Italian cities. He was the first Roman statesman to put his political speeches in writing as a means of influencing public opinion.

Early Latin literature ended with Gaius Lucilius, who created a new kind of poetry in his 30 books of &quot;Satires&quot; (2nd century BC). He wrote in an easy, conversational tone about books, food, friends, and current events.

=== The Golden Age ===
Traditionally, the height of Latin literature has been assigned to the period from 81 BC to AD 17, although recent scholarship has questioned the assumptions that privileged the works of this period over both earlier and later works. This period is usually said to have begun with the first known speech of Cicero and ended with the death of Ovid.

==== The age of Cicero ====
Cicero has traditionally been considered the master of Latin prose. The writing he produced from about 80 BC until his death in 43 BC exceeds that of any Latin author whose work survives in terms of quantity and variety of genre and subject matter, as well as possessing unsurpassed stylistic excellence. Cicero&#x27;s many works can be divided into four groups: (1) letters, (2) rhetorical treatises, (3) philosophical works, and (4) orations. His letters provide detailed information about an important period in Roman history and offer a vivid picture of the public and private life among the Roman governing class. Cicero&#x27;s works on oratory are our most valuable Latin sources for ancient theories on education and rhetoric. His philosophical works were the basis of moral philosophy during the Middle Ages. His speeches inspired many European political leaders and the founders of the United States.
Julius Caesar and Sallust were significant historical writers of Cicero&#x27;s time. Caesar wrote commentaries on the Gallic and civil wars in a straightforward style to justify his actions as a general. He wrote descriptions of people and their motives.

The birth of lyric poetry in Latin occurred during the same period. The lyrics of Catullus, whom the writer Aulus Gellius called &quot;the most elegant of poets&quot;, are noted for their emotional intensity. Contemporary with Catullus, Lucretius expounded the Epicurean philosophy in a long poem, &quot;De rerum natura&quot;.

One of the most prolific writers of the period was Marcus Terentius Varro. Referred to as &quot;the most learned of the Romans&quot; by Quintillian, he wrote about a remarkable variety of subjects, from religion to poetry, but only his writings on agriculture and the Latin language are extant in their complete form.

==== The Augustan Age ====

The emperor Augustus took a personal interest in the literary works produced during his years of power from 27 BC to AD 14. This period is sometimes called the Augustan Age of Latin Literature. Virgil published his pastoral &quot;Eclogues&quot;, the &quot;Georgics&quot;, and the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, an epic poem describing the events that led to the creation of Rome. Virgil told how the Trojan hero Aeneas became the ancestor of the Roman people. Virgil provided divine justification for Roman rule over the world. Although Virgil died before he could put the finishing touches on his poem, it was soon regarded as the greatest work of Latin literature.

Virgil&#x27;s friend Horace wrote &quot;Epodes&quot;, &quot;Odes&quot;, &quot;Satires&quot;, and &quot;Epistles&quot;. The perfection of the &quot;Odes&quot; in content, form, and style has charmed readers for hundreds of years. The &quot;Satires&quot; and &quot;Epistles&quot; discuss ethical and literary problems in an urbane, witty manner. Horace&#x27;s &quot;Art of Poetry&quot;, probably published as a separate work, greatly influenced later poetic theories. It stated the basic rules of classical writing as the Romans understood and used them. After Virgil died, Horace was Rome&#x27;s leading poet.

The Latin elegy reached its highest development in the works of Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid. Most of this poetry is concerned with love. Ovid wrote the &quot;Fasti&quot;, which describes Roman festivals and their legendary origins. Ovid&#x27;s greatest work, the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; weaves various myths into a fast-paced, fascinating story. Ovid was a witty writer who excelled in creating lively and passionate characters. The &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; was the best-known source of Greek and Roman mythology throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It inspired many poets, painters, and composers.

One of the few female poets of ancient Rome whose work has survived is Sulpicia.

In prose, Livy produced a history of the Roman people in 142 books. Only 35 survived, but they are a major source of information on Rome.

=== The Imperial Period ===
From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until about 200, Roman authors emphasized style and tried new and startling ways of expression. During the reign of Nero from 54 to 68, the Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote a number of dialogues and letters on such moral themes as mercy and generosity. In his &quot;Natural Questions&quot;, Seneca analyzed earthquakes, floods, and storms. Seneca&#x27;s tragedies greatly influenced the growth of tragic drama in Europe. His nephew Lucan wrote the &quot;Pharsalia&quot; (about 60), an epic poem describing the civil war between Caesar and Pompey. The &quot;Satyricon&quot; (about 60) by Petronius was the first picaresque Latin novel. Only fragments of the complete work survive. It describes the adventures of various low-class characters in absurd, extravagant, and dangerous situations, often in the world of petty crime.

Epic poems included the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Gaius Valerius Flaccus, following the story of Jason and the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece, the &quot;Thebaid&quot; of Statius, following the conflict of Oedipus&#x27;s sons and the Seven Against Thebes, and the &quot;Punica&quot; of Silius Italicus, following the Second Punic War and the invasions of Hannibal into Italy. At the hands of Martial, the epigram achieved the stinging quality still associated with it. Juvenal satirized vice.

The historian Tacitus painted an unforgettably dark picture of the early empire in his &quot;Histories&quot; and &quot;Annals&quot;, both written in the early 2nd century. His contemporary Suetonius wrote biographies of the 12 Roman rulers from Julius Caesar through Domitian. The letters of Pliny the Younger described Roman life of the period. Quintilian composed the most complete work on ancient education that we possess. Important works from the 2nd century include the &quot;Attic Nights&quot; of Aulus Gellius, a collection of anecdotes and reports of literary discussions among his friends; and the letters of the orator Marcus Cornelius Fronto to Marcus Aurelius. The most famous work of the period was &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, also called &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;, by Apuleius. This novel concerns a young man who is accidentally changed into a donkey. The story is filled with tales of love and witchcraft.

=== Latin in the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Early Modernity ===
Pagan Latin literature showed a final burst of vitality from the late 3rd century till the 5th centuries – Ammianus Marcellinus in history, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus in oratory, and Ausonius and Rutilius Claudius Namatianus in poetry. The &quot;Mosella&quot; by Ausonius demonstrated a modernism of feeling that indicates the end of classical literature as such.

Writers who laid the foundations of Christian Latin literature during the 4th century and 5th century included the church fathers Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, and Ambrose, and the first great Christian poet, Prudentius. Some Latin writing by Christian women also survives: the prison diary of the martyr Perpetua of Carthage, and an account of a Christian pilgrimage by the pilgrim Egeria.

During the Renaissance there was a return to the Latin of classical times, called for this reason Neo-Latin. This purified language continued to be used as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; among the learned throughout Europe, with the great works of Descartes, Francis Bacon, and Baruch Spinoza all being composed in Latin. Among the last important books written primarily in Latin prose were the works of Swedenborg (d. 1772), Linnaeus (d. 1778), Euler (d. 1783), Gauss (d. 1855), and Isaac Newton (d. 1727), and Latin remains a necessary skill for modern readers of great early modern works of linguistics, literature, and philosophy.

Several of the leading English poets wrote in Latin as well as English. Milton&#x27;s 1645 Poems are one example, but there were also Thomas Campion, George Herbert and Milton&#x27;s colleague Andrew Marvell. Some indeed wrote chiefly in Latin and were valued for the elegance and Classicism of their style. Examples of these were Anthony Alsop and Vincent Bourne, who were noted for the ingenious way that they adapted their verse to describing details of life in the 18th century while never departing from the purity of Latin diction. One of the last to be noted for the quality of his Latin verse well into the 19th century was Walter Savage Landor.

== Characteristics ==
Much Latin writing reflects the Romans&#x27; interest in rhetoric, the art of speaking and persuading. Public speaking had great importance for educated Romans because most of them wanted successful political careers. When Rome was a republic, effective speaking often determined who would be elected or what bills would pass. After Rome became an empire, the ability to impress and persuade people by the spoken word lost much of its importance. But training in rhetoric continued to flourish and to affect styles of writing. A large part of rhetoric consists of the ability to present a familiar idea in a striking new manner that attracts attention. Latin authors became masters of this art of variety.

=== Language and form ===

Latin is a highly inflected language, with many grammatical forms for various words. As a result, it can be used with a pithiness and brevity unknown in English. It lends itself to elaboration, because its tight syntax holds even the longest and most complex sentence together as a logical unit. Latin can be used with conciseness, as in the works of Sallust and Tacitus. Or it can have wide, sweeping phrases, as in the works of Livy and the speeches of Cicero.

Latin lacks the poetic vocabulary of Greek. Some earlier Roman poets tried to make up for this deficiency by creating new compound words, as the Greeks had done; nevertheless, Roman writers seldom invented words. Except in epic poetry, they tended to use familiar vocabulary, giving it poetic value by combinations of words and by rich sound effects. Rome&#x27;s leading poets had great technical skill in the choice and arrangement of language. They had an intimate knowledge of the Greek poets, whose themes appear in almost all Roman literature.

<text>Leonard Bloomfield (April 1, 1887 – April 18, 1949) was an American linguist who led the development of structural linguistics in the United States during the 1930s and the 1940s. He is considered to be the father of American distributionalism. His influential textbook &quot;Language&quot;, published in 1933, presented a comprehensive description of American structural linguistics. He made significant contributions to Indo-European historical linguistics, the description of Austronesian languages, and description of languages of the Algonquian family.

Bloomfield&#x27;s approach to linguistics was characterized by its emphasis on the scientific basis of linguistics and emphasis on formal procedures for the analysis of linguistic data. The influence of Bloomfieldian structural linguistics declined in the late 1950s and 1960s as the theory of generative grammar developed by Noam Chomsky came to predominate.

==Early life and education==
Bloomfield was born in Chicago, Illinois, on April 1, 1887, to Jewish parents (Sigmund Bloomfield and Carola Buber Bloomfield). His father immigrated to the United States as a child in 1868; the original family name &quot;Blumenfeld&quot; was changed to Bloomfield after their arrival. In 1896 his family moved to Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin, where he attended elementary school, but returned to Chicago for secondary school. His uncle Maurice Bloomfield was a prominent linguist at Johns Hopkins University, and his aunt Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler was a well-known concert pianist.

Bloomfield attended Harvard College from 1903 to 1906, graduating with the A.B. degree. He subsequently began graduate work at the University of Wisconsin, taking courses in German and Germanic philology, in addition to courses in other Indo-European languages. A meeting with Indo-Europeanist Eduard Prokosch, a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin, convinced Bloomfield to pursue a career in linguistics. In 1908 Bloomfield moved to the University of Chicago, where he took courses in German and Indo-European philology with Frances A. Wood and Carl Darling Buck. His doctoral dissertation in Germanic historical linguistics, &quot;A semasiologic differentiation in Germanic secondary ablaut&quot;, was supervised by Wood, and he graduated in 1909.

He undertook further studies at the University of Leipzig and the University of Göttingen in 1913 and 1914 with leading Indo-Europeanists August Leskien, Karl Brugmann, as well as Hermann Oldenberg, a specialist in Vedic Sanskrit. Bloomfield also studied at Göttingen with Sanskrit specialist Jacob Wackernagel, and considered both Wackernagel and the Sanskrit grammatical tradition of rigorous grammatical analysis associated with Pāṇini as important influences on both his historical and descriptive work. Further training in Europe was a condition for promotion at the University of Illinois from Instructor to the rank of assistant professor.

==Career==
Bloomfield was instructor in German at the University of Cincinnati, 1909–1910; Instructor in German at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, 1910–1913; promoted to Assistant Professor of Comparative Philology and German, also University of Illinois, 1913–1921; Professor of German and Linguistics at the Ohio State University, 1921–1927; Professor of Germanic Philology at the University of Chicago, 1927–1940; Sterling Professor of Linguistics at Yale University, 1940–1949. During the summer of 1925 Bloomfield worked as Assistant Ethnologist with the Geological Survey of Canada in the Canadian Department of Mines, undertaking linguistic field work on Plains Cree; this position was arranged by Edward Sapir, who was then Chief of the Division of Anthropology, Victoria Museum, Geological Survey of Canada, Canadian Department of Mines. In May 1946, he suffered a debilitating stroke, which ended his career.

Bloomfield was one of the founding members of the Linguistic Society of America. In 1924, along with George M. Bolling (Ohio State University) and Edgar Sturtevant (Yale University) he formed a committee to organize the creation of the Society, and drafted the call for the Society&#x27;s foundation. He contributed the lead article to the inaugural issue of the Society&#x27;s journal &quot;Language&quot;, and was President of the Society in 1935. He taught in the Society&#x27;s summer Linguistic Institute in 1938–1941, with the 1938–1940 Institutes being held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the 1941 Institute in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Bloomfield was also a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Indo-European linguistics==
Bloomfield&#x27;s earliest work was in historical Germanic studies, beginning with his dissertation, and continuing with a number of papers on Indo-European and Germanic phonology and morphology. His post-doctoral studies in Germany further strengthened his expertise in the Neogrammarian tradition, which still dominated Indo-European historical studies. Bloomfield throughout his career, but particularly during his early career, emphasized the Neogrammarian principle of regular sound change as a foundational concept in historical linguistics.

Bloomfield&#x27;s work in Indo-European beyond his dissertation was limited to an article on palatal consonants in Sanskrit and one article on the Sanskrit grammatical tradition associated with Pāṇini, in addition to a number of book reviews. Bloomfield made extensive use of Indo-European materials to explain historical and comparative principles in both of his textbooks, &quot;An introduction to language&quot; (1914), and his seminal &quot;Language&quot; (1933). In his textbooks he selected Indo-European examples that supported the key Neogrammarian hypothesis of the regularity of sound change, and emphasized a sequence of steps essential to success in comparative work: (a) appropriate data in the form of texts which must be studied intensively and analysed; (b) application of the comparative method; (c) reconstruction of proto-forms. He further emphasized the importance of dialect studies where appropriate, and noted the significance of sociological factors such as prestige, and the impact of meaning. In addition to regular linguistic change, Bloomfield also allowed for borrowing and analogy.

It is argued that Bloomfield&#x27;s Indo-European work had two broad implications: &quot;He stated clearly the theoretical bases for Indo-European linguistics&quot; and &quot;he established the study of Indo-European languages firmly within general linguistics.&quot;

===Sanskrit studies===
As part of his training with leading Indo-Europeanists in Germany in 1913 and 1914 Bloomfield studied the Sanskrit grammatical tradition originating with Pāṇini, who lived in northwestern India during the fifth or fourth century BC. Pāṇini&#x27;s grammar is characterized by its extreme thoroughness and explicitness in accounting for Sanskrit linguistic forms, and by its complex context-sensitive, rule-based generative structure. Bloomfield noted that &quot;Pāṇini gives the formation of every inflected, compounded, or derived word, with an exact statement of the sound-variations (including accent) and of the meaning&quot;. In a letter to Algonquianist Truman Michelson, Bloomfield noted &quot;My models are Pāṇini and the kind of work done in Indo-European by my teacher, Professor Wackernagel of Basle.&quot;

Pāṇini&#x27;s systematic approach to analysis includes components for: (a) forming grammatical rules, (b) an inventory of sounds, (c) a list of verbal roots organized into sublists, and (d) a list of classes of morphs. Bloomfield&#x27;s approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook &quot;Language&quot; reflect the influence of Pāṇini in his treatment of basic concepts such as &quot;linguistic form&quot;, &quot;free form&quot;, and others. Similarly, Pāṇini is the source for Bloomfield&#x27;s use of the terms &quot;exocentric&quot; and &quot;endocentric&quot; used to describe compound words. Concepts from Pāṇini are found in &quot;Eastern Ojibwa&quot;, published posthumously in 1958, in particular his use of the concept of a morphological zero, a morpheme that has no overt realization. Pāṇini&#x27;s influence is also present in Bloomfield&#x27;s approach to determining parts of speech (Bloomfield uses the term &quot;form-classes&quot;) in both &quot;Eastern Ojibwa&quot; and in the later &quot;Menomini language&quot;, published posthumously in 1962.

==Austronesian linguistics==
While at the University of Illinois Bloomfield undertook research on Tagalog, an Austronesian language spoken in the Philippines. He carried out linguistic field work with Alfredo Viola Santiago, who was an engineering student at the university from 1914 to 1917. The results were published as &quot;Tagalog texts with grammatical analysis&quot;, which includes a series of texts dictated by Santiago in addition to an extensive grammatical description and analysis of every word in the texts. Bloomfield&#x27;s work on Tagalog, from the beginning of field research to publication, took no more than two years. His study of Tagalog has been described as &quot;the best treatment of any Austronesian language ... The result is a description of Tagalog which has never been surpassed for completeness, accuracy, and wealth of exemplification.&quot;

Bloomfield&#x27;s only other publication on an Austronesian language was an article on the syntax of Ilocano, based upon research undertaken with a native speaker of Ilocano who was a student at Yale University. This article has been described as a &quot;tour de force, for it covers in less than seven pages the entire taxonomic syntax of Ilocano&quot;.

==Algonquian linguistics==
Bloomfield&#x27;s work on Algonquian languages had both descriptive and comparative components. He published extensively on four Algonquian languages: Fox, Cree, Menominee, and Ojibwe, publishing grammars, lexicons, and text collections. Bloomfield used the materials collected in his descriptive work to undertake comparative studies leading to the reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian, with an early study reconstructing the sound system of Proto-Algonquian, and a subsequent more extensive paper refining his phonological analysis and adding extensive historical information on general features of Algonquian grammar.

Bloomfield undertook field research on Cree, Menominee, and Ojibwe, and analysed the material in previously published Fox text collections. His first Algonquian research, beginning around 1919, involved study of text collections in the Fox language that had been published by William Jones and Truman Michelson. Working through the texts in these collections, Bloomfield excerpted grammatical information to create a grammatical sketch of Fox. A lexicon of Fox based on his excerpted material was published posthumously.

Bloomfield undertook field research on Menominee in the summers of 1920 and 1921, with further brief field research in September 1939 and intermittent visits from Menominee speakers in Chicago in the late 1930s, in addition to correspondence with speakers during the same period. Material collected by Morris Swadesh in 1937 and 1938, often in response to specific queries from Bloomfield, supplemented his information. Significant publications include a collection of texts, a grammar and a lexicon (both published posthumously), in addition to a theoretically significant article on Menomini phonological alternations.

Bloomfield undertook field research in 1925 among Plains Cree speakers in Saskatchewan at the Sweet Grass reserve, and also at the Star Blanket reserve, resulting in two volumes of texts and a posthumous lexicon. He also undertook brief field work on Swampy Cree at The Pas, Manitoba. Bloomfield&#x27;s work on Swampy Cree provided data to support the predictive power of the hypothesis of exceptionless phonological change.

Bloomfield&#x27;s initial research on Ojibwe was through study of texts collected by William Jones, in addition to nineteenth century grammars and dictionaries. During the 1938 Linguistic Society of America Linguistic Institute held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he taught a field methods class with Andrew Medler, a speaker of the Ottawa dialect who was born in Saginaw, Michigan, but spent most of his life on Walpole Island, Ontario. The resulting grammatical description, transcribed sentences, texts, and lexicon were published posthumously in a single volume. In 1941 Bloomfield worked with Ottawa dialect speaker Angeline Williams at the 1941 Linguistic Institute held at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, resulting in a posthumously published volume of texts.

<doc id="18062" wikidata="Q286" url="?curid=18062" title="Leather">
<text>Leather is a strong, flexible and durable material obtained from the tanning, or chemical treatment, of animal skins and hides to prevent decay. The most common leathers come from cattle, sheep, goats, equine animals, buffalo, pigs and hogs, ostriches, and aquatic animals such as seals and alligators.

Leather can be used to make a variety of items, including clothing, footwear, handbags, furniture, tools and sports equipment, and lasts for decades. Leather making has been practiced for more than 7,000 years and the leading producers of leather today are China and India.

Critics of tanneries claim that they engage in unsustainable practices that pose health hazards to the people and the environment near them.

==Production processes==


The leather manufacturing process is divided into three fundamental subprocesses: preparatory stages, tanning, and crusting. A further subprocess, finishing, can be added into the leather process sequence, but not all leathers receive finishing.

The preparatory stages are when the hide is prepared for tanning. Preparatory stages may include soaking, hair removal, liming, deliming, bating, bleaching, and pickling.

Tanning is a process that stabilizes the proteins, particularly collagen, of the raw hide to increase the thermal, chemical and microbiological stability of the hides and skins, making it suitable for a wide variety of end applications. The principal difference between raw and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to form a hard, inflexible material that, when rewetted, will putrefy, while tanned material dries to a flexible form that does not become putrid when rewetted.

Many tanning methods and materials exist. The typical process sees tanners load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a tank that contains the tanning &quot;liquor&quot;. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the liquor&#x27;s pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather. The more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather&#x27;s hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance.

Crusting is a process that thins and lubricates leather. It often includes a coloring operation. Chemicals added during crusting must be fixed in place. Crusting culminates with a drying and softening operation, and may include splitting, shaving, dyeing, whitening or other methods.

For some leathers, tanners apply a surface coating, called &quot;finishing&quot;. Finishing operations can include oiling, brushing, buffing, coating, polishing, embossing, glazing, or tumbling, among others.

Leather can be oiled to improve its water resistance. This currying process after tanning supplements the natural oils remaining in the leather itself, which can be washed out through repeated exposure to water. Frequent oiling of leather, with mink oil, neatsfoot oil, or a similar material keeps it supple and improves its lifespan dramatically.

===Tanning methods===

Tanning processes largely differ in which chemicals are used in the tanning liquor. Some common types include:
* is tanned using tannins extracted from vegetable matter, such as tree bark prepared in bark mills. It is the oldest known method. It is supple and light brown in color, with the exact shade depending on the mix of materials and the color of the skin. The color tan derives its name from the appearance of undyed vegetable-tanned leather. Vegetable-tanned leather is not stable in water; it tends to discolor, and if left to soak and then dry, it shrinks and becomes harder, a feature of vegetable-tanned leather that is exploited in traditional shoemaking. In hot water, it shrinks drastically and partly congeals, becoming rigid and eventually brittle. Boiled leather is an example of this, where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in boiling water, or in wax or similar substances. Historically, it was occasionally used as armor after hardening, and it has also been used for book binding. 
* Chrome-tanned leather is tanned using chromium sulfate and other chromium salts. It is also known as &quot;wet blue&quot; for the pale blue color of the undyed leather. The chrome tanning method usually takes approximately one day to complete, making it best suited for large-scale industrial use. This is the most common method in modern use. It is more supple and pliable than vegetable-tanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetable-tanned. However, there are environmental concerns with this tanning method, as chromium is a heavy metal; while the trivalent chromium used for tanning is harmless, other byproducts can contain toxic variants. The method was developed in the latter half of the 19th century as tanneries wanted to find ways to speed up the process and to make leather more waterproof.
* Aldehyde-tanned leather is tanned using glutaraldehyde or oxazolidine compounds. It is referred to as &quot;wet white&quot; due to its pale cream color. It is the main type of &quot;chrome-free&quot; leather, often seen in shoes for infants and automobiles. Formaldehyde has been used for tanning in the past; it is being phased out due to danger to workers and sensitivity of many people to formaldehyde. Chamois leather is a form of aldehyde-tanned leather that is porous and highly water-absorbent. Chamois leather is made using oil (traditionally cod oil) that oxidizes to produce the aldehydes that tan the leather.
* Brain tanned leathers are made by a labor-intensive process that uses emulsified oils, often those of animal brains such as deer, cattle, and buffalo. An example of this kind is buckskin. Leather products made in this manner are known for their exceptional softness and washability.
* Alum leather is transformed using aluminium salts mixed with a variety of binders and protein sources, such as flour and egg yolk. Alum leather is not actually tanned; rather the process is called &quot;tawing&quot;, and the resulting material reverts to rawhide if soaked in water long enough to remove the alum salts.

==Grades==
In general, leather is produced in the following grades:
* Top-grain leather includes the outer layer of the hide, known as the grain, which features finer, more densely packed fibers, resulting in strength and durability. Depending on thickness, it may also contain some of the more fibrous under layer, known as the corium. Types of top-grain leather include:
**Full-grain leather contains the entire grain layer, without any removal of the surface. Rather than wearing out, it develops a patina during its useful lifetime. It is usually considered the highest quality leather. Furniture and footwear are often made from full-grain leather. Full-grain leather is typically finished with a soluble aniline dye. Russia leather is a form of full-grain leather.
** Corrected grain leather has the surface subjected to finishing treatments to create a more uniform appearance. This usually involves buffing or sanding away flaws in the grain, then dyeing and embossing the surface.
** Nubuck is top-grain leather that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight nap of short protein fibers, producing a velvet-like surface.
* Split leather is created from the corium left once the top-grain has been separated from the hide, known as the drop split. In thicker hides, the drop split can be further split into a middle split and a flesh split.
**Bicast leather is split leather that is coated with a layer of polyurethane or vinyl with an embossed texture. This gives it the appearance of a grain. It is slightly stiffer than top-grain leather but has a more consistent texture. 
** Patent leather is leather that has been given a high-gloss finish by the addition of a coating. Dating to the late 1700s, it became widely popular after inventor Seth Boyden developed the first mass-production process, using a linseed-oil-based lacquer, in 1818. Modern versions are usually a form of bicast leather.
**Suede is made from the underside of a split to create a soft, napped finish. It is often made from younger or smaller animals, as the skins of adults often result in a coarse, shaggy nap.
* Bonded leather, also called &quot;reconstituted leather&quot;, is a material that uses leather scraps that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or latex onto a fiber mesh. The amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from 10% to 90%, affecting the properties of the product.

The term &quot;genuine leather&quot; does not describe a specific grade. The term often indicates split leather that has been extensively processed, and some sources describe it as synonymous with bicast leather, or made from multiple splits glued together and coated. In some countries, when it is the description on a product label the term means nothing more than &quot;contains leather&quot;; depending on jurisdiction, regulations limit the term&#x27;s use in product labelling.

==Animals used==
Today, most leather is made of cattle (cow) hides, which constitute about 65% of all leather produced. Other animals that are used include sheep (about 13%), goats (about 11%), and pigs (about 10%). Obtaining accurate figures from around the world is difficult, especially for areas where the skin may be eaten. There are significant regional differences in leather production: e.g. goat leather was historically called &quot;Turkey&quot; or &quot;Morocco&quot; due to its association with the Middle East, while pig skin had historically been used the most in Germany. Other animals mentioned below only constitute a fraction of a percent of total leather production.

Horse hides are used to make particularly durable leathers. Shell cordovan is a horse leather made not from the outer skin but from an under layer, found only in equine species, called the shell. It is prized for its mirror-like finish and anti-creasing properties.

Lamb and deerskin are used for soft leather in more expensive apparel. Deerskin is widely used in work gloves and indoor shoes.

Reptilian skins, such as alligator, crocodile, and snake, are noted for their distinct patterns that reflect the scales of their species. This has led to hunting and farming of these species in part for their skins. The Argentine black and white tegu is one of the most exploited reptile species in the world in the leather trade. However, it is not endangered and while monitored, trade is legal in most South American countries.

Kangaroo leather is used to make items that must be strong and flexible. It is the material most commonly used in bullwhips. Some motorcyclists favor kangaroo leather for motorcycle leathers because of its light weight and abrasion resistance. Kangaroo leather is also used for falconry jesses, soccer footwear, (e.g. Adidas Copa Mundial) and boxing speed bags.

Although originally raised for their feathers in the 19th century, ostriches are now more popular for both meat and leather. Ostrich leather has a characteristic &quot;goose bump&quot; look because of the large follicles where the feathers grew. Different processes produce different finishes for many applications, including upholstery, footwear, automotive products, accessories, and clothing.

In Thailand, stingray leather is used in wallets and belts. Stingray leather is tough and durable. The leather is often dyed black and covered with tiny round bumps in the natural pattern of the back ridge of an animal. These bumps are then usually dyed white to highlight the decoration. Stingray rawhide is also used as grips on Chinese swords, Scottish basket hilted swords, and Japanese katanas. Stingray leather is also used for high abrasion areas in motorcycle racing leathers (especially in gloves, where its high abrasion resistance helps prevent wear through in the event of an accident).

For a given thickness, fish leather is typically much stronger due to its criss-crossed fibers.

==Environmental impact==

Leather produces some environmental impact, most notably due to:
* The carbon footprint of cattle rearing (see environmental impact of meat production)
* Use of chemicals in the tanning process (e.g., chromium, phthalate esters, nonyl phenol ethoxylate soaps, pentachlorophenol and solvents)
* Air pollution due to the transformation process (hydrogen sulfide is formed during mixing with acids and ammonia liberated during deliming, solvent vapors)

===Carbon footprint===

Estimates of the carbon footprint of bovine leather range from 65 to 150 kg of CO2 equivalent per square meter of production.

===Water footprint===

One ton of hide or skin generally produces 20 to 80 m3 of waste water, including chromium levels of 100–400 mg/L, sulfide levels of
200–800 mg/L, high levels of fat and other solid wastes, and notable pathogen contamination. Producers often add pesticides to protect hides during transport. With solid wastes representing up to 70% of the wet weight of the original hides, the tanning process represents a considerable strain on water treatment installations.

===Disposal===

Leather biodegrades slowly—taking 25 to 40 years to decompose. However, vinyl and petrochemical-derived materials take 500 or more years to decompose.

===Chemical waste disposal===

Tanning is especially polluting in countries where environmental regulations are lax, such as in India, the world&#x27;s third-largest producer and exporter of leather. To give an example of an efficient pollution prevention system, chromium loads per produced tonne are generally abated from 8 kg to 1.5 kg. VOC emissions are typically reduced from 30 kg/t to 2 kg/t in a properly managed facility. A review of the total pollution load decrease achievable according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization posts precise data on the abatement achievable through industrially proven low-waste advanced methods, while noting, &quot;even though the chrome pollution load can be decreased by 94% on introducing advanced technologies, the minimum residual load 0.15 kg/t raw hide can still cause difficulties when using landfills and composting sludge from wastewater treatment on account of the regulations currently in force in some countries.&quot;

In Kanpur, the self-proclaimed &quot;Leather City of World&quot;—with 10,000 tanneries as of 2011 and a city of three million on the banks of the Ganges—pollution levels were so high, that despite an industry crisis, the pollution control board decided to shut down 49 high-polluting tanneries out of 404 in July 2009. In 2003 for instance, the main tanneries&#x27; effluent disposal unit was dumping 22 tonnes of chromium-laden solid waste per day in the open.

In the Hazaribagh neighborhood of Dhaka in Bangladesh, chemicals from tanneries end up in Dhaka&#x27;s main river. Besides the environmental damage, the health of both local factory workers and the end consumer is also negatively affected. After approximately 15 years of ignoring high court rulings, the government shut down more than 100 tanneries the weekend of 8 April 2017 in the neighborhood.

The higher cost associated with the treatment of effluents than to untreated effluent discharging leads to illegal dumping to save on costs. For instance, in Croatia in 2001, proper pollution abatement cost US$70–100 per ton of raw hides processed against $43/t for irresponsible behavior. In November 2009, one of Uganda&#x27;s main leather making companies was caught directly dumping waste water into a wetland adjacent to Lake Victoria.

==Role of enzymes==

Enzymes like proteases, lipases, and amylases have an important role in the soaking, dehairing, degreasing, and bating operations of leather manufacturing. Proteases are the most commonly used enzymes in leather production. The enzyme must not damage or dissolve collagen or keratin, but should hydrolyze casein, elastin, albumin, globulin-like proteins, and nonstructural proteins that are not essential for leather making. This process is called bating.

Lipases are used in the degreasing operation to hydrolyze fat particles embedded in the skin.

Amylases are used to soften skin, to bring out the grain, and to impart strength and flexibility to the skin. These enzymes are rarely used.

==Preservation and conditioning==
The natural fibers of leather break down with the passage of time. Acidic leathers are particularly vulnerable to red rot, which causes powdering of the surface and a change in consistency. Damage from red rot is aggravated by high temperatures and relative humidities. Although it is chemically irreversible, treatments can add handling strength and prevent disintegration of red rotted leather.

Exposure to long periods of low relative humidities (below 40%) can cause leather to become desiccated, irreversibly changing the fibrous structure of the leather. Chemical damage can also occur from exposure to environmental factors, including ultraviolet light, ozone, acid from sulfurous and nitrous pollutants in the air, or through a chemical action following any treatment with tallow or oil compounds. Both oxidation and chemical damage occur faster at higher temperatures.

There are few methods to maintain and clean leather goods properly such as using damp cloth and avoid using a wet cloth or soaking the leather in water. Various treatments are available such as conditioners. Saddle soap is used for cleaning, conditioning, and softening leather. Leather shoes are widely conditioned with shoe polish.

==In modern culture==

Due to its high resistance to abrasion and wind, leather found a use in rugged occupations. The enduring image of a cowboy in leather chaps gave way to the leather-jacketed and leather-helmeted aviator. When motorcycles were invented, some riders took to wearing heavy leather jackets to protect from road rash and wind blast; some also wear chaps or full leather pants to protect the lower body.

Leather&#x27;s flexibility allows it to be formed and shaped into balls and protective gear. Subsequently, many sports use equipment made with leather, such as baseball gloves and the ball used in cricket and gridiron football.

Leather fetishism is the name popularly used to describe a fetishistic attraction to people wearing leather, or in certain cases, to the garments themselves.

Many rock groups (particularly heavy metal and punk groups in the 1970s and 80s) are well known for wearing leather clothing. Extreme metal bands (especially black metal bands) and Goth rock groups have extensive black leather clothing. Leather has become less common in the punk community over the last three decades, as there is opposition to the use of leather from punks who support animal rights.

Many cars and trucks come with optional or standard leather or &quot;leather faced&quot; seating.

==Religious sensitivities==
In countries with significant populations of individuals observing religions which place restrictions on material choices, vendors typically clarify the source of leather in their products. Such labeling helps facilitate religious observance, so, for example, a Muslim will not accidentally purchase pigskin or a Hindu can avoid cattleskin. Such taboos increase the demand for religiously neutral leathers such as ostrich and deer.

Judaism forbids the comfort of wearing leather shoes on Yom Kippur, Tisha B&#x27;Av, and during mourning. Also, see Leather in Judaism, Teffilin and Torah Scroll.

Jainism prohibits the use of leather, since it is obtained by killing animals.

==Alternatives==
Many forms of artificial leather have been developed, usually involving polyurethane or vinyl coatings applied to a cloth backing. Many names and brands for such artificial leathers exist, including &quot;pleather&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;plastic leather&quot;, and the brand name Naugahyde.

Another alternative is cultured leather which is lab-grown using cell-culture methods, mushroom-based materials and gelatin-based textile made by upcycling meat industry waste. Leather made of fungi or mushroom-based materials are completely biodegradable.

<doc id="18065" wikidata="Q535158" url="?curid=18065" title="Long Parliament">
<text>The Long Parliament was an English Parliament which lasted from 1640 until 1660. It followed the fiasco of the Short Parliament, which had convened for only three weeks during the spring of 1640 after an 11-year parliamentary absence. In September 1640, King Charles I issued writs summoning a parliament to convene on 3 November 1640. He intended it to pass financial bills, a step made necessary by the costs of the Bishops&#x27; Wars against Scotland. The Long Parliament received its name from the fact that, by Act of Parliament, it stipulated it could be dissolved only with agreement of the members; and those members did not agree to its dissolution until 16 March 1660, after the English Civil War and near the close of the Interregnum.

The parliament sat from 1640 until 1648, when it was purged by the New Model Army. After this point, the remaining members of the House of Commons became known as the Rump Parliament; Oliver Cromwell disbanded the Rump in April 1653, replacing it with a succession of nominated and elected parliaments.

In the chaos following the death of Cromwell in September 1658, the Rump was reinstalled in May 1659, and in February 1660 General George Monck allowed the members barred in 1648 to retake their seats, so that they could pass the necessary legislation to allow the Stuart Restoration and dissolve the Long Parliament. This cleared the way for a new parliament to be elected, which was known as the Convention Parliament. Some key members of the Long Parliament, such as Sir Henry Vane the Younger and General Edmond Ludlow, were barred from the final acts of the Long Parliament. They claimed the parliament was not legally dissolved, its final votes a procedural irregularity (the words used contemporaneously were &quot;device&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot;) by Monck to ensure the restoration of King Charles II of England. On the restoration Monck was rewarded with a dukedom.

The Long Parliament later became a key moment in Whig histories of the seventeenth century. American Whig historian Charles Wentworth Upham believed the Long Parliament comprised &quot;a set of the greatest geniuses for government that the world ever saw embarked together in one common cause&quot; and whose actions produced an effect which, at the time, made their country the wonder and admiration of the world, and is still felt and exhibited far beyond the borders of that country, in the progress of reform, and the advancement of popular liberty. He believed its republican principles made it a precursor to the American Revolutionary War.

==Execution of Strafford==

Charles found himself unable to fund the Bishops&#x27; Wars without taxes; in April 1640, Parliament was recalled for the first time in eleven years, but when it refused to vote taxes without concessions, he dissolved it after only three weeks. The humiliating terms imposed by the Scots Covenanters after a second defeat forced him to hold fresh elections in November, which produced a large majority for the opposition, led by John Pym.

Parliament was almost immediately presented with a series of &quot;Root and Branch petitions&quot;. These demanded the expulsion of bishops from the Church of England, reflecting widespread concern at the growth of &quot;Catholic practices&quot; within the church. Charles&#x27; willingness to make war on the Protestant Scots, but not to assist his exiled nephew Charles Louis, led to fears he was about to sign an alliance with Spain, a view shared by the experienced Venetian and French ambassadors.

This meant ending arbitrary rule was important not just for England, but the Protestant cause in general. Since direct attacks on the monarch were considered unacceptable, the usual route was to prosecute his &quot;evil counsellors&quot;. Doing so showed even if the king was above the law, his subordinates were not, and he could not protect them; the intention was to make others think twice about their actions. Further, they started to create a series of committees and sub-committees starting with the Grand Committee for Religion appointed on 6 November 1640.

Their main target was the Earl of Strafford, former Lord Deputy of Ireland; aware of this, he urged Charles to use military force to seize the Tower of London, and arrest any MP or peer guilty of &quot;treasonable correspondence with the Scots&quot;. While Charles hesitated, Pym struck first; on 11 November Strafford was impeached, arrested, and sent to the Tower. Other targets, including John Finch, fled abroad; Archbishop William Laud—by then sufficiently unpopular that in May 1640 a large armed mob attacked Lambeth Palace, seeking to kill him—was impeached in December, joining Strafford in the Tower.

At his trial in March 1641, Strafford was indicted on 28 counts of &quot;arbitrary and tyrannical government&quot;. Even if these charges were proved, it was not clear they constituted a crime against the king, the legal definition of treason. If he went free, his opponents would replace him in the Tower, and so Pym immediately moved a bill of attainder, asserting Strafford&#x27;s guilt and ordering his execution.

Although Charles announced he would not sign the attainder, on 21 April 204 MPs voted in favour, 59 against, while 250 abstained. On 1 May, rumours of a military plot to release Strafford from the Tower led to widespread demonstrations in London, and on 7th, the Lords voted for execution by 51 to 9. Claiming to fear for his family&#x27;s safety, Charles signed the death warrant on 10 May, and Strafford was beheaded two days later.

==Committees established by the Long Parliament==
On 5 November 1640 parliament created several committees to parcel out the work they intended to address. The first committee was the Committee for Privileges and Elections under the leadership of John Maynard, MP for Totnes. On the next day, 6 November, parliament established the Grand Committee for Religion.

==The Grand Remonstrance==

This seemed to provide a basis for a programme of constitutional reforms, and Parliament voted Charles an immediate grant of £400,000. The Triennial Acts required Parliament meet at least every three years, and if the King failed to issue proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. Levying taxes without consent of Parliament was declared unlawful, including Ship money and forced loans, while the Star Chamber and High Commission courts abolished.

These reforms were supported by many who later became Royalists, including Edward Hyde, Viscount Falkland, and Sir John Strangways. Where they differed from Pym and his supporters was their refusal to accept Charles would not keep his commitments, despite evidence to the contrary. He reneged on those made in the 1628 Petition of Right, and agreed terms with the Scots in 1639, while preparing another attack. Both he and Henrietta Maria openly told foreign ambassadors any concessions were temporary, and would be retrieved by force if needed.

In this period, &#x27;true religion&#x27; and &#x27;good government&#x27; were seen as one and the same. Although the vast majority believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was a divinely mandated requirement, they disagreed on what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; most Parliamentarians were Puritans, who believed he was answerable to the leaders of the church, appointed by their congregations.

However, Puritan meant anyone who wanted to reform, or &#x27;purify&#x27;, the Church of England, and contained many different opinions. Some simply objected to Laud&#x27;s reforms; Presbyterians like Pym wanted to reform the Church of England, along the same lines as the Church of Scotland. Independents believed any state church was wrong, while many were also political radicals like the Levellers. Presbyterians in England and Scotland gradually came to see them as more dangerous than the Royalists; an alliance between these three groups eventually led to the Second English Civil War in 1648.

While it is not clear there was a majority for removing bishops from the Church, their presence in the House of Lords became increasingly resented due to their role in blocking many of these reforms. Tensions came to a head in October 1641 with the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion; both Charles and Parliament supported raising troops to suppress it, but neither trusted the other with their control.

On 22 November, the Commons passed the Grand Remonstrance by 159 votes to 148, and presented it to Charles on 1 December. The first half listed over 150 perceived &#x27;misdeeds&#x27;, the second proposed solutions, including church reform and Parliamentary control over the appointment of royal ministers. In the Militia Ordinance, Parliament asserted control over appointment of army and navy commanders; Charles rejected the Grand Remonstrance and refused to assent to the Militia Ordinance. It was at this point moderates like Hyde decided Pym and his supporters had gone too far, and switched sides.

==First English Civil War==

Increasing unrest in London culminated in 23 to 29 December 1641 with widespread riots in Westminster, while the hostility of the crowd meant the bishops stopped attending the Lords. On 30 December, Charles induced John Williams, Archbishop of York and eleven other bishops, to sign a complaint, disputing the legality of any laws passed by the Lords during their exclusion. This was viewed by the Commons as inviting the king to dissolve Parliament; all twelve were arrested.

On 3 January 1642, Charles ordered his Attorney-general to bring charges of treason against Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, and Five Members of the Commons; Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, Arthur Haselrig, and William Strode. This confirmed fears he intended to use force to shut down Parliament. The members were pre-warned, and evaded arrest.

Soon after, Charles left London, accompanied by many Royalist MPs, and members of the Lords, a major tactical mistake. By doing so, he abandoned the largest arsenal in England and the commercial power of the City of London and guaranteed his opponents majorities in both houses. In February, Parliament passed the Clergy Act, excluding bishops from the Lords; Charles approved it, since he had already decided to retrieve all such concessions by assembling an army.

In March 1642, Parliament decreed its own Parliamentary Ordinances were valid laws, even without royal assent. The Militia Ordinance gave them control of the local militia, or Trained Bands; those in London were the most strategically critical, because they could protect Parliament from armed intervention by any soldiers which Charles had near the capital. Charles declared Parliament in rebellion and began raising an army, by issuing a competing Commission of Array.

At the end of 1642, he set up his court at Oxford, where the Royalist MPs formed the Oxford Parliament. In 1645 Parliament reaffirmed its determination to fight the war to a finish. It passed the Self-denying Ordinance, by which all members of either House of Parliament resigned any military commands, and formed the New Model Army under the command of Fairfax and Cromwell. The New Model Army soon destroyed Charles&#x27; armies, and by early 1646, he was on the verge of defeat.

Charles left Oxford in disguise on 27 April; on 6 May, Parliament received a letter from David Leslie, commander of Scottish forces besieging Newark, announcing that he had the king in custody. Charles ordered the Royalist governor, Lord Belasyse, to surrender Newark, and the Scots withdrew to Newcastle, taking the king with them. This marked the end of the First English Civil War.

==Second English Civil War==
Many Parliamentarians had assumed military defeat would force Charles to compromise, which proved a fundamental misunderstanding of his character. When Prince Rupert suggested in August 1645 the war was lost, Charles responded he was correct from a military viewpoint, but &#x27;God will not suffer rebels and traitors to prosper&#x27;. This deeply-held conviction meant he refused any substantial concessions. Aware of divisions among his opponents, he used his position as king of both Scotland and England to deepen them, assuming that he was essential to any government; while this was true in 1646, by 1648 key actors believed it was pointless to negotiate with someone who could not be trusted to keep any agreement.

Unlike in England, where Presbyterians were a minority, the Bishops&#x27; Wars resulted in a Covenanter, or Presbyterian government, and Presbyterian kirk, or Church of Scotland. The Scots wanted to preserve these achievements; the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant was driven by their concern at the implications for this settlement if Charles defeated Parliament. By 1646, they viewed Charles as a lesser threat than the Independents, who opposed their demand for a unified, Presbyterian church of England and Scotland; Cromwell claimed he would fight rather than agree to it.

In July, the Scots and English commissioners presented Charles with the Newcastle Propositions, which he rejected. His refusal to negotiate created a dilemma for the Covenanters. Even if Charles agreed to a Presbyterian union, there was no guarantee it would be approved by Parliament. Keeping him was too dangerous; as subsequent events proved, whether Royalist or Covenanter, many Scots supported his retention. In February 1647, they agreed to a financial settlement, handed Charles over to Parliament, and retreated into Scotland. 

In England, Parliament was struggling with the economic cost of the war, a poor 1646 harvest, and a recurrence of the plague. The Presbyterian faction had the support of the London Trained Bands, the Army of the Western Association, leaders like Rowland Laugharne in Wales, and parts of the Royal Navy. By March 1647, the New Model was owed more than £3 million in unpaid wages; Parliament ordered it to Ireland, stating that only those who agreed would be paid. When their representatives demanded full payment for all in advance, it was disbanded.

The New Model refused to be disbanded; in early June, Charles was removed from his Parliamentary guards, and taken to Thriplow, where he was presented with the Army Council&#x27;s terms. Though they were more lenient than the Newcastle Propositions, Charles rejected them; on 26 July, pro-Presbyterian rioters burst into Parliament, demanding he be invited to London. In early August, Fairfax and the New Model Army took control of the city, while on 20 August Cromwell went to Parliament with a military escort, and forced the passing of the Null and Void Ordinance annulling all Parliamentary proceedings since 26 July, leading to the withdrawal of most of the Presbyterian MPs and presaging Pride&#x27;s Purge the following year. The Putney Debates attempted to address radicals&#x27; objectives, but the return of royalist threats in November led to Fairfax demanding a declaration of loyalty; this re-established command authority over the rank and file, completed at Corkbush.

In late November, the king escaped from his guards, and made his way to Carisbrooke Castle. In April 1648, the Engagers became a majority in the Scottish Parliament; in return for restoring him to the English throne, Charles agreed to impose Presbyterianism in England for three years, and suppress the Independents. His refusal to take the Covenant himself split the Scots; the Kirk Party did not trust Charles, objected to an alliance with English and Scots Royalists, and denounced the Engagement as &#x27;sinful.&#x27;

After two years of constant negotiation, and refusal to compromise, Charles finally had the pieces in place for a rising by Royalists, supported by some English Presbyterians, and Scots Covenanters. However, lack of co-ordination meant the Second English Civil War was quickly suppressed.

==Rump Parliament (6 December 1648 – 20 April 1653)==
Divisions emerged between various factions, culminating in Pride&#x27;s Purge on 7 December 1648, when, under the orders of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s son-in-law Henry Ireton, Colonel Pride physically barred and arrested 41 of the members of Parliament. Many of the excluded members were Presbyterians. Henry Vane the Younger removed himself from Parliament in protest of this unlawful action by Ireton. He was not party to the execution of Charles I, although Cromwell was. In the wake of the ejections, the remnant, the &quot;Rump Parliament&quot;, arranged for the trial and execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649. It was also responsible for the setting up of the Commonwealth of England in 1649.

Henry Vane the Younger was persuaded to rejoin Parliament on 17 February 1649 and a Council of state was installed, into whose hands the executive government of the nation was committed. Sir Henry Vane was appointed a member of the Council. Cromwell used great pains to induce Vane to accept the appointment, and after many consultations, he so far prevailed in satisfying Vane of the purity of his principles in reference to the Commonwealth, as to overcome his reluctance again to enter the public service. Sir Henry Vane was for some time President of the Council, and, as Treasurer and Commissioner for the Navy, he had almost the exclusive direction of that branch of public service.

Cromwell &quot;well knew that while the Long Parliament, that noble company, who had fought the great battle of liberty from the beginning, remained in session, and such men as Vane were enabled to mingle in its deliberations, it would be utterly useless for him to think of executing his purposes&quot; (to set up a Protectorate or Dictatorship). Henry Vane was working on a Reform Bill. Cromwell knew &quot;that if the Reform Bill should be suffered to pass, and a House of Commons be convened, freely elected on popular principles, and constituting a full and fair and equal representation, it would be impossible ever after to overthrow the liberties of the people, or break down the government of the country&quot;. According to General Edmund Ludlow (an unapologetic supporter of the Good Old Cause who lived in exile after the Restoration), this reform bill provided for an equal representation of the people, disfranchised several boroughs which had ceased to have a population in proportion to representation, fixed the number of the House at four hundred&quot;. It would have &quot;secured to England and to the rest of the world the blessings of republican institutions, two centuries earlier than can now be expected&quot;.

&quot;Harrison, who was in Cromwell&#x27;s confidence on this occasion, rose to debate the motion, merely in order to gain time. Word was carried to Cromwell, that the House were on the point of putting the final motion; and Colonel Ingoldby hastened to Whitehall to tell him, that, if he intended to do anything decisive, he had no time to lose&quot;. Once the troops were in place Cromwell entered the assembly. He was dressed in a suit of plain black; with grey worsted stockings. He took his seat; and appeared to be listening to the debate. As the Speaker was about to rise to put the question, Cromwell whispered to Harrison, &quot;Now is the time; I must do it&quot;. As he rose, his countenance became flushed and blacked by the terrific passions which the crisis awakened. With the most reckless violence of manner and language, he abused the character of the House; and, after the first burst of his denunciations had passed, suddenly changing his tone, he exclaimed, &quot;You think, perhaps, this is not parliamentary language; I know it; nor are you to expect such from me&quot;. He then advanced out into the middle of the hall, and walked to and fro, like a man beside himself. In a few moments he stamped upon the floor, the doors flew open and a file of musketeers entered. As they advanced, Cromwell exclaimed, looking over the House, &quot;You are no Parliament; I say you are no Parliament; begone, and give place to honester men&quot;.

&quot;While this extraordinary scene was transacting, the members, hardly believing their own ears and eyes, sat in mute amazement, horror, and pity of the maniac traitor who was storming and raving before them. At length Vane rose to remonstrate, and call him to his senses; but Cromwell, instead of listening to him, drowned his voice, repeating with great vehemence, and as though with the desperate excitement of the moment, &quot;Sir Harry Vane! Sir Harry Vane! Good Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!&quot; He then seized the records, snatched the bill from the hands of the clerk, drove the members out at the point of the bayonet, locked the doors, put the key in his pocket, and returned to Whitehall.

Oliver Cromwell forcibly disbanded the Rump in 1653 when it seemed to be planning to perpetuate itself rather than call new elections as had been agreed. It was followed by Barebone&#x27;s Parliament and then the First, Second and Third Protectorate Parliaments.

==Recall of the Rump (7 May 1659 – 20 February 1660)==
After Richard Cromwell, who had succeeded his father Oliver as Lord Protector in 1658, was effectively deposed by an officers&#x27; coup in April 1659, the officers re-summoned the Rump Parliament to sit. It convened on 7 May 1659, but after five months in power it again clashed with the army (led by John Lambert) and was again forcibly dissolved on 13 October 1659. Once again, Sir Henry Vane was the leading catalyst for the republican cause in opposition to force by the military.

The persons connected with the administration as it existed at the death of Oliver were, of course, interested in keeping things as they were. Also, it was necessary for someone to assume the reins of government until the public will could be ascertained and brought into exercise. Henry Vane was elected to Parliament at Kingston upon Hull, but the certificate was given to another. Vane proceeded to Bristol, entered the canvass, and received the majority. Again the certificate was given to another. Finally Vane proceeded to Whitechurch in Hampshire and was elected a third time and was this time seated in Parliament. Vane managed the debates on behalf of the House of Commons. One of Vane&#x27;s speeches effectively ended Richard Cromwell&#x27;s career:

This speech swept everything before it. The Rump Parliament which Oliver Cromwell had dispersed in 1653 was once more summoned to assemble, by a declaration from the Council of Officers dated on 6 May 1659.

Edmond Ludlow made several attempts to reconcile the army and parliament in this time period but was ultimately unsuccessful. Parliament ordered the regiments of Colonel Morley and Colonel Moss to march to Westminster for their security, and sent for the rest of the troops that were about London to draw down to them also with all speed.

In October 1659, Colonel Lambert and various subordinate members of the army, acting in the military interest, resisted Colonel Morley and others who were defending the rump Parliament. Colonel Lambert, Major Grimes, and Colonel Sydenham eventually gained their points, and placed guards both by land and water, to hinder the members of Parliament from approaching the House. Colonel Lambert subsequently acquitted himself to Henry Vane the Younger, Edmond Ludlow and the &quot;Committee on Safety,&quot; an instrument of the Wallingford House party acting under their misdirection.

Nevertheless, Parliament was closed once again by military force until such time that the army and leaders of Parliament could effect a resolution. Rule then passed to an unelected &quot;Committee of Safety&quot;, including Lambert and Vane; pending a resolution or compromise with the Army.

During these disorders, the Council of State still assembled at the usual place, and:
The Council of Officers at first attempted to come to some agreement with the leaders of Parliament. On 15 October 1659, the Council of Officers appointed ten persons to &quot;consider of fit ways and means to carry on the affairs and government of the Commonwealth&quot;. On 26 October 1659 the Council of Officers appointed a new Committee of Safety of twenty-three members.

On 1 November 1659, the Committee of Safety nominated a committee &quot;to consider of and prepare a form of government to be settled over the three nations in the way of a free state and Commonwealth, and afterwards to present it to the Committee of Safety for their further considerations&quot;.

The designs of General Fleetwood of the army and the Wallingford House party were now suspected as being in a possible alliance with Charles II. According to Edmond Ludlow: 

Edmond Ludlow warned both the Army and key members of Parliament that unless a compromise could be made it would &quot;render all the blood and treasure that had been spent in asserting our liberties of no use to us, but also force us under such a yoke of servitude, that neither we nor our posterity should be able to bear&quot;.

Starting on 17 December 1659, Henry Vane representing the Parliament, Major Saloway and Colonel Salmon with powers from the officers of the army to treat with the fleet, and Vice-Admiral Lawson met in negotiating a compromise. The navy was very adverse to any proposal of terms to be made with the Parliament before Parliament&#x27;s readmission, insisting upon the absolute submission of the army to the authority of Parliament. A plan was then put in place declaring a resolution to join with the Generals at Portsmouth, Colonel Monck, and Vice-Admiral Lawson, but it was still unknown to the republican party that Colonel Monck was in league with King Charles II.

Colonel Monck, though a hero to the restoration of King Charles II, was also treacherously disloyal to the Long Parliament, to his oath to the present Parliament, and to the Good Old Cause. Ludlow stated in early January 1660 when in conversation with several key officers of the army:
This statement may be verified by the many executions of key Parliament members and Generals after the restoration of King Charles II. Therefore, the restoration of King Charles II could not be an act of the Long Parliament acting freely under its own authority, but only under the influence of the sword by Colonel Monck, who traded his loyalties for the present Long Parliament, in preference to a reformed Long Parliament and to the restoration of King Charles II.

General George Monck, who had been Cromwell&#x27;s viceroy in Scotland, feared that the military stood to lose power and secretly shifted his loyalty to the Crown. As he began to march south, Lambert, who had ridden out to face him, lost support in London. However, the Navy declared for Parliament, and on 26 December 1659 the Rump was restored to power.

On 9 January 1660, Monck arrived in London and his plans were communicated. Whereupon Henry Vane the Younger was discharged from being a member of the Long Parliament; and Major Saloway was reproved for his role and committed to the Tower during the pleasure of the house. Lieutenant-General Fleetwood, Col. Sydenham, Lord Commissioner Whitlock, Cornelius Holland, and Mr. Strickland were required to clear themselves touching their deportment in that affair. High treason was also declared against Miles Corbet, Cor. John Jones, Col. Thomlinson, and Edmond Ludlow on 19 January 1660. 1,500 other officers were removed from their command and &quot;scarce one of ten of the old officers of the army were continued&quot;. Any known Anabaptists in the army were specifically discharged. So tame had Parliament become, that though it was most visible that Monck&#x27;s letters and Arthur Haslerig&#x27;s instructions were designed for the dissolution of the Long Parliament, they were obeyed by the remainder of the members and all these designs were to be put into execution. Though named by Parliament for treason, Miles Corbet and Edmond Ludlow were for a while were permitted to continue to sit with Parliament, and for a time the charges against these men were dropped.

==Restoration and dissolution of the Long Parliament (21 February – 16 March 1660)==

After his initial show of deference to the Rump, Monck quickly found them unwilling to continue in cooperation with his plan for an election of a new parliament (the Rump Parliament believed Monck was accountable to them and had its own plan for free elections); so on 21 February 1660 he forcibly reinstated the members &#x27;secluded&#x27; by Pride&#x27;s purge in 1648, so that they could prepare legislation for the Convention Parliament. Some of the Rump Parliament were opposed and refused to sit with the Secluded Members.

On 27 February 1660, &quot;the new Council of State being informed of some designs against the usurped power, issued out warrants for apprehending divers officers of the army; and having some jealousy of others that were members of Parliament, they procured an order of their House to authorize them to seize any member who had not sat since the coming in of the Secluded Members, if there should be occasion.

When the house was ready to pass the act for dissolution, Crew who had been as forward as any man in beginning and carrying on the war against the last King, moved, that before they dissolved themselves, they would bear their witness against the horrid murder, as he called it, of the King. According to Ludlow: 

Having called for elections for a new Parliament to meet on 25 April, the Long Parliament was dissolved on 16 March 1660.

Finally, on 22 April 1660, &quot;Major-General Lambert&#x27;s party was dispersed&quot; and General Lambert taken prisoner by Colonel Ingoldsby.

==Aftereffects: royalist and republican theories==
&quot;Hitherto Monk had continued to make solemn protestations of his affection and fidelity to the Commonwealth interest, against a King and House of Lords; but the new militia being settled, and a Convention, calling themselves a Parliament and fit for his purpose, being met at Westminster, he sent to such lords as had sat with the Parliament till 1648, to return to the place where they used to sit, which they did, upon assurance from him, that no others should be permitted to sit with them; which promise he also broke, and let in not only such as had deserted to Oxford, but the late created lords. And Charles Stuart, eldest son of the late King, being informed of these transactions, left the Spanish territories where he then resided, and by the advice of Monk went to Breda, a town belonging to the States of Holland: from when he sent his letters and a declaration to the two House by Sir John Greenvil; whereupon the nominal House of Commons, though called by a Commonwealth writ in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties of England, passed a vote [on about April 25, 1660], &#x27;That the government of the nation should be by a King, Lords and Commons, and that Charles Stuart should be proclaimed King of England&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;The Lord Mayor, Sheriffs and Aldermen of the City, treated their King with a collation under a tent, placed in St. George&#x27;s Fields; and five or six hundred citizens cloathed in coats of black velvet, and (not improperly) wearing chains about their necks, by an order of the Common Council, attended on the triumph of that day; ... and those who had been so often defeated in the field, and had contributed nothing either of bravery or policy to this change, in ordering the souldiery to ride with swords drawn through the city of London to White Hall, the Duke of York and Monk leading the way; and intimating (as was supposed) a resolution to maintain that by force which had been obtained by fraud&quot;.

Initially seven, and later &#x27;twenty persons were put to death for life and estate.&#x27; These included: Chief Justice Coke, who had been Solicitor to the High Court of Justice, Major-General Harrison, Col. John Jones (also a member of the High Court of Justice), Mr. Thomas Scot, Sir. Henry Vane, Sir. Arthur Haslerig, Sir. Henry Mildmay, Mr. Robert Wallop, the Lord Mounson, Sir. James Harrington, Mr. James Challoner, Mr. John Phelps, Mr. John Carew, Mr. Hugh Peters, Mr. Gregory Clement, Colonel Adrian Scroop, Col. Francis Hacker, Col. Daniel Axtel. Among those who appeared the most basely subservient to these &#x27;exorbitancies&#x27; of the Court, &#x27;Mr. William Prynn was singularly remarkable&#x27; and attempted to add to these all who &#x27;abjured the family of the Stuarts&#x27; previously, though this motion failed.

&quot;John Finch who had been accused of high treason twenty years before, by a full Parliament, and who by flying from their justice had saved his life, was appointed to judge some of those who should have been his judges; and Sir. Orlando Bridgman, who upon his submission to Cromwell had been permitted to practice the law in a private manner, and under that colour had served both as spy and agent for his master, was entrusted with the principal management of this tragic scene; and in his charge to the Grand Jury, had the assurance to tell them &#x27;That no authority, no single person, or community of men; not the people collectively or representatively, had any coercive power over the King of England&#x27;&quot;.

In framing the Act of Indemnity and Oblivion, the House of Commons were unwilling to except Sir Henry Vane, Sir. Arthur Haslerig, and Major-General Lambert as they had no immediate hand in the death of the King, and there was as much reason to except them as most of the members of Parliament from its benefits. In Henry Vane&#x27;s case the House of Lords were desirous of having him specifically excepted, so as to leave him at the mercy of the government and thus restrain him from the exercise of his great talents in promoting his favourite republican principles at any time during the remainder of his life. At a conference between the two Houses, it was concluded that the Commons should consent to except him from the act of indemnity, the Lords agreeing, on their part, to concur with the other House in petitioning the King, in case of the condemnation of Vane, not to carry the sentence into execution. General Edmond Ludlow, still loyal to the Rump Parliament was also excepted.

According to contemporary royalist legal theory, the Long Parliament was regarded as having been automatically dissolved from the moment of Charles I&#x27;s execution on 30 January 1649. This view was confirmed by a court ruling during the treason trial of Henry Vane the Younger – a ruling that Henry Vane himself had concurred with in opposition to Oliver Cromwell years earlier.

The trial given to Vane as to his own person, and defence of his own part played for the Long Parliament was a foregone conclusion. It was not a fair trial as both his defence, and deportment at the time of defence bears out. He was not given legal counsel (other than the judges that sat at his trial); and was left to conduct his own defence after years in prison. Sir Henry Vane maintained the following at his trial:
# Whether the collective body of the Parliament can be impeached of high treason?
# Whether any person, acting by authority of Parliament, can (so long as he acting by that authority) commit treason?
# Whether matters, acted by that authority, can be called in question in an inferior court?
# Whether a king &quot;de jure&quot;, and out of possession, can have treason committed against him?

King Charles II did not keep the promise made to the house but executed the sentence of death on Sir Henry Vane the Younger. The solicitor, openly declared in his speech afterwards &quot;that he (Henry Vane) must be made a public sacrifice&quot;. One of his judges stated: &quot;We knew not how to answer him, but we know what to do with him&quot;.

Edmond Ludlow one of the members of Parliament excepted by the act of indemnity, fled to Switzerland after the restoration of King Charles II, where he wrote his memoirs of these events.

The Long Parliament began with the execution of Lord Stafford, and effectively ended with the execution of Henry Vane the Younger.

The republican theory is that the goal and aim of the Long Parliament was to institute a constitutional, balanced, and equally representative form of government along similar lines as were later accomplished in America by the American Revolution. It is clear from the writings of both Ludlow, Vane, and historians of the early American period such as Upham, that this is what they were striving for and why they were excepted from the acts of indemnity. The republican theory also suggests that the Long Parliament would have been successful in these necessary reforms except through the forceful intervention of Oliver Cromwell (and others) in removing the loyalists party, the unlawful execution of King Charles I, later dissolving the Rump Parliament; and finally the forceful dissolution of the reconvened Rump Parliament by Monck when less than a fourth of the required members were present. It is believed that in many ways this struggle was but a precursor to the American Revolution.

<text>A lubricant (sometimes shortened to lube) is a substance that helps to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move. It may also have the function of transmitting forces, transporting foreign particles, or heating or cooling the surfaces. The property of reducing friction is known as lubricity.

In addition to industrial applications, lubricants are used for many other purposes. Other uses include cooking (oils and fats in use in frying pans and baking to prevent food sticking), to reduce rusting and friction in machinery, through the use of motor oil and grease, bioapplications on humans (e.g., lubricants for artificial joints), ultrasound examination, medical examination, and sexual intercourse. It is mainly used to reduce friction and to contribute to a better, more efficient functioning of a mechanism.

==History==
Lubricants have been in some use for thousands of years. Calcium soaps have been identified on the axles of chariots dated to 1400 BC. Building stones were slid on oil-impregnated lumber in the time of the pyramids. In the Roman era, lubricants were based on olive oil and rapeseed oil, as well as animal fats. The growth of lubrication accelerated in the Industrial Revolution with the accompanying use of metal-based machinery. Relying initially on natural oils, needs for such machinery shifted toward petroleum-based materials early in the 1900s. A breakthrough came with the development of vacuum distillation of petroleum, as described by the Vacuum Oil Company. This technology allowed the purification of very non-volatile substances, which are common in many lubricants.

== Properties ==

A good lubricant generally possesses the following characteristics:
* A high boiling point and low freezing point (in order to stay liquid within a wide range of temperature)
* A high viscosity index
* Thermal stability
* Hydraulic stability
* Demulsibility
* Corrosion prevention
* A high resistance to oxidation
* Pour Point (the minimum temperature at which oil will flow under prescribed test conditions)

=== Formulation ===

Typically lubricants contain 90% base oil (most often petroleum fractions, called mineral oils) and less than 10% additives. Vegetable oils or synthetic liquids such as hydrogenated polyolefins, esters, silicones, fluorocarbons and many others are sometimes used as base oils. Additives deliver reduced friction and wear, increased viscosity, improved viscosity index, resistance to corrosion and oxidation, aging or contamination, etc.

Non-liquid lubricants include powders (dry graphite, PTFE, molybdenum disulphide, tungsten disulphide, etc.), PTFE tape used in plumbing, air cushion and others. Dry lubricants such as graphite, molybdenum disulphide and tungsten disulphide also offer lubrication at temperatures (up to 350 °C) higher than liquid and oil-based lubricants are able to operate. Limited interest has been shown in low friction properties of compacted oxide glaze layers formed at several hundred degrees Celsius in metallic sliding systems; however, practical use is still many years away due to their physically unstable nature.

=== Additives ===

A large number of additives are used to impart performance characteristics to the lubricants. Modern automotive lubricants contain as many as ten additives, comprising up to 20% of the lubricant, the main families of additives are:
* Pour point depressants are compounds that prevent crystallization of waxes. Long chain alkylbenzenes adhere to small crystallites of wax, preventing crystal growth.
* Anti-foaming agents are typically silicone compounds which increase surface tension in order to discourage foam formation.
* Viscosity index improvers (VIIs) are compounds that allow lubricants to remain viscous at higher temperatures. Typical VIIs are polyacrylates and butadiene.
* Antioxidants suppress the rate of oxidative degradation of the hydrocarbon molecules within the lubricant. At low temperatures, free radical inhibitors such as hindered phenols are used, e.g. butylated hydroxytoluene. At temperatures &gt;90 °C, where the metals catalyze the oxidation process, dithiophosphates are more useful. In the latter application the additives are called metal deactivators.
* Detergents ensure the cleanliness of engine components by preventing the formation of deposits on contact surfaces at high temperatures.
* Corrosion inhibitors (rust inhibitors) are usually alkaline materials, such as alkylsulfonate salts, that absorb acids that would corrode metal parts.
* Anti-wear additives form protective &#x27;tribofilms&#x27; on metal parts, suppressing wear. They come in two classes depending on the strength with which they bind to the surface. Popular examples include phosphate esters and zinc dithiophosphates. 
* Extreme pressure (anti-scuffing) additives form protective films on sliding metal parts. These agents are often sulfur compounds, such as dithiophosphates.
* Friction modifiers reduce friction and wear, particularly in the boundary lubrication regime where surfaces come into direct contact. 
In 1999, an estimated 37,300,000 tons of lubricants were consumed worldwide. Automotive applications dominate, including electric vehicles but other industrial, marine, and metal working applications are also big consumers of lubricants. Although air and other gas-based lubricants are known (e.g., in fluid bearings), liquid lubricants dominate the market, followed by solid lubricants.

Lubricants are generally composed of a majority of base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. Although generally lubricants are based on one type of base oil, mixtures of the base oils also are used to meet performance requirements.

=== Mineral oil ===

The term &quot;mineral oil&quot; is used to refer to lubricating base oils derived from crude oil. The American Petroleum Institute (API) designates several types of lubricant base oil:

* Group I – Saturates &lt; 90% and/or sulfur &gt; 0.03%, and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) viscosity index (VI) of 80 to 120
: Manufactured by solvent extraction, solvent or catalytic dewaxing, and hydro-finishing processes. Common Group I base oil are 150SN (solvent neutral), 500SN, and 150BS (brightstock)
* Group II – Saturates &gt; 90% and sulfur &lt; 0.03%, and SAE viscosity index of 80 to 120
: Manufactured by hydrocracking and solvent or catalytic dewaxing processes. Group II base oil has superior anti-oxidation properties since virtually all hydrocarbon molecules are saturated. It has water-white color.
* Group III – Saturates &gt; 90%, sulfur &lt; 0.03%, and SAE viscosity index over 120
: Manufactured by special processes such as isohydromerization. Can be manufactured from base oil or slax wax from dewaxing process.
* Group IV – Polyalphaolefins (PAO)
* Group V – All others not included above, such as naphthenics, polyalkylene glycols (PAG), and polyesters.

The lubricant industry commonly extends this group terminology to include:
* Group I+ with a viscosity index of 103–108
* Group II+ with a viscosity index of 113–119
* Group III+ with a viscosity index of at least 140

Can also be classified into three categories depending on the prevailing compositions:
* Paraffinic
* Naphthenic
* Aromatic

=== Synthetic oils ===
Petroleum-derived lubricant can also be produced using synthetic hydrocarbons (derived ultimately from petroleum), &quot;synthetic oils&quot;.

These include:
* Polyalpha-olefin (PAO)
* Synthetic esters
* Polyalkylene glycols (PAG)
* Phosphate esters
* Perfluoropolyether (PFPE)
* Alkylated naphthalenes (AN)
* Silicate esters
* Ionic fluids
* Multiply alkylated cyclopentanes (MAC)

=== Solid lubricants ===
PTFE: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is typically used as a coating layer on, for example, cooking utensils to provide a non-stick surface. Its usable temperature range up to 350 °C and chemical inertness make it a useful additive in special greases, where it can function both as a thickener and a lubricant. Under extreme pressures, PTFE powder or solids is of little value as it is soft and flows away from the area of contact. Ceramic or metal or alloy lubricants must be used then.

Inorganic solids: Graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of solid lubricants. Some retain their lubricity to very high temperatures. The use of some such materials is sometimes restricted by their poor resistance to oxidation (e.g., molybdenum disulfide degrades above 350 °C in air, but 1100 °C in reducing environments.

Metal/alloy: Metal alloys, composites and pure metals can be used as grease additives or the sole constituents of sliding surfaces and bearings. Cadmium and gold are used for plating surfaces which gives them good corrosion resistance and sliding properties, Lead, tin, zinc alloys and various bronze alloys are used as sliding bearings, or their powder can be used to lubricate sliding surfaces alone.

=== Aqueous lubrication ===
Aqueous lubrication is of interest in a number of technological applications. Strongly hydrated brush polymers such as PEG can serve as lubricants at liquid solid interfaces. By continuous rapid exchange of bound water with other free water molecules, these polymer films keep the surfaces separated while maintaining a high fluidity at the brush–brush interface at high compressions, thus leading to a very low coefficient of friction.

=== Biolubricant ===
Biolubricants are derived from vegetable oils and other renewable sources. They usually are triglyceride esters (fats obtained from plants and animals). For lubricant base oil use, the vegetable derived materials are preferred. Common ones include high oleic canola oil, castor oil, palm oil, sunflower seed oil and rapeseed oil from vegetable, and tall oil from tree sources. Many vegetable oils are often hydrolyzed to yield the acids which are subsequently combined selectively to form specialist synthetic esters. Other naturally derived lubricants include lanolin (wool grease, a natural water repellent).

Whale oil was a historically important lubricant, with some uses up to the latter part of the 20th century as a friction modifier additive for automatic transmission fluid.

In 2008, the biolubricant market was around 1% of UK lubricant sales in a total lubricant market of 840,000 tonnes/year.

, researchers at Australia&#x27;s CSIRO have been studying safflower oil as an engine lubricant, finding superior performance and lower emissions than petroleum-based lubricants in applications such as engine-driven lawn mowers, chainsaws and other agricultural equipment. Grain-growers trialling the product have welcomed the innovation, with one describing it as needing very little refining, biodegradable, a bioenergy and biofuel. The scientists have reengineered the plant using gene silencing, creating a variety that produces up to 93% of oil, the highest currently available from any plant. Researchers at Montana State University’s Advanced Fuel Centre in the US studying the oil’s performance in a large diesel engine, comparing it with conventional oil, have described the results as a &quot;game-changer&quot;.

=== Greases ===
Are solid or semi-solid lubricant produced by blending thickening agents within a liquid lubricant. Greases are typically composed of about 80% lubricating oil, around 5% to 10% thickener, and approximately 10% to 15% additives. In most common greases, the thickener is a light or alkali metal soap, forming a sponge-like structure that encapsulates the oil droplets. Beyond lubrication, greases are generally expected to provide corrosion protection, typically achieved through additives. To prevent drying out at higher temperatures, dry lubricants are also added. By selecting appropriate oils, thickeners, and additives, the properties of greases can be optimized for a wide range of applications. There are greases suited for high or extremely low temperatures, vacuum applications, water-resistant and weatherproof greases, highly pressure-resistant or creeping types, food-grade, or exceptionally adhesive greases.

== Functions of lubricants ==
One of the largest applications for lubricants, in the form of motor oil, is protecting the internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and powered equipment.
=== Lubricant vs. anti-tack coating ===
Anti-tack or anti-stick coatings are designed to reduce the adhesive condition (stickiness) of a given material. The rubber, hose, and wire and cable industries are the largest consumers of anti-tack products but virtually every industry uses some form of anti-sticking agent. Anti-sticking agents differ from &quot;lubricants&quot; in that they are designed to reduce the inherently adhesive qualities of a given compound while lubricants are designed to reduce friction between any two surfaces.

=== Keep moving parts apart ===
Lubricants are typically used to separate moving parts in a system. This separation has the benefit of reducing friction, wear and surface fatigue, together with reduced heat generation, operating noise and vibrations. Lubricants achieve this in several ways. The most common is by forming a physical barrier i.e., a thin layer of lubricant separates the moving parts. This is analogous to hydroplaning, the loss of friction observed when a car tire is separated from the road surface by moving through standing water. This is termed hydrodynamic lubrication. In cases of high surface pressures or temperatures, the fluid film is much thinner and some of the forces are transmitted between the surfaces through the lubricant.

=== Reduce friction ===
Typically the lubricant-to-surface friction is much less than surface-to-surface friction in a system without any lubrication. Thus use of a lubricant reduces the overall system friction. Reduced friction has the benefit of reducing heat generation and reduced formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency. Lubricants may contain polar additives known as friction modifiers that chemically bind to metal surfaces to reduce surface friction even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant present for hydrodynamic lubrication, e.g. protecting the valve train in a car engine at startup. The base oil itself might also be polar in nature and as a result inherently able to bind to metal surfaces, as with polyolester oils.

=== Transfer heat ===
Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat. However, liquid lubricants are much more effective on account of their high specific heat capacity. Typically the liquid lubricant is constantly circulated to and from a cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used to warm as well as to cool when a regulated temperature is required. This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that is carried away in any given unit of time. High flow systems can carry away a lot of heat and have the additional benefit of reducing the thermal stress on the lubricant. Thus lower cost liquid lubricants may be used. The primary drawback is that high flows typically require larger sumps and bigger cooling units. A secondary drawback is that a high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure during sudden system shut downs. An automotive oil-cooled turbocharger is a typical example. Turbochargers get red hot during operation and the oil that is cooling them only survives as its residence time in the system is very short (i.e. high flow rate). If the system is shut down suddenly (pulling into a service area after a high-speed drive and stopping the engine) the oil that is in the turbo charger immediately oxidizes and will clog the oil ways with deposits. Over time these deposits can completely block the oil ways, reducing the cooling with the result that the turbo charger experiences total failure, typically with seized bearings. Non-flowing lubricants such as greases and pastes are not effective at heat transfer although they do contribute by reducing the generation of heat in the first place.

=== Carry away contaminants and debris ===

Lubricant circulation systems have the benefit of carrying away internally generated debris and external contaminants that get introduced into the system to a filter where they can be removed. Lubricants for machines that regularly generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically contain detergent and dispersant additives to assist in debris and contaminant transport to the filter and removal. Over time the filter will get clogged and require cleaning or replacement, hence the recommendation to change a car&#x27;s oil filter at the same time as changing the oil. In closed systems such as gear boxes the filter may be supplemented by a magnet to attract any iron fines that get created.

It is apparent that in a circulatory system the oil will only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that there are no industry standards by which consumers can readily assess the filtering ability of various automotive filters. Poor automotive filters 
significantly reduce the life of the machine (engine) as well as make the system inefficient.

=== Transmit power ===

Lubricants known as hydraulic fluid are used as the working fluid in hydrostatic power transmission. Hydraulic fluids comprise a large portion of all lubricants produced in the world. The automatic transmission&#x27;s torque converter is another important application for power transmission with lubricants.

=== Protect against wear ===

Lubricants prevent wear by reducing friction between two parts. Lubricants may also contain anti-wear or extreme pressure additives to boost their performance against wear and fatigue.

=== Prevent corrosion and rusting ===
Many lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces or that exclude moisture, to prevent corrosion and rust. It reduces corrosion between two metallic surfaces and avoids contact between these surfaces to avoid immersed corrosion.

=== Seal for gases ===
Lubricants will occupy the clearance between moving parts through the capillary force, thus sealing the clearance. This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts.

== &quot;Glaze&quot; formation (high-temperature wear) ==
A further phenomenon that has undergone investigation in relation to high-temperature wear prevention and lubrication is that of a compacted oxide layer glaze formation. Such glazes are generated by sintering a compacted oxide layer. Such glazes are crystalline, in contrast to the amorphous glazes seen in pottery. The required high temperatures arise from metallic surfaces sliding against each other (or a metallic surface against a ceramic surface). Due to the elimination of metallic contact and adhesion by the generation of oxide, friction and wear is reduced. Effectively, such a surface is self-lubricating.

As the &quot;glaze&quot; is already an oxide, it can survive to very high temperatures in air or oxidising environments. However, it is disadvantaged by it being necessary for the base metal (or ceramic) having to undergo some wear first to generate sufficient oxide debris.

== Disposal and environmental impact ==

It is estimated that about 50% of all lubricants are released into the environment. Common disposal methods include recycling, burning, landfill and discharge into water, though typically disposal in landfill and discharge into water are strictly regulated in most countries, as even small amount of lubricant can contaminate a large amount of water. Most regulations permit a threshold level of lubricant that may be present in waste streams and companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually in treating their waste waters to get to acceptable levels.

Burning the lubricant as fuel, typically to generate electricity, is also governed by regulations mainly on account of the relatively high level of additives present. Burning generates both airborne pollutants and ash rich in toxic materials, mainly heavy metal compounds. Thus lubricant burning takes place in specialized facilities that have incorporated special scrubbers to remove airborne pollutants and have access to landfill sites with permits to handle the toxic ash.

Unfortunately, most lubricant that ends up directly in the environment is due to the general public discharging it onto the ground, into drains, and directly into landfills as trash. Other direct contamination sources include runoff from roadways, accidental spillages, natural or man-made disasters, and pipeline leakages.

Improvement in filtration technologies and processes has now made recycling a viable option (with the rising price of base stock and crude oil). Typically various filtration systems remove particulates, additives, and oxidation products and recover the base oil. The oil may get refined during the process. This base oil is then treated much the same as virgin base oil however there is considerable reluctance to use recycled oils as they are generally considered inferior. Basestock fractionally vacuum distilled from used lubricants has superior properties to all-natural oils, but cost-effectiveness depends on many factors. Used lubricant may also be used as refinery feedstock to become part of crude oil. Again, there is considerable reluctance to this use as the additives, soot, and wear metals will seriously poison/deactivate the critical catalysts in the process. Cost prohibits carrying out both filtration (soot, additives removal) and re-refining (distilling, isomerization, hydrocrack, etc.) however the primary hindrance to recycling still remains the collection of fluids as refineries need continuous supply in amounts measured in cisterns, rail tanks.

Occasionally, unused lubricant requires disposal. The best course of action in such situations is to return it to the manufacturer where it can be processed as a part of fresh batches.

&quot;Environment:&quot; Lubricants both fresh and used can cause considerable damage to the environment mainly due to their high potential of serious water pollution. Further, the additives typically contained in lubricant can be toxic to flora and fauna. In used fluids, the oxidation products can be toxic as well. Lubricant persistence in the environment largely depends upon the base fluid, however if very toxic additives are used they may negatively affect the persistence. Lanolin lubricants are non-toxic making them the environmental alternative which is safe for both users and the environment.

{{Nuclear physics}}

Elise {{nobold|&quot;}}Lise{{nobold|&quot;}} Meitner ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|z|ə|_|ˈ|m|aɪ|t|n|ər}} {{respell|LEE|zə|_|MYTE|nər}}; {{IPA|de|ˈliːzə ˈmaɪtnɐ|lang|De-Lise Meitner.ogg}}; 7 November 1878 – 27 October 1968) was an Austrian-Swedish physicist who was instrumental in the discovery of nuclear fission.

Completing her doctoral research in 1906, Meitner became the second woman from the University of Vienna to earn a doctorate in physics. She spent much of her scientific career in Berlin, where she was a physics professor and a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. She was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany. She lost her positions in 1935 because of the anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany, and the 1938 Anschluss resulted in the loss of her Austrian citizenship. On 13–14 July 1938, she fled to the Netherlands with the help of Dirk Coster. She lived in Stockholm for many years, ultimately becoming a Swedish citizen in 1949, but relocated to Britain in the 1950s to be with family members.

In mid-1938, chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry demonstrated that isotopes of barium could be formed by neutron bombardment of uranium. Meitner was informed of their findings by Hahn, and in late December, with her nephew, fellow physicist Otto Robert Frisch, she worked out the physics of this process by correctly interpreting Hahn and Strassmann&#x27;s experimental data. On 13 January 1939, Frisch replicated the process Hahn and Strassmann had observed. In Meitner and Frisch&#x27;s report in the February 1939 issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, they gave the process the name &quot;fission&quot;. The discovery of nuclear fission led to the development of nuclear reactors and atomic bombs during World War II.

Meitner did not share the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for nuclear fission, which was awarded to her long-time collaborator Otto Hahn. Several scientists and journalists have called her exclusion &quot;unjust&quot;. According to the Nobel Prize archive, she was nominated 19 times for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry between 1924 and 1948, and 30 times for the Nobel Prize in Physics between 1937 and 1967. Despite not having been awarded the Nobel Prize, Meitner was invited to attend the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in 1962. She received many other honours, including the posthumous naming of element 109 meitnerium in 1997. Meitner was praised by Albert Einstein as the &quot;German Marie Curie.&quot;

==Early years==
Elise Meitner was born on 7 November 1878 into a Jewish upper-middle-class family at the family home in 27 Kaiser Josefstraße in the Leopoldstadt district of Vienna, the third of eight children of chess master Philipp Meitner and his wife Hedwig. The birth register of Vienna&#x27;s Jewish community lists her as being born on 17 November 1878, but all other documents list her date of birth as 7 November, which is what she used.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=1}} Her father was one of the first Jewish lawyers admitted to practice in Austria. She had two older siblings, Gisela and Auguste (Gusti), and four younger: Moriz (Fritz), Carola (Lola), Frida and Walter; all ultimately pursued an advanced education.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=5–6}} Her father was a freethinker, and she was brought up as such. As an adult, she converted to Christianity, following Lutheranism, and was baptised in 1908;{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=6}} her sisters Gisela and Lola converted to Catholicism that same year.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=6}} She also adopted the shortened name &quot;Lise&quot;.{{sfn|Offereins|2011|pp=69–74}}

==Education==
Meitner&#x27;s interest in science began when she was eight, when she kept a notebook of her scientific research under her pillow. She was drawn to mathematics and science, and studied the colours of an oil slick, thin films, and reflected light. The only career available to women was teaching, so she attended a high school for girls where she trained as a French teacher. As well as French, her education included bookkeeping, arithmetic, history, geography, science and gymnastics. She completed high school in 1892. Women were not allowed to attend public institutions of higher education in Vienna until 1897, but when this restriction was lifted, the requirement for a gymnasium education was waived and women only needed to pass the {{lang|la|matura}}, the secondary school leaving qualification required for university entrance. Her sister Gisela passed the {{lang|la|matura}} and entered medical school in 1900. Meitner began taking private lessons with two other young women in 1899, cramming the missing years of secondary education into two. Physics was taught by Arthur Szarvasy. In July 1901, they sat an external {{lang|la|matura}} examination at the Akademisches Gymnasium. Four out of the fourteen women passed, including Meitner and Henriette Boltzmann, the daughter of physicist Ludwig Boltzmann.{{sfn|Watkins|1984|p=13}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=5–9}}

==Research, work and academia==
===University of Vienna===
Meitner entered the University of Vienna in October 1901.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=10}} She was particularly inspired by Ludwig Boltzmann and often spoke with enthusiasm about his lectures.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=12–16}} Her dissertation was supervised by Franz Exner and his assistant Hans Benndorf.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=17}} Her thesis, titled {{lang|de|Prüfung einer Formel Maxwells}} ({{gloss|Examination of a Maxwell Equation}}), was submitted on 20 November 1905 and approved on 28 November. She passed an oral exam from Exner and Boltzmann on 19 December,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=398}} and was awarded her doctorate on 1 February 1906.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=16}} She became the second woman to earn a doctoral degree in physics at the University of Vienna, after Olga Steindler who had received her degree in 1903;{{sfn|Sime|2005|p=7}} the third was Selma Freud, who worked in the same laboratory as Meitner, and received hers in 1906.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=398}} Meitner&#x27;s thesis was published as {{lang|de|Wärmeleitung in inhomogenen Körpern}} ({{gloss|Thermal Conduction in Inhomogeneous Bodies}}) on 22 February 1906.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=398}}

Paul Ehrenfest asked her to investigate an article on optics by Lord Rayleigh detailing an experiment that produced results Rayleigh had been unable to explain. She was able to explain the results, and also made predictions based on her explanation, which she then verified experimentally, demonstrating her ability to carry out independent and unsupervised research.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=18–21}} She published the results in her report on &quot;Some Conclusions Derived from the Fresnel Reflection Formula&quot;. In 1906, while engaged in this research, Meitner was introduced by Stefan Meyer to radioactivity, then a very new field of study. She started with alpha particles. In her experiments with collimators and metal foil, she found that scattering in a beam of alpha particles increased with the mass of the metal atoms. She submitted her findings to the {{lang|de|Physikalische Zeitschrift}} on 29 June 1907. This was one of the experiments that led Ernest Rutherford to predict the nuclear atom.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=18–21}}

===Friedrich Wilhelm University===
Encouraged and backed by her father&#x27;s financial support, Meitner entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where the renowned physicist Max Planck taught. Planck invited her to his home, and allowed her to attend his lectures. This was an unusual gesture by Planck, who was on record as opposing the admission of women to universities in general, but apparently recognised Meitner as an exception.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=24–26}} She became friends with Planck&#x27;s twin daughters Emma and Grete, who were born in 1889, and shared Meitner&#x27;s love of music.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=38}}

Attending Planck&#x27;s lectures did not take up all her time, and Meitner approached Heinrich Rubens, the head of the experimental physics institute, about doing some research. Rubens said that he would be happy for her to work in his laboratory. He also added that Otto Hahn at the chemistry institute was looking for a physicist to collaborate with. A few minutes later she was introduced to Hahn. He had studied radioactive substances under William Ramsay and Ernest Rutherford, and was already credited with the discovery of what were then thought to be several new radioactive elements.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}}{{efn|In fact, they were isotopes of known elements, but the concept of an isotope, along with the term, was only propounded by Frederick Soddy in 1913.{{sfn|Hughes|2008|pp=134–135}} }} Hahn was the same age as Meitner, and she noted his informal and approachable manner.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}} In Montreal, Hahn had become accustomed to collaboration with physicists—including at least one woman, Harriet Brooks.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=28–29}}

The head of the chemistry institute, Emil Fischer, placed a former woodworking shop ({{lang|de|Holzwerkstatt}}) at Hahn&#x27;s disposal in the basement to use as a laboratory. Hahn equipped it with electroscopes to measure alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. It was not possible to conduct research in the wood shop, but Alfred Stock, the head of the inorganic chemistry department, let Hahn use a space in one of his two private laboratories.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=52}} Like Meitner, Hahn was unpaid, and lived off an allowance from his father, although somewhat larger than hers. He completed his habilitation in early 1907, and became a {{lang|de|Privatdozent}}.{{sfn|Stolz|1989|p=20}} Most of the organic chemists at the chemistry institute did not regard Hahn&#x27;s work—detecting minute traces of isotopes too small to see, weigh or smell through their radioactivity—as real chemistry.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}} One department head remarked that &quot;it is incredible what one gets to be a {{lang|de|Privatdozent}} these days!&quot;{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=50}} Lise Meitner helped discover the radioactive element protactinium.

The arrangement was difficult for Meitner at first. Women were not yet admitted to universities in the German state of the Kingdom of Prussia, which included Berlin. Meitner was allowed to work in the wood shop, which had its own external entrance, but she could not enter the rest of the institute, including Hahn&#x27;s laboratory space upstairs. If she wanted to go to the toilet, she had to use one at the restaurant down the street. The following year, women were admitted to Prussian universities, and Fischer lifted the restrictions, and had women&#x27;s toilets installed in the building. Not all the chemists were happy about this.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=28–29}} The Institute of Physics was more accepting, and she became friends with the physicists there, including {{ill|Otto von Baeyer|de}}, James Franck, Gustav Hertz, Robert Pohl, Max Planck, {{ill|Peter Pringsheim|de}} and Wilhelm Westphal.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=65}}

During the first years Meitner worked with Hahn, they co-authored nine papers: three in 1908 and six in 1909. Together with Hahn, she discovered and developed a physical separation method known as radioactive recoil, in which a daughter nucleus is forcefully ejected as it recoils at the moment of decay. While Hahn was more concerned with discovering new elements (now known to be isotopes), Meitner was more interested in understanding their radiation. She observed that radioactive recoil, which had been discovered by Harriet Brooks in 1904, could be a new way of detecting radioactive substances. They soon discovered two more new isotopes, bismuth-211 and thallium-207.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=58–64}} Meitner was particularly interested in beta particles. By this time, they were known to be electrons. Alpha particles were emitted with characteristic energy, and she expected that this would be true of beta particles too. Hahn and Meitner carefully measured the absorption of beta particles by aluminium, but the results were puzzling. In 1914, James Chadwick found that electrons emitted from the nucleus formed a continuous spectrum, but Meitner found this hard to believe, as it seemed to contradict quantum physics, which held that electrons in an atom can only occupy discrete energy states (quanta).{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=551–553}}
{{Clear}}

===Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry===
In 1912, Hahn and Meitner moved to the newly founded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (KWI) for Chemistry in Berlin. Hahn accepted an offer from Fischer to become a junior assistant in charge of its radiochemistry section, the first laboratory of its kind in Germany. The job came with the title of &quot;professor&quot; and a salary of 5,000 marks per annum ({{Inflation|DE|5,000|1912|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}). Unlike the universities, the privately funded KWI had no policies excluding women, but Meitner worked without pay as a &quot;guest&quot; in Hahn&#x27;s section.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Sime|2005|p=11}} She may have encountered financial difficulties after the death of her father in 1910. Fearing she might return to Vienna, Planck appointed her as his assistant at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in the Friedrich Wilhelm University. As such, she marked his students&#x27; papers. It was her first paid position. Assistant was the lowest rung on the academic ladder, and Meitner was the first female scientific assistant in Prussia.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=44–45}}{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=66}}

Proud officials presented Meitner to Kaiser Wilhelm II at the official opening of the KWI for Chemistry on 23 October 1912.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=70–71}} The following year she became a {{lang|de|Mitglied}} ({{gloss|associate}}) like Hahn (although her salary was still less),{{sfn|Sime|2005|p=11}} and the radioactivity section became the Hahn-Meitner Laboratory. Meitner celebrated with a dinner party at the Hotel Adlon. Hahn and Meitner&#x27;s salaries would soon be dwarfed by royalties from mesothorium (&quot;middle thorium&quot;, radium-228, also called &quot;German radium&quot;) produced for medical purposes, for which Hahn received 66,000 marks in 1914 ({{Inflation|DE|66,000|1914|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}). He gave ten per cent to Meitner.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=47}} In 1914, Meitner was offered an academic position in Prague, which was then part of her country of Austria-Hungary. Planck made it clear to Fischer that he did not want Meitner to leave, and Fischer arranged for her salary to be doubled to 3,000 marks ({{Inflation|DE|3,000|1914|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}).{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=48}}

The move to new accommodation was fortunate, as the wood shop had become thoroughly contaminated by radioactive liquids that had been spilt, and radioactive gases that had vented and decayed then settled as radioactive dust, making sensitive measurements impossible. To ensure that their clean new laboratories stayed that way, Hahn and Meitner instituted strict procedures. Chemical and physical measurements were conducted in different rooms, people handling radioactive substances had to follow protocols that included not shaking hands, and rolls of toilet paper were hung next to every telephone and door handle. Strongly radioactive substances were stored in the old wood shop, and later in a purpose-built radium house on the institute grounds.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=48}}

==World War I and the discovery of protactinium==
In July 1914—shortly before the outbreak of World War I—Hahn was called to active duty with the army in a {{lang|de|Landwehr}} regiment.{{sfn|Van der Kloot|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Spence|1970|pp=286–287}} Meitner undertook X-ray technician training, and a course on anatomy at the city hospital in Lichterfelde.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=66}} Meanwhile, she completed both the work on the beta ray spectrum that she had begun before the war with Hahn and Baeyer, and her own study of the uranium decay chain.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=55}} In July 1915, she returned to Vienna, where she joined the Austrian Army as an X-ray nurse-technician. Her unit was deployed to the Eastern front in Poland, and she also served on the Italian front before being discharged in September 1916.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=59–62}}

Meitner returned to the KWI for Chemistry and her research in October. In January 1917, she was appointed as head of her own physics section. The Hahn-Meitner Laboratory was divided into separate Hahn and Meitner Laboratories, and her pay was increased to 4,000 marks ({{Inflation|DE|4,000|1917|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-3}}).{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=65}} Hahn returned to Berlin on leave, and they discussed another loose end from their pre-war work: the search for the mother isotope of actinium (element 89). According to the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy, this had to be an isotope of the undiscovered element 91 on the periodic table that lay between thorium (element 90) and uranium (element 92). Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring discovered the missing element in 1913, and named it &quot;brevium&quot; after its short half-life. However, the isotope they had found was a beta emitter, and therefore could not be the mother isotope of actinium. This had to be another isotope of the same element.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}

In 1914, Hahn and Meitner had developed a new technique for separating the tantalum group from pitchblende, which they hoped would speed the isolation of the new isotope. When Meitner resumed this work in 1917, Hahn and most of the students, laboratory assistants and technicians had been called up to serve in the armed forces, so Meitner had to do everything herself. In February, she extracted 2 grams of silicon dioxide ({{chem|Si|O|2}}) from 21 grams of pitchblende. She set 1.5 grams aside and added a tantalum pentafluoride ({{chem|Ta|F|5}}) carrier to the other 0.5 grams, which she dissolved in hydrogen fluoride ({{chem|H|F}}). She then boiled it in concentrated sulfuric acid ({{chem|H|2|S|O|4}}), precipitated what was believed to be element 91, and verified that it was an alpha emitter. Hahn came home on leave in April, and together they devised a series of tests to eliminate other sources of alpha particles. The only known ones with similar chemical behaviour were lead-210 (which decays to alpha emitter polonium-210 via bismuth-210) and thorium-230.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}

Further investigation required more pitchblende. Meitner went to Vienna, where she met with Stefan Meyer. The export of uranium from Austria was forbidden due to wartime restrictions, but Meyer was able to offer her a kilogram of uranium residue, pitchblende from which the uranium had been removed, which was actually better for her purpose. The tests showed that the alpha activity was not due to these substances. All that now remained was to find evidence of actinium. For this yet more pitchblende was required, but this time Meyer was unable to assist, as the export was now prohibited. Meitner managed to obtain 100 grams of &quot;double residue&quot;—pitchblende without uranium or radium—from Friedrich Oskar Giesel and began tests with 43 grams of it, but its composition was different, and at first her tests did not work. With Giesel&#x27;s help, she was able to produce a pure product that was strongly radioactive. By December 1917 she was able to isolate both the mother isotope and its actinium daughter product. She submitted their findings for publication in March 1918.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}

Although Fajans and Göhring had been the first to discover the element, custom required that an element was represented by its longest-lived and most abundant isotope, and brevium did not seem appropriate. Fajans agreed to Meitner naming the element &quot;protoactinium&quot; (subsequently shortened to protactinium), and assigning it the chemical symbol Pa. In June 1918, Soddy and John Cranston announced that they had independently extracted a sample of the isotope, but unlike Meitner they were unable to describe its characteristics. They acknowledged Meitner&#x27;s priority, and agreed to the name. The connection to uranium remained a mystery, as neither of the two known isotopes of uranium (uranium-234 and uranium-238) decayed into protactinium. It remained unsolved until uranium-235 was discovered by Arthur Jeffrey Dempster in 1935.{{sfn|Sime|1986|pp=653–657}}

==Beta radiation==
In 1921, Meitner accepted an invitation from Manne Siegbahn to come to Sweden and give a series of lectures on radioactivity as a visiting professor at Lund University. She found that very little research had been done on radioactivity in Sweden, but she was eager to learn about X-ray spectroscopy, which was Siegbahn&#x27;s specialty. At his laboratory, she met a Dutch doctoral candidate, Dirk Coster, who was studying X-ray spectroscopy, and his wife Miep, who was working on her doctorate in Indonesian language and culture. Armed with her newly acquired knowledge of X-ray spectroscopy, Meitner took a fresh look at the beta-ray spectra when she returned to Berlin.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=653–657}} It was known that some beta emission was primary, with electrons being ejected directly from the nucleus, and some was secondary, in which alpha particles from the nucleus knocked electrons out of orbit. Meitner was sceptical of Chadwick&#x27;s claim that the spectral lines were entirely due to secondary electrons, while the primary ones formed a continuous spectrum.{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=552–553}} Using techniques developed by Jean Danysz, she examined the spectra of lead-210, radium-226 and thorium-238.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=86}} Meitner discovered the cause of the emission of electrons from surfaces of atoms with &quot;signature&quot; energies, now known as the Auger-Meitner effect, in 1922.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=90}} The effect is co-named after Pierre Victor Auger, who independently discovered it in 1923.

Women were granted the right of habilitation in Prussia in 1920, and in 1922 Meitner was granted her habilitation and became a {{lang|de|Privatdozentin}}. She was the first woman to receive her habilitation in physics in Prussia, and only the second in Germany after Hedwig Kohn. Since Meitner had already published over 40 papers, she was not required to submit a thesis, but Max von Laue recommended that the requirement for an inaugural lecture not be waived, since he was interested in what she had to say. She therefore gave an inaugural lecture on &quot;Problems of Cosmic Physics&quot;.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=109–110, 421}} From 1923 to 1933, she taught a colloquium or tutorial at Friedrich Wilhelm University each semester, and supervised doctoral students at the KWI for Chemistry.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=109–110, 421}} In 1926, she became an {{lang|de|außerordentlicher Professor}} ({{gloss|extraordinary professor}}), the first woman university physics professor in Germany. Her physics section became larger, and she acquired a permanent assistant. Scientists from Germany and around the world came to the KWI for Chemistry to conduct research under her supervision.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=109–110, 421}} In 1930, Meitner taught a seminar on &quot;Questions of Atomic Physics and Atomic Chemistry&quot; with Leó Szilárd.{{sfn|Lanouette|Silard|1992|pp=100–101}}

Meitner had a Wilson cloud chamber constructed at the KWI for Chemistry, the first one in Berlin, and with her student Kurt Freitag studied the tracks of alpha particles that did not collide with a nucleus.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=113}} With her assistant Kurt Philipp she later used it to take the first images of positron traces from gamma radiation. She proved Chadwick&#x27;s assertion that the discrete spectral lines were entirely the result of secondary electrons, and the continuous spectra were therefore indeed entirely caused by the primary ones. In 1927, Charles Drummond Ellis and William Alfred Wooster measured the energy of the continuous spectrum produced by the beta decay of bismuth-210 at 0.34 MeV where the energy of each disintegration was 0.35 MeV. Thus, the spectrum accounted for nearly, but not all, of the energy. Meitner found this result so troubling that she repeated the experiment with Wilhelm Orthmann using an improved method, and verified Ellis and Wooster&#x27;s results.{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=552–553}}

It appeared that the law of conservation of energy did not hold for beta decay, something Meitner regarded as unacceptable. In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli wrote an open letter to Meitner and Hans Geiger in which he proposed that the continuous spectrum was caused by the emission of a second particle during beta decay, one that had no electric charge and little or no rest mass. The idea was taken up by Enrico Fermi in his 1934 theory of beta decay, and he gave the name &quot;neutrino&quot; to the hypothetical neutral particle. At the time there was scant hope of detecting neutrinos, but in 1956 Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines did just that.{{sfn|Watkins|1983|pp=552–553}}

==Nazi Germany==
Adolf Hitler was sworn in as the Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, as his Nazi Party (NSDAP) was now the largest party in the {{lang|de|Reichstag}}.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=135}} The 7 April 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service removed Jews from the civil service, which included academia. Meitner never tried to conceal her Jewish descent, but initially was exempt from its impact on multiple grounds: she had been employed before 1914, had served in the military during the World War, was an Austrian rather than a German citizen, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was a government-industry partnership.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=138–139}} However, she was dismissed from her adjunct professorship on 6 September on the grounds that her World War I service was not at the front, and she had not completed her habilitation until 1922. This had no effect on her salary or work at the KWI for Chemistry.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=150}} Carl Bosch, the director of IG Farben, a major sponsor of the KWI for Chemistry, assured Meitner that her position there was safe.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=138–139}} Although Hahn and Meitner remained in charge, their assistants, Otto Erbacher and Kurt Philipp respectively, who were both NSDAP members, were given increasing influence over the day-to-day running of the institute.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=153}}

Others were not so fortunate; her nephew Otto Robert Frisch was dismissed from his post in the Institute for Physical Chemistry at the University of Hamburg, as was Otto Stern, the director of the institute. Stern found Frisch a position with Patrick Blackett at Birkbeck College in England,{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=51–52}} and he later worked at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen from 1934 to 1939.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|p=81}} Fritz Strassman had come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry to study under Hahn to improve his employment prospects. He declined a lucrative offer of employment because it required political training and Nazi Party membership, and resigned from the Society of German Chemists when it became part of the Nazi German Labour Front rather than become a member of a Nazi-controlled organisation. As a result, he could neither work in the chemical industry nor receive his habilitation. Meitner persuaded Hahn to hire him as an assistant. Soon he would be credited as a third collaborator on the papers they produced, and would sometimes even be listed first.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=156–157, 169}}{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=122}} Between 1933 and 1935, Meitner published exclusively in the journal {{lang|de|Naturwissenschaften}}, as its editor Arnold Berliner was Jewish, and he continued to accept submissions from Jewish scientists. This generated a boycott of the publication, and in August 1935 the publisher, Springer-Verlag, fired Berliner.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=151–152}}

==Transmutation==
After Chadwick discovered the neutron in 1932,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=39, 160–167, 793}} Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles, and found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus. They noted that positron emission continued after the irradiation ceased. Not only had they discovered a new form of radioactive decay, they had transmuted an element into a hitherto unknown radioactive isotope of another, thereby inducing radioactivity where there had been none before. Radiochemistry was now no longer confined to certain heavy elements, but extended to the entire periodic table.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=161–162}} Chadwick noted that being electrically neutral, neutrons could penetrate the nucleus more easily than protons or alpha particles.{{sfn|Fergusson|2011|p=1151}} Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome picked up on this idea,{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=210–211}} and began irradiating elements with neutrons.{{sfn|Segrè|1989|pp=39–40}}

The radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy said that beta decay causes isotopes to move one element up on the periodic table, and alpha decay causes them to move two down. When Fermi&#x27;s group bombarded uranium atoms with neutrons, they found a complex mix of half lives. Fermi therefore concluded that new elements with atomic numbers greater than 92 (known as transuranium elements) had been created.{{sfn|Segrè|1989|pp=39–40}} Meitner and Hahn had not collaborated for many years, but Meitner was eager to investigate Fermi&#x27;s results. Hahn, initially, was not, but he changed his mind when Aristid von Grosse suggested that what Fermi had found was an isotope of protactinium.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=164–165}} &quot;The only question&quot;, Hahn later wrote, &quot;seemed to be whether Fermi had found isotopes of transuranium elements, or isotopes of the next-lower element, protactinium. At that time Lise Meitner and I decided to repeat Fermi&#x27;s experiments in order to find out whether the 13-minute isotope was a protactinium isotope or not. It was a logical decision, having been the discoverers of protactinium.&quot;{{sfn|Hahn|1966|pp=140–141}}

Between 1934 and 1938, Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann found a great number of radioactive transmutation products, all of which they regarded as transuranic.{{sfn|Hahn|1958|p=78}} At that time, the existence of actinides was not yet established, and uranium was wrongly believed to be a group 6 element similar to tungsten. It followed that the first transuranic elements would be similar to group 7 to 10 elements, rhenium and platinoids. They established the presence of multiple isotopes of at least four such elements, and (mistakenly) identified them as elements with atomic numbers 93 to 96. They were the first scientists to measure the 23-minute half life of the synthetic radioisotope uranium-239 and to establish chemically that it was an isotope of uranium, but with their weak neutron sources they were unable to continue this work to its logical conclusion and identify the real element 93. They identified ten different half lives, with varying degrees of certainty. To account for them, Meitner had to hypothesise a new class of reaction and the alpha decay of uranium, neither of which had ever been reported before, and for which physical evidence was lacking. Hahn and Strassmann refined their chemical procedures, while Meitner devised new experiments to examine the reaction processes.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=170–172}}

In May 1937, Hahn and Meitner issued parallel reports, one in {{lang|de|Zeitschrift für Physik}} with Meitner as the first author, and one in {{lang|de|Chemische Berichte}} with Hahn as the first author.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=170–172}} Hahn concluded his by stating emphatically: {{lang|de|Vor allem steht ihre chemische Verschiedenheit von allen bisher bekannten Elementen außerhalb jeder Diskussion}} ({{gloss|Above all, their chemical distinction from all previously known elements needs no further discussion}}). Meitner was increasingly uncertain. She considered the possibility that the reactions were from different isotopes of uranium; three were known: uranium-238, uranium-235 and uranium-234. However, when she calculated the neutron cross section, it was too large to be anything other than the most abundant isotope, uranium-238, and concluded that it must be another case of nuclear isomerism, a phenomenon Hahn had discovered in protactinium years before. She therefore ended her report on a very different note to Hahn, reporting that: &quot;The process must be neutron capture by uranium-238, which leads to three isomeric nuclei of uranium-239. This result is very difficult to reconcile with current concepts of the nucleus.&quot;{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=177}}

==Escape from Germany==
With the {{lang|de|Anschluss}}, Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria on 12 March 1938, Meitner lost her Austrian citizenship.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=184–185}} Niels Bohr extended an offer to lecture in Copenhagen, and Paul Scherrer invited her to attend a congress in Switzerland, with all expenses paid. Carl Bosch still said that she could remain at the KWI for Chemistry, but by May she was aware that the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture was looking into her case. On 9 May, she decided to accept Bohr&#x27;s invitation to go to Copenhagen, where Frisch worked,{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=262}} but when she went to the Danish consulate to get a travel visa, she was told that Denmark no longer recognised her Austrian passport as valid. She could not leave for Denmark, Switzerland or any other country.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=189–190}}

Bohr came to Berlin in June, and was gravely concerned. When he returned to Copenhagen, he began looking for a position for Meitner in Scandinavia. He also asked Hans Kramers to see if anything was available in the Netherlands. Kramers contacted Coster, who in turn notified Adriaan Fokker. Coster and Fokker attempted to secure a position for Meitner at the University of Groningen. They found that the Rockefeller Foundation would not support refugee scientists, and that the International Federation of University Women had been flooded with applications for support from Austria. On 27 June, Meitner received an offer of a one-year position at Manne Siegbahn&#x27;s new {{ill|Manne Siegbahn Laboratory|sv|Manne Siegbahnlaboratoriet}} in Stockholm, then under construction, which would be devoted to nuclear physics, and she decided to accept it. But on 4 July she learned that academics would no longer be granted permission to travel abroad.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=263}}

Through Bohr in Copenhagen, Peter Debye communicated with Coster and Fokker, and they approached the Netherlands Ministry of Education with an appeal to allow Meitner to come to the Netherlands. As foreigners were not allowed to work for pay, an appointment as a non-salaried {{lang|nl|privaat-docente}} was required. Wander Johannes de Haas and Anton Eduard van Arkel arranged for one at Leiden University.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=264}} Coster also spoke to the head of the border guards, who assured him that Meitner would be admitted. A friend of Coster, E. H. Ebels, was a local politician from the border area, and he spoke directly to the guards on the border.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=265}}

On 11 July, Coster arrived in Berlin, where he stayed with Debye.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=265}} The following morning, Meitner arrived early at the KWI for Chemistry, and Hahn briefed her on the plan. To avoid suspicion, she maintained her usual routine, remaining at the institute until 20:00 correcting one of the associate&#x27;s papers for publication. Hahn and Paul Rosbaud helped her pack two small suitcases, carrying only summer clothes. Hahn gave her a diamond ring he had inherited from his mother in case of emergency; she took only 10 marks in her purse ({{Inflation|DE|10|1938|fmt=eq|cursign=€|r=-1}}). She then spent the night at Hahn&#x27;s house. The next morning Meitner met Coster at the railway station, where they pretended to have met by chance. They travelled on a lightly used line to Bad Nieuweschans railway station on the border, which they crossed without incident;{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=266}} the German border guards may have thought that Meitner was the wife of a professor.{{sfn|Sime|1990|p=267}} A telegram from Pauli informed Coster that he was now &quot;as famous for the abduction of Lise Meitner as for the discovery of hafnium&quot;.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=205}}

Meitner learned on 26 July that Sweden had granted her permission to enter on her Austrian passport, and two days later she flew to Copenhagen, where she was greeted by Frisch, and stayed with Niels and Margrethe Bohr at their holiday house in Tisvilde. On 1 August she travelled by train and steamship to Göteborg station in Sweden, where she was met at by Eva von Bahr. They took a train, and then a steamer, to Von Bahr&#x27;s home in Kungälv, where she stayed until September.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=207}} Hahn told everyone at the KWI for Chemistry that Meitner had gone to Vienna to visit her relatives, and a few days later the institute had closed for the summer. On 23 August, she wrote to Bosch requesting retirement.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=210}} He tried to ship her belongings to Sweden, but the Reich Ministry of Education insisted they remain in Germany.{{sfn|Sime|1990|pp=215–216}}

Meitner was also concerned about her family in Austria. One of her first actions in Sweden was to apply for a Swedish immigration permit for Gusti and her husband Justinian (Jutz) Frisch.{{sfn|Sime|1990|pp=215–216}} Hahn selected Josef Mattauch to replace her as head of the physics section, and went to Vienna to offer him the job. While there he dined with Meitner&#x27;s sisters Gusti and Gisela and their husbands Jutz Frisch and Karl Lion on 9 November. The next day Gusti informed him that Frisch had been arrested. That day, Meitner arrived in Copenhagen; arranging a travel visa had been difficult with her invalid Austrian passport. Hahn joined her in Copenhagen on 13 November, and had discussions about the uranium research with Meitner, Bohr and Otto Robert Frisch.{{sfn|Sime|1990|pp=226–228}}

==Nuclear fission==
{{Main|Discovery of nuclear fission}}
Hahn and Strassmann isolated the three radium isotopes (verified by their half-lives) and used fractional crystallisation to separate it from its barium carrier by adding barium bromide crystals in four steps. Since radium precipitates preferentially in a solution of barium bromide, at each step the fraction drawn off would contain less radium than the one before. However, they found no difference between each of the fractions. In case their process was faulty in some way, they verified it with known isotopes of radium; the process was fine. On 19 December, Hahn wrote to Meitner, informing her that the radium isotopes behaved chemically like barium. Anxious to finish up before the Christmas break, Hahn and Strassmann submitted their findings to {{lang|de|Naturwissenschaften}} on 22 December without waiting for Meitner to reply.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=233–234}} Hahn concluded the paper with: &quot;As chemists... we should substitute the symbols Ba, La, Ce for Ra, Ac, Th. As &#x27;nuclear chemists&#x27; fairly close to physics we cannot yet bring ourselves to take this step which contradicts all previous experience in physics.&quot;

Frisch normally celebrated Christmas with Meitner in Berlin, but in 1938 she accepted an invitation from Eva von Bahr to spend it with her family at Kungälv, and Meitner asked Frisch to join her there. Meitner received the letter from Hahn describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium. Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium, and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=113–114}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=235–239}} Nonetheless, she had immediately written back to Hahn to say: &quot;At the moment the assumption of such a thoroughgoing breakup seems very difficult to me, but in nuclear physics we have experienced so many surprises, that one cannot unconditionally say: &#x27;It is impossible.&#x27;&quot;{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=235}}

Meitner dismissed the possibility that Hahn&#x27;s identification of barium was in error; her faith in Hahn&#x27;s expertise as a chemist was absolute. Meitner and Frisch then considered how it could be possible. Previous attempts at atom splitting had never had enough energy to chip away more than individual protons or alpha particles, but a barium nucleus was much larger. They considered the liquid-drop model of the nucleus that had been proposed by George Gamow: perhaps it was possible for a drop to become elongated and then divide itself in two.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=115–116}}

Frisch later wrote:{{blockquote|text=At that point we both sat down on a tree trunk (all that discussion had taken place while we walked through the wood in the snow, I with my skis on, Lise Meitner making good her claim that she could walk just as fast without), and started to calculate on scraps of paper. The charge of a uranium nucleus, we found, was indeed large enough to overcome the effect of the surface tension almost completely; so the uranium nucleus might indeed resemble a very wobbly unstable drop, ready to divide itself at the slightest provocation, such as the impact of a single neutron.But there was another problem. After separation, the two drops would be driven apart by their mutual electric repulsion and would acquire high speed and hence a very large energy, about 200 MeV in all; where could that energy come from? Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered the empirical formula for computing the masses of nuclei and worked out that the two nuclei formed by the division of a uranium nucleus together would be lighter than the original uranium nucleus by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein&#x27;s formula &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2, and one-fifth of a proton mass was just equivalent to 200 MeV. So here was the source for that energy; it all fitted!{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=115–116}} }}

Meitner and Frisch had correctly interpreted Hahn&#x27;s results to mean that the nucleus of uranium had split roughly in half. The first two reactions that the Berlin group had observed were light elements created by the breakup of uranium nuclei; the third, the 23-minute one, was a decay into the real element 93.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=243}} On returning to Copenhagen, Frisch informed Bohr, who slapped his forehead and exclaimed &quot;What idiots we have been!&quot;{{sfn|Frisch|1979|p=116}} Bohr promised not to say anything until they had a paper ready for publication. To speed the process, they decided to submit a one-page note to &quot;Nature&quot;. At this point, the only evidence that they had was the barium. Logically, if barium was formed, the other element must be krypton,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=246}} but Hahn had mistakenly believed that the atomic masses had to add up to 239 rather than the atomic numbers adding up to 92, and thought it was masurium (technetium), and so did not check for it:{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=239, 456}}
: {{chem||92|U}} + n → {{chem||56|Ba}} + {{chem||36|Kr}} + some n {{efn|Although Hahn and Strassmann believed that fission had occurred in the uranium-238 isotope, their observations indicate that they actually observed fission in uranium-235.{{sfn|Steinhauser|2016|pp=265–266}} }} 

Over a series of long-distance phone calls, Meitner and Frisch came up with a simple experiment to bolster their claim: to measure the recoil of the fission fragments, using a Geiger counter with the threshold set above that of the alpha particles. Frisch conducted the experiment on 13 January, and found the pulses caused by the reaction just as they had predicted.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=246}} He decided he needed a name for the newly discovered nuclear process. He spoke to William A. Arnold, an American biologist working with George de Hevesy, and asked him what biologists called the process by which living cells divided into two. Arnold told him that biologists called it fission. Frisch then applied that name to the nuclear process in his paper.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=263}} He mailed both papers to &quot;Nature&quot; on 16 January; the jointly-authored note appeared in print on 11 February and Frisch&#x27;s paper on recoil on 18 February.

These three reports, the first Hahn-Strassmann publications of 6 January and 10 February 1939, and the Frisch-Meitner publication of 11 February 1939, had electrifying effects on the scientific community.{{sfn|Stuewer|1985|pages=54–56}} In 1940 Frisch and Rudolf Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which established that an atomic explosion could be generated.{{sfn|Bernstein|2011|pp=441–446}}

==Nobel Prize==
Despite the many honours that Meitner received in her lifetime, she did not receive the Nobel Prize while it was awarded to Otto Hahn for the discovery of nuclear fission. She was nominated 49 times for Physics and Chemistry Nobel Prizes but never won. On 15 November 1945, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that Hahn had been awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for &quot;his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei&quot;.{{efn|The Nobel Committee had decided to defer the 1944 award for one year due to the war.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}} }} Meitner was the one who told Hahn and Strassman to test their radium in more detail, and it was she who told Hahn that it was possible for the nucleus of uranium to disintegrate. Without these contributions of Meitner, Hahn would not have found that the uranium nucleus can split in half.{{sfn|Sime|1989|pp=373–376}}

In 1945 the Nobel Committee for Chemistry in Sweden that selected the Nobel Prize in Chemistry decided to award that prize solely to Hahn, who found out from a newspaper while detained in Farm Hall in England. In the 1990s, the long-sealed records of the Nobel Committee&#x27;s proceedings became public, and the comprehensive biography of Meitner published in 1996 by Ruth Lewin Sime took advantage of this unsealing to reconsider Meitner&#x27;s exclusion.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}} In a 1997 article in the American Physical Society journal &quot;Physics Today&quot;, Sime and her colleagues Elisabeth Crawford and Mark Walker wrote: {{blockquote|It appears that Lise Meitner did not share the 1944 prize because the structure of the Nobel committees was ill-suited to assess interdisciplinary work; because the members of the chemistry committee were unable or unwilling to judge her contribution fairly; and because during the war the Swedish scientists relied on their own limited expertise. Meitner&#x27;s exclusion from the chemistry award may well be summarized as a mixture of disciplinary bias, political obtuseness, ignorance, and haste.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}}}}

Max Perutz, the 1962 Nobel Prize for chemistry winner reached a similar conclusion: {{blockquote|Having been locked up in the Nobel Committee&#x27;s files these fifty years, the documents leading to this unjust award now reveal that the protracted deliberations by the Nobel jury were hampered by lack of appreciation both of the joint work that had preceded the discovery and of Meitner&#x27;s written and verbal contributions after her flight from Berlin.{{sfn|Perutz|2002|p=27}}}}

The five-member physics committee included Manne Siegbahn; his former student Erik Hulthén, the professor of experimental physics at Uppsala University; and Axel Lindh, who eventually succeeded Hulthén. All three were part of the Siegbahn school of X-ray spectroscopy. The poor relationship between Siegbahn and Meitner was a factor here, as was the bias towards experimental rather than theoretical physics.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}} In his report on the work of Meitner and Frisch, Hulthén relied on pre-war papers. He did not think that their work was groundbreaking and argued that the prize for physics was given for experimental rather than theoretical work, which had not been the case for many years.{{sfn|Crawford|Sime|Walker|1997|pp=26–32}} At the time Meitner herself wrote in a letter: &quot;Surely Hahn fully deserved the Nobel Prize for chemistry. There is really no doubt about it. But I believe that Frisch and I contributed something not insignificant to the clarification of the process of uranium fission—how it originates and that it produces so much energy and that was something very remote to Hahn.&quot;{{sfn|Sexl|Hardy|2002|p=119}}{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=327}} Hahn&#x27;s Nobel Prize was long expected; both he and Meitner had been nominated for both the chemistry and the physics prizes several times even before the discovery of nuclear fission. According to the Nobel Prize archive, she was nominated 19 times for Nobel Prize in Chemistry between 1924 and 1948, and 30 times for Nobel Prize in Physics between 1937 and 1967. Her nominators included Arthur Compton, Dirk Coster, Kasimir Fajans, James Franck, Otto Hahn, Oskar Klein, Niels Bohr, Max Planck and Max Born. Despite not having been awarded the Nobel Prize, Meitner was invited to attend the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in 1962.

==Later life==
Meitner found that Siegbahn did not want her. At the time the offer to come to Sweden had been extended, he had said that he had no money, and could only offer Meitner a place to work. Eva von Bahr had then written to Carl Wilhelm Oseen, who had provided money from the Nobel Foundation. This left her with laboratory space, but now she had to perform work that she had been able to delegate to her laboratory technicians for the previous twenty years.{{sfn|Sime|1994|p=697}} Ruth Lewin Sime wrote that: {{blockquote|In Sweden there was no general sympathy for refugees from Nazi Germany: the country was small, with a weak economy and no immigrant tradition, and its academic culture had always been firmly pro-German, a tradition that did not change much until the middle of the war when it became obvious that Germany would not win. During the war, members of Siegbahn&#x27;s group saw Meitner as an outsider, withdrawn and depressed; they did not understand the displacement and anxiety common to all refugees, or the trauma of losing friends and relatives to the Holocaust, or the exceptional isolation of a woman who had single mindedly devoted her life to her work.{{sfn|Sime|1994|p=697}} }}

On 14 January 1939, Meitner learned that her brother-in-law Jutz had been released from Dachau and he and her sister Gusti were permitted to emigrate to Sweden.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=247}} Jutz&#x27;s boss, Gottfried Bermann, had escaped to Sweden,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=247}} and he offered Jutz his old job back at the publishing firm if he was able to come. Niels Bohr interceded with a Swedish official, Justitieråd Alexandersson, who said that Jutz would receive a labour permit on arrival in Sweden. He worked there until he was pensioned off in 1948, and then moved to Cambridge to join Otto Robert Frisch.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=205–207}} Her sister Gisela and brother-in-law Karl Lion moved to England,{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=215}} and Meitner also considered moving there. She visited Cambridge in July 1939 and accepted an offer from William Lawrence Bragg and John Cockcroft of a position at the Cavendish Laboratory on a three-year contract with Girton College, Cambridge, but the Second World War broke out in September 1939 before she could make the move.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=278}}

In Sweden, Meitner continued her research as best she could. She measured the neutron cross sections of thorium, lead and uranium using dysprosium as a neutron detector,{{sfn|Sime|1994|p=697}} an assay technique pioneered by George de Hevesy and Hilde Levi.{{sfn|Frisch|1979|pp=88–90}} She was able to arrange for Hedwig Kohn, who faced deportation to Poland, to come to Sweden, and eventually to emigrate to the United States, travelling via the Soviet Union. She was unsuccessful in bringing Stefen Meyer out of Germany,{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=285–288}} but he managed to survive the war.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=313}} She declined an offer to join Frisch on the British contribution to the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, declaring &quot;I will have nothing to do with a bomb!&quot;{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=305}} She later said that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had come as a surprise to her, and that she was &quot;sorry that the bomb had to be invented&quot;.{{sfn|Dawidoff|1994|p=228}} After the war, Meitner acknowledged her own moral failing in staying in Germany from 1933 to 1938. She wrote: &quot;It was not only stupid but very wrong that I did not leave at once.&quot;{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=310}} She regretted her own inaction during this period, and was also bitterly critical of Hahn, Max von Laue, Werner Heisenberg, and other German scientists. In a June 1945 letter addressed to Hahn, that he never received, she wrote: {{blockquote|You all worked for Nazi Germany. And you did not even try passive resistance. Granted, to absolve your conscience you helped some oppressed person here and there, but millions of innocent human beings were murdered and there was no protest. Here in neutral Sweden, long before the end of the war, there was discussion of what should be done with German scholars once the war is over. What then must the English and Americans be thinking? I and many others are of the opinion that the one path for you would be to deliver an open statement that you are aware that through your passivity you share responsibility for what has happened, and that you have the need to work for what can be done to make amends. But many think it is too late for that. These people say that first you betrayed your friends, then your men and your children in that you let them stake their lives on a criminal war – and finally that you betrayed Germany itself, because when the war was already quite hopeless, you never once spoke out against the meaningless destruction of Germany. That sounds pitiless but nevertheless I believe that the reason I write this to you is true friendship. In the last few days one had heard of the unbelievably gruesome things in the concentration camps; it overwhelms everything one previously feared. When I heard on English radio a very detailed report by the English and Americans about Belsen and Buchenwald, I began to cry out loud and lay awake all night. And if you had seen those people who were brought here from the camps. One should take a man like Heisenberg and millions like him, and force them to look at these camps and the martyred people. The way he turned up in Denmark in 1941 is unforgettable.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=310}} }}

In the aftermath of the bombing of Hiroshima, Meitner became a celebrity. She had a radio interview with Eleanor Roosevelt, and a few days later another one with a radio station in New York, during which she heard her sister Frida&#x27;s voice for the first time in years.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=310}} &quot;I am of Jewish descent&quot;, she told Frida, &quot;I am not Jewish by belief, know nothing of the history of Judaism, and do not feel closer to Jews than to other people.&quot;{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=315–316}} On 25 January 1946, Meitner arrived in New York, where she was greeted by her sisters Lola and Frida, and by Frisch, who had made the two-day train trip from Los Alamos. Lola&#x27;s husband Rudolf Allers arranged a visiting professorship for Meitner at the Catholic University of America. Meitner lectured at Princeton University, Harvard University and Columbia University, and discussed physics with Albert Einstein, Hermann Weyl, Tsung-Dao Lee, Yang Chen-Ning and Isidor Isaac Rabi. She went to Durham, North Carolina and saw Hertha Sponer and Hedwig Kohn, and spent an evening in Washington, DC, with James Chadwick, who was now the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. She also met the project&#x27;s director, Major General Leslie Groves. She spoke at Smith College, and went to Chicago, where she met Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller, Victor Weisskopf and Leo Szilard.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=330–333}} On 8 July, Meitner boarded the {{RMS|Queen Mary||6}} for England, where she met with Erwin Schrödinger, Wolfgang Pauli and Max Born. There were belated celebrations for the 300th birthday of Isaac Newton, but the only German invited to attend was Max Planck.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=334–335}}

For her friends in Sweden, Siegbahn&#x27;s opposition to Meitner&#x27;s Nobel Prize was the final straw, and they resolved to get her a better position. In 1947, Meitner moved to the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, where {{ill|Gudmund Borelius|sv}} established a new facility for atomic research. There had been scant nuclear physics research in Sweden, which was blamed on Siegbahn&#x27;s lack of support for Meitner&#x27;s work, and now such knowledge seemed vital for Sweden&#x27;s future. At the KTH, Meitner had three rooms, two assistants, and access to technicians, with Sigvard Eklund occupying the room next door. The intention was that Meitner would have the salary and title of a &quot;research professor&quot;—one without teaching duties.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=347–348}}

The professorship fell through when the Minister for Education, Tage Erlander, unexpectedly became the Prime Minister of Sweden in 1946, but Borelius and Klein ensured that she had the salary of a professor, if not the title.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=358–361}} In 1949, she became a Swedish citizen, but without surrendering her Austrian citizenship thanks to a special act passed by the Riksdag. Plans were approved for R1, Sweden&#x27;s first nuclear reactor, in 1947, with Eklund as the project director, and Meitner worked with him on its design and construction. In her last scientific papers in 1950 and 1951, she applied magic numbers to nuclear fission.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=358–361}} She retired in 1960 and moved to the UK where many of her relatives were.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Meitner enjoyed visiting Germany and staying with Hahn and his family for several days on different occasions.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=365}} Hahn wrote in his memoirs that he and Meitner had remained lifelong close friends.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=51}} Even though their friendship was full of trials, arguably more so experienced by Meitner, she &quot;never voiced anything but deep affection for Hahn&quot;.{{sfn|Cropper|2004|p=343}} On occasions such as their 70th, 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays, they addressed recollections in each other&#x27;s honour. Hahn emphasised Meitner&#x27;s intellectual productivity, and work such as her research on the nuclear shell model, always passing over the reasons for her move to Sweden as quickly as possible. She emphasised Hahn&#x27;s personal qualities, his charm and musical ability.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=365}}

A strenuous trip to the United States in 1964 led to Meitner having a heart attack, which she spent several months recovering from. Her physical and mental condition was weakened by atherosclerosis. After breaking her hip in a fall and suffering several small strokes in 1967, Meitner made a partial recovery, but was eventually weakened to the point where she had to move into a Cambridge nursing home.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=379}} Meitner died in her sleep on 27 October 1968 at the age of 89. She was not informed of the deaths of Otto Hahn on 28 July 1968 or his wife Edith on 14 August, as her family believed it would be too much for someone so frail. As was her wish, she was buried in the village of Bramley in Hampshire, at St James parish church, close to her younger brother Walter, who had died in 1964.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=380}} Her nephew Frisch composed the inscription on her headstone. It reads:
{{blockquote|Lise Meitner: a physicist who never lost her humanity.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=380}}}}

==Awards and honours==
Meitner was praised by Albert Einstein as the &quot;German Marie Curie&quot;. On her visit to the US in 1946, she received the honour &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; from the National Press Club and had dinner with the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman, at the Women&#x27;s National Press Club.{{sfn|Yruma|2008|pp=161–164}} She received the Leibniz Medal from the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1924, the Lieben Prize from the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1925, the Ellen Richards Prize in 1928, the City of Vienna Prize for science in 1947, Max Planck Medal of the German Physical Society jointly with Hahn in 1949, the inaugural Otto Hahn Prize of the German Chemical Society in 1954,{{sfn|Frisch|1970|p=415}} the Wilhelm Exner Medal in 1960, and in 1967, the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.

The President of Germany, Theodor Heuss, awarded Meitner the highest German order for scientists, the peace class of the Pour le Mérite in 1957, the same year as Hahn.{{sfn|Frisch|1970|p=415}} Meitner became a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1945, and a full member in 1951, permitting her to participate in the Nobel Prize process.{{sfn|Sime|1996|p=359}} Four years later she was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.{{sfn|Frisch|1970|p=405}} She was also elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960. She received honorary doctorates from Adelphi College, the University of Rochester, Rutgers University and Smith College in the United States,{{sfn|Frisch|1970|p=415}} the Free University of Berlin in Germany, and the University of Stockholm in Sweden.{{sfn|Frisch|1970|p=415}}

In September 1966 the United States Atomic Energy Commission jointly awarded the Enrico Fermi Award to Hahn, Strassmann and Meitner for their discovery of fission. The ceremony was held in the Hofburg palace in Vienna. It was the first time that this prize had been awarded to non-Americans, and the first time it was presented to a woman.{{sfn|Hahn|1966|p=183}} Meitner&#x27;s diploma bore the words: &quot;For pioneering research in the naturally occurring radioactivities and extensive experimental studies leading to the discovery of fission&quot;. Hahn&#x27;s diploma was slightly different: &quot;For pioneering research in the naturally occurring radioactivities and extensive experimental studies culminating in the discovery of fission.&quot; Hahn and Strassmann were present, but Meitner was too ill to attend, so Frisch accepted the award on her behalf.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=379–380}} Glenn Seaborg, the discoverer of plutonium, presented it to her in the home of Max Perutz in Cambridge on 23 October 1966.{{sfn|Sime|1996|pp=379–380}}

After her death in 1968, Meitner received many naming honours. In 1997, element 109 was named meitnerium. She is the first and so far the only non-mythological woman thus exclusively honoured (since curium was named after both Marie and Pierre Curie). Additional naming honours are the Hahn–Meitner-Institut in Berlin, craters on the Moon and Venus, and the main-belt asteroid 6999 Meitner. In 2000, the European Physical Society established the biennial Lise Meitner Prize for excellent research in nuclear science. In 2006 the &quot;Gothenburg Lise Meitner Award&quot; was established by the University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden; it is awarded annually to a scientist who has made a breakthrough in physics. In October 2010, the building at the Free University of Berlin that had once housed the KWI for Chemistry, and had been known as the Otto Hahn Building since 1956, was renamed the Hahn-Meitner Building, and in July 2014 a statue of Meitner was unveiled in the garden of the Humboldt University of Berlin next to similar statues of Hermann von Helmholtz and Max Planck.

Schools and streets were named after her in many cities in Austria and Germany, and a short residential street in Bramley, her resting place, is named Meitner Close. Since 2008 the Austrian Physical Society and the German Physical Society have organized the Lise Meitner Lectures, a series of annual public talks given by distinguished female physicists, and since 2015 the AlbaNova University Centre in Stockholm has had an annual Lise Meitner Distinguished Lecture. In 2016, the Institute of Physics in the UK established the Meitner Medal for public engagement within physics. In 2017, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy in the United States named a major nuclear energy research program after her. On 6 November 2020, a satellite named after her (ÑuSat 16 or &quot;Lise&quot;, COSPAR 2020-079H) was launched. The International Atomic Energy Agency named its library in her honour and established a programme to &quot;provide early- and mid‑career women professionals with opportunities to participate in a multi-week visiting professional programme and advance their technical and soft skills&quot;.

<text>The llama (; or ) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the pre-Columbian era.

Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin. Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5–8 miles). The name &quot;llama&quot; (also historically spelled &quot;lama&quot; or &quot;glama&quot;) was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.

The ancestors of llamas are thought to have originated on the Great Plains of North America about 40 million years ago and subsequently migrated to South America about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago), camelids were extinct in North America. As of 2007, there were over seven million llamas and alpacas in South America. Some were imported to the United States and Canada late in the 20th century; their descendants now number more than 158,000 llamas and 100,000 alpacas.

In Aymara mythology, llamas are important beings. The Heavenly Llama is said to drink water from the ocean and urinates as it rains. According to Aymara eschatology, llamas will return to the water springs and ponds where they come from at the end of time.

== Classification ==

Lamoids, or llamas (as they are more generally known as a group), consist of the vicuña (&quot;Lama vicugna&quot;), guanaco (&quot;Lama guanicoe&quot;), Suri alpaca, and Huacaya alpaca (&quot;Lama pacos&quot;), and the domestic llama (&quot;Lama glama&quot;). Guanacos and vicuñas live in the wild, while llamas and alpacas exist only as domesticated animals. Although early writers compared llamas to sheep, their similarity to the camel was soon recognized. They were included in the genus &quot;Camelus&quot; along with alpaca in the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1758) of Carl Linnaeus. They were, however, separated by Georges Cuvier in 1800 under the name of &quot;lama&quot; along with the guanaco. DNA analysis has confirmed that the guanaco is the wild ancestor of the llama, while the vicuña is the wild ancestor of the alpaca.

The genus &quot;Lama&quot; is, with the two species of true camels, the sole existing representatives of a very distinct section of the Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) called Tylopoda, or &quot;bump-footed&quot;, from the peculiar bumps on the soles of their feet. The Tylopoda consists of a single family, the Camelidae, and shares the order Artiodactyla with the Suina (pigs), the Tragulina (chevrotains), the Pecora (ruminants), and the Whippomorpha (hippos and cetaceans, which belong to Artiodactyla from a cladistic, if not traditional, standpoint). The Tylopoda have more or less affinity to each of the sister taxa, standing in some respects in a middle position between them, sharing some characteristics from each, but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxa.

The 19th-century discoveries of a vast and previously unexpected extinct Paleogene fauna of North America, as interpreted by paleontologists Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope, and Othniel Charles Marsh, aided understanding of the early history of this family. Llamas were not always confined to South America; abundant llama-like remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in the Rocky Mountains and in Central America. Some of the fossil llamas were much larger than current forms. Some species remained in North America during the last ice ages. North American llamas are categorized as an extinct genus, &quot;Hemiauchenia&quot;. Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000 years ago in modern-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri, and Florida.

The camelid lineage has a good fossil record. Camel-like animals have been traced back through early Miocene forms from the thoroughly differentiated, modern species. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls. No fossils of these earlier forms have been found in the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of camelids and that the ancestors of Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge from North America. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part of the Great American Interchange, where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American camelids died out at the end of the Pleistocene.

== Characteristics ==
A full-grown llama can reach a height of at the top of the head and can weigh between . At maturity, males can weigh 94.74 kg, while females can weigh 102.27 kg. At birth, a baby llama (called a &quot;cria&quot;) can weigh between . Llamas typically live for 15 to 25 years, with some individuals surviving 30 years or more.

The following characteristics apply especially to llamas. Dentition of adults: incisors canines , premolars , molars ; total 32. In the upper jaw, a compressed, sharp, pointed laniariform incisor near the hinder edge of the premaxilla is followed in the male at least by a moderate-sized, pointed, curved true canine in the anterior part of the maxilla. The isolated canine-like premolar that follows in the camels is not present. The teeth of the molar series, which are in contact with each other, consist of two very small premolars (the first almost rudimentary) and three broad molars, generally constructed like those of &quot;Camelus&quot;. In the lower jaw, the three incisors are long, spatulate, and procumbent; the outer ones are the smallest. Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous series of one premolar and three molars, which differ from those of &quot;Camelus&quot; in having a small accessory column at the anterior outer edge.
The skull generally resembles that of &quot;Camelus&quot;, with a larger brain cavity and orbits and less-developed cranial ridges due to its smaller size. The nasal bones are shorter and broader and are joined by the premaxilla.

Vertebrae:
* cervical 7,
* dorsal 12,
* lumbar 7,
* sacral 4,
* caudal 15 to 20.

The ears are rather long and slightly curved inward, characteristically known as &quot;banana&quot; shaped. There is no dorsal hump. The feet are narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having a distinct plantar pad. The tail is short, and the fiber is long, woolly, and soft.

In essential structural characteristics, as well as in general appearance and habits, all the animals of this genus very closely resemble each other, so whether they should be considered as belonging to one, two, or more species is a matter of controversy among naturalists.

The question is complicated by the circumstances of most individuals who have come under observation, either in a completely or partially domesticated state. Many are also descended from ancestors previously domesticated, a state that tends to produce a certain amount of variation from the original type. The four forms commonly distinguished by the inhabitants of South America are recognized as distinct species, though there are difficulties in defining their distinctive characteristics.

These are:
* the llama, &quot;Lama glama&quot; (Linnaeus);
* the alpaca, &quot;Lama pacos&quot; (Linnaeus);
* the guanaco (from the Quechua &quot;huanaco&quot;), &quot;Lama guanicoe&quot; (Müller); and
* the vicuña, &quot;Lama vicugna&quot; (Molina)

The llama and alpaca are only known in the domestic state and are variable in size and of many colors, often white, brown, or piebald. Some are grey or black. The guanaco and vicuña are wild. The guanaco is endangered; it has a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below.

The guanaco and vicuña certainly differ: The vicuña is more petite, more slender in its proportions, and has a shorter head than the guanaco.

The vicuña lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, in the southern part of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia. Its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid.

Vicuña fiber is extremely delicate and soft and highly valued for weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is small.
Alpacas are primarily descended from wild vicuña ancestors. In contrast, domesticated llamas are descended primarily from wild guanaco ancestors, although a considerable amount of hybridization between the two species has occurred.

Differential characteristics between llamas and alpacas include the llama&#x27;s larger size, longer head, and curved ears. Alpaca fiber is generally more expensive but not always more valuable. Alpacas tend to have a more consistent color throughout the body. The most apparent visual difference between llamas and camels is that camels have a humps and llamas do not.

Llamas are not ruminants, pseudo-ruminants, or modified ruminants. They do have a complex three-compartment stomach that allows them to digest lower quality, high cellulose foods. The stomach compartments allow for fermentation of tricky foodstuffs, followed by regurgitation and re-chewing. Ruminants (cows, sheep, goats) have &quot;four&quot; compartments, whereas llamas have only three stomach compartments: the rumen, omasum, and abomasum.

In addition, the llama (and other camelids) have an extremely long and complex large intestine (colon). The large intestine&#x27;s role in digestion is to reabsorb water, vitamins, and electrolytes from food waste passing through it. The length of the llama&#x27;s colon allows it to survive on much less water than other animals. This is a major advantage in arid climates where they live.

== Reproduction ==
Llamas have an unusual reproductive cycle for a large animal. Female llamas are induced ovulators. Through mating, the female releases an egg and is often fertilized on the first attempt. Female llamas do not go into estrus (&quot;heat&quot;).

Like humans, llama males and females mature sexually at different rates. Females reach puberty at about 12 months old; males do not become sexually mature until around three years of age.

=== Mating ===
Llamas mate in a kush (lying down) position, similar to big cats and canines, which is unusual in a large animal. They mate for an extended time (20–45 minutes), also unusual in a large animal.

=== Gestation ===
The gestation period of a llama is 11.5 months (350 days). Dams (female llamas) do not lick off their babies, as they have an attached tongue that does not reach outside of the mouth more than . Rather, they will nuzzle and hum to their newborns.

=== Crias ===
A cria (from Spanish for &quot;baby&quot;) is the name for a baby llama, alpaca, vicuña, or guanaco. Crias are typically born with all the herd&#x27;s females gathering to protect against the male llamas and potential predators. Llamas give birth standing. Birth is usually quick and problem-free, over in less than 30 minutes. Most births occur between 8 am and noon, during the warmer daylight hours. This may increase cria survival by reducing fatalities due to hypothermia during cold Andean nights. This birthing pattern is considered a continuation of the birthing patterns observed in the wild. Their crias are up and standing, walking, and attempting to suckle within the first hour after birth. Crias are partially fed with llama milk that is lower in fat and salt and higher in phosphorus and calcium than cow or goat milk. A female llama will only produce about of milk at a time when she gives milk, so the cria must frequently suckle to receive the nutrients it requires.

=== Breeding methods ===
In harem mating, the male is left with females most of the year.

For field mating, a female is turned into a field with a male llama and left there for some time. This is the easiest method in terms of labor but the least useful in predicting a likely birth date. An ultrasound test can be performed, and together with the exposure dates, a better idea of when the cria is expected can be determined.

Hand mating is the most efficient method, but it requires the most work on the part of the human involved. A male and female llama are put into the same pen, and mating is monitored. They are then separated and re-mated every other day until one refuses the mating. Usually, one can get in two matings using this method, though some stud males routinely refuse to mate a female more than once. The separation presumably helps to keep the sperm count high for each mating and also helps to keep the condition of the female llama&#x27;s reproductive tract more sound. If the mating is unsuccessful within two to three weeks, the female is mated again.

== Nutrition ==

Options for feeding llamas are quite wide; various commercial and farm-based feeds are available. The major determining factors include feed cost, availability, nutrient balance and energy density required. Young, actively growing llamas require a greater concentration of nutrients than mature animals because of their smaller digestive tract capacities.

== Behavior ==

Llamas that are well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning are very friendly and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious, and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become extremely difficult to handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.

Llamas are now utilized as certified therapy animals in nursing homes and hospitals. Rojo the Llama, located in the Pacific Northwest was certified in 2008. The Mayo Clinic says animal-assisted therapy can reduce pain, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. This type of therapy is growing in popularity, and several organizations throughout the United States participate.
When correctly reared, llamas spitting at a human is a rare thing. Llamas are very social herd animals, however, and sometimes spit at each other to discipline lower-ranked llamas. A llama&#x27;s social rank in a herd is never static. They can always move up or down the social ladder by picking small fights. This is usually done between males to see which will become dominant. Their fights are visually dramatic, characterized by spitting, ramming each other with their chests, neck wrestling, and kicking, mainly to knock the other off balance. The females are usually only seen spitting to control other herd members. One may determine how agitated the llama is by the materials in the spit. The more irritated the llama is, the further back into each of the three stomach compartments it will try to draw materials from for its spit.

While the social structure might constantly change, they live as a family and care for each other. If one notices a strange noise or feels threatened, an alarm call - a loud, shrill sound that rhythmically rises and falls - is sent out, and all others become alert. They will often hum to each other as a form of communication.

The llama&#x27;s groaning noises or going &quot;mwa&quot; (/mwaʰ/) is often a sign of fear or anger. Unhappy or agitated llamas will lay their ears back, while ears being perked upwards is a sign of happiness or curiosity.

An &quot;orgle&quot; is the mating sound of a llama or alpaca, made by the sexually aroused male. The sound is reminiscent of gargling but with a more forceful, buzzing edge. Males begin the sound when they become aroused and continue throughout copulation.

=== Guard behavior ===
Using llamas as livestock guards in North America began in the early 1980s, and some sheep producers have used llamas successfully since then. Some would even use them to guard their smaller cousins, the alpaca. They are used most commonly in the western regions of the United States, where larger predators, such as coyotes and feral dogs, are prevalent. Typically, a single gelding (castrated male) is used.

Research suggests using multiple guard llamas is not as effective as one. Multiple males tend to bond with one another rather than with the livestock and may ignore the flock. A gelded male of two years of age bonds closely with its new charges and is instinctively very effective in preventing predation. Some llamas bond more quickly to sheep or goats if introduced just before lambing. Many sheep and goat producers indicate a special bond quickly develops between lambs and their guard llama, and the llama is particularly protective of the lambs.

Using llamas as guards has reduced the losses to predators for many producers. The value of the livestock saved each year exceeds a llama&#x27;s purchase cost and annual maintenance. Although not every llama is suited to the job, most are a viable, nonlethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no training and little care.

== Fiber ==
Llamas have a fine undercoat, which can be used for handicrafts and garments. The coarser outer guard hair is used for rugs, wall hangings, and lead ropes. The fiber comes in many colors, ranging from white or grey to reddish-brown, brown, dark brown, and black.


== Medical uses ==
Doctors and researchers have determined that llamas possess antibodies that are well-suited to treat certain diseases. Scientists have been studying the way llamas might contribute to the fight against coronaviruses, including MERS and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19).

== History of domestication==

=== Pre-Incan cultures ===
Scholar Alex Chepstow-Lusty has argued that the switch from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to widespread agriculture was only possible because of the use of llama dung as fertilizer.

The Moche people frequently placed llamas and their parts in the burials of important people as offerings or provisions for the afterlife. The Moche of pre-Columbian Peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics.

=== Inca Empire ===
In the Inca Empire, llamas were the only beasts of burden, and many of the people dominated by the Inca had long traditions of llama herding. For the Inca nobility, the llama was symbolic, and llama figures were often buried with the dead.
In South America, llamas are still used as beasts of burden, as well as for the production of fiber and meat.

The Inca deity Urcuchillay was depicted in the form of a multicolored llama.

Carl Troll has argued that the large numbers of llamas found in the southern Peruvian highlands were an essential factor in the rise of the Inca Empire. It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the most significant distribution of alpacas and llamas in Pre-Hispanic America. The link between the Andean biomes of puna and páramo, llama pastoralism and the Inca state is a matter of research.

=== Spanish Empire ===

One of the main uses for llamas at the time of the Spanish conquest was to bring down ore from the mines in the mountains. Gregory de Bolivar estimated that in his day, as many as 300,000 were employed in the transport of produce from the Potosí mines alone, but since the introduction of horses, mules, and donkeys, the importance of the llama as a beast of burden has greatly diminished.

According to Juan Ignacio Molina, the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of hueques (possibly a llama type) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plow animals in 1614.

In Chile hueque, populations declined towards extinction in the 16th and 17th century being replaced by European livestock. The causes of its extinction are not clear. However, it is known that the introduction of sheep caused some competition among both domestic species. Anecdotal evidence of the mid-17th century shows that both species coexisted and suggests that there were many more sheep than hueques. The decline of hueques reached a point in the late 18th century when only the Mapuche from Mariquina and Huequén next to Angol raised the animal.
=== United States ===

Llamas were first imported into the US in the late 1800s as zoo exhibits. Restrictions on importation of livestock from South America due to hoof and mouth disease, combined with lack of commercial interest, resulted in the number of llamas staying low until the late 20th century. In the 1970s, interest in llamas as livestock began to grow, and the number of llamas increased as farmers bred and produced an increasing number of animals. Both the price and number of llamas in the US climbed rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. With little market for llama fiber or meat in the US and the value of guard llamas limited, the primary value in llamas was in breeding more animals, a classic sign of a speculative bubble in agriculture. By 2002, there were almost 145,000 llamas in the US, according to the US Department of Agriculture, and animals sold for as much as $220,000. However, the lack of any end market for the animals resulted in a crash in both llama prices and the number of llamas; the Great Recession further dried up investment capital, and the number of llamas in the US began to decline as fewer animals were bred and older animals died of old age. By 2017, the number of llamas in the US had dropped below 40,000. A similar speculative bubble was experienced with the closely related alpaca, which burst shortly after the llama bubble.

==Culture==
Being an important animal and long-standing cultural icon in South America, Llamas gained in recent history cultural prominence in Western culture.

For example, the videogame company Maxis has used Llamas extensively as elements in their games, particularly in the widely popular game series The Sims, Llamas being the national symbol of the country the broader series of Sim games are set in. The online video game Fortnite uses piñata llamas as loot containers, which contain various in-game resources. Also the programming language Perl with its so-called Llama book has been associated with Llamas. Game developer Jeff Minter also named his company Llamasoft in honor of the animal.

In &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove,&quot; a 2000 animated Disney film, an Incan emperor gets turned into a llama.

<text>In film editing, an L cut is a variant of a split edit technique in which the audio from the preceding scene overlaps the picture from the following scene, so that the audio cuts after the picture, and continues playing over the beginning of the next scene.

The name of the cut refers to the shape of audio and video pieces of the second of two scenes cut together when it was done on analog film. This creates a shape similar to the letter &quot;L&quot; on the timeline, with the main body representing the video from the previous clip and the foot of the &quot;L&quot; representing the continuing audio. The L-Cut frequently appears in interviews, documentaries, and dialogue-heavy video scenes.

<doc id="18077" wikidata="Q8096" url="?curid=18077" title="Lexicon">
<text>A lexicon (plural: lexicons, rarely lexica) is the vocabulary of a language or branch of knowledge (such as nautical or medical). In linguistics, a lexicon is a language&#x27;s inventory of lexemes. The word &quot;lexicon&quot; derives from Greek word (), neuter of () meaning &#x27;of or for words&#x27;.

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language&#x27;s words (its wordstock); and a grammar, a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include bound morphemes, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most affixes). In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions, collocations and other phrasemes are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries are lists of the lexicon, in alphabetical order, of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, lexemes are grouped into lemmas. A lemma is a group of lexemes generated by inflectional morphology. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords that list the citation forms and any irregular forms, since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. Closed categories, such as determiners or pronouns, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily syntactic. Open categories, such as nouns and verbs, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more semantic in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
A central role of the lexicon is documenting established &quot;lexical norms and conventions&quot;. Lexicalization is the process by which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a doublet, are often close semantically. Two examples are &quot;&quot; versus &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; versus &quot;&quot;.

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:
* Innovation, the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as &quot;slang&quot;, &quot;branding&quot;.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* Compounding (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* Abbreviation of compounds.
* Acronyms, the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as and .
* Inflection, a morphology change with a category, such as a number or tense.
* Derivation, a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* Agglutination, the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
Neologisms are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language&#x27;s lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake. Other common sources are slang and advertising.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the source language material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):
* Guestword (in German: &quot;Gastwort&quot;): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: &quot;Fremdwort&quot;): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: &quot;Lehnwort&quot;): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:
* Phono-semantic matching (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves generative devices that combine morphemes according to a language&#x27;s rules. For example, the suffix &quot;-able&quot; is usually only added to transitive verbs, as in &quot;readable&quot; but not &quot;cryable&quot;.

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through analogy, common sense and, most commonly, context. Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually, only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound. Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically.

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolution of languages and takes a diachronic view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through a parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to shape the lexicon, making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.
* Phonological assimilation, the modification of loanwords to fit a new language&#x27;s sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too &quot;foreign&quot;, inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* Analogy, where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* Emphasis, the modification of words&#x27; stress or accent.
* Metaphor, a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
The term &quot;lexicon&quot; is generally used in the context of a single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants (Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese, for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a &quot;&quot; (British English) as well as an or in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/concept relationship; lexical access and lexical access failure; how a word&#x27;s phonology, syntax, and meaning intersect; the morphology-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use (pragmatics); language acquisition; the history and evolution of words (etymology); and the relationships between words, often studied within philosophy of language.

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics and computational linguistics.

<text>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by that of his younger contemporary Michelangelo.

Born out of wedlock to a successful notary and a lower-class woman in, or near, Vinci, he was educated in Florence by the Italian painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. He began his career in the city, but then spent much time in the service of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. Later, he worked in Florence and Milan again, as well as briefly in Rome, all while attracting a large following of imitators and students. Upon the invitation of Francis I, he spent his last three years in France, where he died in 1519. Since his death, there has not been a time where his achievements, diverse interests, personal life, and empirical thinking have failed to incite interest and admiration, making him a frequent namesake and subject in culture.

Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history of Western art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance. Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major works – including numerous unfinished works – he created some of the most influential paintings in the Western canon. The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; is his best known work and is the world&#x27;s most famous individual painting. &quot;The Last Supper&quot; is the most reproduced religious painting of all time and his &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; drawing is also regarded as a cultural icon. In 2017, &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot;, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo, was sold at auction for , setting a new record for the most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.

Revered for his technological ingenuity, he conceptualised flying machines, a type of armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, a ratio machine that could be used in an adding machine, and the double hull. Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance. Some of his smaller inventions, however, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire. He made substantial discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, hydrodynamics, geology, optics, and tribology, but he did not publish his findings and they had little to no direct influence on subsequent science.
== Biography ==
=== Early life (1452–1472) ===
==== Birth and background ====

Leonardo da Vinci, properly named Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (&quot;Leonardo, son of ser Piero from Vinci&quot;), was born on 15 April 1452 in, or close to, the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, 20 miles from Florence. He was born out of wedlock to Piero da Vinci (Ser Piero da Vinci d&#x27;Antonio di ser Piero di ser Guido; 1426–1504), a Florentine legal notary, and Caterina di Meo Lippi (), from the lower class. It remains uncertain where Leonardo was born; the traditional account, from a local oral tradition recorded by the historian Emanuele Repetti, is that he was born in Anchiano, a country hamlet that would have offered sufficient privacy for the illegitimate birth, though it is still possible he was born in a house in Florence that Ser Piero almost certainly had. Leonardo&#x27;s parents both married separately the year after his birth. Caterina – who later appears in Leonardo&#x27;s notes as only &quot;Caterina&quot; or &quot;Catelina&quot; – is usually identified as the Caterina Buti del Vacca, who married the local artisan Antonio di Piero Buti del Vacca, nicknamed . Having been betrothed to her the previous year, Ser Piero married Albiera Amadori and after her death in 1464, went on to have three subsequent marriages. From all the marriages, Leonardo eventually had 16 half-siblings (of whom 11 survived infancy) who were much younger than he (the last was born when Leonardo was 46 years old) and with whom he had very little contact.
Very little is known about Leonardo&#x27;s childhood and much is shrouded in myth, partially because of his biography in the frequently apocryphal &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot; (1550) by 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari. Tax records indicate that by at least 1457 he lived in the household of his paternal grandfather, Antonio da Vinci, but it is possible that he spent the years before then in the care of his mother in Vinci, either Anchiano or Campo Zeppi in the parish of San Pantaleone. He is thought to have been close to his uncle, Francesco da Vinci, but his father was probably in Florence most of the time. Ser Piero, who was the descendant of a long line of notaries, established an official residence in Florence by at least 1469 and had a successful career. Despite his family history, Leonardo only received a basic and informal education in (vernacular) writing, reading, and mathematics; possibly because his artistic talents were recognised early, so his family decided to focus their attention there.

Later in life, Leonardo recorded his earliest memory, now in the Codex Atlanticus. While writing on the flight of birds, he recalled as an infant when a kite came to his cradle and opened his mouth with its tail; commentators still debate whether the anecdote was an actual memory or a fantasy.

==== Verrocchio&#x27;s workshop ====
In the mid-1460s, Leonardo&#x27;s family moved to Florence, which at the time was the centre of Christian Humanist thought and culture. Around the age of 14, he became a &quot;garzone&quot; (studio boy) in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, who was the leading Florentine painter and sculptor of his time. This was about the time of the death of Verrocchio&#x27;s master, the great sculptor Donatello. Leonardo became an apprentice by the age of 17 and remained in training for seven years. Other famous painters apprenticed in the workshop or associated with it include Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli, and Lorenzo di Credi. Leonardo was exposed to both theoretical training and a wide range of technical skills, including drafting, chemistry, metallurgy, metal working, plaster casting, leather working, mechanics, and woodwork, as well as the artistic skills of drawing, painting, sculpting, and modelling.

Leonardo was a contemporary of Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino, who were all slightly older than he was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio or at the Platonic Academy of the Medici. Florence was ornamented by the works of artists such as Donatello&#x27;s contemporaries Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot;, gleaming with gold leaf, displayed the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, and was the first painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Leon Battista Alberti&#x27;s treatise &quot;De pictura&quot; were to have a profound effect on younger artists and in particular on Leonardo&#x27;s own observations and artworks.

Much of the painting in Verrocchio&#x27;s workshop was done by his assistants. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his &quot;The Baptism of Christ&quot; (), painting the young angel holding Jesus&#x27;s robe with skill so far superior to his master&#x27;s that Verrocchio purportedly put down his brush and never painted again (the latter claim probably being apocryphal). The new technique of oil paint was applied to areas of the mostly tempera work, including the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream, and much of Jesus&#x27;s figure, indicating Leonardo&#x27;s hand. Additionally, Leonardo may have been a model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of &quot;David&quot; in the Bargello and the archangel Raphael in &quot;Tobias and the Angel&quot;.

Vasari tells a story of Leonardo as a very young man: a local peasant made himself a round buckler shield and requested that Ser Piero have it painted for him. Leonardo, inspired by the story of Medusa, responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that his father bought a different shield to give to the peasant and sold Leonardo&#x27;s to a Florentine art dealer for 100 ducats, who in turn sold it to the Duke of Milan.

=== First Florentine period (1472 – c. 1482) ===

By 1472, at the age of 20, Leonardo qualified as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate and live with him. Leonardo&#x27;s earliest known dated work is a 1473 pen-and-ink drawing of the Arno valley (see below). According to Vasari, the young Leonardo was the first to suggest making the Arno river a navigable channel between Florence and Pisa.

In January 1478, Leonardo received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of Saint Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio, an indication of his independence from Verrocchio&#x27;s studio. An anonymous early biographer, known as Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and often worked in the garden of the Piazza San Marco, Florence, where a Neoplatonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers organised by the Medici met. In March 1481, he received a commission from the monks of San Donato in Scopeto for &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot;. Neither of these initial commissions were completed, being abandoned when Leonardo went to offer his services to Duke of Milan Ludovico Sforza. Leonardo wrote Sforza a letter which described the diverse things that he could achieve in the fields of engineering and weapon design, and mentioned that he could paint. He brought with him a silver string instrument – either a lute or lyre – in the form of a horse&#x27;s head.

With Alberti, Leonardo visited the home of the Medici and through them came to know the older Humanist philosophers of whom Marsiglio Ficino, proponent of Neoplatonism; Cristoforo Landino, writer of commentaries on Classical writings, and John Argyropoulos, teacher of Greek and translator of Aristotle were the foremost. Also associated with the Platonic Academy of the Medici was Leonardo&#x27;s contemporary, the brilliant young poet and philosopher Pico della Mirandola. In 1482, Leonardo was sent as an ambassador by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici to Ludovico il Moro, who ruled Milan between 1479 and 1499.

=== First Milanese period (c. 1482–1499) ===

Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot; for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and &quot;The Last Supper&quot; for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary (on behalf of Sforza) to meet king Matthias Corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a Madonna. In 1490 he was called as a consultant, together with Francesco di Giorgio Martini, for the building site of the cathedral of Pavia and was struck by the equestrian statue of Regisole, of which he left a sketch. Leonardo was employed on many other projects for Sforza, such as preparation of floats and pageants for special occasions; a drawing of, and wooden model for, a competition to design the cupola for Milan Cathedral; and a model for a huge equestrian monument to Ludovico&#x27;s predecessor Francesco Sforza. This would have surpassed in size the only two large equestrian statues of the Renaissance, Donatello&#x27;s &quot;Gattamelata&quot; in Padua and Verrocchio&#x27;s &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot; in Venice, and became known as the &quot;Gran Cavallo&quot;. Leonardo completed a model for the horse and made detailed plans for its casting, but in November 1494, Ludovico gave the metal to his brother-in-law to be used for a cannon to defend the city from Charles VIII of France.

Contemporary correspondence records that Leonardo and his assistants were commissioned by the Duke of Milan to paint the Sala delle Asse in the Sforza Castle, 1498. The project became a trompe-l&#x27;œil decoration that made the great hall appear to be a pergola created by the interwoven limbs of sixteen mulberry trees, whose canopy included an intricate labyrinth of leaves and knots on the ceiling.

=== Second Florentine period (1500–1508) ===
When Ludovico Sforza was overthrown by France in 1500, Leonardo fled Milan for Venice, accompanied by his assistant Salaì and friend, the mathematician Luca Pacioli. In Venice, Leonardo was employed as a military architect and engineer, devising methods to defend the city from naval attack. On his return to Florence in 1500, he and his household were guests of the Servite monks at the monastery of Santissima Annunziata and were provided with a workshop where, according to Vasari, Leonardo created the cartoon of &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist&quot;, a work that won such admiration that &quot;men [and] women, young and old&quot; flocked to see it &quot;as if they were going to a solemn festival.&quot;

In Cesena in 1502, Leonardo entered the service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a military architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron. Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia&#x27;s stronghold, a town plan of Imola in order to win his patronage. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.

Leonardo had left Borgia&#x27;s service and returned to Florence by early 1503, where he rejoined the Guild of Saint Luke on 18 October of that year. By this same month, Leonardo had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the model for the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, which he would continue working on until his twilight years. In January 1504, he was part of a committee formed to recommend where Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of &quot;David&quot; should be placed. He then spent two years in Florence designing and painting a mural of &quot;The Battle of Anghiari&quot; for the Signoria, with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, &quot;The Battle of Cascina&quot;.

In 1506, Leonardo was summoned to Milan by Charles II d&#x27;Amboise, the acting French governor of the city. There, Leonardo took on another pupil, Count Francesco Melzi, the son of a Lombard aristocrat, who is considered to have been his favourite student. The Council of Florence wished Leonardo to return promptly to finish &quot;The Battle of Anghiari&quot;, but he was given leave at the behest of Louis XII, who considered commissioning the artist to make some portraits. Leonardo may have commenced a project for an equestrian figure of d&#x27;Amboise; a wax model attributed to him survives and would be the only extant example of Leonardo&#x27;s sculpture, but the attribution is not widely accepted. Leonardo was otherwise free to pursue his scientific interests. Many of Leonardo&#x27;s most prominent pupils either knew or worked with him in Milan, including Bernardino Luini, Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, and Marco d&#x27;Oggiono. In 1507, Leonardo was in Florence sorting out a dispute with his brothers over the estate of his father, who had died in 1504.

=== Second Milanese period (1508–1513) ===
By 1508, Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.

In 1512, Leonardo was working on plans for an equestrian monument for Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, but this was prevented by an invasion of a confederation of Swiss, Spanish and Venetian forces, which drove the French from Milan. Leonardo stayed in the city, spending several months in 1513 at the Medici&#x27;s Vaprio d&#x27;Adda villa.

=== Rome and France (1513–1519) ===

In March 1513, Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s son Giovanni assumed the papacy (as Leo X); Leonardo went to Rome that September, where he was received by the pope&#x27;s brother Giuliano. From September 1513 to 1516, Leonardo spent much of his time living in the Belvedere Courtyard in the Apostolic Palace, where Michelangelo and Raphael were both active. Leonardo was given an allowance of 33 ducats a month and, according to Vasari, decorated a lizard with scales dipped in quicksilver. The pope gave him a painting commission of unknown subject matter, but cancelled it when the artist set about developing a new kind of varnish. Leonardo became ill, in what may have been the first of multiple strokes leading to his death. He practised botany in the Vatican Gardens, and was commissioned to make plans for the Pope&#x27;s proposed draining of the Pontine Marshes. He also dissected cadavers, making notes for a treatise on vocal cords; these he gave to an official in hopes of regaining the Pope&#x27;s favour, but he was unsuccessful.

In October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan. On 21 March 1516 Antonio Maria Pallavicini, the French ambassador to the Holy See, received a letter sent from Lyon a week previously by the royal advisor Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet, containing the French king&#x27;s instructions to assist Leonardo in his relocation to France and to inform the artist that the King was eagerly awaiting his arrival. Pallavicini was also asked to reassure Leonardo that he would be well received at court, both by the King and by his mother, Louise of Savoy. Leonardo entered Francis&#x27;s service later that year, and was given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé near the King&#x27;s residence at the royal Château d&#x27;Amboise. He was frequently visited by Francis, and drew plans for an immense castle town the King intended to erect at Romorantin. He also made a mechanical lion, which during a pageant walked towards the King and – upon being struck by a wand – opened its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies.

Leonardo was accompanied during this time by his friend and apprentice Francesco Melzi, and was supported by a pension totalling 10,000 scudi. At some point, Melzi drew a portrait of Leonardo; the only others known from his lifetime were a sketch by an unknown assistant on the back of one of Leonardo&#x27;s studies () and a drawing by Giovanni Ambrogio Figino depicting an elderly Leonardo with his right arm wrapped in clothing. The latter, in addition to the record of an October 1517 visit by Louis d&#x27;Aragon, confirms an account of Leonardo&#x27;s right hand being paralytic when he was 65, which may indicate why he left works such as the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; unfinished. He continued to work at some capacity until eventually becoming ill and bedridden for several months.

==== Death ====

Leonardo died at Clos Lucé on 2 May 1519 at the age of 67, possibly of a stroke. Francis I had become a close friend. Vasari describes Leonardo as lamenting on his deathbed, full of repentance, that &quot;he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done.&quot; Vasari states that in his last days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament. Vasari also records that the King held Leonardo&#x27;s head in his arms as he died, although this story may be legend rather than fact. In accordance with his will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed Leonardo&#x27;s casket. Melzi was the principal heir and executor, receiving, as well as money, Leonardo&#x27;s paintings, tools, library and personal effects. Leonardo&#x27;s other long-time pupil and companion, Salaì, and his servant Baptista de Vilanis, each received half of Leonardo&#x27;s vineyards. His brothers received land, and his serving woman received a fur-lined cloak. On 12 August 1519, Leonardo&#x27;s remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the Château d&#x27;Amboise.

Some 20 years after Leonardo&#x27;s death, Francis was reported by the goldsmith and sculptor Benvenuto Cellini as saying: &quot;There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture and architecture, as that he was a very great philosopher.&quot;

Salaì, or Il Salaino (&quot;The Little Unclean One&quot;, i.e., the devil), entered Leonardo&#x27;s household in 1490 as an assistant. After only a year, Leonardo made a list of his misdemeanours, calling him &quot;a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton,&quot; after he had made off with money and valuables on at least five occasions and spent a fortune on clothes. Nevertheless, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo&#x27;s household for the next thirty years. Salaì executed a number of paintings under the name of Andrea Salaì, but although Vasari claims that Leonardo &quot;taught him many things about painting,&quot; his work is generally considered to be of less artistic merit than others among Leonardo&#x27;s pupils, such as Marco d&#x27;Oggiono and Boltraffio.

At the time of his death in 1524, Salaì owned a painting referred to as &quot;Joconda&quot; in a posthumous inventory of his belongings; it was assessed at 505 lire, an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.

== Personal life ==


Despite the thousands of pages Leonardo left in notebooks and manuscripts, he scarcely made reference to his personal life.

Within Leonardo&#x27;s lifetime, his extraordinary powers of invention, his &quot;great physical beauty&quot; and &quot;infinite grace,&quot; as described by Vasari, as well as all other aspects of his life, attracted the curiosity of others. One such aspect was his love for animals, likely including vegetarianism and according to Vasari, a habit of purchasing caged birds and releasing them.

Leonardo had many friends who are now notable either in their fields or for their historical significance, including mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book &quot;Divina proportione&quot; in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella that appears to have been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.

Beyond friendship, Leonardo kept his private life secret. His sexuality has been the subject of satire, analysis, and speculation. This trend began in the mid-16th century and was revived in the 19th and 20th centuries, most notably by Sigmund Freud in his &quot;Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood&quot;. Leonardo&#x27;s most intimate relationships were perhaps with his pupils Salaì and Melzi. Melzi, writing to inform Leonardo&#x27;s brothers of his death, described Leonardo&#x27;s feelings for his pupils as both loving and passionate. It has been claimed since the 16th century that these relationships were of a sexual or erotic nature. Walter Isaacson in his biography of Leonardo makes explicit his opinion that the relations with Salaì were intimate and homosexual.

Earlier in Leonardo&#x27;s life, court records of 1476, when he was aged twenty-four, show that Leonardo and three other young men were charged with sodomy in an incident involving a known male prostitute. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, and there is speculation that since one of the accused, Lionardo de Tornabuoni, was related to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, the family exerted its influence to secure the dismissal. Since that date much has been written about his presumed homosexuality and its role in his art, particularly in the androgyny and eroticism manifested in &quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot; and &quot;Bacchus&quot; and more explicitly in a number of erotic drawings. 

== Paintings ==

Despite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter. A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces. These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. By the 1490s Leonardo had already been described as a &quot;Divine&quot; painter.

Among the qualities that make Leonardo&#x27;s work unique are his innovative techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, the &quot;Last Supper&quot;, and the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;.

=== Early works ===

Leonardo first gained attention for his work on the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;, painted in conjunction with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio&#x27;s workshop, both of which are Annunciations. One is small, long and high. It is a &quot;predella&quot; to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, long. In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.

In the smaller painting, Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised submission to God&#x27;s will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity&#x27;s role in God&#x27;s incarnation.

=== Paintings of the 1480s ===
In the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was of ground-breaking importance in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.

One of these paintings was &quot;Saint Jerome in the Wilderness&quot;, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo&#x27;s life, as evidenced in his diary: &quot;I thought I was learning to live; I was only learning to die.&quot; Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to the outer edge of the painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo&#x27;s anatomical studies. Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.

The daring display of figure composition, the landscape elements and personal drama also appear in the great unfinished masterpiece, the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;, a commission from the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto. It is a complex composition, of about Leonardo did numerous drawings and preparatory studies, including a detailed one in linear perspective of the ruined classical architecture that forms part of the background. In 1482 Leonardo went to Milan at the behest of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici in order to win favour with Ludovico il Moro, and the painting was abandoned.


The third important work of this period is the &quot;Virgin of the Rocks&quot;, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, to be done with the assistance of the de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. While the painting is quite large, about , it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of San Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.

Leonardo&#x27;s most remarkable portrait of this period is the &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot;, presumed to be Cecilia Gallerani (), lover of Ludovico Sforza. The painting is characterised by the pose of the figure with the head turned at a very different angle to the torso, unusual at a date when many portraits were still rigidly in profile. The ermine plainly carries symbolic meaning, relating either to the sitter, or to Ludovico who belonged to the prestigious Order of the Ermine.
=== Paintings of the 1490s ===
Leonardo&#x27;s most famous painting of the 1490s is &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the moment when Jesus has just said &quot;one of you will betray me&quot;, and the consternation that this statement caused.

The writer Matteo Bandello observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.

The painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation, but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as &quot;completely ruined.&quot; Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking. Despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in various mediums.

Toward the end of this period, in 1498 Leonardo&#x27;s trompe-l&#x27;œil decoration of the Sala delle Asse was painted for the Duke of Milan in the Castello Sforzesco.

=== Paintings of the 1500s ===
In 1505, Leonardo was commissioned to paint &quot;The Battle of Anghiari&quot; in the Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Leonardo devised a dynamic composition depicting four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440. Michelangelo was assigned the opposite wall to depict the Battle of Cascina. Leonardo&#x27;s painting deteriorated rapidly and is now known from a copy by Rubens.
Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; or &quot;La Gioconda&quot;, the laughing one. In the present era, it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests, in particular, on the elusive smile on the woman&#x27;s face, its mysterious quality perhaps due to the subtly shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes such that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined. The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called &quot;sfumato&quot;, or Leonardo&#x27;s smoke. Vasari wrote that the smile was &quot;so pleasing that it seems more divine than human, and it was considered a wondrous thing that it was as lively as the smile of the living original.&quot;

Other characteristics of the painting are the unadorned dress, in which the eyes and hands have no competition from other details; the dramatic landscape background, in which the world seems to be in a state of flux; the subdued colouring; and the extremely smooth nature of the painterly technique, employing oils laid on much like tempera, and blended on the surface so that the brushstrokes are indistinguishable. Vasari expressed that the painting&#x27;s quality would make even &quot;the most confident master ... despair and lose heart.&quot; The perfect state of preservation and the fact that there is no sign of repair or overpainting is rare in a panel painting of this date.

In the painting &quot;Virgin and Child with Saint Anne&quot;, the composition again picks up the theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as &quot;breathtakingly beautiful&quot; and harkens back to the &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual is that there are two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, Saint Anne. She leans forward to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.

== Drawings ==

Leonardo was a prolific draughtsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot;, &quot;The Virgin of the Rocks&quot; and &quot;The Last Supper&quot;. His earliest dated drawing is a &quot;Landscape of the Arno Valley&quot;, 1473, which shows the river, the mountains, Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail.

Among his famous drawings are the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, a study of the proportions of the human body; the &quot;Head of an Angel&quot;, for &quot;The Virgin of the Rocks&quot; in the Louvre; a botanical study of &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;; and a large drawing (160×100 cm) in black chalk on coloured paper of &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist&quot; in the National Gallery, London. This drawing employs the subtle &quot;sfumato&quot; technique of shading, in the manner of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;. It is thought that Leonardo never made a painting from it, the closest similarity being to &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne&quot; in the Louvre.

Other drawings of interest include numerous studies generally referred to as &quot;caricatures&quot; because, although exaggerated, they appear to be based upon observation of live models. Vasari relates that Leonardo would look for interesting faces in public to use as models for some of his work. There are numerous studies of beautiful young men, often associated with Salaì, with the rare and much admired facial feature, the so-called &quot;Grecian profile&quot;. These faces are often contrasted with that of a warrior. Salaì is often depicted in fancy-dress costume. Leonardo is known to have designed sets for pageants with which these may be associated. Other, often meticulous, drawings show studies of drapery. A marked development in Leonardo&#x27;s ability to draw drapery occurred in his early works. Another often-reproduced drawing is a macabre sketch that was done by Leonardo in Florence in 1479 showing the body of Bernardo Baroncelli, hanged in connection with the murder of Giuliano, brother of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, in the Pazzi conspiracy. In his notes, Leonardo recorded the colours of the robes that Baroncelli was wearing when he died.

Like the two contemporary architects Donato Bramante (who designed the Belvedere Courtyard) and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, Leonardo experimented with designs for centrally planned churches, a number of which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.

== Journals and notes ==

Renaissance humanism recognised no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo&#x27;s studies in science and engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo&#x27;s life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him. Leonardo&#x27;s notes and drawings display an enormous range of interests and preoccupations, some as mundane as lists of groceries and people who owed him money and some as intriguing as designs for wings and shoes for walking on water. There are compositions for paintings, studies of details and drapery, studies of faces and emotions, of animals, babies, dissections, plant studies, rock formations, whirlpools, war machines, flying machines and architecture.
These notebooks – originally loose papers of different types and sizes – were largely entrusted to Leonardo&#x27;s pupil and heir Francesco Melzi after the master&#x27;s death. These were to be published, a task of overwhelming difficulty because of its scope and Leonardo&#x27;s idiosyncratic writing. Some of Leonardo&#x27;s drawings were copied by an anonymous Milanese artist for a planned treatise on art . After Melzi&#x27;s death in 1570, the collection passed to his son, the lawyer Orazio, who initially took little interest in the journals. In 1587, a Melzi household tutor named Lelio Gavardi took 13 of the manuscripts to Pisa; there, the architect Giovanni Magenta reproached Gavardi for having taken the manuscripts illicitly and returned them to Orazio. Having many more such works in his possession, Orazio gifted the volumes to Magenta. News spread of these lost works of Leonardo&#x27;s, and Orazio retrieved seven of the 13 manuscripts, which he then gave to Pompeo Leoni for publication in two volumes; one of these was the Codex Atlanticus. The other six works had been distributed to a few others. After Orazio&#x27;s death, his heirs sold the rest of Leonardo&#x27;s possessions, and thus began their dispersal.

Some works have found their way into major collections such as the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, the Louvre, the , the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, which holds the 12-volume Codex Atlanticus, and the British Library in London, which has put a selection from the Codex Arundel (BL Arundel MS 263) online. Works have also been at Holkham Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in the private hands of John Nicholas Brown I and Robert Lehman. The Codex Leicester is the only privately owned major scientific work of Leonardo; it is owned by Bill Gates and displayed once a year in different cities around the world.

Most of Leonardo&#x27;s writings are in mirror-image cursive. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left. Leonardo used a variety of shorthand and symbols, and states in his notes that he intended to prepare them for publication. In many cases a single topic is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet, together conveying information that would not be lost if the pages were published out of order. Why they were not published during Leonardo&#x27;s lifetime is unknown.

== Science and inventions ==

Leonardo&#x27;s approach to science was observational: he tried to understand a phenomenon by describing and depicting it in utmost detail and did not emphasise experiments or theoretical explanation. Since he lacked formal education in Latin and mathematics, contemporary scholars mostly ignored Leonardo the scientist, although he did teach himself Latin. His keen observations in many areas were noted, such as when he wrote &quot;Il sole non si move.&quot; (&quot;The Sun does not move.&quot;)

In the 1490s he studied mathematics under Luca Pacioli and prepared a series of drawings of regular solids in a skeletal form to be engraved as plates for Pacioli&#x27;s book &quot;Divina proportione&quot;, published in 1509. While living in Milan, he studied light from the summit of Monte Rosa. Scientific writings in his notebook on fossils have been considered as influential on early palaeontology.

The content of his journals suggest that he was planning a series of treatises on a variety of subjects. A coherent treatise on anatomy is said to have been observed during a visit by Cardinal Louis d&#x27;Aragon&#x27;s secretary in 1517. Aspects of his work on the studies of anatomy, light and the landscape were assembled for publication by Melzi and eventually published as &quot;A Treatise on Painting&quot; in France and Italy in 1651 and Germany in 1724, with engravings based upon drawings by the Classical painter Nicolas Poussin. According to Arasse, the treatise, which in France went into 62 editions in fifty years, caused Leonardo to be seen as &quot;the precursor of French academic thought on art.&quot;

While Leonardo&#x27;s experimentation followed scientific methods, a recent and exhaustive analysis of Leonardo as a scientist by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from Galileo, Newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a &quot;Renaissance Man&quot;, his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.

=== Anatomy and physiology ===
Leonardo started his study in the anatomy of the human body under the apprenticeship of Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of &quot;topographic anatomy&quot;, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.

As a successful artist, Leonardo was given permission to dissect human corpses at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and later at hospitals in Milan and Rome. From 1510 to 1511 he collaborated in his studies with the doctor Marcantonio della Torre, professor of Anatomy at the University of Pavia. Leonardo made over 240 detailed drawings and wrote about 13,000 words toward a treatise on anatomy. Only a small amount of the material on anatomy was published in Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on painting&quot;. During the time that Melzi was ordering the material into chapters for publication, they were examined by a number of anatomists and artists, including Vasari, Cellini and Albrecht Dürer, who made a number of drawings from them.

Leonardo&#x27;s anatomical drawings include many studies of the human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it in a manner that prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus &quot;in utero&quot;. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.

Leonardo also closely observed and recorded the effects of age and of human emotion on the physiology, studying in particular the effects of rage. He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made a number of studies of horses.

Leonardo&#x27;s dissections and documentation of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped to describe the physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of &#x27;emotions&#x27; and their expression. He found it difficult to incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns.

=== Engineering and inventions ===
During his lifetime, Leonardo was also valued as an engineer. With the same rational and analytical approach that moved him to represent the human body and to investigate anatomy, Leonardo studied and designed many machines and devices. He drew their &quot;anatomy&quot; with unparalleled mastery, producing the first form of the modern technical drawing, including a perfected &quot;exploded view&quot; technique, to represent internal components. Those studies and projects collected in his codices fill more than 5,000 pages. In a letter of 1482 to the lord of Milan Ludovico il Moro, he wrote that he could create all sorts of machines both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled from Milan to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. In 1502, he created a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. He continued to contemplate the canalisation of Lombardy&#x27;s plains while in Louis XII&#x27;s company and of the Loire and its tributaries in the company of Francis I. Leonardo&#x27;s journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.

Leonardo was fascinated by the phenomenon of flight for much of his life, producing many studies, including &quot;Codex on the Flight of Birds&quot; (), as well as plans for several flying machines, such as a flapping ornithopter and a machine with a helical rotor. In a 2003 documentary by British television station Channel Four, titled &quot;Leonardo&#x27;s Dream Machines&quot;, various designs by Leonardo, such as a parachute and a giant crossbow, were interpreted and constructed. Some of those designs proved successful, whilst others fared less well when tested. Similarly, a team of engineers built ten machines designed by Leonardo in the 2009 American television series &quot;Doing DaVinci&quot;, including a fighting vehicle and a self-propelled cart.

Research performed by Marc van den Broek revealed older prototypes for more than 100 inventions that are ascribed to Leonardo. Similarities between Leonardo&#x27;s illustrations and drawings from the Middle Ages and from Ancient Greece and Rome, the Chinese and Persian Empires, and Egypt suggest that a large portion of Leonardo&#x27;s inventions had been conceived before his lifetime. Leonardo&#x27;s innovation was to combine different functions from existing drafts and set them into scenes that illustrated their utility. By reconstituting technical inventions he created something new.

In his notebooks, Leonardo first stated the &#x27;laws&#x27; of sliding friction in 1493. His inspiration for investigating friction came about in part from his study of perpetual motion, which he correctly concluded was not possible. His results were never published and the friction laws were not rediscovered until 1699 by Guillaume Amontons, with whose name they are now usually associated. For this contribution, Leonardo was named as the first of the 23 &quot;Men of Tribology&quot; by Duncan Dowson.

== Legacy ==

Although he had no formal academic training, many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the &quot;Universal Genius&quot; or &quot;Renaissance Man&quot;, an individual of &quot;unquenchable curiosity&quot; and &quot;feverishly inventive imagination.&quot; He is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history, and &quot;his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote.&quot; Scholars interpret his view of the world as being based in logic, though the empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.

Leonardo&#x27;s fame within his own lifetime was such that the King of France carried him away like a trophy, and was claimed to have supported him in his old age and held him in his arms as he died. Interest in Leonardo and his work has never diminished. Crowds still queue to see his best-known artworks, T-shirts still bear his most famous drawing, and writers continue to hail him as a genius while speculating about his private life, as well as about what one so intelligent actually believed in.

The continued admiration that Leonardo commanded from painters, critics and historians is reflected in many other written tributes. Baldassare Castiglione, author of &quot;Il Cortegiano&quot; (&quot;The Courtier&quot;), wrote in 1528: &quot;...Another of the greatest painters in this world looks down on this art in which he is unequalled...&quot; while the biographer known as &quot;Anonimo Gaddiano&quot; wrote, : &quot;His genius was so rare and universal that it can be said that nature worked a miracle on his behalf...&quot; Vasari, in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot; (1568), opens his chapter on Leonardo:

In the normal course of events many men and women are born with remarkable talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by Heaven with beauty, grace and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human skill. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty, who displayed infinite grace in everything that he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.

The 19th century brought a particular admiration for Leonardo&#x27;s genius, causing Henry Fuseli to write in 1801: &quot;Such was the dawn of modern art, when Leonardo da Vinci broke forth with a splendour that distanced former excellence: made up of all the elements that constitute the essence of genius...&quot; This is echoed by A. E. Rio who wrote in 1861: &quot;He towered above all other artists through the strength and the nobility of his talents.&quot;

By the 19th century, the scope of Leonardo&#x27;s notebooks was known, as well as his paintings. Hippolyte Taine wrote in 1866: &quot;There may not be in the world an example of another genius so universal, so incapable of fulfilment, so full of yearning for the infinite, so naturally refined, so far ahead of his own century and the following centuries.&quot;

Art historian Bernard Berenson wrote in 1896: 

The interest in Leonardo&#x27;s genius has continued unabated; experts study and translate his writings, analyse his paintings using scientific techniques, argue over attributions and search for works which have been recorded but never found. Liana Bortolon, writing in 1967, said: The Elmer Belt Library of Vinciana is a special collection at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Twenty-first-century author Walter Isaacson based much of his biography of Leonardo on thousands of notebook entries, studying the personal notes, sketches, budget notations, and musings of the man whom he considers the greatest of innovators. Isaacson was surprised to discover a &quot;fun, joyous&quot; side of Leonardo in addition to his limitless curiosity and creative genius.

On the 500th anniversary of Leonardo&#x27;s death, the Louvre in Paris arranged for the largest ever single exhibit of his work, called &quot;Leonardo&quot;, between November 2019 and February 2020. The exhibit includes over 100 paintings, drawings and notebooks. Eleven of the paintings that Leonardo completed in his lifetime were included. Five of these are owned by the Louvre, but the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; was not included because it is in such great demand among general visitors to the Louvre; it remains on display in its gallery. &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, however, is on display following a legal battle with its owner, the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia in Venice. &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; was also not included because its Saudi owner did not agree to lease the work.

The &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, considered Leonardo&#x27;s magnum opus, is often regarded as the most famous portrait ever made. &quot;The Last Supper&quot; is the most reproduced religious painting of all time, and Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; drawing is also considered a cultural icon.

More than a decade of analysis of Leonardo&#x27;s genetic genealogy, conducted by Alessandro Vezzosi and Agnese Sabato, came to a conclusion in mid-2021. It was determined that the artist has 14 living male relatives. The work could also help determine the authenticity of remains thought to belong to Leonardo.

== Location of remains ==
While Leonardo was certainly buried in the collegiate church of Saint Florentin at the Château d&#x27;Amboise in 12 August 1519, the current location of his remains is unclear. Much of Château d&#x27;Amboise was damaged during the French Revolution, leading to the church&#x27;s demolition in 1802. Some of the graves were destroyed in the process, scattering the bones interred there and thereby leaving the whereabouts of Leonardo&#x27;s remains subject to dispute; a gardener may have even buried some in the corner of the courtyard.

In 1863, fine-arts inspector general Arsène Houssaye received an imperial commission to excavate the site and discovered a partially complete skeleton with a bronze ring on one finger, white hair, and stone fragments bearing the inscriptions &quot;EO&quot;, &quot;AR&quot;, &quot;DUS&quot;, and &quot;VINC&quot; interpreted as forming &quot;Leonardus Vinci&quot;. The skull&#x27;s eight teeth correspond to someone of approximately the appropriate age, and a silver shield found near the bones depicts a beardless Francis I, corresponding to the king&#x27;s appearance during Leonardo&#x27;s time in France.

Houssaye postulated that the unusually large skull was an indicator of Leonardo&#x27;s intelligence; author Charles Nicholl describes this as a &quot;dubious phrenological deduction&quot;. At the same time, Houssaye noted some issues with his observations, including that the feet were turned toward the high altar, a practice generally reserved for laymen, and that the skeleton of seemed too short. Art historian Mary Margaret Heaton wrote in 1874 that the height would be appropriate for Leonardo. The skull was allegedly presented to Napoleon III before being returned to the Château d&#x27;Amboise, where they were in the chapel of Saint Hubert in 1874. A plaque above the tomb states that its contents are only presumed to be those of Leonardo.

It has since been theorised that the folding of the skeleton&#x27;s right arm over the head may correspond to the paralysis of Leonardo&#x27;s right hand. In 2016, it was announced that DNA tests would be conducted to determine whether the attribution is correct. The DNA of the remains will be compared to that of samples collected from Leonardo&#x27;s work and his half-brother Domenico&#x27;s descendants; it may also be sequenced.

In 2019, documents were published revealing that Houssaye had kept the ring and a lock of hair. In 1925, his great-grandson sold these to an American collector. Sixty years later, another American acquired them, leading to their being displayed at the Leonardo Museum in Vinci beginning on 2 May 2019, the 500th anniversary of the artist&#x27;s death.
