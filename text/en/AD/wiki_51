<text>Kabaddi (, ) is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players. It is one of the traditional games of South Asia. In this game, a raider enters the opposing half to tag defenders and return within 30 seconds while avoiding tackles. Points are awarded for successful tags, while defenders earn points for stopping the raider. Tagged or tackled players are temporarily out but can re-enter when their team scores. Raids alternate between teams throughout the game.

It is popular in India, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the history of India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh. It is the second most popular and viewed sport in India after cricket. It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.

There are two major disciplines: &quot;Punjabi kabaddi&quot;, also called &quot;circle style&quot;, comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, and the &quot;standard style&quot;, on a rectangular court indoors, is played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.

This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: &quot;kabaddi &quot;or &quot;chedugudu&quot; in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; &quot;kabaddi&quot; in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; &quot;kabaddi&quot;, &quot;komonti&quot; or &quot;ha-du-du&quot; in West Bengal and Bangladesh; &quot;baibalaa&quot; in Maldives, &quot;kauddi&quot; or &quot;kabaddi&quot; in the Punjab region; &quot;hu-tu-tu&quot; in Western India, &quot;ha-do-do&quot; in Eastern India; &quot;chadakudu&quot; in South India; &quot;kapardi&quot; in Nepal; &quot;kabadi&quot; or &quot;sadugudu&quot; in Tamil Nadu; and &quot;chakgudu&quot; in Sri Lanka.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The raider is required to execute each raid on a single breath; in order to prove that they are not inhaling, they are required to repeatedly chant the word &quot;kabaddi&quot;, in a process referred to as a cant. The term kabaddi is from a Tamil word composed of &quot;Kai&quot; and &quot;Pidi&quot;, meaning &quot;hand catch&quot;.

=== Ancient era ===

Ronojoy Sen speculates in his book &quot;Nation At Play&quot; that kabaddi originated during the Vedic period (between 1500 BC and 500 BC). There are accounts of Gautama Buddha and Lord Krishna having played an ancient form of the sport.

According to the sport&#x27;s origins, kabaddi is a sport developed centered on Jallikattu. A player going to the opposition is treated like a bull. It is like taming a bull without touching it, as it is mentioned in Sangam Literature that the game called Sadugudu was practised since ages.

There are also accounts of kabaddi having been played in Iran 2,000 years ago.

=== Modern era ===

Modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various forms under different names in the Indian subcontinent. India has been first credited with having helped to popularize kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi. These developments helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally been played on muddy surfaces in villages, for legitimate international competition.

The first framework of rules for the sport was prepared in Maharashtra in the 1920s, with English sports serving as a model for this formalisation. One of the earliest modern tournaments of the sport, the All India Kabaddi Tournament in 1923, was played according to these amended rules. After being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, kabaddi was added to the Asian Games programme beginning in 1990.

The advent of the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) in 2014 revolutionised the standard style of the sport, with various rule changes being made; for example, whereas previously raids had no time limit other than the breathing capacity of the raider, the PKL rules introduced the concept of a standard 30-second time limit for every raid.

==Variations==
===Standard style===

In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of in the case of men and in the case of women. Each has five supplementary players held in reserve for substitution. The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half time break in which the teams exchange sides. During each play, known as a &quot;raid&quot;, a player from the attacking side, known as the &quot;raider&quot;, runs into the opposing team&#x27;s side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible. The raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team&#x27;s territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled. (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn&#x27;t yet reached the baulk line, they do not need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.) While raiding, the raider must loudly chant &quot;kabaddi&quot;, confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling. Each raid has a 30-second time limit.

A point is scored for each defender tagged; tags can be made with any part of the raider&#x27;s body and touching any part of the defender&#x27;s body. If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team&#x27;s territory when there are six or more players, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point (the bonus point is only scored if the raider&#x27;s trailing foot is in the air while they step over the line). If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead. All players tagged or tackled are taken out of the game, but one is &quot;revived&quot; for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle. However, bonus points do not revive players. In addition, players who step out of the boundary are out. However, the boundary of the field can vary mid-raid; there are two strips on either side of the court known as &quot;lobby areas&quot; which only become part of the field of play in raids where the raider touches an opponent.

A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an &quot;empty raid&quot;. By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a &quot;super raid&quot;. If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out (&quot;All Out&quot;), they earn two additional points and then all the opposition players are placed back in the game.

In the event of a tie, PKL rules stipulate (for playoff matches) that each team is to perform five raids on the other team, with no time limits involved, no players being dismissed or revived, and the baulk line being simultaneously treated as a bonus line.

===Styles of Indian kabaddi===

There are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by some amateur federation.
*In Sanjeevani Kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out. The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent&#x27;s side scores four extra points.
*In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent&#x27;s side secures a point. The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration.
*Punjabi kabaddi is a variation that is played on a circular pitch of a diameter of .

=== Beach kabaddi ===
The Beach kabaddi variant is played in two 15-minute halves by two teams of four players who are not allowed to wear shoes and is played on levelled ground of sand either on seas shore or river banks. It is played at an international level in competitions such as the Asian Beach Games.

=== Indoor kabaddi ===
The Indoor kabaddi variant is played in two 15-minute halves by two teams of five players and is a shorter variant of standard style kabaddi. It is played at an international level in competitions such as the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games.

The Pro Kabaddi League was established in 2014. The league modeled its business upon that of the Indian Premier League of Twenty20 cricket, with a large focus on marketing, the backing of local broadcaster Star Sports. The Pro Kabaddi League quickly became a ratings success on Indian television; the 2014 season was watched by at least 435 million viewers over the course of the season, and the inaugural championship match was seen by 98.6 million viewers.

Bengal Warriors, Bengaluru Bulls, Patna Pirates, Tamil Thalaivas, UP Yoddhas, Gujrat Giants, Haryana Steelers, Puneri Paltan, U Mumba, Jaipur Pink Panthers, Dabang Delhi KC, and Telugu Titans are the 12 teams that play in the Pro Kabaddi League.

The organisers of the Pro Kabaddi League change the sport&#x27;s rules and its presentation to make it more suitable for a television audience. All players in the league must be strictly under 85 kg in weight. When the raider scores 10 or more raid points in a single match, it is called a super 10, and they earn an extra point. If the defender successfully manages to tackle the five raiders in a single game, it is a high 5, and the team will be awarded one extra point.

Additional rules are used in the Pro Kabaddi League to encourage scoring: when a defensive side has three or fewer players remaining, tackles are worth two points instead of one. Furthermore, if a team performs two empty raids in a row, the next raider must score a point (&quot;do-or-die raid&quot;), or else they will be declared out and the opposing team will score a point.

Each edition is contested over several rounds, with teams eliminated in each round, and the Summit Round acting as the playoffs of the tournament and leading to the final.

<doc id="16928" wikidata="Q630974" url="?curid=16928" title="Kerameikos">
<text>Kerameikos (, ) also known by its Latinized form Ceramicus, is an area of Athens, Greece, located to the northwest of the Acropolis, which includes an extensive area both within and outside the ancient city walls, on both sides of the Dipylon Gate and by the banks of the Eridanos River. It was the potters&#x27; quarter of the city, from which the English word &quot;ceramic&quot; is derived, and was also the site of an important cemetery and numerous funerary sculptures erected along the Sacred Way, a road from Athens to Eleusis.

== History and description ==

The area took its name from the city square or dēmos (δῆμος) of the Kerameis (Κεραμεῖς, potters), which in turn derived its name from the word κέραμος (&quot;kéramos&quot;, &quot;pottery clay&quot;, from which the English word &quot;ceramic&quot; is derived). The &quot;Inner Kerameikos&quot; was the former &quot;potters&#x27; quarter&quot; within the city and &quot;Outer Kerameikos&quot; covers the cemetery and also the &quot;Dēmósion Sēma&quot; (δημόσιον σῆμα, public graveyard) just outside the city walls, where Pericles delivered his funeral oration in 431 BC. The cemetery was also where the Ηiera Hodos (the Sacred Way, i.e. the road to Eleusis) began, along which the procession moved for the Eleusinian Mysteries. The quarter was located there because of the abundance of clay mud carried over by the Eridanos River.

The area has undergone a number of archaeological excavations in recent years, though the excavated area covers only a small portion of the ancient &quot;dēmos&quot;. It was originally an area of marshland along the banks of the Eridanos river which was used as a cemetery as long ago as the 3rd millennium BC. It became the site of an organised cemetery from about 1200 BC; numerous cist graves and burial offerings from the period have been discovered by archaeologists. Houses were constructed on the higher drier ground to the south. During the Archaic period increasingly large and complex grave mounds and monuments were built along the south bank of the Eridanos, lining the Sacred Way.
The building of the new city wall in 478 BC, following the Persian sack of Athens in 480 BC, fundamentally changed the appearance of the area. At the suggestion of Themistocles, all of the funerary sculptures were built into the city wall and two large city gates facing north-west were erected in the Kerameikos. The Sacred Way ran through the Sacred Gate, on the southern side, to Eleusis. On the northern side a wide road, the Dromos, ran through the double-arched Dipylon Gate (also known as the Thriasian Gate) and on to the Platonic Academy a few miles away. State graves were built on either side of the Dipylon Gate, for the interment of prominent personages such as notable warriors and statesmen, including Pericles and Cleisthenes.
After the construction of the city wall, the Sacred Way and a forking street known as the Street of the Tombs again became lined with imposing sepulchral monuments belonging to the families of rich Athenians, dating to before the late 4th century BC. The construction of such lavish mausolea was banned by decree in 317 BC, following which only small columns or inscribed square marble blocks were permitted as grave stones. The Roman occupation of Athens led to a resurgence of monument-building, although little is left of them today.
During the Classical period an important public building, the Pompeion, stood inside the walls in the area between the two gates. This served a key function in the procession (&quot;pompē&quot;, πομπή) in honour of Athena during the Panathenaic Festival. It consisted of a large courtyard surrounded by columns and banquet rooms, where the nobility of Athens would eat the sacrificial meat for the festival. According to ancient Greek sources, a hecatomb (a sacrifice of 100 cows) was carried out for the festival and the people received the meat in the Kerameikos, possibly in the Dipylon courtyard; excavators have found heaps of bones in front of the city wall.
The Pompeion and many other buildings in the vicinity of the Sacred Gate were razed to the ground by the marauding army of the Roman dictator Sulla, during his sacking of Athens in 86 BC; an episode that Plutarch described as a bloodbath. During the 2nd century AD, a storehouse was constructed on the site of the Pompeion, but it was destroyed during the invasion of the Heruli in 267 AD. The ruins became the site of potters&#x27; workshops until about 500 AD, when two parallel colonnades were built behind the city gates, overrunning the old city walls. A new Festival Gate was constructed to the east with three entrances leading into the city. This was in turn destroyed in raids by the invading Avars and Slavs at the end of the 6th century, and the Kerameikos fell into obscurity. It was not rediscovered until a Greek worker dug up a stele in April 1863.

== Archaeology ==

Archaeological excavations in the Kerameikos began in 1870 under the auspices of the Greek Archaeological Society. They have continued from 1913 to the present day under the German Archaeological Institute at Athens.
Latest findings in the Kerameikos include the excavation of a 2.1 m tall Kouros, unearthed by the German Archaeological Institute at Athens under the direction of Professor Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier. This Kouros is the larger twin of the one now kept in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and both were made by the same anonymous sculptor called the Dipylon Master.

During the construction of Kerameikos metro station for the expanded Athens Metro, a plague pit and approximately 1,000 tombs from the 4th and 5th centuries BC were discovered. In 1992, Greek archaeologist Efi Baziatopoulou-Valavani excavated these sites. The plague pit is located in the northwestern corner of the cemetery and is 6.5 meters long and 1.6 meters deep, containing 89 individuals&#x27; remains. The remains found belonged to adult males and females, as well as eight children. Many consider this pit to contain victims from the Plague of Athens, which was prevalent from 430 to 428 BC, followed by a recurrence from 427 to 426 BC.

Pottery found within the grave was used to date the burial to between 430 and 426 BC based on the styles common during that time. The burial is considered to be related to the Athenian plague not only because of the dating of the burial, but also because of the nature of the burial. The chaos caused by the Plague of Athens, as described by Thucydides, matches with the disordered nature of the pit. The pit is further thought to be a state burial, conducted for victims whose families could not afford proper burials.

Bodies were found in five successive layers within the pit, with more care shown on the bottom levels and increasingly little care shown as the burial continued upwards. Bodies were thrown in haphazardly, their positions dictated by the shape of the pit. There was soil placed between the bodies only on the lower levels, and most of the offerings were also found on the lower levels of the burial. The eight children’s bodies were found on the upper-most level, and were covered with large shards of pottery.

Offerings for the dead consisted of roughly 30 small vases. Examples of the ceramics found within the pit include choes, a pelike, and numerous lekythoi. All of these pieces are common in quality and use. The excavator, Baziatopoulou, further remarks that the offerings are surprisingly few considering the number of dead buried within the pit. She then notes that this is especially true when taking into account the probable loss of one or more upper levels from prior intrusions into the burial, which would have brought the total persons buried up to approximately 150. The offerings found were scattered on the lower levels of the pit, suggesting diminishing care as the burial continued upwards.

The eight children found buried within the pit are an exception to the pattern of diminishing care as the burial progressed. Found on the upper levels, these children were not thrown in the pit haphazardly but were instead placed with care and covered with shards of pottery. These are the only ceramics found in the pit that are outside of the lower levels, and this caused Biazatopoulou to comment that the children “seem to have been treated with special care.” Notably, one of the children’s faces was reconstructed by professor Manolis Papagrigorakis and the child is now known as Myrtis.

The skeletal remains found within the pit were submitted to Greek orthodontics professor Manolis Papagrigorakis for examination. Upon analyzing dental pulp from the remains, he concluded that three subjects contained the bacterium &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; serovar typhi, which results in typhoid fever. The pathogen responsible for the Athenian plague is much disputed, and this DNA evidence has caused scholars to view typhoid fever as a likely culprit. These are the only remains in connection with the Athenian plague to be analyzed.

Large areas adjacent to those already excavated remain in to be explored, as they lie under the fabric of modern-day Athens. Expropriation of these areas has been delayed until funding is secured.

==Museum==
The area is enclosed and visitable through an entrance on the last block of Ermou Street, close to the intersection with Peiraios Street. The Kerameikos Museum is housed there, in a small neoclassical building that houses the most extensive collection of burial-related artifacts in Greece, varying from large-scale marble sculpture to funerary urns, stelae, jewelry, toys etc. The original burial monument sculptures are displayed within the museum, having been replaced by plaster replicas &quot;in situ&quot;.

The museum incorporates inner and outer courtyards, where the larger sculptures are kept. Down the hill from the museum, visitors can wander among the Outer Kerameikos ruins, the Demosion Sema, the banks of the Eridanos where some water still flows, the remains of the Pompeion and the Dipylon Gate, and walk the first blocks of the Sacred Way towards Eleusis and of the Panathenaic Way towards the Acropolis. The bulk of the area lies about 7–10 meters below modern street level, having in the past been inundated by centuries&#x27; worth of sediment accumulation from the floods of the Eridanos.

== Metro station ==

As of spring 2007, Kerameikos is the name given to the metro station which belongs to Line 3 of the Athens Metro, adjacent to the Technopolis of Gazi.

<text>The Kamov Ka-25 (NATO reporting name &quot;Hormone&quot;) is a naval helicopter, developed for the Soviet Navy in the USSR from 1958.

==Design and development==

In the late 1950s there was an urgent demand for anti-submarine helicopters for deployment on new ships equipped with helicopter platforms entering service with the Soviet Navy. Kamov&#x27;s compact design was chosen for production in 1958. To speed the development of the new anti-submarine helicopter Kamov designed and built a prototype to prove the cabin and dynamic components layout; designated Ka-20, this demonstrator was not equipped with mission equipment, corrosion protection or shipboard operational equipment. The Ka-20 was displayed at the 1961 Tushino Aviation Day display.

Definitive prototypes of the Ka-25 incorporated mission equipment and corrosion protection for the structure. The rotor system introduced aluminium alloy blades pressurised with nitrogen for crack detection, lubricated hinges, hydraulic powered controls, alcohol de-icing and automatic blade folding. Power was supplied by two free-turbine engines sat atop the cabin, with electrically de-iced inlets, plain lateral exhausts with no infrared countermeasures, driving the main gearbox directly and a cooling fan for the gearbox and hydraulic oil coolers aft of the main gearbox. Construction was of stressed skin duralumin throughout with flush-riveting, as well as some bonding and honeycomb sandwich panels. The 1.5m × 1.25m × 3.94m cabin had a sliding door to port flight deck forward of the cabin and fuel tanks underfloor filled using a pressure refueling nozzle on the port side. A short boom at the rear of the cabin had a central fin and twin toed-in fins at the ends of the tailplane mainly for use during auto-rotation. The undercarriage consisted of two noncastoring mainwheels with sprag brakes attached to the fuselage by parallel &#x27;V&#x27; struts with a single angled shock absorber to dissipate landing loads, and two castoring nosewheels on straight shock absorbing legs attached directly to the fuselage either side of the cockpit which folded rearwards to reduce interference with the RADAR, all wheels were fitted with emergency rapid inflation flotation collars. Flying controls all act on the co-axial rotors with pitch, roll and collective similar to a conventional single rotor helicopter. Yaw was through differential collective which has a secondary effect of torque, an automatic mixer box ensured that total lift on the rotors remained constant during yaw maneuvers, to improve handling during deck landings. Optional extras included fold up seats for 12 passengers, rescue hoist, external auxiliary fuel tanks or containers for cameras, flares, smoke floats or beacons.

==Variants==
;Ka-25BSh: (NATO reporting name &#x27;Hormone-A&#x27;) Variants are used in the anti-submarine warfare role, equipped with radar, dipping sonar and a towed MAD and armed with torpedoes and nuclear or conventional depth-charges.
;Ka-25BShZ: Mine-sweeping version, eight built.
;Ka-25C: Little-known upgrade.
;Ka-25F: Proposed assault version in competition with the Mi-22 and the larger Mi-24. Modified with a glazed nose, cargo compartment with four doors, an under-fuselage turret with a GSh-23L and provision for up to six 9M17 Phalanga Anti-tank missiles or six UB-16 rocket launchers, each with 16 S-5 rockets or bombs.
;Ka-25Ts: (NATO reporting name &#x27;Hormone-B&#x27;) Over The Horizon targeting version for relaying data to cruise missiles launched from surface warships and submarines. Anti-submarine equipment, Electronic Surveillance Measures and weapons bay removed and larger radar scanner/reflector in a bulged radome under the nose. Also recognisable by the semi-retractable landing gear and a small cylindrical data-link antenna under the rear fuselage.

;Ka-25K: Civilian flying crane helicopter with a gondola under the lengthened nose for controlling slung loads up to . Fitted with electrically de-iced rotor blades and optional seats for 12 passengers. A single prototype (SSSR-21110) flown in 1966.
;Ka-25PS: (NATO reporting name &#x27;Hormone-C&#x27;) Search and rescue and transport version with no weapons bay, radome as Ka-25BSh. Normal equipment included seats for 12, rescue winch, provision for stretchers and auxiliary tanks. Optional equipment included a homing receiver, Electronic Surveillance Measures, searchlight and loudspeaker. Ka-25PS helicopters were usually painted red and white.
;Ka-25T: (NATO reporting name &#x27;Hormone-B&#x27;) Possibly misidentified or incorrect designation for Ka-25Ts OTH targeting relay aircraft.
;Ka-25TL: Missile tracking version. Also known as the Ka-25TI and Ka-25IV.

<text>Kainite ( or ) (KMg(SO4)Cl·3H2O) is an evaporite mineral in the class of &quot;Sulfates (selenates, etc.) with additional anions, with H2O&quot; according to the Nickel–Strunz classification. It is a hydrated potassium-magnesium sulfate-chloride, naturally occurring in irregular granular masses or as crystalline coatings in cavities or fissures. This mineral is dull and soft, and is colored white, yellowish, grey, reddish, or blue to violet. Its name is derived from Greek [kainos] (&quot;(hitherto) unknown&quot;), as it was the first mineral discovered that contained both sulfate and chloride as anions. Kainite forms monoclinic crystals.

== Properties ==

Kainite is of bitter taste and soluble in water. On recrystallization picromerite is deposited from the solution.

== Genesis and occurrence ==

Kainite was discovered in the Stassfurt salt mines in today&#x27;s Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in 1865 by the mine official Schöne and was first described by Carl Friedrich Jacob Zincken.

Kainite is a typical secondary mineral that forms through metamorphosis in marine deposits of potassium carbonate, and is also occasionally formed through resublimation from volcanic vapours. It is often accompanied by anhydrite, carnallite, halite, and kieserite.

Kainite is only found in comparatively few places, among them in salt mines in central and northern Germany, Bad Ischl (Austria), on Pasquasia in Sicily, in Whitby (UK), and in the Carlsbad Potash District in New Mexico, in volcanic deposits in Kamchatka and in Iceland, and in salt lakes in western China. It has also been identified in Gusev Crater on Mars.

It can also be produced from bittern remaining after removal of table salt from seawater.

== Uses ==

Kainite is used as a source of potassium and magnesium compounds, as a fertilizer, and as gritting salt.

<text>KAIST (originally the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) is a national research university located in Daedeok Innopolis, Daejeon, South Korea. KAIST was established by the Korean government in 1971 as the nation&#x27;s first public, research-oriented science and engineering institution. KAIST is considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the nation. KAIST has been internationally accredited in business education, and hosts the Secretariat of the Association of Asia-Pacific Business Schools (AAPBS). KAIST has 10,504 full-time students and 1,342 faculty researchers (as of the Fall 2019 Semester) and had a total budget of US$765 million in 2013, of which US$459 million was from research contracts.

In 2007, KAIST partnered with international institutions and adopted dual degree programs for its students. Its partner institutions include the Technical University of Denmark, Carnegie Mellon University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Technische Universität Berlin, and the Technical University of Munich.

==History==

The institute was founded in 1971 as the Korea Advanced Institute of Science (KAIS) by a loan of US$6 million (US$38 million 2019) from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and supported by President Park Chung-Hee. The institute&#x27;s academic scheme was mainly designed by Frederick E. Terman, then vice president of Stanford University, and Dr. KunMo Chung, a professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. The institute&#x27;s two main functions were to train advanced scientists and engineers and develop a structure of graduate education in the country. Research studies had begun by 1973 and undergraduates studied for bachelor&#x27;s degrees by 1984.

In 1981 the government merged the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) to form the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, or KAIST, under the leadership of physics professor Choochon Lee. Due to differing research philosophies, KIST and KAIST split in 1989. In the same year KAIST and the Korea Institute of Technology (KIT) combined and moved from Seoul to the Daedeok Science Town in Daejeon. 
The first act of President Suh upon his inauguration in July 2006 was to lay out the KAIST Development Plan. The ‘KAIST Development Five-Year Plan’ was finalized on February 5, 2007, by KAIST Steering Committee. The goals of KAIST set by Suh were to become one of the best science and technology universities in the world, and to become one of the top-10 universities by 2011. In January 2008, the university dropped its full name, &quot;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology&quot;, and changed its official name to only &quot;KAIST&quot;.

===Timeline===
==Academics==

===Academics===

Admission to KAIST is based on overall grades, grades on math and science courses, recommendation letters from teachers, study plan, personal statements, and other data, and does not rely on a standardized test conducted by the university. In 2014, the acceptance rate for local students was 14.9%, and for international students at 13.2%.

Full scholarships are given to all students including international students in the bachelor, master and doctorate courses. Doctoral students are given military-exemption benefits from South Korea&#x27;s compulsory military service. Up to 80% of courses taught in KAIST are conducted in English.

Undergraduate students can join the school through an “open major system” that allows students to take classes for three terms and then choose a discipline that suits their aptitude, and undergraduates are allowed to change their major anytime. KAIST has also produced many doctorates through the integrated master&#x27;s and doctoral program and early-completion system. Students must publish papers in internationally renowned academic journals for graduation.

===Students===
KAIST produced 69,388 alumni from 1975 to 2021, with 19,457 bachelor&#x27;s, 35,513 master&#x27;s, and 14,418 doctorate degree holders. As of Spring 2021, 10,793 students were enrolled in KAIST with 3,605 bachelor&#x27;s, 3,069 master&#x27;s, 1,354 joint M.S.-Ph.D.&#x27;s, and 2,765 doctoral students. More than 70 percent of KAIST undergraduates come from specialized science high schools. 817 international students from 81 countries are studying at KAIST (as of spring semester 2021), making it one of the most ethnically diverse universities in the country.

== Campus ==

KAIST has two campuses in Daejeon and one campus in Seoul. The university is mainly located in the Daedeok Science Town in the city of Daejeon, 150 kilometers south of the capital Seoul. Daedeok is also home to some 50 public and private research institutes, universities such as CNU and high-tech venture capital companies.

Most lectures, research activities, and housing services are located in the Daejeon main campus. It has a total of 29 dormitories. Twenty-three dormitories for male students and four dormitories for female students are located on the outskirts of the campus, and two apartments for married students are located outside the campus.

The Seoul campus is the home of the Business Faculty of the university. The graduate schools of finance, management and information &amp; media management are located there. The total area of the Seoul campus is .

The Munji campus, the former campus of Information and Communications University until its merger with KAIST, is located ca. away from the main campus. It has two dormitories, one for undergraduate students and the other for graduate students. The Institute for Basic Science (IBS) Center for Axion and Precision Physics Research is located here doing particle and nuclear physics related to dark matter and the Rare Isotope Science Project has the Superconducting Radio Frequency test facility.

=== Main library ===
The KAIST main library was established in 1971 as KAIS library, and it went through a merge and separation process with KIST library. It merged with KIT in March 1990. A contemporary 5 story building was constructed as the main library, and it is being operated with an annex library. The library uses the American LC Classification Schedule.

The library underwent expansion and remodeling, which finished in 2018, to include conference rooms, collaboration rooms, and media rooms.

=== Event ===
KAIST&#x27;s Seokrim Taeulje is a festival held by KAIST for three days every spring semester. The festival preparation committee under the undergraduate student council will be in charge of planning and execution, various food booths and experience booths will be opened, and stage events such as club performances and a song festival will be held. Also called the Cherry Blossom Festival, students eat strawberries on the lawn.

==Research==
Seven KAIST Institutes (KIs) have been set up: the KI for the BioCentury, the KI for Information Technology Convergence, the KI for the Design of Complex Systems, the KI for Entertainment Engineering, the KI for the NanoCentury, the KI for Eco-Energy, and the KI for Urban Space and Systems. Each KI is operated as an independent research center at the level of a college, receiving support in terms of finance and facilities. In terms of ownership of intellectual property rights, KAIST holds 2,694 domestic patents and 723 international patents so far.

=== Electric vehicles ===
Researchers at KAIST have developed the Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), a technique of powering vehicles through cables underneath the surface of the road via non-contact magnetic charging (a power source is placed underneath the road surface and power is wirelessly picked up on the vehicle itself). In July 2009 the researchers successfully supplied up to 60% power to a bus over a gap of from a power line embedded in the ground using power supply and pick up technology developed in-house.

==Controversy==
===Suicides===
In 2011, a punitive tuition system was introduced to KAIST, which charged students for tuition only if their grade-point average dropped below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. This change, along with a new system mandating English-only classes, led to 11 members of KAIST committing suicide from 2011 to 2016. The university has since reversed the punitive tuition system.

===Development of autonomous arms===
In February 2018, the Korea Times published an article which stated that KAIST was starting an AI weapons research project together with the Korean arms manufacturer Hanwha. The allegations were of developing lethal autonomous weapons with Hanwha. This has led to researchers from 30 countries boycotting KAIST, which has denied existence of the program.

===China tech leaks===
In February 2024, a KAIST professor was found guilty by an appellate court of leaking autonomous vehicle technologies to China between 2017 and 2020, leading to a two year prison sentence. Despite a lower court having sentenced the professor to two years in prison with a three-year suspended sentence in 2021, KAIST did not take any disciplinary action, instead offering only a public apology and a promise to improve its transparency

<text>Kaolinite ( ; also called kaolin) is a clay mineral, with the chemical composition Al2Si2O5(OH)4. It is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet of silica () linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina ().

Kaolinite is a soft, earthy, usually white, mineral (dioctahedral phyllosilicate clay), produced by the chemical weathering of aluminium silicate minerals like feldspar. It has a low shrink–swell capacity and a low cation-exchange capacity (1–15 meq/100 g).

Rocks that are rich in kaolinite, and halloysite, are known as kaolin () or china clay. In many parts of the world kaolin is colored pink-orange-red by iron oxide, giving it a distinct rust hue. Lower concentrations of iron oxide yield the white, yellow, or light orange colors of kaolin. Alternating lighter and darker layers are sometimes found, as at Providence Canyon State Park in Georgia, United States.

Kaolin is an important raw material in many industries and applications. Commercial grades of kaolin are supplied and transported as powder, lumps, semi-dried noodle or slurry. Global production of kaolin in 2021 was estimated to be 45 million tonnes, with a total market value of US $4.24 billion.

==Names==
The English name &quot;kaolin&quot; was borrowed in 1727 from François Xavier d&#x27;Entrecolles&#x27;s 1712 French reports on the manufacture of Jingdezhen porcelain. D&#x27;Entrecolles was transcribing the Chinese term , now romanized as in pinyin, taken from the name of the village of Gaoling (&quot;High Ridge&quot;) near Ehu in Fuliang County, now part of Jiangxi Province&#x27;s Jingdezhen Prefecture. The area around the village had become the main source of Jingdezhen&#x27;s kaolin over the course of the Qing dynasty. The mineralogical suffix &quot;-ite&quot; was later added to generalize the name to cover nearly identical minerals from other locations.

Kaolinite is also occasionally discussed under the archaic names lithomarge and lithomarga from Latin , a combination of (，, &quot;stone&quot;) and (&quot;marl&quot;). In more proper modern use, lithomarge now refers specifically to a compacted and massive form of kaolin.

==Chemistry==
===Notation===
The chemical formula for kaolinite as written in mineralogy is , however, in ceramics applications the same formula is typically written in terms of oxides, thus giving .

===Structure===

Compared with other clay minerals, kaolinite is chemically and structurally simple. It is described as a 1:1 or &quot;TO&quot; clay mineral because its crystals consist of stacked &quot;TO&quot; layers. Each &quot;TO&quot; layer consists of a tetrahedral (&quot;T&quot;) sheet composed of silicon and oxygen ions bonded to an octahedral (&quot;O&quot;) sheet composed of oxygen, aluminium, and hydroxyl ions. The &quot;T&quot; sheet is so called because each silicon ion is surrounded by four oxygen ions forming a tetrahedron. The &quot;O&quot; sheet is so called because each aluminium ion is surrounded by six oxygen or hydroxyl ions arranged at the corners of an octahedron. The two sheets in each layer are strongly bonded together via shared oxygen ions, while layers are bonded via hydrogen bonding between oxygen on the outer face of the &quot;T&quot; sheet of one layer and hydroxyl on the outer face of the &quot;O&quot; sheet of the next layer.

A kaolinite layer has no net electrical charge and so there are no large cations (such as calcium, sodium, or potassium) between layers as with most other clay minerals. This accounts for kaolinite&#x27;s relatively low ion exchange capacity. The close hydrogen bonding between layers also hinders water molecules from infiltrating between layers, accounting for kaolinite&#x27;s nonswelling character.

When moistened, the tiny platelike crystals of kaolinite acquire a layer of water molecules that cause crystals to adhere to each other and give kaolin clay its cohesiveness. The bonds are weak enough to allow the plates to slip past each other when the clay is being molded, but strong enough to hold the plates in place and allow the molded clay to retain its shape. When the clay is dried, most of the water molecules are removed, and the plates hydrogen bond directly to each other, so that the dried clay is rigid but still fragile. If the clay is moistened again, it will once more become plastic.

===Structural transformations===
Kaolinite group clays undergo a series of phase transformations upon thermal treatment in air at atmospheric pressure.

====Milling====
High-energy milling of kaolin results in the formation of a mechanochemically amorphized phase similar to metakaolin, although the properties of this solid are quite different. The high-energy milling process is highly inefficient and consumes a large amount of energy.

====Drying====

Below 100 °C, exposure to low humidity air will result in the slow evaporation of any liquid water in the kaolin. At low moisture content the mass can be described &quot;leather dry&quot;, and at near 0% moisture it is referred to as &quot;bone dry&quot;.

Above 100 °C any remaining free water is lost. Above around 400 °C hydroxyl ions (OH−) are lost from the kaolinite crystal structure in the form of water: the material cannot now be plasticised by absorbing water. This is irreversible, as are subsequent transformations; this is referred to as &quot;calcination&quot;.

====Metakaolin====
Endothermic dehydration of kaolinite begins at 550–600 °C producing disordered metakaolin, but continuous hydroxyl loss is observed up to . Although historically there was much disagreement concerning the nature of the metakaolin phase, extensive research has led to a general consensus that metakaolin is not a simple mixture of amorphous silica () and alumina (), but rather a complex amorphous structure that retains some longer-range order (but not strictly crystalline) due to stacking of its hexagonal layers.
:&lt;chem&gt;Al2Si2O5(OH)4 -&gt; Al2Si2O7 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

====Spinel====
Further heating to 925–950 °C converts metakaolin to an aluminium-silicon spinel which is sometimes also referred to as a gamma-alumina type structure:
:&lt;chem&gt;2 Al2Si2O7 -&gt; Si3Al4O12 + SiO2&lt;/chem&gt;

====Platelet mullite====
Upon calcination above 1050 °C, the spinel phase nucleates and transforms to platelet mullite and highly crystalline cristobalite:
:&lt;chem&gt;3 Si3Al4O12 -&gt; 2 (3 Al2O3 . 2 SiO2) + 5 SiO2&lt;/chem&gt;

====Needle mullite====
Finally, at 1400 °C the &quot;needle&quot; form of mullite appears, offering substantial increases in structural strength and heat resistance. This is a structural but not chemical transformation. See stoneware for more information on this form.

==Occurrence==

Kaolinite is one of the most common minerals; it is mined, as kaolin, in Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Iran, Malaysia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Tanzania, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam.

Mantles of kaolinite are common in Western and Northern Europe. The ages of these mantles are Mesozoic to Early Cenozoic.

Kaolinite clay occurs in abundance in soils that have formed from the chemical weathering of rocks in hot, moist climates; for example in tropical rainforest areas. Comparing soils along a gradient towards progressively cooler or drier climates, the proportion of kaolinite decreases, while the proportion of other clay minerals such as illite (in cooler climates) or smectite (in drier climates) increases. Such climatically related differences in clay mineral content are often used to infer changes in climates in the geological past, where ancient soils have been buried and preserved.
In the &quot;Institut National pour l&#x27;Étude Agronomique au Congo Belge&quot; (INEAC) classification system, soils in which the clay fraction is predominantly kaolinite are called &quot;kaolisol&quot; (from kaolin and soil).

In the United States, the main kaolin deposits are found in central Georgia, on a stretch of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line between Augusta and Macon. This area of thirteen counties is called the &quot;white gold&quot; belt; Sandersville is known as the &quot;Kaolin Capital of the World&quot; due to its abundance of kaolin. In the late 1800s, an active kaolin surface-mining industry existed in the extreme southeast corner of Pennsylvania, near the towns of Landenberg and Kaolin, and in what is present-day White Clay Creek Preserve. The product was brought by train to Newark, Delaware, on the Newark-Pomeroy line, along which can still be seen many open-pit clay mines. The deposits were formed between the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene, about 100 to 45 million years ago, in sediments derived from weathered igneous and metakaolin rocks. Kaolin production in the United States during 2011 was 5.5 million tons.

During the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum sediments deposited in the Espluga Freda area of Spain were enriched with kaolinite from a detrital source due to denudation.

==Synthesis and genesis==
Difficulties are encountered when trying to explain kaolinite formation under atmospheric conditions by extrapolation of thermodynamic data from the more successful high-temperature syntheses. La Iglesia and Van Oosterwijk-Gastuche (1978) thought that the conditions under which kaolinite will nucleate can be deduced from stability diagrams, based as they are on dissolution data. Because of a lack of convincing results in their own experiments, La Iglesia and Van Oosterwijk-Gastuche (1978) had to conclude, however, that there were other, still unknown, factors involved in the low-temperature nucleation of kaolinite. Because of the observed very slow crystallization rates of kaolinite from solution at room temperature Fripiat and Herbillon (1971) postulated the existence of high activation energies in the low-temperature nucleation of kaolinite.

At high temperatures, equilibrium thermodynamic models appear to be satisfactory for the description of kaolinite dissolution and nucleation, because the thermal energy suffices to overcome the energy barriers involved in the nucleation process. The importance of syntheses at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure towards the understanding of the mechanism involved in the nucleation of clay minerals lies in overcoming these energy barriers. As indicated by Caillère and Hénin (1960) the processes involved will have to be studied in well-defined experiments, because it is virtually impossible to isolate the factors involved by mere deduction from complex natural physico-chemical systems such as the soil environment.
Fripiat and Herbillon (1971), in a review on the formation of kaolinite, raised the fundamental question how a disordered material (i.e., the amorphous fraction of tropical soils) could ever be transformed into a corresponding ordered structure. This transformation seems to take place in soils without major changes in the environment, in a relatively short period of time, and at ambient temperature (and pressure).

Low-temperature synthesis of clay minerals (with kaolinite as an example) has several aspects. In the first place the silicic acid to be supplied to the growing crystal must be in a monomeric form, i.e., silica should be present in very dilute solution (Caillère et al., 1957; Caillère and Hénin, 1960; Wey and Siffert, 1962; Millot, 1970). In order to prevent the formation of amorphous silica gels precipitating from supersaturated solutions without reacting with the aluminium or magnesium cations to form crystalline silicates, the silicic acid must be present in concentrations below the maximum solubility of amorphous silica. The principle behind this prerequisite can be found in structural chemistry: &quot;Since the polysilicate ions are not of uniform size, they cannot arrange themselves along with the metal ions into a regular crystal lattice.&quot; (Iler, 1955, p. 182)

The second aspect of the low-temperature synthesis of kaolinite is that the aluminium cations must be hexacoordinated with respect to oxygen (Caillère and Hénin, 1947; Caillère et al., 1953; Hénin and Robichet, 1955). Gastuche et al. (1962) and Caillère and Hénin (1962) have concluded that kaolinite can only ever be formed when the aluminium hydroxide is in the form of gibbsite. Otherwise, the precipitate formed will be a &quot;mixed alumino-silicic gel&quot; (as Millot, 1970, p. 343 put it). If it were the only requirement, large amounts of kaolinite could be harvested simply by adding gibbsite powder to a silica solution. Undoubtedly a marked degree of adsorption of the silica in solution by the gibbsite surfaces will take place, but, as stated before, mere adsorption does not create the layer lattice typical of kaolinite crystals.

The third aspect is that these two initial components must be incorporated into one mixed crystal with a layer structure. From the following equation (as given by Gastuche and DeKimpe, 1962) for kaolinite formation
:&lt;chem&gt;2Al(OH)3 + 2H4SiO4 -&gt; Si2O5 . Al2(OH)4 + 5H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
it can be seen that five molecules of water must be removed from the reaction for every molecule of kaolinite formed. Field evidence illustrating the importance of the removal of water from the kaolinite reaction has been supplied by Gastuche and DeKimpe (1962). While studying soil formation on a basaltic rock in Kivu (Zaïre), they noted how the occurrence of kaolinite depended on the of the area involved. A clear distinction was found between areas with good drainage (i.e., areas with a marked difference between wet and dry seasons) and those areas with poor drainage (i.e., perennially swampy areas). Kaolinite was only found in the areas with distinct seasonal alternations between wet and dry. The possible significance of alternating wet and dry conditions on the transition of allophane into kaolinite has been stressed by Tamura and Jackson (1953). The role of alternations between wetting and drying on the formation of kaolinite has also been noted by Moore (1964).

===Laboratory syntheses===
Syntheses of kaolinite at high temperatures (more than ) are relatively well known. There are for example the syntheses of Van Nieuwenberg and Pieters (1929); Noll (1934); Noll (1936); Norton (1939); Roy and Osborn (1954); Roy (1961); Hawkins and Roy (1962); Tomura et al. (1985); Satokawa et al. (1994) and Huertas et al. (1999).
Relatively few low-temperature syntheses have become known (cf. Brindley and DeKimpe (1961); DeKimpe (1969); Bogatyrev et al. (1997)).

Laboratory syntheses of kaolinite at room temperature and atmospheric pressure have been described by DeKimpe et al. (1961). From those tests the role of periodicity becomes convincingly clear. DeKimpe et al. (1961) had used daily additions of alumina (as ) and silica (in the form of ethyl silicate) during at least two months. In addition, adjustments of the pH took place every day by way of adding either hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Such daily additions of Si and Al to the solution in combination with the daily titrations with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide during at least 60 days will have introduced the necessary element of periodicity. Only now the actual role of what has been described as the &quot;aging&quot; (&quot;Alterung&quot;) of amorphous alumino-silicates (as for example Harder, 1978 had noted) can be fully understood. As such, time is not bringing about any change in a closed system at equilibrium; but a series of alternations of periodically changing conditions (by definition, taking place in an open system) will bring about the low-temperature formation of more and more of the stable phase kaolinite instead of (ill-defined) amorphous alumino-silicates.

==Applications==
===Main===
In 2009, up to 70% of kaolin was used in the production of paper. Following reduced demand from the paper industry, resulting from both competing minerals and the effect of digital media, in 2016 the market share was reported to be: paper, 36%; ceramics, 31%; paint, 7% and other, 26%. According to the USGS, in 2021 the global production of kaolin was estimated to be around 45 million tonnes.

* Paper applications require high-brightness, low abrasion and delaminated kaolins. For paper coatings it is used to enhance the gloss, brilliance, smoothness and receptability to inks; it can account for 25% of mass of the paper. As a paper filler it is used as a pulp extender, and to increase opacity; it can account for 15% of mass.
* In whiteware ceramic bodies, kaolin can constitute up to 50% of the raw materials. In unfired bodies it contributes to the green strength, plasticity and rheological properties, such as the casting rate. During firing it reacts with other body components to form the crystal and glass phases. With suitable firing schedules it is key to the formation of mullite. The most valued grades have low contents of chromophoric oxides such that the fired material has high whiteness. In glazes it is primarily used as a rheology control agent, but also contributes some green strength. In both glazes and frits it contributes some SiO2 as a glass network former, and Al2O3 as both a network former and modifier.

===Other industrial===
* As a raw material for the production of an insulation material called Kaowool (a form of mineral wool).
* An additive to some paints to extend the titanium dioxide () white pigment and modify gloss levels.
* An additive to modify the properties of rubber upon vulcanization.
* An additive to adhesives to modify rheology.
* As adsorbents in water and wastewater treatment.
* In its altered metakaolin form, as a pozzolan; when added to a concrete mix, metakaolin accelerates the hydration of Portland cement and takes part in the pozzolanic reaction with the portlandite formed in the hydration of the main cement minerals (e.g. alite).
* Metakaolin is also a base component for geopolymer compounds.

===Medical===
* To soothe an upset stomach, similar to the way parrots (and later, humans) in South America originally used it (more recently, industrially produced).
* Kaolin-based preparations are used for treatment of diarrhea.
* An ingredient in &#x27;pre-work&#x27; skin protection and barrier creams.
* To induce and accelerate blood clotting. In April 2008 the US Naval Medical Research Institute announced the successful use of a kaolinite-derived aluminosilicate infusion in traditional gauze. which is still the hemostat of choice for all branches of the US military. See Kaolin clotting time and quikclot
* As a mild abrasive in toothpaste.

===Cosmetics===
* As a filler in cosmetics.
* For facial masks or soap.
* for spa body treatments, such as body wraps, cocoons, or spot treatments.

===Archaeology===
* As an indicator in radiological dating since kaolinite can contain very small traces of uranium and thorium.

===Geophagy===
* Humans sometimes eat kaolin for pleasure or to suppress hunger, a practice known as geophagy. In Africa, kaolin used for such purposes is known as &quot;kalaba&quot; (in Gabon and Cameroon), &quot;calaba&quot;, and &quot;calabachop&quot; (in Equatorial Guinea). Consumption is greater among women, especially during pregnancy, and its use is sometimes said by women of the region to be a habit analogous to cigarette smoking among men. The practice has also been observed within a small population of African-American women in the Southern United States, especially Georgia, likely brought with the traditions of the aforementioned Africans via slavery. There, the kaolin is called &quot;white dirt&quot;, &quot;chalk&quot; or &quot;white clay&quot;.

===Geotechnical engineering===
* Research results show that the utilization of kaolinite in geotechnical engineering can be alternatively replaced by safer illite, especially if its presence is less than 10.8% of the total rock mass.

===Small-scale uses===
* As a light-diffusing material in white incandescent light bulbs.
* In organic farming as a spray applied to crops to deter insect damage, and in the case of apples, to prevent sun scald.
* As whitewash in traditional stone masonry homes in Nepal.
* As a filler in Edison Diamond Discs.

==Production output==
Global production of kaolin by country in 2012 was estimated to be:
==Typical properties==
Some selected typical properties of various ceramic grade kaolins are:

==Safety==

Kaolin is generally recognized as safe, but may cause mild irritation of the skin or mucous membranes. Kaolin products may also contain traces of crystalline silica, a known carcinogen if inhaled.

In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for kaolin exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure TWA 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.

<text>The Kawasaki Ki-56 (, Type 1 Freight Transport) was a Japanese, two-engine light transport aircraft used during World War II. It was known to the Allies by the reporting name Thalia. One-hundred twenty-one were built between 1940-43.

==Design and development==
The Kawasaki Ki-56 was derived from the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra aircraft that the &quot;Kawasaki Kokuki Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha&quot; (The Kawasaki Aircraft Engineering Company Limited) had built under licence. In September 1939, Kawasaki was asked by the Koku Hombu to design an improved version as Ki-56. A number was also built by Tachikawa Hikoki K.K.

==Operational history==
The Japanese invasion of Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies campaign began with a paratroop drop from Ki-56 transports on Airfield P1 and the oil refineries near Palembang. Royal Air Force Hawker Hurricane fighters flying from P1 to locate the Japanese invasion fleet passed the incoming Ki-56s but thought them to be friendly Lockheed Hudsons (also developed from the Lockheed Model 14) returning from a raid. The defending anti-aircraft gunners at P1 were equally fooled, until parachutes began to open. Once the AA guns opened fire, one transport was shot down, another force-landed, and others veered off course. The paratroop drop was effective, and the airfield and oil installations were overrun.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On March 28, 1946, a Dalstroi Aviation Ki-56 (&quot;514&quot;) crashed on takeoff from Zyrianka, Russia due to crew error, killing the pilot.
* On December 7, 1946, a Dalstroi Aviation Ki-56 (&quot;6&quot;) crashed on climbout from Berelakh, Magadan, Russia (then part of the Khabarovsk Territory) due to double engine failure, killing all seven on board.

<text>MV &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was a German military transport ship which was sunk on 30 January 1945 by in the Baltic Sea while evacuating civilians and military personnel from East Prussia and the German-occupied Baltic states, and German military personnel from Gotenhafen (Gdynia), as the Red Army advanced. By one estimate, 9,343 people died, making it the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking in history.

Originally constructed as a cruise ship for the Nazi Strength Through Joy (&quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot;) organization in 1937, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; had been requisitioned by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German navy) in 1939. She served as a hospital ship in 1939 and 1940. She was then assigned as a floating barracks for naval personnel in Gotenhafen before being fitted with anti-aircraft guns and put into service to transport evacuees in 1945.

== Construction and naming ==
&quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was constructed by the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyards. Measuring long by wide, with a capacity of , she was launched on 5 May 1937.

The ship was originally intended to be named &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; but instead was christened after Wilhelm Gustloff, leader of the Nazi Party&#x27;s Swiss branch, who had been assassinated by a Jewish medical student in 1936. Adolf Hitler decided on the name change after sitting next to Gustloff&#x27;s widow during his memorial service. After completing sea trials in the North Sea from 15 to 16 March 1938 she was handed over to her owners.

==Cruise ship==
&quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was the first purpose-built cruise ship for the German Labour Front (&quot;Deutsche Arbeitsfront&quot;, DAF) and used by subsidiary organisation Strength Through Joy (&quot;Kraft durch Freude&quot;, KdF). Her purposes were to provide recreational and cultural activities for German functionaries and workers, including concerts, cruises, and other holiday trips, and to serve as a public relations tool that would present &quot;a more acceptable image of the Third Reich&quot;. She was the flagship of the KdF cruise fleet, her last civilian role, until the spring of 1939.

The ship made her unofficial maiden voyage between 24 and 27 March 1938 carrying Austrians in an attempt to convince them to vote for the annexation of Austria by Germany. On 29 March she departed on her second voyage carrying workers and their families from the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard on a three-day cruise.

===Rescue of &quot;Pegaway&quot;===
For her third voyage &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; left Hamburg on 1 April 1938 under the command of Carl Lübbe to join the KdF ships &quot;Der Deutsche&quot;, &quot;Oceania&quot; and &quot;Sierra Cordoba&quot; on a group cruise of the North Sea. A storm developed on 3 April with winds up to that forced the four ships apart. Meanwhile, the 1,836 gross ton coal freighter &quot;Pegaway&quot;, which had departed the Tyne on 2 April for Hamburg, was also caught up in the storm. Cargo and machinery were washed from &quot;Pegaway&quot;″s decks and the ship lost maneuverability as the storm increased in intensity. By 4 April, it was taking on water and slowly sinking.

At 4 am, Captain G. W. Ward of &quot;Pegaway&quot; issued an SOS when the ship was northwest of the island of Terschelling, off the coast of the Netherlands. The closest of the ships that answered the distress call was &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, which reached &quot;Pegaway&quot; at 6 am. She launched her Lifeboat No. 1, with a crew of twelve under the command of Second Officer Meyer. The oar-powered lifeboat was unable to come aside &quot;Pegaway&quot; in the heavy seas and looked in danger of needing to be rescued. Lifeboat No. 6, with a crew of ten under the command of Second Officer Schürmann, was then lowered. As it was motor-powered, it was better able to handle the waves.

After first assisting their shipmates in Lifeboat No. 1 to head back towards &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, Schürmann was able to reach &quot;Pegaway&quot;. One by one the 19 men on &quot;Pegaway&quot; jumped into the sea and were hauled onto Lifeboat No. 6, with both them and the crew of the lifeboat back at &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; by 7:45 am. By now a Dutch tugboat had arrived but was unable to save &quot;Pegaway&quot;, which soon rolled to port and sank. Lifeboat No. 1 had been so badly damaged by the waves that after its crew had climbed up via ladders to the safety of their ship it was set adrift, to later be washed up on the shores of Terschelling on 2 May.
===Anschluss===
On 8 April 1938 &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, under the command of Captain Lübbe, departed Hamburg for England, where she anchored over offshore from Tilbury so as to remain in international waters. This allowed her to act as a floating polling station for German and Austrian citizens living in England who wished to vote on the approaching plebiscite on Germany&#x27;s unification with Austria. During 10 April, 1,172 Germans and 806 Austrian eligible voters were ferried between the docks at Tilbury to the ship where 1,968 votes were cast in favour of the union and ten voted against. Once the voting was complete, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; departed, reaching Hamburg on 12 April.

After undertaking a further voyage on 14 to 19 April 1938, the ship went on an &quot;Osterfahrt&quot; (Easter Voyage) before her actual official maiden voyage, which was undertaken from 21 April to 6 May 1938, when she joined &quot;Der Deutsche&quot;, &quot;Oceania&quot; and &quot;Sierra Cordoba&quot; on a group cruise to the Madeira Islands. On the second day of her voyage, the 58-year-old Captain Lübbe died on the bridge from a heart attack. He was replaced by Friedrich Petersen, who commanded &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; for the remainder of the cruise. Petersen left the ship until he returned as captain on her fatal voyage.

===Condor Legion===
Between 20 May and 2 June 1939, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was diverted from her pleasure cruises. With seven other ships in the KdF fleet, she transported the Condor Legion back to Germany from Spain following the victory of the Nationalist forces under General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War.

From 14 March 1938 until 26 August 1939, the ship took over 80,000 passengers on a total of 60 voyages, all around Europe.

==Military career==
From September 1939 to November 1940, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; served as a hospital ship, officially designated &quot;Lazarettschiff&quot; D. Beginning on 20 November 1940, medical equipment was removed from the ship and she was repainted from the hospital ship colors of white with a green stripe to standard naval grey.
As a consequence of the Allied blockade of the German coastline, she was used as a barracks ship for approximately 1,000 U-boat trainees of the 2nd Submarine Training Division (2. &quot;Unterseeboot-Lehrdivision&quot;) in the port of Gdynia, which had been occupied by Germany and renamed &quot;Gotenhafen&quot;, located near Danzig (Gdańsk). &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; sat in dock there for over four years. In 1942, was used as a stand-in for in the German film version of the disaster. Filmed in Gotenhafen, the 2nd Submarine Training Division acted as extras in the movie. Eventually, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was put back into service transporting civilians and military personnel as part of Operation Hannibal.

==Operation Hannibal – evacuation==

Operation Hannibal was the naval evacuation of German troops and civilians from East Prussia and the German-occupied Baltic states as the Red Army advanced from the east. &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;″s final voyage was to evacuate civilians, German military personnel, and technicians from Courland, East Prussia, and Danzig-West Prussia. Many had worked at advanced weapon bases in the Baltic from Gotenhafen to Kiel.

The ship&#x27;s complement and passenger lists cited 6,050 people on board, but these did not include the many individuals who boarded the ship without being listed in the official embarkation records. Heinz Schön, a German archivist and &quot;Gustloff&quot; survivor, researched the sinking during the 1980s and 1990s. He concluded that the ship was carrying a crew of 173 (naval armed forces auxiliaries); 918 officers, NCOs, and men of the 2 &quot;Unterseeboot-Lehrdivision&quot;; 373 female naval auxiliary helpers; 162 wounded soldiers; and 8,956 civilians, for a total of 10,582 passengers and crew. The passengers, besides civilians, included Gestapo personnel, members of the Organisation Todt, and Nazi officials with their families. The ship was overcrowded, and due to the high temperature and humidity inside, many passengers defied orders not to remove their life jackets. Besides ethnic Germans, the people on board included Lithuanians, Latvians, Poles, Estonians, and Croatians, some of whom had been victims of Nazi aggression.

The ship left Gotenhafen at 12:30 pm on 30 January 1945, accompanied by two torpedo boats and the passenger liner &quot;Hansa&quot;, which was carrying civilians and military personnel. &quot;Hansa&quot; and one torpedo boat developed mechanical problems and could not continue, leaving &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; with one torpedo boat escort, &quot;Löwe&quot; (ex-). The ship had four captains on board (the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;&#x27;s captain, two merchant marine captains, and the captain of the U-boat complement housed on the vessel), and they disagreed on the best course of action to guard against submarine attacks. Against the advice of the military commander, Lieutenant Commander Wilhelm Zahn (a submariner who argued for a course in shallow waters close to shore and without lights), &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;&#x27;s captain, Friedrich Petersen, decided to head for deep water, which was known to have been cleared of mines. When he was informed by a mysterious radio message of an oncoming German minesweeper convoy, Petersen decided to activate his ship&#x27;s red and green navigation lights so as to avoid a collision in the dark, making &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; easy to spot in the dark.

As &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; had been fitted with anti-aircraft guns, and the Germans did not mark her as a hospital ship, no notification of her operating in a hospital capacity had been given. Since she was transporting military personnel, she did not have any protection as a hospital ship under international accords.

===Sinking===
&quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was soon sighted by the , under the command of Captain Alexander Marinesko. The submarine sensor on board the escorting torpedo boat had frozen, rendering it inoperable, as had her anti-aircraft guns, leaving the vessels defenseless. Marinesko followed the ships to their starboard (seaward) side for two hours before making a daring move, surfacing his submarine and steering it around &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;″s stern, to attack it from the port side closer to shore, from where the attack would be less expected. At around 9 pm (CET), Marinesko ordered his crew to launch four torpedoes at &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;″s port side, about offshore, between Großendorf and Leba.

The three torpedoes that were fired successfully all struck &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; on her port side. The first struck the ship&#x27;s bow, causing watertight doors to seal off the area where off-duty crew members were sleeping. The second hit the accommodations for the women&#x27;s naval auxiliary, located in the ship&#x27;s drained swimming pool. It dislodged the pool tiles at high velocity, which caused high casualties; only three of the 373 women quartered there survived. The third torpedo scored a direct hit on the engine room located , disabling all power and communications.

Reportedly, only nine lifeboats could be lowered; the rest had frozen in their davits and had to be broken free. About twenty minutes after the torpedoes&#x27; impact, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; suddenly listed so dramatically to port that the lifeboats lowered on the high starboard side crashed into the ship&#x27;s tilting side, destroying many lifeboats and spilling their occupants.

Many deaths were caused either directly by the torpedoes or drowning in the onrushing water. Some fatalities were due to the initial stampede caused by panicked passengers on the stairs and decks. Many passengers jumped into the icy Baltic. The water temperature in the Baltic Sea in late January is usually around ; however, this was a particularly cold night, with an air temperature of and ice floes covering the surface. The majority of those who died succumbed to exposure in the freezing water.

Less than 40 minutes after being struck, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was lying on her side. She sank bow-first ten minutes later, in of water.

German forces were able to rescue 1,252 people: the torpedo boat rescued 564; the torpedo boat &quot;Löwe&quot;, 472; the minesweeper &quot;M387&quot;, 98; the minesweeper &quot;M375&quot;, 43; the minesweeper &quot;M341&quot;, 37; the steamer &quot;Göttingen&quot;, 28; the torpedo recovery boat (&quot;Torpedofangboot&quot;) &quot;TF19&quot;, 7; the freighter &quot;Gotenland&quot;, two; and the patrol boat (&quot;Vorpostenboot&quot;) &quot;V1703&quot;, one baby. Thirteen of the survivors died later. All four captains on &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; survived her sinking; an official naval inquiry was initiated only against Lieutenant Commander Zahn. His degree of responsibility was never resolved, however, because of Nazi Germany&#x27;s collapse in 1945.

===Losses===
The figures from Heinz Schön&#x27;s research make the loss in the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; sinking to be &quot;9,343 men, women and children&quot;. His more recent research is backed up by estimates arrived at by a different method. An &quot;Unsolved History&quot; episode that aired in March 2003, on the Discovery Channel, undertook a computer analysis of the sinking. Using &quot;Maritime Exodus&quot; software, it estimated that 9,600 people died of the more than 10,600 on board, by taking into account passenger density based on witness reports, and a simulation of escape routes and survivability with the timeline of the sinking.

==Aftermath==
Many ships were sunk during the war by the Allies and by the Axis Powers. However, based on the latest estimates of passenger numbers and those known to be saved, the sinking of &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; remains by far the largest loss of life in maritime history resulting from the sinking of a single vessel.

About 1,000 German naval officers and men were aboard and died in the sinking of &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;. Women aboard the ship at the time of the sinking were inaccurately described by Soviet propaganda as &quot;SS personnel from the German concentration camps&quot;. There were, however, 373 female naval auxiliaries amongst the passengers, only three of whom survived.

On the night of 9–10 February, just eleven days after the sinking, &quot;S-13&quot; sank another German ship, , killing about 4,500 people.

Before sinking &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, Captain Marinesko had been facing a court martial due to his alcohol problems and for being caught in a brothel while he and his crew were off duty. Marinesko was deemed by the Soviet government as &quot;not suitable to be a hero&quot;. Instead of being awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for the sinking, he was awarded the lesser Order of the Red Banner. He was downgraded in rank to lieutenant and dishonorably discharged from the Soviet Navy in October 1945.

In 1960, Marinesko was reinstated as captain third class and granted a full pension; in 1963 he was given the traditional ceremony due a captain upon the successful return from a mission. He died three weeks later at the age of 50 from cancer. In 1990 Marinesko was posthumously named a Hero of the Soviet Union by Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.

Author Günter Grass said in an interview published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 2003: &quot;One of the many reasons I wrote &quot;Crabwalk&quot; was to take the subject away from the extreme Right... They said the tragedy of &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; was a war crime. It wasn&#x27;t. It was terrible, but it was a result of war, a terrible result of war.&quot;

==Wreckage==

Noted as &quot;Obstacle No. 73&quot; on Polish navigation charts, and classified as a war grave, &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; rests at , about offshore, east of Łeba and west of Władysławowo (the former Leba and Großendorf, respectively). It is one of the largest shipwrecks on the Baltic Sea floor and has attracted much interest from treasure hunters searching for the lost Amber Room. In order to protect the property on board the war grave, as well as the wreck itself and the surrounding environment, the Polish Maritime Office in Gdynia has forbidden diving within a radius of the wreck.

In 2006, a bell recovered from the wreck and subsequently used as a decoration in a Polish seafood restaurant was lent to the privately funded &quot;Forced Paths&quot; exhibition in Berlin.

<text>Kerberos () is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of &quot;tickets&quot; to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. Its designers aimed it primarily at a client–server model, and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other&#x27;s identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks.

Kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a trusted third party, and optionally may use public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication. Kerberos uses UDP port 88 by default.

The protocol was named after the character &quot;Kerberos&quot; (or &quot;Cerberus&quot;) from Greek mythology, the ferocious three-headed guard dog of Hades.

==History and development==
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed Kerberos in 1988 to protect network services provided by Project Athena. Its first version was primarily designed by Steve Miller and Clifford Neuman based on the earlier Needham–Schroeder symmetric-key protocol. Kerberos versions 1 through 3 were experimental and not released outside of MIT.

Kerberos version 4, the first public version, was released on January 24, 1989. Since Kerberos 4 was developed in the United States, and since it used the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm, U.S. export control restrictions prevented it from being exported to other countries. MIT created an exportable version of Kerberos 4 with all encryption code removed, called &quot;Bones&quot;. Eric Young of Australia&#x27;s Bond University reimplemented DES into Bones, in a version called &quot;eBones&quot;, which could be freely used in any country. Sweden&#x27;s Royal Institute of Technology released another reimplementation called KTH-KRB.

Neuman and John Kohl published version 5 in 1993 with the intention of overcoming existing limitations and security problems. Version 5 appeared as RFC 1510, which was then made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005.

In 2005, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Kerberos working group updated specifications. Updates included:
* Encryption and Checksum Specifications (RFC 3961).
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption for Kerberos 5 (RFC 3962).
* A new edition of the Kerberos V5 specification &quot;The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)&quot; (RFC 4120). This version obsoletes RFC 1510, clarifies aspects of the protocol and intended use in a more detailed and clearer explanation.
* A new edition of the Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) specification &quot;The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2&quot; (RFC 4121).

MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos freely available, under copyright permissions similar to those used for BSD. In 2007, MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium to foster continued development. Founding sponsors include vendors such as Oracle, Apple Inc., Google, Microsoft, Centrify Corporation and TeamF1 Inc., and academic institutions such as the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, Stanford University, MIT, and vendors such as CyberSafe offering commercially supported versions.

==Protocol==

===Description===
The client authenticates itself to the Authentication Server (AS) which is part of the key distribution center (KDC). The KDC issues a ticket-granting ticket (TGT), which is time stamped and encrypts it using the ticket-granting service&#x27;s (TGS) secret key and returns the encrypted result to the user&#x27;s workstation. This is done infrequently, typically at user logon; the TGT expires at some point although it may be transparently renewed by the user&#x27;s session manager while they are logged in.

When the client needs to communicate with a service on another node (a &quot;principal&quot;, in Kerberos parlance), the client sends the TGT to the TGS, which is another component of the KDC and usually shares the same host as the authentication server. The service must have already been registered with the TGS with a Service Principal Name (SPN). The client uses the SPN to request access to this service. After verifying that the TGT is valid and that the user is permitted to access the requested service, the TGS issues a service ticket (ST) and session keys to the client. The client then sends the ticket to the service server (SS) along with its service request.

The protocol is described in detail below.

====User Client-based Login without Kerberos====
# A user enters a username and password on the client machine(s). Other credential mechanisms like pkinit (RFC 4556) allow for the use of public keys in place of a password. The client transforms the password into the key of a symmetric cipher. This either uses the built-in key scheduling, or a one-way hash, depending on the cipher-suite used. 
#The server receives the username and symmetric cipher and compares it with the data from the database. Login was a success if the cipher matches the cipher that is stored for the user.

====Client Authentication====
# The client sends a plaintext message of the user ID to the AS (Authentication Server) requesting services on behalf of the user. (Note: Neither the secret key nor the password is sent to the AS.)
# The AS checks to see whether the client is in its database. If it is, the AS generates the secret key by hashing the password of the user found at the database (e.g., Active Directory in Windows Server) and sends back the following two messages to the client:
#* Message A: &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot; encrypted using the secret key of the client/user.
#* Message B: &quot;Ticket-Granting-Ticket&quot; (TGT, which includes the client ID, client network address, ticket validity period, and the &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot;) encrypted using the secret key of the TGS.
# Once the client receives messages A and B, it attempts to decrypt message A with the secret key generated from the password entered by the user. If the user entered password does not match the password in the AS database, the client&#x27;s secret key will be different and thus unable to decrypt message A. With a valid password and secret key the client decrypts message A to obtain the &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot;. This session key is used for further communications with the TGS. (Note: The client cannot decrypt Message B, as it is encrypted using TGS&#x27;s secret key.) At this point, the client has enough information to authenticate itself to the TGS.

====Client Service Authorization====
# When requesting services, the client sends the following messages to the TGS:
#* Message C: Composed of the message B (the encrypted TGT using the TGS secret key) and the ID of the requested service.
#* Message D: Authenticator (which is composed of the client ID and the timestamp), encrypted using the &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot; (found by the client in Message A).
# Upon receiving messages C and D, the TGS retrieves message B out of message C. It decrypts message B using the TGS secret key. This gives it the &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot; and the client ID (both are in the TGT). Using this &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot;, the TGS decrypts message D (Authenticator) and compares the client IDs from messages B and D; if they match, the server sends the following two messages to the client:
#* Message E: &quot;Client-to-server ticket&quot; (which includes the client ID, client network address, validity period, and &quot;Client/Server Session Key&quot;) encrypted using the service&#x27;s secret key.
#* Message F: &quot;Client/Server Session Key&quot; encrypted with the &quot;Client/TGS Session Key&quot;.

====Client Service Request====
# Upon receiving messages E and F from TGS, the client has enough information to authenticate itself to the Service Server (SS). The client connects to the SS and sends the following two messages:
#* Message E: From the previous step (the &quot;Client-to-server ticket&quot;, encrypted using service&#x27;s Secret key by the TGS).
#* Message G: A new Authenticator, which includes the client ID, timestamp and is encrypted using &quot;Client/Server Session Key&quot;.
# The SS decrypts the ticket (message E) using its own secret key to retrieve the &quot;Client/Server Session Key&quot;. Using the sessions key, SS decrypts the Authenticator and compares client ID from messages E and G, if they match server sends the following message to the client to confirm its true identity and willingness to serve the client:
#* Message H: The timestamp found in client&#x27;s Authenticator (plus 1 in version 4, but not necessary in version 5), encrypted using the &quot;Client/Server Session Key&quot;.
# The client decrypts the confirmation (message H) using the &quot;Client/Server Session Key&quot; and checks whether the timestamp is correct. If so, then the client can trust the server and can start issuing service requests to the server.
# The server provides the requested services to the client.

==Support by operating systems==

===Microsoft Windows===
Windows 2000 and later versions use Kerberos as their default authentication method. Some Microsoft additions to the Kerberos suite of protocols are documented in RFC 3244 &quot;Microsoft Windows 2000 Kerberos Change Password and Set Password Protocols&quot;. RFC 4757 documents Microsoft&#x27;s use of the RC4 cipher. While Microsoft uses and extends the Kerberos protocol, it does not use the MIT software.

Kerberos is used as the preferred authentication method: in general, joining a client to a Windows domain means enabling Kerberos as the default protocol for authentications from that client to services in the Windows domain and all domains with trust relationships to that domain.

In contrast, when either client or server or both are not joined to a domain (or not part of the same trusted domain environment), Windows will instead use NTLM for authentication between client and server.

Internet web applications can enforce Kerberos as an authentication method for domain-joined clients by using APIs provided under SSPI.

Microsoft Windows and Windows Server include , a command-line utility that can be used to read, modify, or delete the Service Principal Names (SPN) for an Active Directory service account.

===Unix and other operating systems===
Many Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD, Apple&#x27;s macOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle&#x27;s Solaris, IBM&#x27;s AIX, HP-UX and others, include software for Kerberos authentication of users or services. A variety of non-Unix like operating systems such as z/OS, IBM i and OpenVMS also feature Kerberos support. Embedded implementation of the Kerberos V authentication protocol for client agents and network services running on embedded platforms is also available from companies .

==Drawbacks and limitations==
* Kerberos has strict time requirements, which means that the clocks of the involved hosts must be synchronized within configured limits. The tickets have a time availability period, and if the host clock is not synchronized with the Kerberos server clock, the authentication will fail. The default configuration per MIT requires that clock times be no more than five minutes apart. In practice, Network Time Protocol daemons are usually used to keep the host clocks synchronized. Note that some servers (Microsoft&#x27;s implementation being one of them) may return a KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW result containing the encrypted server time if both clocks have an offset greater than the configured maximum value. In that case, the client could retry by calculating the time using the provided server time to find the offset. This behavior is documented in RFC 4430.
* The administration protocol is not standardized and differs between server implementations. Password changes are described in RFC 3244.
* In case of symmetric cryptography adoption (Kerberos can work using symmetric or asymmetric (public-key) cryptography), since all authentications are controlled by a centralized key distribution center (KDC), compromise of this authentication infrastructure will allow an attacker to impersonate any user.
* Each network service that requires a different host name will need its own set of Kerberos keys. This complicates virtual hosting and clusters.
* Kerberos requires user accounts and services to have a trusted relationship to the Kerberos token server.
* The required client trust makes creating staged environments (e.g., separate domains for test environment, pre-production environment and production environment) difficult: Either domain trust relationships need to be created that prevent a strict separation of environment domains, or additional user clients need to be provided for each environment.

==Security==
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher can be used in combination with Kerberos, but is no longer an Internet standard because it is weak. Security vulnerabilities exist in products that implement legacy versions of Kerberos which lack support for newer encryption ciphers like AES.

<text>Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used medically for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It is also used as a treatment for depression and in pain management. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist which accounts for most of its psychoactive effects.

At anesthetic doses, ketamine induces a state of dissociative anesthesia, a trance-like state providing pain relief, sedation, and amnesia. Its distinguishing features as an anesthestic are preserved breathing and airway reflexes, stimulated heart function with increased blood pressure, and moderate bronchodilation. At lower, sub-anesthetic doses, it is a promising agent for treatment of pain and treatment-resistant depression. As with many antidepressants, the results of a single administration wane with time. 

Ketamine is used as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic and dissociative effects. When used recreationally, it is found both in crystalline powder and liquid form, and is often referred to by users as &quot;Special K&quot; or simply &quot;K&quot;. The long-term effects of repeated use are largely unknown and are an area of active investigation. Liver and urinary toxicity have been reported among regular users of high doses of ketamine for recreational purposes.
Ketamine was first synthesized in 1962, derived from phencyclidine in pursuit of a safer anesthetic with fewer hallucinogenic effects. It was approved for use in the United States in 1970. It has been regularly used in veterinary medicine and was extensively used for surgical anesthesia in the Vietnam War. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

== Medical uses ==

=== Anesthesia ===
The use of ketamine in anesthesia reflects its characteristics. It is a drug of choice for short-term procedures when muscle relaxation is not required. The effect of ketamine on the respiratory and circulatory systems is different from that of other anesthetics. It suppresses breathing much less than most other available anesthetics. When used at anesthetic doses, ketamine usually stimulates rather than depresses the circulatory system. Protective airway reflexes are preserved, and it is sometimes possible to administer ketamine anesthesia without protective measures to the airways. Psychotomimetic effects limit the acceptance of ketamine; however, lamotrigine and nimodipine decrease psychotomimetic effects and can also be counteracted by benzodiazepines or propofol administration. Ketofol is a combination of ketamine and propofol.

Ketamine is frequently used in severely injured people and appears to be safe in this group. It has been widely used for emergency surgery in field conditions in war zones, for example, during the Vietnam War. A 2011 clinical practice guideline supports the use of ketamine as a sedative in emergency medicine, including during physically painful procedures. It is the drug of choice for people in traumatic shock who are at risk of hypotension. Ketamine is unlikely to lower blood pressure, which is dangerous for people with severe head injury; in fact, it can raise blood pressure, often making it useful in treating such injuries.

Ketamine is an option in children as the sole anesthetic for minor procedures or as an induction agent followed by neuromuscular blocker and tracheal intubation. In particular, children with cyanotic heart disease and neuromuscular disorders are good candidates for ketamine anesthesia.

Due to the bronchodilating properties of ketamine, it can be used for anesthesia in people with asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, and with severe reactive airway disease including active bronchospasm.

=== Pain ===
Ketamine infusions are used for acute pain treatment in emergency departments and in the perioperative period for individuals with refractory pain. The doses are lower than those used for anesthesia, usually referred to as sub-anesthetic doses. Adjunctive to morphine or on its own, ketamine reduces morphine use, pain level, nausea, and vomiting after surgery. Ketamine is likely to be most beneficial for surgical patients when severe post-operative pain is expected, and for opioid-tolerant patients.

Ketamine is especially useful in the pre-hospital setting due to its effectiveness and low risk of respiratory depression.
Ketamine has similar efficacy to opioids in a hospital emergency department setting for the management of acute pain and the control of procedural pain. It may also prevent opioid-induced hyperalgesia and postanesthetic shivering.

For chronic pain, ketamine is used as an intravenous analgesic, mainly if the pain is neuropathic. It has the added benefit of counteracting spinal sensitization or wind-up phenomena experienced with chronic pain. In multiple clinical trials, ketamine infusions delivered short-term pain relief in neuropathic pain diagnoses, pain after a traumatic spine injury, fibromyalgia, and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). However, the 2018 consensus guidelines on chronic pain concluded that, overall, there is only weak evidence in favor of ketamine use in spinal injury pain, moderate evidence in favor of ketamine for CRPS, and weak or no evidence for ketamine in mixed neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and cancer pain. In particular, only for CRPS, there is evidence of medium to longer-term pain relief.

=== Depression ===
Ketamine is a rapid-acting antidepressant, but its effect is transient. Intravenous ketamine infusion in treatment-resistant depression may result in improved mood within 4 hours reaching the peak at 24 hours. A single dose of intravenous ketamine has been shown to result in a response rate greater than 60% as early as 4.5 hours after the dose (with a sustained effect after 24 hours) and greater than 40% after 7 days. Although only a few pilot studies have sought to determine the optimal dose, increasing evidence suggests that 0.5 mg/kg dose injected over 40 minutes gives an optimal outcome. The antidepressant effect of ketamine is diminished at 7 days, and most people relapse within 10 days. However, for a significant minority, the improvement may last 30 days or more.

One of the main challenges with ketamine treatment can be the length of time that the antidepressant effects last after finishing a course of treatment. A possible option may be maintenance therapy with ketamine, which usually runs twice a week to once in two weeks. Ketamine may decrease suicidal thoughts for up to three days after the injection.

An enantiomer of ketamine &quot;esketamine&quot; commercially sold as &quot;Spravato&quot; was approved as an antidepressant by the European Medicines Agency in 2019. Esketamine was approved as a nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression in the United States and elsewhere in 2019 (see Esketamine and Depression). The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommends esketamine as a third-line treatment for depression.

A Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials in adults with unipolar major depressive disorder, found that when compared with placebo, people treated with either ketamine or esketamine experienced reduction or remission of symptoms lasting 1 to 7 days. There were 18.7% (4.1 to 40.4%) more people reporting some benefit and 9.6% (0.2 to 39.4%) more who achieved remission within 24 hours of ketamine treatment. Among people receiving esketamine, 12.1% (2.5 to 24.4%) encountered some relief at 24 hours, and 10.3% (4.5 to 18.2%) had few or no symptoms. These effects did not persist beyond one week, although a higher dropout rate in some studies means that the benefit duration remains unclear.

Ketamine may partially improve depressive symptoms among people with bipolar depression at 24 hours after treatment, but not three or more days. Potentially, ten more people with bipolar depression per 1000 may experience brief improvement, but not the cessation of symptoms, one day following treatment. These estimates are based on limited available research.

In February 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an alert to healthcare professionals concerning compounded nasal spray products containing ketamine intended to treat depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda-2/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizures===
Ketamine is used to treat status epilepticus that has not responded to standard treatments, but only case studies and no randomized controlled trials support its use.

===Asthma===
Ketamine has been suggested as a possible therapy for children with severe acute asthma who do not respond to standard treatment. This is due to its bronchodilator effects. A 2012 Cochrane review found there were minimal adverse effects reported, but the limited studies showed no significant benefit.

== Contraindications ==
Some major contraindications for ketamine are:
* Severe cardiovascular disease such as unstable angina or poorly controlled hypertension
* Increased intracranial or intraocular pressure (however these remain controversial, with recent studies suggesting otherwise)
* Poorly controlled psychosis
* Severe liver disease such as cirrhosis
* Pregnancy
* Active substance use disorder (for serial ketamine injections)
* Age less than 3 months

== Adverse effects ==
At anesthetic doses, 10–20% of adults and 1–2% of children experience adverse psychiatric reactions that occur during emergence from anesthesia, ranging from dreams and dysphoria to hallucinations and emergence delirium. Psychotomimetic effects decrease adding lamotrigine and nimodipine and can be counteracted by pretreatment with a benzodiazepine or propofol. Ketamine anesthesia commonly causes tonic-clonic movements (greater than 10% of people) and rarely hypertonia. Vomiting can be expected in 5–15% of the patients; pretreatment with propofol mitigates it as well. Laryngospasm occurs only rarely with ketamine. Ketamine, generally, stimulates breathing; however, in the first 2–3 minutes of a high-dose rapid intravenous injection, it may cause a transient respiratory depression.

At lower sub-anesthetic doses, psychiatric side effects are prominent. Most people feel strange, spacey, woozy, or a sense of floating, or have visual distortions or numbness. Also very frequent (20–50%) are difficulty speaking, confusion, euphoria, drowsiness, and difficulty concentrating. The symptoms of psychosis such as going into a hole, disappearing, feeling as if melting, experiencing colors, and hallucinations are described by 6–10% of people. Dizziness, blurred vision, dry mouth, hypertension, nausea, increased or decreased body temperature, or feeling flushed are the common (&gt;10%) non-psychiatric side effects. All these adverse effects are most pronounced by the end of the injection, dramatically reduced 40 minutes afterward, and completely disappear within 4 hours after the injection.

=== Urinary and liver toxicity ===
Urinary toxicity occurs primarily in people who use large amounts of ketamine routinely, with 20–30% of frequent users having bladder complaints. It includes a range of disorders from cystitis to hydronephrosis to kidney failure. The typical symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis are frequent urination, dysuria, and urinary urgency sometimes accompanied by pain during urination and blood in urine. The damage to the bladder wall has similarities to both interstitial and eosinophilic cystitis. The wall is thickened and the functional bladder capacity is as low as 10–150 mL. Studies indicate that ketamine-induced cystitis is caused by ketamine and its metabolites directly interacting with urothelium, resulting in damage of the epithelial cells of the bladder lining and increased permeability of the urothelial barrier which results in clinical symptoms.

Management of ketamine-induced cystitis involves ketamine cessation as the first step. This is followed by NSAIDs and anticholinergics and, if the response is insufficient, by tramadol. The second line treatments are epithelium-protective agents such as oral pentosan polysulfate or intravesical (intra-bladder) instillation of hyaluronic acid. Intravesical botulinum toxin is also useful.

Liver toxicity of ketamine involves higher doses and repeated administration. In a group of chronic high-dose ketamine users, the frequency of liver injury was reported to be about 10%. There are case reports of increased liver enzymes involving ketamine treatment of chronic pain. Chronic ketamine abuse has also been associated with biliary colic, cachexia, gastrointestinal diseases, hepatobiliary disorder, and acute kidney injury.

=== Near-death experience ===
Most people who were able to remember their dreams during ketamine anesthesia report near-death experiences (NDEs) when the broadest possible definition of an NDE is used. Ketamine can reproduce features that commonly have been associated with NDEs. A 2019 large-scale study found that written reports of ketamine experiences had a high degree of similarity to written reports of NDEs in comparison to other written reports of drug experiences.

=== Dependence and tolerance ===
Although the incidence of ketamine dependence is unknown, some people who regularly use ketamine develop ketamine dependence. Animal experiments also confirm the risk of misuse. Additionally, the rapid onset of effects following insufflation may increase potential use as a recreational drug. The short duration of effects promotes bingeing. Ketamine tolerance rapidly develops, even with repeated medical use, prompting the use of higher doses. Some daily users reported withdrawal symptoms, primarily anxiety, shaking, sweating, and palpitations, following the attempts to stop. Cognitive deficits as well as increased dissociation and delusion symptoms were observed in frequent recreational users of ketamine.

== Interactions ==
Ketamine potentiates the sedative effects of propofol and midazolam. Naltrexone potentiates psychotomimetic effects of a low dose of ketamine, while lamotrigine and nimodipine decrease them. Clonidine reduces the increase of salivation, heart rate, and blood pressure during ketamine anesthesia and decreases the incidence of nightmares.

Clinical observations suggest that benzodiazepines may diminish the antidepressant effects of ketamine. It appears most conventional antidepressants can be safely combined with ketamine.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
==== Mechanism of action ====
Ketamine is a mixture of equal amounts of two enantiomers: esketamine and arketamine. Esketamine is a far more potent NMDA receptor pore blocker than arketamine. Pore blocking of the NMDA receptor is responsible for the anesthetic, analgesic, and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine. Blocking of the NMDA receptor results in analgesia by preventing central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons; in other words, ketamine&#x27;s actions interfere with pain transmission in the spinal cord.

The mechanism of action of ketamine in alleviating depression is not well understood and is an area of active investigation. Due to the hypothesis that NMDA receptor antagonism underlies the antidepressant effects of ketamine, esketamine was developed as an antidepressant. However, multiple other NMDA receptor antagonists, including memantine, lanicemine, rislenemdaz, rapastinel, and 4-chlorokynurenine, have thus far failed to demonstrate significant effectiveness for depression. Furthermore, animal research indicates that arketamine, the enantiomer with a weaker NMDA receptor antagonism, as well as (2&quot;R&quot;,6&quot;R&quot;)-hydroxynorketamine, the metabolite with negligible affinity for the NMDA receptor but potent alpha-7 nicotinic receptor antagonist activity, may have antidepressant action. This furthers the argument that NMDA receptor antagonism may not be primarily responsible for the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Acute inhibition of the lateral habenula, a part of the brain responsible for inhibiting the mesolimbic reward pathway and referred to as the &quot;anti-reward center&quot;, is another possible mechanism for ketamine&#x27;s antidepressant effects.

Possible biochemical mechanisms of ketamine&#x27;s antidepressant action include direct action on the NMDA receptor and downstream effects on regulators such as BDNF and mTOR. It is not clear whether ketamine alone is sufficient for antidepressant action or its metabolites are also important; the active metabolite of ketamine, hydroxynorketamine, which does not significantly interact with the NMDA receptor but nonetheless indirectly activates AMPA receptors, may also or alternatively be involved in the rapid-onset antidepressant effects of ketamine. In NMDA receptor antagonism, acute blockade of NMDA receptors in the brain results in an increase in the release of glutamate, which leads to an activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA receptors), which in turn modulate a variety of downstream signaling pathways to influence neurotransmission in the limbic system and mediate antidepressant effects. Such downstream actions of the activation of AMPA receptors include upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its signaling receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, deactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), and inhibition of the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase.

====Molecular targets====
Ketamine principally acts as a pore blocker of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. The &quot;S&quot;-(+) and &quot;R&quot;-(–) stereoisomers of ketamine bind to the dizocilpine site of the NMDA receptor with different affinities, the former showing approximately 3- to 4-fold greater affinity for the receptor than the latter. As a result, the &quot;S&quot; isomer is a more potent anesthetic and analgesic than its &quot;R&quot; counterpart.

Ketamine may interact with and inhibit the NMDAR via another allosteric site on the receptor.

With a couple of exceptions, ketamine actions at other receptors are far weaker than ketamine&#x27;s antagonism of the NMDA receptor (see the activity table to the right).

Although ketamine is a very weak ligand of the monoamine transporters (Ki &gt; 60 μM), it has been suggested that it may interact with allosteric sites on the monoamine transporters to produce monoamine reuptake inhibition. However, no functional inhibition (IC50) of the human monoamine transporters has been observed with ketamine or its metabolites at concentrations of up to 10,000 nM. Moreover, animal studies and at least three human case reports have found no interaction between ketamine and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine, which is of importance as the combination of a monoamine reuptake inhibitor with an MAOI can produce severe toxicity such as serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. Collectively, these findings shed doubt on the involvement of monoamine reuptake inhibition in the effects of ketamine in humans. Ketamine has been found to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, but instead of being due to dopamine reuptake inhibition, this may be via indirect/downstream mechanisms, namely through antagonism of the NMDA receptor.

Whether ketamine is an agonist of D2 receptors is controversial. Early research by the Philip Seeman group found ketamine to be a D2 partial agonist with a potency similar to that of its NMDA receptor antagonism. However, later studies by different researchers found the affinity of ketamine of &gt;10 μM for the regular human and rat D2 receptors, Moreover, whereas D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine can rapidly and powerfully suppress prolactin secretion, subanesthetic doses of ketamine have not been found to do this in humans and in fact, have been found to dose-dependently &quot;increase&quot; prolactin levels. Imaging studies have shown mixed results on inhibition of striatal [11C] raclopride binding by ketamine in humans, with some studies finding a significant decrease and others finding no such effect. However, changes in [11C] raclopride binding may be due to changes in dopamine concentrations induced by ketamine rather than binding of ketamine to the D2 receptor.

==== Relationships between levels and effects ====
Dissociation and psychotomimetic effects are reported in people treated with ketamine at plasma concentrations of approximately 100 to 250 ng/mL (0.42–1.1 μM). The typical intravenous antidepressant dosage of ketamine used to treat depression is low and results in maximal plasma concentrations of 70 to 200 ng/mL (0.29–0.84 μM). At similar plasma concentrations (70 to 160 ng/mL; 0.29–0.67 μM) it also shows analgesic effects. In 1–5 minutes after inducing anesthesia by rapid intravenous injection of ketamine, its plasma concentration reaches as high as 60–110 μM. When the anesthesia was maintained using nitrous oxide together with continuous injection of ketamine, the ketamine concentration stabilized at approximately 9.3 μM. In an experiment with purely ketamine anesthesia, people began to awaken once the plasma level of ketamine decreased to about 2,600 ng/mL (11 μM) and became oriented in place and time when the level was down to 1,000 ng/mL (4 μM). In a single-case study, the concentration of ketamine in cerebrospinal fluid, a proxy for the brain concentration, during anesthesia varied between 2.8 and 6.5 μM and was approximately 40% lower than in plasma.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Ketamine can be absorbed by many different routes due to both its water and lipid solubility. Intravenous ketamine bioavailability is 100% by definition, intramuscular injection bioavailability is slightly lower at 93%, and epidural bioavailability is 77%. Subcutaneous bioavailability has never been measured but is presumed to be high. Among the less invasive routes, the intranasal route has the highest bioavailability (45–50%) and oral – the lowest (16–20%). Sublingual and rectal bioavailabilities are intermediate at approximately 25–50%.

After absorption ketamine is rapidly distributed into the brain and other tissues. The plasma protein binding of ketamine is variable at 23–47%.
In the body, ketamine undergoes extensive metabolism. It is biotransformed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 isoenzymes into norketamine, which, in turn, is converted by CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 into hydroxynorketamine and dehydronorketamine. Low oral bioavailability of ketamine is due to the first-pass effect and, possibly, ketamine intestinal metabolism by CYP3A4. As a result, norketamine plasma levels are several-fold higher than ketamine following oral administration, and norketamine may play a role in anesthetic and analgesic action of oral ketamine. This also explains why oral ketamine levels are independent of CYP2B6 activity, unlike subcutaneous ketamine levels.

After an intravenous injection of tritium-labelled ketamine, 91% of the radioactivity is recovered from urine and 3% from feces. The medication is excreted mostly in the form of metabolites, with only 2% remaining unchanged. Conjugated hydroxylated derivatives of ketamine (80%) followed by dehydronorketamine (16%) are the most prevalent metabolites detected in urine.

== Chemistry ==
=== Structure ===
In chemical structure, ketamine is an arylcyclohexylamine derivative. Ketamine is a chiral compound. The more active enantiomer, esketamine (&quot;S&quot;-ketamine), is also available for medical use under the brand name Ketanest S, while the less active enantiomer, arketamine (&quot;R&quot;-ketamine), has never been marketed as an enantiopure drug for clinical use. While S-ketamine is more effective as an analgesic and anesthetic through NMDA receptor antagonism, R-ketamine produces longer-lasting effects as an antidepressant.

The optical rotation of a given enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its salts and free base form. The free base form of (&quot;S&quot;)‑ketamine exhibits dextrorotation and is therefore labelled (&quot;S&quot;)‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its hydrochloride salt shows levorotation and is thus labelled (&quot;S&quot;)‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride.

=== Detection ===
Ketamine may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized people, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma ketamine concentrations are usually in a range of 0.5–5.0 mg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically (during general anesthesia), 1–2 mg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 3–20 mg/L in victims of acute fatal overdosage. Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug use monitoring purposes. The presence of norketamine, a pharmacologically active metabolite, is useful for confirmation of ketamine ingestion.

== History ==
Ketamine was first synthesized in 1962 by Calvin L. Stevens, a professor of chemistry at Wayne State University and a Parke-Davis consultant. It was known by the developmental code name &quot;CI-581&quot;. After promising preclinical research in animals, ketamine was tested in human prisoners in 1964. These investigations demonstrated ketamine&#x27;s short duration of action and reduced behavioral toxicity made it a favorable choice over phencyclidine (PCP) as an anesthetic. The researchers wanted to call the state of ketamine anesthesia &quot;dreaming&quot;, but Parke-Davis did not approve of the name. Hearing about this problem and the &quot;disconnected&quot; appearance of treated people, Mrs. Edward F. Domino, the wife of one of the pharmacologists working on ketamine, suggested &quot;dissociative anesthesia&quot;. Following FDA approval in 1970, ketamine anesthesia was first given to American soldiers during the Vietnam War.

The discovery of antidepressive action of ketamine in 2000 has been described as the single most important advance in the treatment of depression in more than 50 years. It has sparked interest in NMDA receptor antagonists for depression, and has shifted the direction of antidepressant research and development.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
While ketamine is marketed legally in many countries worldwide, it is also a controlled substance in many countries.

* In Australia, ketamine is listed as a Schedule 8 controlled drug under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).
* In Canada, ketamine has been classified as a Schedule I narcotic, since 2005.
* In December 2013, the government of India, in response to rising recreational use and the use of ketamine as a date rape drug, added it to Schedule X of the Drug and Cosmetics Act requiring a special license for sale and maintenance of records of all sales for two years.
* In the United Kingdom, it became labeled a Class B drug on 12 February 2014.
* The increase in recreational use prompted ketamine to be placed in Schedule III of the United States Controlled Substances Act in August 1999.

=== Recreational use ===
At sub-anesthetic doses, ketamine produces a dissociative state, characterised by a sense of detachment from one&#x27;s physical body and the external world that is known as depersonalization and derealization. At sufficiently high doses, users may experience what is called the &quot;K-hole&quot;, a state of dissociation with visual and auditory hallucination. John C. Lilly, Marcia Moore, D. M. Turner, and David Woodard (among others) have written extensively about their own entheogenic and psychonautic experiences with ketamine. Turner died prematurely due to drowning during presumed unsupervised ketamine use. In 2006, the Russian edition of Adam Parfrey&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Culture&quot; was banned and destroyed by authorities owing to its inclusion of an essay by Woodard about the entheogenic use of, and psychonautic experiences with, ketamine.

Recreational ketamine use has been implicated in deaths globally, with more than 90 deaths in England and Wales in the years of 2005–2013. They include accidental poisonings, drownings, traffic accidents, and suicides. The majority of deaths were among young people. Several months after being found dead in his hot tub, actor Matthew Perry&#x27;s October 2023 apparent drowning death was revealed to have been caused by a ketamine overdose, and, while other factors were present, the acute effects of ketamine were ruled to be the primary cause of death. Due to its ability to cause confusion and amnesia, ketamine has been used for date rape.

== Research ==
Ketamine is under investigation for its potential in treating treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine is a known psychoplastogen, which refers to a compound capable of promoting rapid and sustained neuroplasticity.

Ketamine has shown anthelmintic activity in rats, with an effect comparable to ivermectin and albendazole at extremely high concentrations.

== Veterinary uses ==
In veterinary anesthesia, ketamine is often used for its anesthetic and analgesic effects on cats, dogs, rabbits, rats, and other small animals. It is frequently used in induction and anesthetic maintenance in horses. It is an important part of the &quot;rodent cocktail&quot;, a mixture of drugs used for anesthetising rodents. Veterinarians often use ketamine with sedative drugs to produce balanced anesthesia and analgesia, and as a constant-rate infusion to help prevent pain wind-up. Ketamine is also used to manage pain among large animals. It is the primary intravenous anesthetic agent used in equine surgery, often in conjunction with detomidine and thiopental, or sometimes guaifenesin.

Ketamine appears not to produce sedation or anesthesia in snails. Instead, it appears to have an excitatory effect.

<text>The Kickapoo people (; Kickapoo: Kiikaapoa or Kiikaapoi; ) are an Algonquian-speaking Native American tribe and Indigenous people in Mexico, originating in the region south of the Great Lakes. Today, three federally recognized Kickapoo tribes are in the United States: the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas, the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, and the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas. The Oklahoma and Texas bands are politically associated with each other. The Kickapoo in Kansas came from a relocation from southern Missouri in 1832 as a land exchange from their reserve there. Around 3,000 people are enrolled tribal members. 

Another band, the Tribu Kikapú, resides in Múzquiz Municipality in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila. Smaller bands live in Sonora, to the west, and Durango, to the southwest.

==Name and etymology==
According to some sources, the name &quot;Kickapoo&quot; ( in the Anishinaabe language and its Kickapoo cognate ) means &#x27;stands here and there&#x27;, which may have referred to the tribe&#x27;s migratory patterns. The name can also mean &#x27;wanderer&#x27;. This interpretation is contested and generally believed to be a folk etymology.

== History ==
=== Pre-1800s ===
The Kickapoo are an Algonquian-language people who likely migrated to or developed as a people in a large territory along the southern Wabash River in the area of modern Terre Haute, Indiana, where they were located at the time of first contact with Europeans in the 1600s. They were confederated with the larger Wabash Confederacy, which included the Piankeshaw and the Wea to their north, and the powerful Miami Tribe, to their east. A subgroup occupied the Upper Iowa River region in what was later known as northeast Iowa and the Root River region in southeast Minnesota in the late 1600s and early 1700s. This group was probably known by the clan name &quot;Mahouea&quot;, derived from the Illinoian word for wolf, &quot;m&#x27;hwea&quot;.

The earliest European contact with the Kickapoo tribe occurred during the La Salle Expeditions into Illinois Country in the late 17th century. The French colonists set up remote fur trading posts throughout the region, including on the Wabash River. They typically set up posts at or near Native American villages. Terre Haute was founded as an associated French village. The Kickapoo had to contend with a changing cast of Europeans; the British defeated the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War and took over nominal rule of former French territory east of the Mississippi River after 1763. They increased their own trading with the Kickapoo.

=== 1800s to present ===
The United States acquired the territory east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River after it gained independence from Great Britain (now the United Kingdom). As white settlers moved into the region from the United States&#x27; eastern areas, beginning in the early 19th century, the Kickapoo were under pressure. They negotiated with the United States over their territory in several treaties, including the Treaty of Vincennes, the Treaty of Grouseland, and the Treaty of Fort Wayne. They sold most of their lands to the United States and moved north to settle among the Wea people.

Rising tensions between the regional tribes and the United States led to Tecumseh&#x27;s War in 1811. The Kickapoo were among the closest allies of Shawnee leader Tecumseh. Many Kickapoo warriors participated in the Battle of Tippecanoe and the subsequent War of 1812 on the side of the British, hoping to expel the white American settlers from the region. 

The 1819 treaty of Edwardsville saw the Kickapoo cede the entirety of their holdings in Illinois comprising nearly one-half area of the state, in exchange for a smaller tract on the Osage river in Missouri and $3,000 worth of goods. The Kickapoo were not eager to move, partly as their assigned tract in Missouri was made of rugged hills and already occupied by the Osage, who were their hereditary enemies. Instead, half of the population traveled south and crossed onto the Spanish side of the Red River in modern day Texas. The US government quickly mobilized to prevent this emigration and force their removal to Missouri. This remnant of Kickapoo remained in Illinois under the guidance of Kennekuk, a prominent, nonviolent spiritual leader among the Kickapoo. He led his followers during the Indian Removal in the 1830s to their current tribal lands in Kansas. He died there of smallpox in 1852.

The close of the war led to a change of federal Indian policy in the Indiana Territory, and later the state of Indiana. White American leaders began to advocate the removal of tribes to lands west of the Mississippi River, to remove their claims to Native lands wanted by white American settlers. The Kickapoo were among the first tribes to leave Indiana under this program. They accepted land in Kansas and an annual subsidy in exchange for leaving their land in the state.

== Language ==

==Tribes and communities==
Three federally recognized Kickapoo communities are in the United States in Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. The Mexican Kickapoo are closely tied to the Texas and Oklahoma communities. These groups migrate annually among the three locations to maintain connections. Indeed, the Texas and Mexican branches are the same cross-border nation, called the Kickapoo of Coahuila/Texas.

=== Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas ===
The tribe in Kansas was home to prophet Kenekuk, who was known for his astute leadership that allowed the small group to maintain their reservation. Kenekuk wanted to keep order among the tribe he was in, while living in Kansas. He also wanted to focus on keeping the identity of the Kickapoo people, because of all the relocations they had done.

The basis of Kenekuk&#x27;s leadership began in the religious revivals of the 1820s and 1830s, with a blend of Protestantism and Catholicism. Kenekuk taught his tribesmen and white audiences to obey God&#x27;s commands, for sinners were damned to the pits of hell. Once the Kickapoo people got relocated to Kansas they resisted the ideas of Protestantism and Catholicism and started focusing more on farming, so they could provide food for the rest of the tribe. After this had happened they remained together and claimed some of the original land that they had before it was taken by Americans.

The Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas is located at in the northeastern part of the state in parts of three counties: Brown, Jackson, and Atchison. It has a land area of and a resident population of 4,419 as of the 2000 census. The largest community on the reservation is the city of Horton. The other communities are:

*Muscotah
*Netawaka 
*Powhattan
*Whiting
*Willis
===Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas===

The Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Texas is located at on the Rio Grande on the U.S.-Mexico border in western Maverick County, just south of the city of Ciudad Acuña, as part of the community of Rosita South. It has a land area of and a 2000 census population of 420 persons. The Texas Indian Commission officially recognized the tribe in 1977.

Other Kickapoo in Maverick County, Texas, constitute the &quot;South Texas Subgroup of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma&quot;. That tribe formerly owned of non-reservation land in Maverick County, primarily to the north of Eagle Pass, but has sold most of it to a developer. It has an office in that city.

=== Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma ===
After being expelled from the Republic of Texas, many Kickapoo moved south to Mexico, but the population of two villages settled in Indian Territory. One village settled within the Chickasaw Nation and the other within the Muscogee Creek Nation. These Kickapoo were granted their own reservation in 1883 and became recognized as the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma.

The reservation was short-lived. In 1893 under the Dawes Act, their communal tribal lands were broken up and assigned to separate member households by allotments. The tribe&#x27;s government was dismantled by the Curtis Act of 1898, which encouraged assimilation by Native Americans to the majority culture. Tribal members struggled under these conditions.

In the 1930s the federal and state governments encouraged tribes to reorganize their governments. This one formed the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma in 1936, under the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act.

Today the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma is headquartered in McLoud, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area is in Oklahoma, Pottawatomie, and Lincoln counties. They have 2,719 enrolled tribal members.

<text>The Katyusha () is a type of rocket artillery first built and fielded by the Soviet Union in World War II. Multiple rocket launchers such as these deliver explosives to a target area more intensively than conventional artillery, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. They are fragile compared to artillery guns, but are cheap, easy to produce, and usable on almost any chassis. The Katyushas of World War II, the first self-propelled artillery mass-produced by the Soviet Union, were usually mounted on ordinary trucks. This mobility gave the Katyusha, and other self-propelled artillery, another advantage: being able to deliver a large blow all at once, and then move before being located and attacked with counter-battery fire.

Katyusha weapons of World War II included the BM-13 launcher, light BM-8, and heavy BM-31. Today, the nickname &quot;Katyusha&quot; is also applied to newer truck-mounted post-Soviet – in addition to non-Soviet – multiple-rocket launchers, notably the common BM-21 Grad and its derivatives.

== Nickname ==
Initially, concerns for secrecy kept the military designation of the Katyushas from being known by the soldiers who operated them. They were called by code names such as &quot;Kostikov guns&quot;, after , the head of the RNII, the Reactive Scientific Research Institute, and finally classed as &quot;Guards Mortars&quot;. The name &quot;BM-13&quot; was only allowed into secret documents in 1942, and remained classified until after the war.

Because they were marked with the letter &quot;K&quot; (for Voronezh Komintern Factory), Red Army troops adopted a nickname from Mikhail Isakovsky&#x27;s popular wartime song, &quot;Katyusha&quot;, about a girl longing for her absent beloved, who has gone away on military service. Katyusha is the Russian equivalent of &quot;Katie&quot;, an endearing diminutive form of the name Katherine. &quot;Yekaterina&quot; is given the diminutive &quot;Katya,&quot; which itself is then given the affectionate diminutive &quot;Katyusha&quot;.

German troops coined the nickname &quot;Stalin&#x27;s organ&quot; (), after Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, comparing the visual resemblance of the launch array to a pipe organ, and the sound of the weapon&#x27;s rocket motors, a distinctive howling sound which terrified the German troops, adding a psychological warfare aspect to their use. Weapons of this type are known by the same name in Denmark (), Finland (), France (), Norway (), the Netherlands and Belgium (), Hungary (), Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries () as well as in Sweden ().

The heavy BM-31 launcher was also referred to as &quot;Andryusha&quot; (&quot;Андрюша&quot;, an affectionate diminutive of &quot;Andrew&quot;).

== World War II ==
Katyusha rocket launchers, which were built in Voronezh, were mounted on many platforms during World War II, including on trucks, artillery tractors, tanks, and armoured trains, as well as on naval and riverine vessels as assault support weapons. Soviet engineers also mounted single Katyusha rockets on lengths of railway track to serve in urban combat.

The design was relatively simple, consisting of racks of parallel rails on which rockets were mounted, with a folding frame to raise the rails to launch position. Each truck had 14 to 48 launchers. The M-13 rocket of the BM-13 system was long, in diameter and weighed .

The weapon is less accurate than conventional artillery guns, but is extremely effective in saturation bombardment. A battery of four BM-13 launchers could fire a salvo in 7–10 seconds that delivered 4.35 tons of high explosives over a impact zone, making its power roughly equivalent to that of 72 conventional artillery guns. With an efficient crew, the launchers could redeploy to a new location immediately after firing, denying the enemy the opportunity for counterbattery fire. Katyusha batteries were often massed in very large numbers to create a shock effect on enemy forces. The weapon&#x27;s disadvantage was the long time it took to reload a launcher, in contrast to conventional artillery guns which could sustain a continuous, albeit low, rate of fire.

=== Development ===



Initial development of solid propellant rockets was carried out by Nikolai Tikhomirov at the Soviet Gas Dynamics Laboratory (GDL), with the first test-firing of a solid fuel rocket carried out in March 1928, which flew for about 1,300 meters The rockets were used to assist take-off of aircraft and were later developed into the RS-82 and RS-132 (RS for , &#x27;rocket-powered shell&#x27;) in the early 1930s led by Georgy Langemak, including firing rockets from aircraft and the ground. In June 1938, GDL&#x27;s successor Reactive Scientific Research Institute (RNII) began building several prototype launchers for the modified 132 mm M-132 rockets. Firing over the sides of ZIS-5 trucks proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails longitudinally. In August 1939, the result was the BM-13 (BM stands for &quot;боевая машина&quot; (translit. &quot;boyevaya mashina&quot;), &#x27;combat vehicle&#x27; for M-13 rockets).

The first large-scale testing of the rocket launchers took place at the end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of . But the artillery branch was not fond of the Katyusha, because it took up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds, while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time. Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940, and the BM-13-16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production. Only forty launchers were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.

After their success in the first month of the war, mass production was ordered and the development of other models proceeded. The Katyusha was inexpensive and could be manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built, and by the end of the war total production reached about 10,000.

The truck-mounted Katyushas were installed on ZIS-6 6×4 trucks, as well as the two-axle ZIS-5 and ZIS-5V. In 1941, a small number of BM-13 launchers were mounted on STZ-5 artillery tractors. A few were also tried on KV tank chassis as the KV-1K, but this was a needless waste of heavy armour. Starting in 1942, they were also mounted on various British, Canadian and U.S. Lend-Lease trucks, in which case they were sometimes referred to as BM-13S. The cross-country performance of the Studebaker US6 2½-ton 6×6 truck was so good that it became the GAU&#x27;s standard mounting in 1943, designated BM-13N (&quot;normalizovanniy&quot;, &#x27;standardized&#x27;), and more than 1,800 of this model were manufactured by the end of World War II. After World War II, BM-13s were based on Soviet-built ZIS-151 trucks.

The 82 mm BM-8 was approved in August 1941, and deployed as the BM-8-36 on truck beds and BM-8-24 on T-40 and T-60 light tank chassis. Later these were also installed on GAZ-67 jeeps as the BM-8-8, and on the larger Studebaker trucks as the BM-8-48. In 1942, the team of scientists Leonid Shvarts, Moisei Komissarchik and engineer Yakov Shor received the Stalin Prize for the development of the BM-8-48.

Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was developed in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it became the basis for the BM-31-12 truck-mounted launcher.

A battery of BM-13-16 launchers included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having a crew of six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was to switch to a new position some 10 km away due to the ease with which the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.

=== Variants ===
Soviet World War II rocket systems were named according to set patterns:
* Ground vehicles were designated BM-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; referred to the rocket model and &quot;y&quot; the number of launch rails or tubes.
* towed trailers and sledges used the format M-&quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; 
* In navy use, the order of the elements was different, taking the form &quot;y&quot;-M-&quot;x&quot;

For example, the BM-8-16 was a vehicle with 16 rails for M-8 rockets while the BM-31-12 fired the M-31 rockets from 12 launch tubes. Short names such as BM-8 or BM-13 were used as well. The chassis carrying the launcher was not defined in the name e.g. BM-8-24 referred to a truck mounted launcher (ZIS-5) as well as on the T-40 tank and on the STZ-3 artillery tractor. 

Chassis for the launchers included:
* Soviet-built ZIS-5, ZIS-6, GAZ-AA trucks, and post war the ZIS-151
* STZ-5 tracked artillery tractor
* T-40 tank
* Lend-lease provided Studebaker US6 truck,
* Armored train car,
* River boat,
* Towed sledge,
* Towed trailer,
* Backpack (portable variant, so called &quot;mountain Katyusha&quot;),


The M-8 and M-13 rocket could also be fitted with smoke warheads, although this was not common.

==== Foreign variants ====

The Axis powers had captured Katyushas during the war. Germany considered producing a local copy, but instead created the &quot;8 cm Raketen-Vielfachwerfer&quot;, which was based on the Katyusha.

Romania had started developing its Mareșal tank destroyer in late 1942. One of the first experimental models was equipped with a Katyusha rocket launcher and tested in the summer of 1943. The project was not continued.

=== Combat history ===

The multiple rocket launchers were top secret at the beginning of World War II and a special unit of NKVD troops was raised to operate them. On July 14, 1941, an experimental artillery battery of seven launchers was first used in battle at Rudnya, Smolensk Oblast under the command of Captain Ivan Flyorov, destroying a concentration of German troops with tanks, armored vehicles and trucks in the marketplace, causing massive German Army casualties and panicked retreat from the town. This was the first time Katyusha ever used in compact. Following the success, the Red Army organized new Guards mortar batteries for the support of infantry divisions. A battery&#x27;s complement was standardized at four launchers. They remained under NKVD control until German &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; rocket launchers became common later in the war.

On August 8, 1941, Stalin ordered the formation of eight special Guards mortar regiments under the direct control of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK). Each regiment comprised three battalions of three batteries, totalling 36 BM-13 or BM-8 launchers. Independent Guards mortar battalions were also formed of 12 launchers in three batteries of four. By the end of 1941, there were eight regiments, 35 independent battalions, and two independent batteries in service, a total of 554 launchers.

In June 1942 heavy Guards mortar battalions were formed around the new M-30 static rocket launch frames, consisting of 96 launchers in three batteries. In July, a battalion of BM-13s was added to the establishment of a tank corps. In 1944, the BM-31 was used in motorized heavy Guards mortar battalions of 48 launchers. In 1943, Guards mortar brigades, and later divisions, were formed equipped with static launchers.

At dawn on September 5, the preparatory artillery and air bombardment began all along the front of the 24th, 1st Guards and 66th armies. But even on the main lines of advance the density of the artillery fire was not great and did not yield the necessary results. The attack began after Katyusha volleys.

By the end of 1942, 57 regiments were in service—together with the smaller independent battalions, this was the equivalent of 216 batteries: 21% BM-8 light launchers, 56% BM-13, and 23% M-30 heavy launchers. By the end of the war, the equivalent of 518 batteries were in service.

== Post-war development ==

The success and economy of multiple rocket launchers (MRL) have led them to continue to be developed. In the years following WWII, the BM-13 was replaced by the 140 mm BM-14 and the BM-31 was replaced by the 240 mm BM-24. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 Grad launchers somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27 Uragan. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.

BM-13s were used in the Korean War by the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army and Korean People&#x27;s Army against the South Korean and United Nations forces. Soviet BM-13s were known to have been imported to China before the Sino-Soviet split and were operational in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. The Viet Minh deployed them against the French Far East Expeditionary Corps during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu at the end of the First Indochina War.

== Recognition and honours ==
Participants in the creation of the Katyusha rocket launcher received official recognition only in 1991. By decree of the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev dated June 21, 1991, I. T. Kleymenov, G. E. Langemak, V. N. Luzhin, B. S. Petropavlovsky, B. M. Slonimer and N. I. Tikhomirov were posthumously awarded title of the Hero of Socialist Labour for their work on the creation of the Katyusha.

<text>Kathy Acker (April 18, 1947 [disputed] – November 30, 1997) was an American experimental novelist, playwright, essayist, and postmodernist writer, known for her idiosyncratic and transgressive writing that dealt with themes such as childhood trauma, sexuality and rebellion. Her writing incorporates pastiche and the cut-up technique, involving cutting-up and scrambling passages and sentences; she also defined her writing as existing in the post-&quot;nouveau roman&quot; European tradition. In her texts, she combines biographical elements, power, sex and violence.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The only child of Donald and Claire (nee Weill) Lehman, Acker was born Karen Lehman in New York City in 1947, although the Library of Congress gives her birth year as 1948, while the editors of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; gave her birth year as April 18, 1948, New York, New York, U.S. She died on November 30, 1997, in Tijuana, Mexico. Most obituaries, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, cited her birth year as 1944.

Her family was from a wealthy, assimilated German-Jewish background that was culturally but not religiously Jewish. Her maternal grandmother, Florence Weill, was an Austrian Jew who had inherited a small fortune from her husband&#x27;s glove-making business. Acker&#x27;s grandparents went into political exile from Alsace-Lorraine prior to World War I, due to the rising nationalism of pre-Nazi Germany, moving to Paris and then to the United States. According to Acker, her grandparents were &quot;first generation French-German Jews&quot; whose ancestors originally hailed from the Pale of Settlement. In an interview with the magazine &quot;Tattoo Jew&quot;, Acker stated that religious Judaism &quot;means nothing to me. I don&#x27;t run away from it, it just means nothing to me&quot; and elaborated that her parents were &quot;high-German Jews&quot; who held cultural prejudices against Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews. (&quot;I was trained to run away from Polish Jews.&quot;)

Acker was raised in her mother and stepfather&#x27;s home in the Sutton Place neighborhood of Manhattan&#x27;s prosperous Upper East Side. Her father, Donald Lehman abandoned the family before Acker&#x27;s birth. Her relationship with her domineering mother, even into adulthood, was fraught with hostility and anxiety because Acker felt unloved and unwanted. Her mother soon remarried, to Albert Alexander, whose surname Kathy, née Karen, was given, although the writer later described her mother&#x27;s union with Alexander as a passionless marriage to an ineffectual man. Kathy had a half-sister, Wendy, by her mother&#x27;s second marriage, but the two women were never close and long estranged. By the time of Acker&#x27;s death, she had requested that her friends not contact Wendy, as some had suggested. In 1978, her mother Claire Alexander, committed suicide. As an adult, Acker tried to track down her father, but abandoned her search after she discovered that her father had disappeared after killing a trespasser on his yacht and spending six months in a psychiatric asylum until the state dismissed the murder charges.

===Education===
Acker attended the Lenox School, a private school for girls on the Upper East Side. As an undergraduate at Brandeis University, she studied Classics and &quot;took advantage of loosened mores, attending orgies thrown by theatre kids.&quot; In 1966, she married Robert Acker, and took his surname. Robert Acker was the son of lower-middle-class Polish-Jewish immigrants. Her mother and stepfather had hoped she would marry a wealthy man and did not expect the marriage to Acker to last long. She became interested in writing novels and, with Robert, moved to California to attend University of California, San Diego, where David Antin, Eleanor Antin, and Jerome Rothenberg were among her teachers. She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1968. After moving to New York, she attended two years of graduate school at the City College of New York in Classics, specializing in Greek. She did not earn a graduate degree. During her time in New York, she was employed as a file clerk, secretary, stripper, and porn performer.

===Start of career and relationships===
Although her birth name was Karen, she was known as Kathy to her friends and family. Her first work appeared in print as part of the burgeoning New York City literary underground of the mid-1970s. During the 1970s, Acker often moved back and forth among San Diego, San Francisco, and New York, becoming a fixture of the downtown scene in the East Village. In February 1978, she married the composer and experimental musician Peter Gordon due to a cancer scare, and the pair ended their seven-year relationship shortly afterward. Later, she had relationships with the theorist, publisher, and critic Sylvère Lotringer and then with the filmmaker and film theorist Peter Wollen, as well as a brief affair with media theorist and scholar McKenzie Wark. In 1996, Acker left San Francisco and moved to London to live with the writer and music critic Charles Shaar Murray. She married twice. She was openly bisexual.

In 1979, she won the Pushcart Prize for her short story &quot;New York City in 1979.&quot; During the early 1980s, she lived in London, where she wrote several of her most critically acclaimed works. After returning to the United States in the late 1980s, she worked as an adjunct professor at the San Francisco Art Institute for about six years and as a visiting professor at several universities, including the University of Idaho, the University of California, San Diego (UC-San Diego), University of California, Santa Barbara (UC-Santa Barbara), the California Institute of Arts, and Roanoke College.

In July 1989, Acker was involved in a literary controversy when the trade periodical &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; revealed that around four pages from Harold Robbins&#x27; novel &quot;The Pirate&quot; (1974) had been lifted without permission and integrated into Acker&#x27;s novel &quot;The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec&quot; (1975), which had recently been re-published in the UK in a selection of early works by Acker titled &quot;Young Lust&quot; (1989). After Paul Gitlin saw the exposé in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, he informed Robbins&#x27; UK publisher, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who requested that Acker&#x27;s publisher Unwin Hyman withdraw and pulp &quot;Young Lust&quot;. Representatives for Acker explained that she was well known for her deliberate use of literary appropriation—or bricolage, a postmodern technique akin to plagiarism in which fragments of pre-existing works are combined along with original writings to create new literary works. After an intervention by William S. Burroughs—a novelist who used appropriation in his own works of the 1960s—Robbins issued a statement to give Acker retroactive permission to appropriate from his work, avoiding legal action on his publisher&#x27;s part.

===Later life and death===
In April 1996, Acker was diagnosed with breast cancer and she elected to have a double mastectomy. In January 1997, she wrote about her loss of faith in conventional medicine in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article, &quot;The Gift of Disease.&quot;

In the article, she explains that after unsuccessful surgery, which left her feeling physically mutilated and emotionally debilitated, she rejected the passivity of the patient in the medical mainstream and began to seek out the advice of nutritionists, acupuncturists, psychic healers, and Chinese herbalists. She found appealing the claim that instead of being an object of knowledge, as in Western medicine, the patient becomes a seer, a seeker of wisdom, that illness becomes the teacher and the patient the student. After pursuing several forms of alternative medicine in England and the United States, Acker died a year and a half later, on November 30, 1997, aged 50, from complications of cancer in a Tijuana alternative cancer clinic, the only alternative-treatment facility that accepted her with her advanced stage of cancer. She died in what was called &quot;Room 101&quot;, to which her friend Alan Moore quipped, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing that woman can&#x27;t turn into a literary reference.&quot; (Room 101, in the climax of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, turns out to be the torture chamber in which the Inner Party subjects its political prisoners to their own worst fears.)

==Literary overview==
Acker was associated with the New York punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The punk aesthetic influenced her literary style. In the 1970s, before the term &quot;postmodernism&quot; was popular, Acker began writing her books. These books contain features that would eventually be considered postmodernist work. Her controversial body of work borrows heavily from the experimental styles of William S. Burroughs and Marguerite Duras, with critics often comparing her writing to that of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Jean Genet. Critics have noticed links to Gertrude Stein and photographers Cindy Sherman and Sherrie Levine. She was influenced by the Black Mountain School poets, William S. Burroughs, David Antin, Carolee Schneeman, Eleanor Antin, French critical theory, mysticism, and pornography, as well as classic literature.

Acker&#x27;s novels exhibit a fascination with, and an indebtedness to, tattoos. She dedicated &quot;Empire of the Senseless&quot; to her tattooist.

Acker published her first book, &quot;Politics&quot;, in 1972. Although the collection of poems and essays did not garner much critical or public attention, it did establish her reputation within the New York punk scene. In 1973, she published her first novel (under the pseudonym Black Tarantula), &quot;The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula: Some Lives of Murderesses&quot;. The following year, she published her second novel, &quot;I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac: Imagining&quot;. Both works are reprinted in &quot;Portrait of an Eye&quot;.

In 1979, she received popular attention after winning a Pushcart Prize for her short story &quot;New York City in 1979.&quot; She did not receive critical attention, however, until publishing &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in 1982. The opening of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an obvious re-writing of Charles Dickens&#x27;s work of the same name. It features her usual subject matter, including a semi-autobiographical account of her mother&#x27;s suicide and the appropriation of several other texts, including Pierre Guyotat&#x27;s violent and sexually explicit &quot;Eden Eden Eden.&quot; That same year, Acker published a chapbook, entitled &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Erica Jong&quot;. She appropriated from a number of influential writers. These writers include Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, John Keats, William Faulkner, T. S. Eliot, the Brontë sisters, the Marquis de Sade, Georges Bataille, and Arthur Rimbaud.

Acker wrote the script for the 1983 film &quot;Variety&quot;. Acker wrote a text on the photographer Marcus Leatherdale that was published in 1983, in an art catalogue for the Molotov Gallery in Vienna.

After a series of failed contracts to publish &quot;Blood and Guts in High School&quot;, Acker made her British literary debut in 1984 when Picador published the novel, followed by publication in New York by Grove Press. That same year, she was signed by Grove Press, one of the legendary independent publishers committed to controversial and avant-garde writing; she was one of the last writers taken on by Barney Rosset before the end of his tenure there. Most of her work was published by them, including re-issues of important earlier work. She wrote for several magazines and anthologies, including the periodicals &quot;RE/Search&quot;, &quot;Angel Exhaust&quot;, &quot;monochrom&quot; and &quot;Rapid Eye&quot;. As she neared the end of her life, her work was more well-received by the conventional press; for example, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published a number of her essays, interviews, and articles, among them was an interview with the Spice Girls. &quot;In Memoriam to Identity&quot; draws attention to popular analyses of Rimbaud&#x27;s life and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, constructing or revealing social and literary identity. Although known in the literary world for creating a whole new style of feminist prose and for her transgressive fiction, she was also a punk and feminist icon for her devoted portrayals of subcultures, strong-willed women, and violence.

Notwithstanding the increased recognition she garnered for &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Blood and Guts in High School&quot; is often considered Acker&#x27;s breakthrough work. She first began composing the book in 1973 while living in Solana Beach, writing and drawing fragments in notebooks before compiling the manuscript in 1979. Published in 1984, it is one of her most extreme explorations of sexuality and violence. Borrowing from, among other texts, Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, &quot;Blood and Guts&quot; details the experiences of Janey Smith, a sex-addicted and pelvic inflammatory disease-ridden urbanite who is in love with a father who sells her into slavery. In its original publications by Picador and Grove Press, the final two chapters were accidentally reversed from Acker&#x27;s intended order; the mistake was corrected in the 2017 re-publication of the novel. Many critics criticized the book for being demeaning toward women, and Germany banned it completely. Acker published the German court judgment against &quot;Blood and Guts in High School&quot; in &quot;Hannibal Lecter, My Father&quot;.

Acker published &quot;Empire of the Senseless&quot; in 1988, and considered it a turning point in her writing. While she still borrows from other texts, including Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, the appropriation is less obvious. However, one of Acker&#x27;s more controversial appropriations is from William Gibson&#x27;s 1984 text, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, in which Acker equates code with the female body and its militaristic implications. In 1988, she published &quot;Literal Madness: Three Novels&quot;, which included three previously-published works: &quot;Florida&quot; deconstructs and reduces John Huston&#x27;s 1948 film noir &quot;Key Largo&quot; into its base sexual politics, &quot;Kathy Goes to Haiti&quot; details a young woman&#x27;s relationship and sexual exploits while on vacation, and &quot;My Death My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini&quot; provides a fictional &quot;autobiography&quot; of the Italian filmmaker in which he solves his own murder.

Between 1990 and 1993, she published four more books: &quot;In Memoriam to Identity&quot; (1990); &quot;Hannibal Lecter, My Father&quot; (1991); &quot;Portrait of an Eye: Three Novels&quot; (1992), also composed of already-published works; and &quot;My Mother: Demonology&quot; (1992). Her collection, &quot;Portrait of an Eye&quot;, was championed by publisher Fred Jordan, who had discovered her work at Grove Press before moving to Pantheon and sent an early copy of the book to William Burroughs in 1991. Her last novel, &quot;Pussy, King of the Pirates&quot;, was published in 1996, which she, Rico Bell, and the rest of rock band the Mekons also reworked into an operetta, which they performed at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 1997.

In 2007, Amandla Publishing re-published Acker&#x27;s articles that she wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; from 1989 to 1991. Grove Press published two unpublished early novellas in the volume &quot;Rip-Off Red, Girl Detective and The Burning Bombing of America&quot;, and a collection of selected work, &quot;Essential Acker&quot;, edited by Amy Scholder and Dennis Cooper in 2002.

Three volumes of her non-fiction have been published and republished since her death. In 2002, New York University staged &quot;Discipline and Anarchy&quot;, a retrospective exhibition of her works, while in 2008, London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Arts screened an evening of films influenced by Acker.

==Posthumous reputation==
A collection of essays on Acker&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Lust for Life: On the Writings of Kathy Acker&quot;, edited by Carla Harryman, Avital Ronell, and Amy Scholder, was published by Verso Books in 2006 and includes essays by Nayland Blake, Leslie Dick, Robert Glück, Carla Harryman, Laurence Rickels, Avital Ronell, Barrett Watten, and Peter Wollen. In 2009, the first collection of essays to focus on academic study of Acker, &quot;Kathy Acker and Transnationalism&quot; was published.
In 2015, Semiotext(e) published &quot;I&#x27;m Very Into You&quot;, a book of Acker&#x27;s email correspondence with media theorist McKenzie Wark, edited by Matias Viegener, her executor and head of the Kathy Acker Literary Trust. Her personal library is housed in a reading room at the University of Cologne in Germany, and her papers are divided between NYU&#x27;s Fales Library and the Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Duke University. A limited body of her recorded readings and discussions of her works exists in the special collections archive of University of California, San Diego.

In 2013, the Acker Award was launched and named for Kathy Acker. Awarded to living and deceased members of the San Francisco or New York avant-garde art scene, the award is financed by Alan Kaufman and Clayton Patterson.

In 2017, American writer and artist Chris Kraus published &quot;After Kathy Acker: A Literary Biography&quot;, the first book-length biography of Acker&#x27;s life experiences and literary strategies. American writer Douglas A. Martin published &quot;Acker&quot;. a book-length study of Acker&#x27;s influences and artistic trajectory.

In 2018, British writer Olivia Laing published &quot;Crudo&quot;, a novel which references Acker&#x27;s works and life, and whose main character is a woman called Kathy, suffering double breast cancer; yet book&#x27;s events are situated in August–September 2017. In 2019, Amy Scholder and Douglas A. Martin co-edited &quot;Kathy Acker: The Last Interview and Other Conversations&quot;. Kate Zambreno wrote on Kathy Acker in her essay &quot;New York City, Summer 2013&quot; published as part of the collection &quot;Screen Tests&quot; (Harpers Collins, 2019). The essay was originally published in &quot;Icon&quot; edited by Amy Scholder (Feminist Press, 2014).

Between May 1, 2019 and August 4, 2019, the exhibition &quot;I, I, I, I, I, I, I, Kathy Acker&quot; was held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. The exhibition featured works by more than 40 artists, such as Reza Abdoh, Johanna Hedva and Reba Maybury. In 2020, Grove Press issued a new edition of &quot;Portrait of an Eye&quot;, with an introduction by Kate Zambreno.

<text>The ; ), also spelled Koh-e-Noor, Kohinoor and Koh-i-Nur, is one of the largest cut diamonds in the world, weighing . It is part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. The diamond is currently set in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

There are multiple conflicting legends on the origin of the diamond. However, in the words of the colonial administrator Theo Metcalfe, there is &quot;very meagre and imperfect&quot; evidence of the early history of the Koh-i-Noor before the 1740s. There is no record of its original weight, but the earliest attested weight is 186 old carats (191 metric carats or 38.2 g). The first verifiable record of the diamond comes from a history by Muhammad Kazim Marvi of the 1740s invasion of Northern India by Nader Shah. Marvi notes the Koh-i-Noor as one of many stones on the Mughal Peacock Throne that Nader looted from Delhi. The diamond then changed hands between various empires in south and west Asia, until being given to Queen Victoria after the Second Anglo-Sikh War and the British East India Company&#x27;s annexation of the Punjab in 1849, during the reign of the then 11-year-old Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh. The young king ruled under the shadow of the Company ally Gulab Singh, the first Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, who had previously possessed the stone.

Originally, the stone was of a similar cut to other Mughal-era diamonds, like the Daria-i-Noor, which are now in the Iranian National Jewels. In 1851, it went on display at the Great Exhibition in London, but the lackluster cut failed to impress viewers. Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, ordered it to be re-cut as an oval brilliant by Coster Diamonds. By modern standards, the culet (point at the bottom of a gemstone) is unusually broad, giving the impression of a black hole when the stone is viewed head-on; it is nevertheless regarded by gemologists as &quot;full of life&quot;.

Since arriving in the UK, it has only been worn by female members of the British royal family. It is said to bring bad luck if it is worn by a man. Victoria wore the stone in a brooch and a circlet. After she died in 1901, it was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra. It was transferred to the Crown of Queen Mary in 1911, and to the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1937 for her coronation.

Today, the diamond is on public display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. The governments of India, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan have all claimed ownership of the Koh-i-Noor, demanding its return ever since India gained independence from the British Empire in 1947. The British government insists the gem was obtained legally under the terms of the Last Treaty of Lahore in 1849 and has rejected the claims. 

In 2018, at the Supreme Court of India the Archeological Survey of India clarified that the diamond was surrendered to the British and &quot;it (the diamond) was neither stolen nor forcibly taken away&quot;.

== History ==
=== Legendary origin ===
Babur, the Turco-Mongol founder of the Mughal Empire, wrote about a &quot;famous&quot; diamond that weighed just over 187 old carats – approximately the size of the once 186-carat Koh-i-Noor. According to the diary of Alauddin Khalji of the Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, he acquired a large diamond when he invaded the kingdoms of southern India at the beginning of the 14th century and looted it from the Kakatiyas. It later passed on to succeeding dynasties of the sultanate, and Babur received the diamond in 1526 as a tribute for his conquest of Delhi and Agra at the Battle of Panipat. However, it is impossible to verify these details exactly about when or where it was found, and many competing theories exist as to its original owner.

For some time it was alleged that while in the possession of Shah Jahan&#x27;s son Aurangzeb, the stone was cut by Hortense Borgia, a Venetian lapidarist, who reduced the weight of the large stone to . For this carelessness, Borgia was reprimanded and fined 10,000 rupees. However according to recent research, the story of Borgia cutting the diamond is not correct, and most probably mixed up with that of the Orlov, part of Catherine the Great&#x27;s imperial Russian scepter in the Kremlin.

=== Early history ===

In early Indian history, diamonds were the most valued of gemstones. However, during the period of Mughal rule, diamonds lost this distinction. When looking at the Mughal treasury, Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the Grand vizier to Akbar, noted that red spinels and Burmese rubies had become the most desirable jewels by the nobility. During this time the Persian new year ceremony, Nowruz, had become a period in which the subjects could bring offerings of gems and money to the imperial family in exchange for political promotions within the greater bureaucracy. By the time Shah Jahan ascended the throne as the fifth Mughal emperor, there were so many jewels in the treasury that he decided to use many of them in the making of the ornate Peacock Throne in 1635.

Over a century later in 1738 Nader Shah founded the Afsharid dynasty. Following the overthrow of the Safavid dynasty of Persia two years earlier, he began raiding Mughal territory before soon launching a full-scale invasion of North-West India. This invading force soon captured Delhi where, after a massacre of the civilian population, the army began a systematic looting of the wealth of the city and the treasury of the Mughal Empire. With nearly 10,000 wagons of loot, along with millions of rupees and an assortment of other historic jewels, Nader Shah also carried away the imperial Peacock Throne. Nader Shah&#x27;s biographer, Muhammad Kazim Marvi, first recorded seeing the Koh-i-Noor in the 1740s on the head of one of the peacocks on the throne, along with other prominent gems such as the great Timur Ruby and the Daria-i-Noor. It is alleged that Nader Shah exclaimed &quot;Koh-i-Noor!&quot;, Persian and Hindi-Urdu for &quot;Mountain of Light&quot;, when he first obtained the famous stone. One of his consorts is even noted to have said, &quot;If a strong man were to throw four stones – one north, one south, one east, one west, and a fifth stone up into the air – and if the space between them were to be filled with gold, all would not equal the value of the Koh-i-Noor&quot;.

After Nadir Shah was killed and his empire collapsed in 1747, the Koh-i-Noor fell to his grandson, who in 1751 gave it to Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the Afghan Empire, in return for his support. One of Ahmed&#x27;s grandsons, Shah Shuja Durrani, wore a bracelet containing the Koh-i-Noor on the occasion of Mountstuart Elphinstone&#x27;s visit to Peshawar in 1808. A year later, Shah Shuja formed an alliance with the United Kingdom to help defend against a possible invasion of Afghanistan by Russia. He was quickly overthrown, but fled with the diamond to Lahore (in modern Pakistan), where in one account, Ranjit Singh, founder of the Sikh Empire, in return for his hospitality, insisted upon the gem being given to him, and he took possession of it in 1813.

Shah Shuja&#x27;s memoirs dispute this, which claim Ranjit Singh extorted the diamond from him by having his son tortured in front of him.

=== In Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s possession ===
Ranjit Singh had the diamond examined by jewelers of Lahore for two days to ensure that Shuja had not tricked him. After the jewelers confirmed its genuineness, he donated 125,000 rupees to Shuja. Ranjit Singh then asked the principal jewelers of Amritsar to estimate the diamond&#x27;s value; the jewelers declared that the value of the diamond was &quot;far beyond all computation&quot;. Ranjit Singh then affixed the diamond to the front of his turban, and paraded on an elephant to enable his subjects to see it. He used to wear it as an armlet during major festivals such as Diwali and Dusserah, and took it with him during travel. He would exhibit it to prominent visitors, especially British officers.

One day, Ranjit Singh asked the diamond&#x27;s former owners – Shuja and his wife Wafa Begum – to estimate its value. Wafa Begum replied that if a strong man threw a stone in four cardinal directions and vertically, Koh-i-Noor would be worth more than the gold and precious stones filled in the space. Ranjit Singh grew paranoid about the Koh-i-Noor being stolen, because in the past, another valuable jewel had been stolen from him while he was intoxicated. He kept the diamond within a high-security facility at the Gobindgarh Fort when it was not in use. When the diamond was to be transported, it was placed in a pannier on a guarded camel; 39 other camels with identical panniers were included in the convoy; the diamond was always placed on the first camel immediately behind the guards, but great secrecy was maintained regarding which camel carried it. Only Ranjit Singh&#x27;s treasurer Misr Beli Ram knew which camel carried the diamond.

In June 1839, Ranjit Singh suffered his third stroke, and it became apparent that he would die soon. On his deathbed, he started giving away his valuable possessions to religious charities, and appointed his eldest son Kharak Singh as his successor. A day before his death, on 26 June 1839, a major argument broke out between his courtiers regarding the fate of Koh-i-Noor. Ranjit Singh himself was too weak to speak, and communicated using gestures. Bhai Gobind Ram, the head Brahmin of Ranjit Singh, insisted that the king had willed Koh-i-Noor and other jewels to the Jagannath Temple, Puri: the king apparently supported this claim through gestures, as recorded in his court chronicle &quot;Umdat ul-Tawarikh&quot;. However, treasurer Beli Ram insisted that it was a state property rather than Ranjit Singh&#x27;s personal property, and therefore, should be handed over to Kharak Singh.

After Ranjit Singh&#x27;s death, Beli Ram refused to send the diamond to the temple, and hid it in his vaults. Meanwhile, Kharak Singh and wazir Dhian Singh also issued orders stating that the diamond should not be taken out of Lahore.

=== In Gulab Singh&#x27;s possession ===

On 8 October 1839, the new emperor Kharak Singh was overthrown in a coup by his prime minister Dhian Singh. The prime minister&#x27;s brother Gulab Singh, Raja of Jammu, came into possession of the Koh-i-Noor. Kharak Singh later died in prison, soon followed by the mysterious death of his son and successor Nau Nihal Singh on 5 November 1840. Gulab Singh held onto the stone until January 1841, when he presented it to emperor Sher Singh in order to win his favour, after his brother Dhian Singh negotiated a ceasefire between Sher Singh and the overthrown empress Chand Kaur. Gulab Singh had attempted to defend the widowed empress at her fort in Lahore, during two days of conflict and shelling by Sher Singh and his troops. Despite handing over the Koh-i-noor, Gulab Singh as a result of the ceasefire returned safely to Jammu with a wealth of gold and other jewels taken from the treasury.

==== Worn by child emperor Duleep Singh ====
On 15 September 1843, both Sher Singh and prime minister Dhian Singh were assassinated in a coup led by Ajit Singh Sandhawalia. However, the next day in a counter coup led by Dhian&#x27;s son Hira Singh the assassins were killed. Aged 24, Hira Singh succeeded his father as prime minister, and installed the five-year old Duleep Singh as emperor. The Koh-i-noor was now fastened to the arm of the child emperor in court at Lahore. Duleep Singh and his mother empress Jind Kaur, had till then resided in Jammu, the kingdom governed by Gulab Singh.

Following his nephew Prime Minister Hira Singh&#x27;s assassination on 27 March 1844, and the subsequent outbreak of the First Anglo-Sikh War, Gulab Singh himself led the Sikh empire as its prime minister, and despite defeat in the war, he became the first Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir on 16 March 1846, under the Treaty of Amritsar.

=== Surrender to Queen Victoria ===

On 29 March 1849, following the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the Kingdom of Punjab was formally annexed to Company rule, and the Last Treaty of Lahore was signed, officially ceding the Koh-i-Noor to Queen Victoria and the Maharaja&#x27;s other assets to the company. Article III of the treaty read:

The lead signatory of the treaty for the by then eleven-year-old Maharaja Duleep Singh was his commander-in-chief Tej Singh, a loyalist of Maharaja Gulab Singh who had previously been in possession of the Koh-i-Noor and gained Kashmir from the Sikh empire, via treaty with Britain, following the First Anglo-Sikh War.

The Governor-General in charge of the ratification of this treaty was the Marquess of Dalhousie. The manner of his aiding in the transfer of the diamond was criticized even by some of his contemporaries in Britain. Although some thought it should have been presented as a gift to Queen Victoria by the East India Company, it is clear that Dalhousie believed the stone was a spoil of war, and treated it accordingly, ensuring that it was officially surrendered to her by Duleep Singh, the youngest son of Ranjit Singh. The presentation of the Koh-i-Noor by the East India Company to the queen was the latest in a long history of transfers of the diamond as a coveted spoil of war. Duleep Singh had been placed in the guardianship of Dr John Spencer Login, a surgeon in the East India Company Army serving in the Presidency of Bengal. Duleep Singh moved to England in 1854 and spent the rest of his life in exile.

==== Journey to the United Kingdom ====

In due course, the Governor-General received the Koh-i-Noor from Dr Login, who had been appointed Governor of the Citadel, on 6 April 1848 under a receipt dated 7 December 1849, in the presence of members of the Board of Administration for the affairs of the Punjab: Sir Henry Lawrence (President), C. G. Mansel, John Lawrence and Sir Henry Elliot (Secretary to the Government of India).

Legend in the Lawrence family has it that before the voyage, John Lawrence left the jewel in his waistcoat pocket when it was sent to be laundered, and was most grateful when it was returned promptly by the valet who found it.

On 1 February 1850, the jewel was sealed in a small iron safe inside a red dispatch box, both sealed with red tape and a wax seal and kept in a chest at Bombay Treasury awaiting a steamer ship from China. It was then sent to England for presentation to Queen Victoria in the care of Captain J. Ramsay and Brevet Lt. Col F. Mackeson under tight security arrangements, one of which was the placement of the dispatch box in a larger iron safe. They departed from Bombay on 6 April on board HMS &quot;Medea&quot;, captained by Captain Lockyer.

The ship had a difficult voyage: an outbreak of cholera on board when the ship was in Mauritius had the locals demanding its departure, and they asked their governor to open fire on the vessel and destroy it if there was no response. Shortly afterwards, the vessel was hit by a severe gale that blew for some 12 hours.

On arrival in Britain on 29 June, the passengers and mail were unloaded in Plymouth, but the Koh-i-Noor stayed on board until the ship reached Spithead, near Portsmouth, on 1 July. The next morning, Ramsay and Mackeson, in the company of Mr Onslow, the private secretary to the Chairman of the Court of Directors of the British East India Company, proceeded by train to East India House in the City of London and passed the diamond into the care of the chairman and deputy chairman of the East India Company.

The Koh-i-Noor was formally presented to Queen Victoria on 3 July 1850 at Buckingham Palace by the deputy chairman of the East India Company. The date had been chosen to coincide with the Company&#x27;s 250th anniversary.

=== The Great Exhibition ===

Members of the public were given a chance to see the Koh-i-Noor when The Great Exhibition was staged at Hyde Park, London, in 1851. It represented the might of the British Empire and took pride of place in the eastern part of the central gallery.

Its mysterious past and advertised value of £1–2 million drew large crowds. At first, the stone was put inside a gilded birdcage, but after complaints about its dull appearance, the Koh-i-Noor was moved to a case with black velvet and gas lamps in the hope that it would sparkle better. Despite this, the flawed and asymmetrical diamond still failed to please viewers.

=== 1852 re-cutting ===
Originally, the diamond had 169 facets and was long, wide, and deep. It was high-domed, with a flat base and both triangular and rectangular facets, similar in overall appearance to other Mughal-era diamonds which are now in the Iranian Crown Jewels.

Disappointment in the appearance of the stone was not uncommon; &quot;Punch&quot; magazine referred to it as the &quot;Mountain of Darkness,&quot; a play on the English translation of its name as &quot;Mountain of Light&quot;. After consulting mineralogists, including Sir David Brewster, Victoria&#x27;s husband Prince Albert with the consent of the government decided to have the diamond re-cut. For this task, he employed one of the largest and most famous Dutch diamond merchants, Mozes Coster. He sent to London one of his most experienced artisans, Levie Benjamin Voorzanger, and his assistants.
On 17 July 1852, the cutting began at the factory of Garrard &amp; Co. in Haymarket, using a steam-powered mill built specially for the job by Maudslay, Sons and Field. Supervised by Albert and the Duke of Wellington, and the technical direction of the Queen&#x27;s mineralogist, James Tennant, the cutting took 38 days, cost Albert £8,000, and reduced the diamond from 186 old carats (191 modern carats or 38.2 g) to its current weight . The stone now measures long, wide, and deep. Brilliant-cut diamonds usually have 58 facets, but the Koh-i-Noor has 8 additional &quot;star&quot; facets around the culet, making a total of 66 facets.

The great loss of weight was to some extent due to removal of several flaws, one especially big, which Voorzanger discovered. Although Prince Albert was dissatisfied with such a huge reduction, most experts agreed that Voorzanger had made the right decision and did the job with impeccable skill. When Queen Victoria showed the re-cut diamond to the young Maharaja Duleep Singh, the Koh-i-Noor&#x27;s last non-British owner, he was apparently unable to speak for several minutes afterwards.

The much lighter but more dazzling stone was mounted in a honeysuckle brooch and a circlet worn by the queen. At this time, it belonged to her personally, and was not yet part of the Crown Jewels. Although Victoria wore it often, she became uneasy about the way in which the diamond had been acquired. In a letter to her eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, she wrote in the 1870s: &quot;No one feels more strongly than I do about India or how much I opposed our taking those countries and I think no more will be taken, for it is very wrong and no advantage to us. You know also how I dislike wearing the Koh-i-Noor&quot;.

=== Crown Jewel ===

After Queen Victoria&#x27;s death, the Koh-i-Noor was set in the Crown of Queen Alexandra, the wife of Edward VII, that was used to crown her at their coronation in 1902. The diamond was transferred to the Crown of Queen Mary in 1911, and finally to Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1937. When the Queen Mother died in 2002, the crown was placed on top of her coffin for the lying-in-state and funeral. Queen Camilla was crowned with Queen Mary&#x27;s Crown at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla on 6 May 2023, but without the Koh-i-Noor diamond.

All these crowns are on display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London with crystal replicas of the diamond set in the older crowns. The original bracelet given to Queen Victoria can also be seen there. A glass model of the Koh-i-Noor shows visitors how it looked when it was brought to the United Kingdom. Replicas of the diamond in this and its re-cut forms can also be seen in the &#x27;Vault&#x27; exhibit at the Natural History Museum, London.

During the Second World War, the Crown Jewels were moved from their home at the Tower of London to Windsor Castle. They were kept in leather hat boxes under lock and key in the office of the Royal Librarian Sir Owen Morshead until 1941 when they were transferred to a specially dug tunnel under the walls of the castle. At this time Morshead and the Keeper of the Tower Armouries removed some of the larger stones, including the Koh-i-Noor, and wrapping them in cotton wool, inserted them in a glass preserving-jar, which was then placed in a biscuit tin; the thinking being that, unlike the bulkier crowns, this would allow their swift relocation if the German invasion occurred.

== Ownership dispute ==
The Koh-i-Noor has long been a subject of diplomatic controversy, with India, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan all demanding its return from the UK at various points.

=== India ===
The Government of India first demanded the return of the Koh-i-Noor as soon as its independence was granted in 1947. A second request followed in 1953, the year of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Each time, the British Government rejected the claims, saying that ownership was non-negotiable.

In 2000, several members of the Indian Parliament signed a letter calling for the diamond to be given back to India, claiming it was taken illegally. British officials said that a variety of claims meant it was impossible to establish the diamond&#x27;s original owner, and that it had been part of Britain&#x27;s heritage for more than 150 years.

In July 2010, while visiting India, David Cameron, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, said of returning the diamond, &quot;If you say yes to one you suddenly find the British Museum would be empty. I am afraid to say, it is going to have to stay put.&quot; On a subsequent visit in February 2013, he said, &quot;They&#x27;re not having that back.&quot;

In April 2016, the Indian Culture Ministry stated it would make &quot;all possible efforts&quot; to arrange the return of the Koh-i-Noor to India. The then Solicitor General of India, Ranjit Kumar said, &quot;It was given voluntarily by Ranjit Singh to the British as compensation for help in the Sikh Wars. The Koh-i-Noor is not a stolen object.&quot;

=== Pakistan ===
In 1976, Pakistan asserted its ownership of the diamond, saying its return would be &quot;a convincing demonstration of the spirit that moved Britain voluntarily to shed its imperial encumbrances and lead the process of decolonisation&quot;. In a letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, James Callaghan, wrote, &quot;I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of the Sikh Empire in 1849. I could not advise Her Majesty that it should be surrendered.&quot;

=== Afghanistan ===
In 2000, the Taliban&#x27;s foreign affairs spokesman, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said the Koh-i-Noor was the legitimate property of Afghanistan, and demanded for it to be handed over to the regime. &quot;The history of the diamond shows it was taken from us (Afghanistan) to India, and from there to Britain. We have a much better claim than the Indians&quot;, he said. The Afghan claim derives from Shah Shuja Durrani&#x27;s memoirs, which states he surrendered the diamond to Ranjit Singh while Singh was having his son tortured in front of him, so he argued that the Maharajah of Lahore acquired the stone illegitimately.

===Proposed compromises===
Because of the disputes over the diamond&#x27;s rightful ownership, there have been various compromises suggested. These include dividing it into four, with a piece given to each of Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan, with the final piece retained by the British Crown. Another suggestion is that the jewel be housed in a special museum at the Wagah border between India and Pakistan. However this suggestion does not cater to Afghan claims, nor the reality of current British possession. The British Government rejects these compromises, and has stated since the end of the British Raj that the status of the diamond is &#x27;non-negotiable&#x27;.

== In popular culture ==
A rumor that the Koh-i-Noor is cursed may have originated with the &quot;Delhi Gazette&quot;; it was soon repeated in &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;, and Queen Victoria herself expressed concern about the curse. This led to a counter-rumor that the curse attached only to male rulers. 

The Koh-i-Noor was one of the inspirations for the eponymous gemstone in &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868), a 19th-century British epistolary novel by Wilkie Collins, generally considered to be the first full length detective novel in the English language. In his preface to the first edition of the book, Collins says that he based his eponymous &quot;Moonstone&quot; on the histories of two stones: the Orlov, a diamond in the Russian Imperial Sceptre, and the Koh-i-Noor. In the 1966 Penguin Books edition of &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, J. I. M. Stewart states that Collins used G. C. King&#x27;s to research the history of the Koh-i-Noor.

The Koh-i-Noor also features in Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1925 detective novel &quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot; where it is hidden somewhere inside a large country house and is discovered at the end of the novel. The diamond had been stolen from the Tower of London by a Parisian gang leader who replaced it with a replica stone.

The Koh-i-Noor is a central plot point in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s 1990 historical novel and satire, &quot;Flashman and the Mountain of Light&quot;, which refers to the diamond in its title.

&quot;Kohinoor&quot;, a 2005 Indian mystery television series, follows a search for the diamond after its supposed return to India. 

The Koh-i-Noor is a main part of the 2014 Indian film &quot;Bang Bang!&quot;. 

&quot;Kolkatay Kohinoor&quot;, a 2019 mystery thriller film is based on a similar premise and explores the diamond&#x27;s fictional relations to Kolkata.

<text>Kvass is a fermented, cereal-based, low-alcoholic beverage of cloudy appearance and sweet-sour taste.

Kvass originates from northeastern Europe, where grain production was considered insufficient for beer to become a daily drink. The first written mention of kvass is found in &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, describing the celebration of Vladimir the Great&#x27;s baptism in 988. 

In the traditional method, kvass is made from a mash obtained from rye bread or rye flour and malt soaked in hot water, fermented for about 12 hours with the help of sugar and bread yeast or baker&#x27;s yeast at room temperature. In industrial methods, kvass is produced from wort concentrate combined with various grain mixtures. It is a popular drink in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine. Kvass (or beverages similar to it) are also popular in some parts of China, Finland, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.

==Terminology==
The word &quot;kvass&quot; is ultimately from Proto-Indo-European base (&#x27;to become sour&#x27;). In English it was first mentioned in a text around 1553 as &quot;quass&quot;. Nowadays, the name of the drink is almost the same in most languages: in Polish: &#x27; (, to differentiate it from , &#x27;acid&#x27;, originally from , &#x27;sour&#x27;); Belarusian: , &#x27;; Russian: , &#x27;; Ukrainian: , ; Latvian: &#x27;; Romanian: &#x27;; Hungarian: &#x27;; Serbian: &#x27;; Chinese: , ; Eastern Finnish: &#x27;. Non-cognates include Estonian &#x27;, Finnish &#x27;, Latvian &#x27; (), Latgalian (, similar to Lithuanian ), Lithuanian &#x27; (, similar to Latvian &#x27;), and Swedish &#x27; ().

==Production==
In the traditional method, either dried rye bread or a combination of rye flour and rye malt is used. The dried rye bread is extracted with hot water and incubated for 12 hours at room temperature, after which bread yeast and sugar are added to the extract and fermented for 12 hours at . Alternatively, rye flour is boiled, mixed with rye malt, sugar, and baker&#x27;s yeast and then fermented for 12 hours at .

The simplest industrial method produces kvass from a wort concentrate. The concentrate is warmed up and mixed with a water and sugar solution to create wort with a sugar concentration of 5–7% and pasteurized to stabilize it. After that, the wort is pumped into a fermentation tank, where baker&#x27;s yeast and lactic acid bacteria culture is added, and the solution is fermented for 12–24 hours at . Only around 1% of the extract is fermented out into ethanol, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid. Afterwards, the kvass is cooled to , clarified through either filtration or centrifugation, and adjusted for sugar content, if necessary.

Initially, it was filled in large containers from which the kvass was sold on streets, but now, the vast majority of industrially produced kvass is filled and sold in 1–3-litre plastic bottles and has a shelf life of 4–6 weeks.

Kvass is usually 0.5–1.0% alcohol by weight, but may sometimes be as high as 2.0%.

==History==
The exact origins of kvass are unclear, and whether it was invented by Slavic people or any other Eastern European ethnicity is unknown, although some Polish sources claim that kvass was invented by Slavs. Kvass has existed in the northeastern part of Europe, where grain production is thought to have been insufficient for beer to become a daily drink. It has been known among the Early Slavs since the 10th century. Possibly invented in the Kievan Rus&#x27; and known there since at least the 10th century, kvass has become one of the symbols of East Slavic cuisine. The first written mention of kvass is found in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, describing the celebration of Vladimir the Great&#x27;s baptism in 988, when kvass along with mead and food was given out to the citizens of Kiev. Kvass-making remained a daily household activity well into the 19th century.

In the second half of the 19th century, with military engagement, increasing industrialization, and large-scale projects, such as the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway creating a growing need to supply large numbers of people with foodstuff for extended periods of time, kvass became commercialized; more than 150 kvass varieties, such as apple, pear, mint, lemon, chicory, raspberry, and cherry were recorded. As commercial kvass producers began selling it in barrels on the streets, domestic kvass-making started to decline. For example, in the year ended 30 June 1912, there were 17 factories in the Governorate of Livonia, producing a total of 437,255 gallons of kvass.

In the 1890s, the first scientific studies into the production of kvass were conducted in Kiev, and in the 1960s, commercial mass production technology of kvass was further developed by chemists in Moscow.

== By country ==
===Russia===
Although the massive flood of western soft drinks after the fall of the USSR, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi substantially shrank the market share of kvass in Russia, in recent years it has regained its original popularity, often marketed as a national soft drink or &quot;patriotic&quot; alternative to the famous Coca-Cola drink. For example, the Russian company Nikola has promoted its brand of kvass with an advertising campaign emphasizing &quot;anti-cola-nisation.&quot; Moscow-based Business Analytica reported in 2008 that bottled kvass sales had tripled since 2005 and estimated that per capita kvass consumption in Russia would reach three litres in 2008. Between 2005 and 2007, cola&#x27;s share of the Moscow soft drink market fell from 37% to 32%. Meanwhile, kvass&#x27;s share more than doubled over the same time period, reaching 16% in 2007. In response, Coca-Cola launched its own brand of kvass in May 2008. This is the first time a foreign company has made an appreciable entrance into the Russian kvass market. Pepsi has also signed an agreement with a Russian kvass manufacturer to act as a distribution agent. The development of new technologies for storage and distribution, and heavy advertising, have contributed to this surge in popularity; three new major brands have been introduced since 2004.

===Belarus===
Belarus has several breweries producing kvass: Alivaria Brewery, , and . It also has a variety of kvass tasting and entertainment festivals. The largest show takes place in the city of Lida.

===Poland===


Kvass may have appeared in Poland as early as the 10th century, it quickly became a trendy beverage thanks to its easy and cheap method of production as well as its thirst-quenching and digestion-aiding qualities. By the time of Jogaila&#x27;s rule, kvass was universal. It was at first commonly drunk by peasants in the eastern parts of the country, but eventually the drink spread to the szlachta. One example of this is , an old type of Polish kvass that is still sold as a contemporary brand. Its origins can be traced back to the 1500s, when founded the town of Kodeń on land granted by the Polish king. He then bought the mills and 24 villages of the surrounding areas from their previous landowners. Then, the taste of kvass became known among the Polish szlachta, who used it for its supposed healing qualities. Throughout the 19th century, kvass remained popular among Poles who lived in the Congress Poland of Imperial Russia and in Austrian Galicia, especially the inhabitants of rural areas. Up until the 19th century, recipes for local variants of kvass remained well-guarded secrets of families, religious orders, and monasteries.

The beverage production in Poland on an industrial scale can be traced back to the more recent interwar period, when the Polish state regained independence as the Second Polish Republic. In interwar Poland, kvass was brewed and sold in mass numbers by magnates of the Polish drinks market like the Varsovian brewery Haberbusch i Schiele or the &quot;Karpiński&quot; company. Kvass remained particularly popular in eastern Poland. However, with the collapse of many prewar businesses and much of the Polish industry during World War II, kvass lost popularity following the aftermath of the war. It also gradually lost favour throughout the 20th century upon introducing mass-produced soft drinks and carbonated water into the Polish market. In the early 21st century, kvass experienced a renaissance in Poland due to the heightened interest in healthy diets, natural products, and traditions.

Kvass can be found in some supermarkets and grocery stores, where it is known in Polish as (). Commercial bottled versions of the drink are the most common variant, as some companies specialise in manufacturing a more modern version of the drink (some variants are manufactured in Poland whilst others are imported from its neighbouring countries, Lithuania and Ukraine being the most popular source). However, old recipes for a traditional version of kvass exist. Some of them originate from eastern Poland; others from more central regions include adding honey for flavour. Although commercial kvass is much easier to find in Polish shops, Polish manufacturers of more natural and healthier variants of kvass have become increasingly popular both within and outside of the country&#x27;s borders. A less healthy alternative of quick-to-make variants using kvass concentrate can also be purchased in shops. One colloquial Polish name for is (&#x27;rural orangeade&#x27;). In some Polish villages, such as Zaława and its surroundings, kvass was traditionally produced on every farm.

===Latvia===

In Latvian, kvass was also called . After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the street vendors disappeared from the streets of Latvia due to new health laws that banned its sale on the street. Economic disruptions forced many kvass factories to close. The Coca-Cola Company moved in and began quickly dominating the soft drink market. In 1998, the local soft drink industry adapted by selling bottled kvass and launching aggressive marketing campaigns. This surge in sales was stimulated by the fact that kvass sold for about half the price of Coca-Cola. In just three years, kvass constituted as much as 30% of the soft drink market in Latvia, while the market share of Coca-Cola fell from 65% to 44%. The Coca-Cola Company had losses in Latvia of about $1 million in 1999 and 2000. Coca-Cola responded by purchasing kvass manufacturers and producing kvass at their own soft drink plants.

On 30 September 2010, the Saeima (parliament) adopted quality and classification requirements for kvass, defining it as &quot;a beverage obtained by fermenting a mixture of kvass wort with a yeast of microorganism cultures to which sugar and other food sources and food additives are added or not added after the fermentation&quot; with a maximum ABV of 1.2 percent, and differentiating it from an unfermented non-alcoholic mixture of grain product extract, water, flavourings, preservatives, and other ingredients, which is designated as a &quot;kvass (malt) beverage&quot;.

In 2014, Latvian kvass producers won seven medals at the Russian Beverage exposition in Moscow, with Ilgezeem&#x27;s &quot;Porter Tanheiser&quot; kvass winning two gold medals. In 2019, &quot;Iļģuciema kvass&quot; ranked second in the Most Loved Latvian Beverage Brand Top, and first in the subsequent 2020 top.

===Lithuania===
In Lithuania, kvass is known as and is widely available in bottles and drafts. The first written records of kvass and kvass recipes in Lithuania appeared in the 16th century. Many restaurants in Vilnius make their own kvass, which they sell on the premises. Some brands of mass-produced Lithuanian kvass are also sold on the Polish market. Strictly speaking, &quot;gira&quot; can be made from anything fermentable—such as caraway tea, beetroot juice, or berries—but it is made mainly from black bread, or barley or rye malt.

===Estonia===
In Estonia, kvass is known as . Initially, it was made from either brewer&#x27;s spent grain or wort left to ferment in a closed container, but later, special kvass bread () or industrially produced malt concentrate started to be used. Nowadays, &quot;&quot; generally is industrially produced with the use of pasteurization, the addition of preservatives, and artificial carbonation.

===Finland===
In Finland, a fermented drink made from a mixture of rye flour and rye malt was ubiquitous in parts of Eastern Finland and was heated in the oven. It was called (which can also be used to refer to small beer) or (in Eastern Finnish), while nowadays the drink is often known as () and is available in many work canteens, gas stations, and lower-end restaurants.

Traditionally, was usually made in households once a week from a mixture of malted and unmalted rye grains. Other grains, such as oats or barley, were also sometimes used; occasionally, leftover potatoes or pieces of bread were added. Everything was mixed with water in a metal cauldron or a clay pot and kept warm in the oven or by the stove for at least six hours for the mixture to darken and sweeten. Sometimes, the grain solids were filtered out through lautering. In Eastern Finland, the mixture was formed into large loaves and briefly baked for the crust to turn brown. The porridge or pieces of the malt bread were mixed into a wooden cask with water and fermented for one or two days with a previous batch, a sourdough starter, spontaneously or in more recent times with commercial baker&#x27;s yeast. In the early 20th century, with sugar becoming more readily available, it started replacing the malting process, and modern &quot;&quot; is made from dark rye malt, sugar, and baker&#x27;s yeast.

===Sweden===
Kvass was also made in Sweden, where it was known as &#x27; (). However, it was very likely limited only to areas where rye bread was the standard bread as opposed to crispbread, which was more common in Western Sweden and did not go stale. &#x27; was still being made in Öland farms up until 1935.

===China===
In the mid-19th century, kvass was introduced in Xinjiang, where it became known as () and eventually became one of the region&#x27;s signature drinks. It is usually consumed cold together with barbecue. In 1900, Russian merchant Ivan Churin founded Harbin Churin Food () in Harbin, offering kvass and other specialities, and by 2009, the company was already producing 5,000 tons of kvass a year, making up 90% of the local market. In 2011, it moved its kvass factory to Tianjin, increasing its sales to 20,000 tons in the first year.

===Elsewhere===
Following the influx of immigrants in the UK due to the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, several stores selling cuisine and beverages from Eastern Europe were established, many of which stock imported (primarily pasteurised) kvass. As a result, since then a number of different flavours of not-pasteurised kvass, fermented using sourdough starter culture, have also become available in the UK in 2023. In recent years, kvass has also become more popular in Serbia.

In 2017, a version of kvass from carrots or beets was developed in California by the producer Biotic Ferments.

== Nutritional composition ==
Naturally fermented kvass contains 5.9%±0.02 carbohydrates, of which 5.7%±0.02 are sugars (mostly fructose, glucose, and maltose), as well as 0.71±0.09, 1.28±0.12, and 18.14±0.48 mg/100 g of thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin respectively. In addition to that, 19 different aroma volatile compounds have also been identified in naturally fermented kvass, most notably 4-penten-2-ol (10.05×107 PAU), which has a fruity odour; carvone (2.28×107 PAU) originating from caraway fruits used as an ingredient in rye bread; and ethyl octanoate (1.03×107 PAU), which has an odour of fruit and fat.

Traditional kvass made from rye wholemeal bread has been found to have, on average, twice the dietary fibre content, 60% more antioxidant activity (due to the addition of caramel and citric acid to the bread), and three times less reducing sugar content than industrially produced kvass.

Historically, alcohol by volume (ABV) of kvass varied depending on the ingredients, microbial flora, as well as temperature and length of fermentation, but nowadays it is usually not higher than 1.5%. The wide availability and consumption of kvass, including by children of all ages, together with the lacking indication of ABV for kvass on the labels and in advertisements, has been named a possible contributor to chronic alcoholism in the former Soviet Union.

== Use ==
Apart from drinking, kvass is also used by families as the basis for many dishes. Traditional cold summertime soups of Russian cuisine, such as okroshka, botvinya, and tyurya, are based on kvass.

==Cultural references==
The name of Kvasir, a wise being in Norse mythology, is possibly related to kvass.

There is a Russian expression, (literally &#x27;to clamber from bread to kvass&#x27;), which means &#x27;to live from hand to mouth&#x27; or to &#x27;scrape by&#x27; referring to the frugal practice amongst the poor peasants of making kvass from stale leftovers of rye bread. Another kvass-related term in Russian is &quot;&quot; (квасной патриотизм) dating back to an 1823 letter by the Russian poet Pyotr Vyazemsky who defined it as &quot;unqualified praise of everything that is your own&quot;.

In the Polish language, several traditional sayings that reference exist. There is also an old Polish folk rhyming song. It shows the history of kvass in the country as having been drunk by generations of Polish reapers as a thirst-quenching beverage used during periods of hard work during the harvest season, long before it became popular as a medicinal drink among the szlachta. The song goes as follows:
In the Polish village of Zaława, there is a customary game known as (&#x27;volcano&#x27;) that is associated with the beverage. The fermentation of sugars makes kvass slightly carbonated, thus, when shaken or heated, it can cause the liquid to suddenly and rapidly rise out of an open vessel. Playing &quot;wulkan&quot; consists of vigorously shaking a bottle of kvass shortly before handing it to someone else who is going to drink it; the sudden &quot;shooting out&quot; of the beverage onto the person opening the bottle is a source of entertainment for the youth of Zaława and a well-known prank during regional festivities.

In Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, French soldiers are aware of kvass on entering Moscow, enjoying it but referring to it as &quot;pig&#x27;s lemonade&quot;. In Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s &quot;Motl, Peysi the Cantor&#x27;s Son&quot;, diluted kvass is the focus of one of Motl&#x27;s older brother&#x27;s get-rich-quick schemes.

<text>The Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem is a result in dynamical systems about the persistence of quasiperiodic motions under small perturbations. The theorem partly resolves the small-divisor problem that arises in the perturbation theory of classical mechanics.

The problem is whether or not a small perturbation of a conservative dynamical system results in a lasting quasiperiodic orbit. The original breakthrough to this problem was given by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1954. This was rigorously proved and extended by Jürgen Moser in 1962 (for smooth twist maps) and Vladimir Arnold in 1963 (for analytic Hamiltonian systems), and the general result is known as the KAM theorem.

Arnold originally thought that this theorem could apply to the motions of the Solar System or other instances of the -body problem, but it turned out to work only for the three-body problem because of a degeneracy in his formulation of the problem for larger numbers of bodies. Later, Gabriella Pinzari showed how to eliminate this degeneracy by developing a rotation-invariant version of the theorem.

==Statement==

===Integrable Hamiltonian systems===

The KAM theorem is usually stated in terms of trajectories in phase space of an integrable Hamiltonian system. The motion of an integrable system is confined to an invariant torus (a doughnut-shaped surface). Different initial conditions of the integrable Hamiltonian system will trace different invariant tori in phase space. Plotting the coordinates of an integrable system would show that they are quasiperiodic.

===Perturbations===

The KAM theorem states that if the system is subjected to a weak nonlinear perturbation, some of the invariant tori are deformed and survive, i.e. there is a map from the original manifold to the deformed one that is continuous in the perturbation. Conversely, other invariant tori are destroyed: even arbitrarily small perturbations cause the manifold to no longer be invariant and there exists no such map to nearby manifolds. Surviving tori meet the non-resonance condition, i.e., they have “sufficiently irrational” frequencies. This implies that the motion on the deformed torus continues to be quasiperiodic, with the independent periods changed (as a consequence of the non-degeneracy condition). The KAM theorem quantifies the level of perturbation that can be applied for this to be true.

Those KAM tori that are destroyed by perturbation become invariant Cantor sets, named &quot;Cantori&quot; by Ian C. Percival in 1979.

The non-resonance and non-degeneracy conditions of the KAM theorem become increasingly difficult to satisfy for systems with more degrees of freedom. As the number of dimensions of the system increases, the volume occupied by the tori decreases.

As the perturbation increases and the smooth curves disintegrate we move from KAM theory to Aubry–Mather theory which requires less stringent hypotheses and works with the Cantor-like sets.

The existence of a KAM theorem for perturbations of quantum many-body integrable systems is still an open question, although it is believed that arbitrarily small perturbations will destroy integrability in the infinite size limit.

===Consequences===

An important consequence of the KAM theorem is that for a large set of initial conditions the motion remains perpetually quasiperiodic.

==KAM theory==

The methods introduced by Kolmogorov, Arnold, and Moser have developed into a large body of results related to quasiperiodic motions, now known as KAM theory. Notably, it has been extended to non-Hamiltonian systems (starting with Moser), to non-perturbative situations (as in the work of Michael Herman) and to systems with fast and slow frequencies (as in the work of Mikhail B. Sevryuk).

== KAM torus ==
A manifold formula_1 invariant under the action of a flow formula_2 is called an invariant formula_3-torus, if there exists a diffeomorphism formula_4 into the standard formula_3-torus formula_6 such that the resulting motion on formula_7 is uniform linear but not static, &quot;i.e.&quot; formula_8，where formula_9 is a non-zero constant vector, called the &quot;frequency vector&quot;. 

If the frequency vector formula_10 is: 

* rationally independent (&quot;a.k.a.&quot; incommensurable, that is formula_11 for all formula_12)
* and &quot;badly&quot; approximated by rationals, typically in a &quot;Diophantine&quot; sense: formula_13,

then the invariant formula_3-torus formula_1 (formula_16) is called a &quot;KAM torus&quot;. The formula_17 case is normally excluded in classical KAM theory because it does not involve small divisors.

<doc id="16974" wikidata="Q864457" url="?curid=16974" title="Knapsack problem">
<text>The knapsack problem is the following problem in combinatorial optimization:
:&quot;Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.&quot;
It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.

The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897.

The subset sum problem is a special case of the decision and 0-1 problems where each kind of item, the weight equals the value: formula_1. In the field of cryptography, the term &quot;knapsack problem&quot; is often used to refer specifically to the subset sum problem. The subset sum problem is one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems.

==Applications==
Knapsack problems appear in real-world decision-making processes in a wide variety of fields, such as finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials, selection of investments and portfolios, selection of assets for asset-backed securitization, and generating keys for the Merkle–Hellman and other knapsack cryptosystems.

One early application of knapsack algorithms was in the construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples, it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point values, it is more difficult to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions to the best of their abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.

A 1999 study of the Stony Brook University Algorithm Repository showed that, out of 75 algorithmic problems related to the field of combinatorial algorithms and algorithm engineering, the knapsack problem was the 19th most popular and the third most needed after suffix trees and the bin packing problem.

== Definition ==
The most common problem being solved is the 0-1 knapsack problem, which restricts the number &quot;formula_2&quot; of copies of each kind of item to zero or one. Given a set of &quot;formula_3&quot; items numbered from 1 up to &quot;formula_3&quot;, each with a weight &quot;formula_5&quot; and a value &quot;formula_6&quot;, along with a maximum weight capacity &quot;formula_7&quot;,
: maximize formula_8
: subject to formula_9 and formula_10.
Here &quot;formula_2&quot; represents the number of instances of item &quot;formula_12&quot; to include in the knapsack. Informally, the problem is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack&#x27;s capacity.

The bounded knapsack problem (BKP) removes the restriction that there is only one of each item, but restricts the number formula_2 of copies of each kind of item to a maximum non-negative integer value formula_14:
: maximize formula_8
: subject to formula_9 and formula_17

The unbounded knapsack problem (UKP) places no upper bound on the number of copies of each kind of item and can be formulated as above except that the only restriction on formula_2 is that it is a non-negative integer.
: maximize formula_8
: subject to formula_9 and formula_21

One example of the unbounded knapsack problem is given using the figure shown at the beginning of this article and the text &quot;if any number of each book is available&quot; in the caption of that figure.

== Computational complexity ==
The knapsack problem is interesting from the perspective of computer science for many reasons:
* The decision problem form of the knapsack problem (&quot;Can a value of at least &quot;V&quot; be achieved without exceeding the weight &quot;W&quot;?&quot;) is NP-complete, thus there is no known algorithm that is both correct and fast (polynomial-time) in all cases.
* There is no known polynomial algorithm which can tell, given a solution, whether it is optimal (which would mean that there is no solution with a larger &quot;V&quot;). This problem is co-NP-complete.
* There is a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming.
* There is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, which uses the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm as a subroutine, described below.
* Many cases that arise in practice, and &quot;random instances&quot; from some distributions, can nonetheless be solved exactly.

There is a link between the &quot;decision&quot; and &quot;optimization&quot; problems in that if there exists a polynomial algorithm that solves the &quot;decision&quot; problem, then one can find the maximum value for the optimization problem in polynomial time by applying this algorithm iteratively while increasing the value of k. On the other hand, if an algorithm finds the optimal value of the optimization problem in polynomial time, then the decision problem can be solved in polynomial time by comparing the value of the solution output by this algorithm with the value of k. Thus, both versions of the problem are of similar difficulty.

One theme in research literature is to identify what the &quot;hard&quot; instances of the knapsack problem look like, or viewed another way, to identify what properties of instances in practice might make them more amenable than their worst-case NP-complete behaviour suggests. The goal in finding these &quot;hard&quot; instances is for their use in public-key cryptography systems, such as the Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem. More generally, better understanding of the structure of the space of instances of an optimization problem helps to advance the study of the particular problem and can improve algorithm selection.

Furthermore, notable is the fact that the hardness of the knapsack problem depends on the form of the input. If the weights and profits are given as integers, it is weakly NP-complete, while it is strongly NP-complete if the weights and profits are given as rational numbers. However, in the case of rational weights and profits it still admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.

===Unit-cost models===
The NP-hardness of the Knapsack problem relates to computational models in which the size of integers matters (such as the Turing machine). In contrast, decision trees count each decision as a single step. Dobkin and Lipton show an formula_22 lower bound on linear decision trees for the knapsack problem, that is, trees where decision nodes test the sign of affine functions. This was generalized to algebraic decision trees by Steele and Yao.
If the elements in the problem are real numbers or rationals, the decision-tree lower bound extends to the real random-access machine model with an instruction set that includes addition, subtraction and multiplication of real numbers, as well as comparison and either division or remaindering (&quot;floor&quot;). This model covers more algorithms than the algebraic decision-tree model, as it encompasses algorithms that use indexing into tables. However, in this model all program steps are counted, not just decisions.
An &quot;upper bound&quot; for a decision-tree model was given by Meyer auf der Heide who showed that for every &quot;n&quot; there exists an -deep linear decision tree that solves the subset-sum problem with &quot;n&quot; items. Note that this does not imply any upper bound for an algorithm that should solve the problem for &quot;any given n&quot;.

== Solving ==
Several algorithms are available to solve knapsack problems, based on the dynamic programming approach, the branch and bound approach or hybridizations of both approaches.

=== Dynamic programming in-advance algorithm ===
The unbounded knapsack problem (UKP) places no restriction on the number of copies of each kind of item. Besides, here we assume that formula_23
: formula_24
: subject to formula_25 and formula_23

Observe that formula_27 has the following properties:

1. formula_28 (the sum of zero items, i.e., the summation of the empty set).

2. formula_29
, formula_30, where formula_6 is the value of the formula_12-th kind of item.

The second property needs to be explained in detail. During the process of the running of this method, how do we get the weight formula_33? There are only formula_12 ways and the previous weights are formula_35 where there are total formula_12 kinds of different item (by saying different, we mean that the weight and the value are not completely the same). If we know each value of these formula_12 items and the related maximum value previously, we just compare them to each other and get the maximum value ultimately and we are done.

Here the maximum of the empty set is taken to be zero. Tabulating the results from formula_38 up through formula_39 gives the solution. Since the calculation of each formula_27 involves examining at most formula_3 items, and there are at most formula_7 values of formula_27 to calculate, the running time of the dynamic programming solution is formula_44. Dividing formula_45 by their greatest common divisor is a way to improve the running time.

Even if P≠NP, the formula_44 complexity does not contradict the fact that the knapsack problem is NP-complete, since formula_7, unlike formula_3, is not polynomial in the length of the input to the problem. The length of the formula_7 input to the problem is proportional to the number of bits in formula_7, formula_51, not to formula_7 itself. However, since this runtime is pseudopolynomial, this makes the (decision version of the) knapsack problem a weakly NP-complete problem.

==== 0-1 knapsack problem ====

A similar dynamic programming solution for the 0-1 knapsack problem also runs in pseudo-polynomial time. Assume formula_53 are strictly positive integers. Define formula_54 to be the maximum value that can be attained with weight less than or equal to formula_33 using items up to formula_12 (first formula_12 items).

We can define formula_54 recursively as follows: (Definition A)
* formula_59
* formula_60 if formula_61 (the new item is more than the current weight limit)
*formula_62 if formula_63.

The solution can then be found by calculating formula_64. To do this efficiently, we can use a table to store previous computations.

The following is pseudocode for the dynamic program:
// Input:
// Values (stored in array v)
// Weights (stored in array w)
// Number of distinct items (n)
// Knapsack capacity (W)
// NOTE: The array &quot;v&quot; and array &quot;w&quot; are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index 1.

array m[0..n, 0..W];
for j from 0 to W do:
 m[0, j] := 0
for i from 1 to n do:
 m[i, 0] := 0

for i from 1 to n do:
 for j from 1 to W do:
 if w[i] &gt; j then:
 m[i, j] := m[i-1, j]
 else:
 m[i, j] := max(m[i-1, j], m[i-1, j-w[i]] + v[i])

This solution will therefore run in formula_44 time and formula_44 space. 
(If we only need the value m[n,W], we can modify the code so that the amount of memory required is O(W) which stores the recent two lines of the array &quot;m&quot;.)

However, if we take it a step or two further, we should know that the method will run in the time between formula_44 and formula_68. From Definition A, we know that there is no need to compute all the weights when the number of items and the items themselves that we chose are fixed. That is to say, the program above computes more than necessary because the weight changes from 0 to W often. From this perspective, we can program this method so that it runs recursively.
// Input:
// Values (stored in array v)
// Weights (stored in array w)
// Number of distinct items (n)
// Knapsack capacity (W)
// NOTE: The array &quot;v&quot; and array &quot;w&quot; are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index 1.

Define value[n, W]

Initialize all value[i, j] = -1

Define m:=(i,j) // Define function m so that it represents the maximum value we can get under the condition: use first i items, total weight limit is j
 if i == 0 or j &lt;= 0 then:
 value[i, j] = 0
 return

 if (value[i-1, j] == -1) then: // m[i-1, j] has not been calculated, we have to call function m
 m(i-1, j)

 if w[i] &gt; j then: // item cannot fit in the bag
 value[i, j] = value[i-1, j]
 else: 
 if (value[i-1, j-w[i]] == -1) then: // m[i-1,j-w[i]] has not been calculated, we have to call function m
 m(i-1, j-w[i])
 value[i, j] = max(value[i-1,j], value[i-1, j-w[i]] + v[i])

Run m(n, W)
For example, there are 10 different items and the weight limit is 67. So,
formula_69
If you use above method to compute for formula_70, you will get this, excluding calls that produce formula_71:
formula_72

Besides, we can break the recursion and convert it into a tree. Then we can cut some leaves and use parallel computing to expedite the running of this method.

To find the actual subset of items, rather than just their total value, we can run this after running the function above:
 * Returns the indices of the items of the optimal knapsack.
 * i: We can include items 1 through i in the knapsack
 * j: maximum weight of the knapsack
function knapsack(i: int, j: int): Set&lt;int&gt; {
 if i == 0 then:
 return {}
 if m[i, j] &gt; m[i-1, j] then:
 return {i} ∪ knapsack(i-1, j-w[i])
 else:
 return knapsack(i-1, j)

knapsack(n, W)
=== Meet-in-the-middle ===
Another algorithm for 0-1 knapsack, discovered in 1974 and sometimes called &quot;meet-in-the-middle&quot; due to parallels to a similarly named algorithm in cryptography, is exponential in the number of different items but may be preferable to the DP algorithm when formula_7 is large compared to &quot;n&quot;. In particular, if the formula_5 are nonnegative but not integers, we could still use the dynamic programming algorithm by scaling and rounding (i.e. using fixed-point arithmetic), but if the problem requires formula_75 fractional digits of precision to arrive at the correct answer, formula_7 will need to be scaled by formula_77, and the DP algorithm will require formula_78 space and formula_79 time.

 algorithm Meet-in-the-middle is
 input: A set of items with weights and values.
 output: The greatest combined value of a subset.
 partition the set {1...&quot;n&quot;} into two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of approximately equal size
 compute the weights and values of all subsets of each set
 for each subset of &quot;A&quot; do
 find the subset of &quot;B&quot; of greatest value such that the combined weight is less than &quot;W&quot;
 keep track of the greatest combined value seen so far

The algorithm takes formula_80 space, and efficient implementations of step 3 (for instance, sorting the subsets of B by weight, discarding subsets of B which weigh more than other subsets of B of greater or equal value, and using binary search to find the best match) result in a runtime of formula_81. As with the meet in the middle attack in cryptography, this improves on the formula_82 runtime of a naive brute force approach (examining all subsets of formula_83), at the cost of using exponential rather than constant space (see also baby-step giant-step). The current state of the art improvement to the meet-in-the-middle algorithm, using insights from Schroeppel and Shamir&#x27;s Algorithm for Subset Sum, provides as a corollary a randomized algorithm for Knapsack which preserves the formula_84 (up to polynomial factors) running time and reduces the space requirements to formula_85 (see Corollary 1.4). In contrast, the best known deterministic algorithm runs in formula_84 time with a slightly worse space complexity of formula_87.

=== Approximation Algorithms ===
As for most NP-complete problems, it may be enough to find workable solutions even if they are not optimal. Preferably, however, the approximation comes with a guarantee of the difference between the value of the solution found and the value of the optimal solution.

As with many useful but computationally complex algorithms, there has been substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The knapsack problem, though NP-Hard, is one of a collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that the problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme. To be exact, the knapsack problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).

==== Greedy approximation algorithm ====
George Dantzig proposed a greedy approximation algorithm to solve the unbounded knapsack problem. His version sorts the items in decreasing order of value per unit of weight, formula_88. It then proceeds to insert them into the sack, starting with as many copies as possible of the first kind of item until there is no longer space in the sack for more. Provided that there is an unlimited supply of each kind of item, if formula_89 is the maximum value of items that fit into the sack, then the greedy algorithm is guaranteed to achieve at least a value of formula_90.

For the bounded problem, where the supply of each kind of item is limited, the above algorithm may be far from optimal. Nevertheless, a simple modification allows us to solve this case: Assume for simplicity that all items individually fit in the sack (formula_91 for all formula_12). Construct a solution formula_93 by packing items greedily as long as possible, i.e. formula_94 where formula_95. Furthermore, construct a second solution formula_96 containing the first item that did not fit. Since formula_97 provides an upper bound for the LP relaxation of the problem, one of the sets must have value at least formula_90; we thus return whichever of formula_93 and formula_100 has better value to obtain a formula_101-approximation.

It can be shown that the average performance converges to the optimal solution in distribution at the error rate formula_102 

==== Fully polynomial time approximation scheme ====
The fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the knapsack problem takes advantage of the fact that the reason the problem has no known polynomial time solutions is because the profits associated with the items are not restricted. If one rounds off some of the least significant digits of the profit values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε where ε is a bound on the correctness of the solution. This restriction then means that an algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time that is correct within a factor of (1-ε) of the optimal solution.

 algorithm FPTAS is 
 input: ε ∈ (0,1]
 a list A of n items, specified by their values, formula_6, and weights
 output: S&#x27; the FPTAS solution
 P := max formula_104 // the highest item value
 K := ε formula_105
 for i from 1 to n do
 formula_106 := formula_107
 end for
 return the solution, S&#x27;, using the formula_106 values in the dynamic program outlined above

Theorem: The set formula_109 computed by the algorithm above satisfies formula_110, where formula_111 is an optimal solution.

====Quantum approximate optimization====
Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) can be employed to solve Knapsack problem using quantum computation by minimizing the Hamiltonian of the problem. The Knapsack Hamiltonian is constructed via embedding the constraint condition to the cost function of the problem with a penalty term.formula_112where formula_113 is the penalty constant which is determined by case-specific fine-tuning.

===Dominance relations===
Solving the unbounded knapsack problem can be made easier by throwing away items which will never be needed. For a given item formula_12, suppose we could find a set of items formula_115 such that their total weight is less than the weight of formula_12, and their total value is greater than the value of formula_12. Then formula_12 cannot appear in the optimal solution, because we could always improve any potential solution containing formula_12 by replacing formula_12 with the set formula_115. Therefore, we can disregard the formula_12-th item altogether. In such cases, formula_115 is said to dominate formula_12. (Note that this does not apply to bounded knapsack problems, since we may have already used up the items in formula_115.)

Finding dominance relations allows us to significantly reduce the size of the search space. There are several different types of dominance relations, which all satisfy an inequality of the form:

formula_126, and formula_127 for some formula_128

where
formula_129 and formula_130. The vector formula_131 denotes the number of copies of each member of formula_115.

;Collective dominance: The formula_12-th item is collectively dominated by formula_115, written as formula_135, if the total weight of some combination of items in formula_115 is less than &quot;wi&quot; and their total value is greater than &quot;vi&quot;. Formally, formula_137 and formula_138 for some formula_128, i.e. formula_140. Verifying this dominance is computationally hard, so it can only be used with a dynamic programming approach. In fact, this is equivalent to solving a smaller knapsack decision problem where formula_141, formula_142, and the items are restricted to formula_115.
;Threshold dominance: The formula_12-th item is threshold dominated by formula_115, written as formula_146, if some number of copies of formula_12 are dominated by formula_115. Formally, formula_149, and formula_127 for some formula_128 and formula_152. This is a generalization of collective dominance, first introduced in and used in the EDUK algorithm. The smallest such formula_153 defines the threshold of the item formula_12, written formula_155. In this case, the optimal solution could contain at most formula_156 copies of formula_12.
;Multiple dominance: The formula_12-th item is multiply dominated by a single item formula_159, written as formula_160, if formula_12 is dominated by some number of copies of formula_159. Formally, formula_163, and formula_164 for some formula_165 i.e. formula_166. This dominance could be efficiently used during preprocessing because it can be detected relatively easily.
;Modular dominance: Let formula_167 be the &quot;best item&quot;, i.e. formula_168 for all formula_12. This is the item with the greatest density of value. The formula_12-th item is modularly dominated by a single item formula_159, written as formula_172, if formula_12 is dominated by formula_159 plus several copies of formula_167. Formally, formula_176, and formula_177 i.e. formula_178.

== Variations ==
There are many variations of the knapsack problem that have arisen from the vast number of applications of the basic problem. The main variations occur by changing the number of some problem parameter such as the number of items, number of objectives, or even the number of knapsacks.

===Multi-dimensional objective===
Here, instead of a single objective (e.g. maximizing the monetary profit from the items in the knapsack), there can be several objectives. For example, there could be environmental or social concerns as well as economic goals. Problems frequently addressed include portfolio and transportation logistics optimizations.

As an example, suppose you run a cruise ship. You have to decide how many famous comedians to hire. This boat can handle no more than one ton of passengers and the entertainers must weigh less than 1000 lbs. Each comedian has a weight, brings in business based on their popularity and asks for a specific salary. In this example, you have multiple objectives. You want, of course, to maximize the popularity of your entertainers while minimizing their salaries. Also, you want to have as many entertainers as possible.

===Multi-dimensional weight===
Here, the weight of knapsack item formula_12 is given by a D-dimensional vector formula_180 and the knapsack has a D-dimensional capacity vector formula_181. The target is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of weights in each dimension formula_75 does not exceed formula_183.

Multi-dimensional knapsack is computationally harder than knapsack; even for formula_184, the problem does not have EPTAS unless Pformula_185NP. However, the algorithm in is shown to solve sparse instances efficiently. An instance of multi-dimensional knapsack is sparse if there is a set formula_186 for formula_187 such that for every knapsack item formula_12, formula_189 such that formula_190 and formula_191. Such instances occur, for example, when scheduling packets in a wireless network with relay nodes. The algorithm from also solves sparse instances of the multiple choice variant, multiple-choice multi-dimensional knapsack.

The IHS (Increasing Height Shelf) algorithm is optimal for 2D knapsack (packing squares into a two-dimensional unit size square): when there are at most five squares in an optimal packing.

===Multiple knapsacks===

Here, there are multiple knapsacks. This may seem like a trivial change, but it is not equivalent to adding to the capacity of the initial knapsack, as each knapsack has its own capacity constraint. This variation is used in many loading and scheduling problems in Operations Research and has a Polynomial-time approximation scheme. This variation is similar to the Bin Packing Problem. It differs from the Bin Packing Problem in that a subset of items can be selected, whereas, in the Bin Packing Problem, all items have to be packed to certain bins. 

===Quadratic===
The quadratic knapsack problem maximizes a quadratic objective function subject to binary and linear capacity constraints. The problem was introduced by Gallo, Hammer, and Simeone in 1980, however the first treatment of the problem dates back to Witzgall in 1975.

=== Geometric ===
In the geometric knapsack problem, there is a set of rectangles with different values, and a rectangular knapsack. The goal is to pack the largest possible value into the knapsack.

=== Online ===
In the online knapsack problem, the items come one by one. Whenever an item arrives, we must decide immediately whether to put it in the knapsack or discard it. There are two variants: (a) non-removable - an inserted item remains in the knapsack forever; (b) removable - an inserted item may be removed later, to make room for a new item.

Han, Kawase and Makino present a randomized algorithm for the unweighted non-removable setting. It is 2-competitive, which is the best possible. For the weighted removable setting, they give a 2-competitive algorithm, prove a lower bound of ~1.368 for randomized algorithms, and prove that no deterministic algorithm can have a constant competitive ratio. For the unweighted removable setting, they give an 10/7-competitive-ratio algorithm, and prove a lower bound of 1.25. 

There are several other papers on the online knapsack problem.

<doc id="16976" wikidata="Q424502" url="?curid=16976" title="Kernite">
<text>Kernite, also known as rasorite, is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

Kernite is soluble in cold water and alters to tincalconite when it dehydrates. It undergoes a non-reversible alteration to metakernite () when heated to above 100 °C.

==Occurrence and history==
The mineral occurs in sedimentary evaporite deposits in arid regions.

Kernite was discovered in 1926 in eastern Kern County, in Southern California, and later renamed after the county. The location was the US Borax Mine at Boron in the western Mojave Desert. This type material is stored at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C.

The Kern County mine was the only known source of the mineral for a period of time. More recently, kernite is mined in Argentina and Turkey.

The largest documented, single crystal of kernite measured 2.44 x 0.9 x 0.9 m3 and weighed ~3.8 tons.

==Uses==
Kernite is used to produce borax which can be used in a variety of soaps.

<doc id="16978" wikidata="Q409192" url="?curid=16978" title="Ketoprofen">
<text>Ketoprofen is one of the propionic acid class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic effects. It acts by inhibiting the body&#x27;s production of prostaglandin.
It was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in 1980.

== Medical uses ==
Ketoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums.

Ketoprofen topical patches are being used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain.

Ketoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.

Trials are going on for using this drug along with ibuprofen for management of lymphedema. Animal trial and some human trials have shown significant improvement over placebo control. Dr Stanley G Rockson, of Stanford University is leading these researches.

===Efficacy===
A 2013 systematic review indicated &quot;The efficacy of orally administered ketoprofen in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was significantly better than that of ibuprofen and/or diclofenac.&quot; A 2017 Cochrane systematic review investigating ketoprofen as a single-dose by mouth in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac.

There is evidence supporting topical ketoprofen for osteoarthritis but not other chronic musculoskeletal pain.

== Adverse effects ==
In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in fetuses that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

==Mechanism==
Ketoprofen undergoes metabolism in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid (glucuronidation) by UGT enzymes, hydroxylation of the benzoyl ring by the CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and reduction of its ketone moiety (a carbonyl functional group, i.e. with carbon-oxygen double bond) by carbonyl reducing enzymes (CREs). Ketoprofen is used for its antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes reversibly, which decreases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin precursors.

The patches have been shown to provide rapid and sustained delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration.

=== Chirality and biological activity ===
Ketoprofen has one stereogenic center in the side chain and hence exists as mirror-image twins. Majority of the profens are marketed as racemic mixtures. For most of the NSAIDs the pharmacological activity resides in the (S)-enantiomers with their (R)-enantiomer virtually inactive. An interesting observation about most profens including ketoprofen is that they undergo unidirectional metabolic inversion, chiral inversion, of the (R)- acid to its (S)-mirror-image version with no other change in the molecule.
There have been concerns raised that Ketoprofen can break down into the parent benzophenone molecule in skin exposed to strong summer or tropical UV light and this could pose a theoretical cancer risk. Given such a risk it is better to use other pain killers in such circumstances.

== History ==
The earliest report of therapeutic use in humans is in 1972.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Brand names in Australia include Orudis and Oruvail. It is available in Japan in a transdermal patch Mohrus Tape, made by Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical. It is available in the UK as Ketoflam and Oruvail, in Ireland as Fastum Gel, in Estonia as Keto, Ketonal, and Fastum Gel, in Finland as Ketorin, Keto, Ketomex, and Orudis; in France as Profénid, Bi-Profénid, Toprec, and Ketum; in Italy as Ketodol, Fastum Gel, Lasonil, Orudis and Oki; in Greece as Okitask; in Poland as Ketonal, Ketonal active, Ketolek, in Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia as Knavon and Ketonal; in Romania as Ketonal and Fastum Gel; in Mexico as Arthril; in Norway as Zon and Orudis; in Russia as ОКИ (OKI), Fastum Gel and Ketonal; in Spain as Actron and Fastum Gel; in Albania as Oki and Fastum Gel; in Indonesia as Kaltrofen; and in Venezuela as Ketoprofeno as an injectable solution of 100 mg and 150 mg capsules.

In some countries, the optically pure (&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen) is available; its trometamol salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.

==Veterinary medicine==
Ketoprofen is a common NSAID, antipyretic, and analgesic used in horses and other equines. It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as laminitis. It is also used to control fevers and prevent endotoxemia. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures.

In horses, it is given at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg/day. Studies have shown that it does not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene B4, as originally claimed. It is therefore not considered superior to phenylbutazone as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use. In fact, phenylbutazone was shown superior to ketoprofen in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages.

===Ecological problems===

Experiments have found ketoprofen, like diclofenac, is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in red-headed vultures. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock develop acute kidney failure within days of exposure.

<doc id="16985" wikidata="Q199701" url="?curid=16985" title="Kabuki">
<text>is a classical form of Japanese theatre, mixing dramatic performance with traditional dance. Kabuki theatre is known for its heavily stylised performances, its glamorous, highly decorated costumes, and for the elaborate make-up worn by some of its performers.

Kabuki is thought to have originated in the early Edo period, when the art&#x27;s founder, Izumo no Okuni, formed a female dance troupe that performed dances and light sketches in Kyoto. The art form later developed into its present all-male theatrical form after women were banned from performing in kabuki theatre in 1629. Kabuki developed throughout the late 17th century and reached its zenith in the mid-18th century.

In 2005, kabuki theatre was proclaimed by UNESCO as an intangible heritage possessing outstanding universal value. In 2008, it was inscribed in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

== Etymology ==
The individual kanji that make up the word &quot;kabuki&quot; can be read as , , and . &quot;Kabuki&quot; is therefore sometimes translated as &#x27;the art of singing and dancing&#x27;. These are, however, characters which do not reflect actual etymology. The kanji of &#x27;skill&#x27; generally refers to a performer in kabuki theatre.

Since the word &quot;kabuki&quot; is believed to derive from the verb , meaning &#x27;to lean&#x27; or &#x27;to be out of the ordinary&#x27;, the word &quot;kabuki&quot; can also be interpreted as &#x27;avant-garde&#x27; or &#x27;bizarre&#x27; theatre. The expression referred originally to those who were bizarrely dressed. It is often translated into English as &#x27;strange things&#x27; or &#x27;the crazy ones&#x27;, and referred to the style of dress worn by gangs of samurai. Another explanation attributes the word &quot;kabuki&quot; to a verb that was used to describe young samurai patrons, meaning &quot;being weird&quot; or &quot;offbeat.&quot;

== History ==
===1603–1629: Kabuki===

The history of kabuki began in 1603 during the Edo period when former shrine maiden Izumo no Okuni, possibly a of Izumo-taisha, began performing with a troupe of young female dancers a new, simple style of dance drama in pantomime, on a makeshift stage in the dry bed of the Kamo River in Kyoto

In the earliest forms of kabuki, female performers played both men and women in comic playlets about ordinary life. It did not take long for the style to become popular, and Okuni was asked to perform before the Imperial Court. In the wake of such success, rival troupes quickly formed, and kabuki was born as ensemble dance and drama performed by women.

Much of the appeal of kabuki in this era was due to the ribald, suggestive themes featured by many troupes; this appeal was further augmented by the fact that many performers were also involved in prostitution. For this reason, kabuki was also known as during this period.

Kabuki became a common form of entertainment in the red-light districts of Japan, especially in Yoshiwara, the registered red-light district in Edo. The widespread appeal of kabuki often meant that a diverse crowd of different social classes gathered to watch performances, a unique occurrence that happened nowhere else in the city of Edo. Kabuki theatres became well known as a place to both see and be seen in terms of fashion and style, as the audience—commonly comprising a number of socially low but economically wealthy merchants—typically used a performance as a way to feature the fashion trends.

As an art-form, kabuki also provided inventive new forms of entertainment, featuring new musical styles played on the , clothes and fashion often dramatic in appearance, famous actors and stories often intended to mirror current events. Performances typically lasted from morning until sunset, with surrounding teahouses providing meals, refreshments and place to socialise. The area surrounding kabuki theatres also featured a number of shops selling kabuki souvenirs.

After performances, women performers would offer sexual services for those who could afford it. Since fights would usually erupt among the young samurai patrons, shogunal authorities, who wanted to maintain order, banned women from performing on stage. Following this ban, Okuni replaced the women with boys in Kabuki performances. During the early seventeenth century, within a culture where pederasty was pervasive among samurai, her decision didn&#x27;t significantly harm the theater&#x27;s popularity. In fact, it may have even benefited Kabuki, as it caught the attention of the third shogun, Iemitsu, known for his interest in pederasty. He even arranged special performances. However, after Iemitsu&#x27;s death in 1651 and with samurai now fighting for the attention of boys rather than girls, the shogunate imposed further restrictions, allowing only males over 15 to perform on stage.

Kabuki switched to adult male actors, called , in the mid-1600s. Adult male actors, however, continued to play both female and male characters, and kabuki retained its popularity, remaining a key element of the Edo period urban life-style.

Although kabuki was performed widely across Japan, the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za theatres became the most widely known and popular kabuki theatres, where some of the most successful kabuki performances were and still are held.

===1629–1673: Transition to ===
During the time period of 1628–1673, the modern version of all-male kabuki actors, a style of kabuki known as (lit., &quot;young man kabuki&quot;), was established, following the ban on women and young boys. Cross-dressing male actors, known as &quot;&quot; (lit., &quot;woman role&quot;) or &quot;&quot; took over previously female- or -acted roles. Young (adolescent) men were still preferred for women&#x27;s roles due to their less obviously masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices. The roles of adolescent men in kabuki, known as , were also played by young men, often selected for their attractiveness; this became a common practice, and were often presented in an erotic context.

The focus of kabuki performances also increasingly began to emphasise drama alongside dance. However, the ribald nature of kabuki performances continued, with male actors also engaging in sex work for both female and male customers. Audiences frequently became rowdy, and brawls occasionally broke out, sometimes over the favors of a particularly popular or handsome actor, leading the shogunate to ban first and then roles for a short period of time; both bans were rescinded by 1652.

===1673–1841: Genroku period kabuki===

During the Genroku period, kabuki thrived, with the structure of kabuki plays formalising into the structure they are performed in today, alongside many other elements which eventually came to be recognised as a key aspect of kabuki tradition, such as conventional character tropes. Kabuki theater and , an elaborate form of puppet theater later known as , became closely associated with each other, mutually influencing the other&#x27;s further development.

The famous playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon, one of the first professional kabuki playwrights, produced several influential works during this time, though the piece usually acknowledged as his most significant, (&quot;The Love Suicides at&quot; ), was originally written for . Like many plays, it was adapted for kabuki, eventually becoming popular enough to reportedly inspire a number of real-life &quot;copycat&quot; suicides, and leading to a government ban on (plays about love suicides) in 1723.

Also during the Genroku period was the development of the style of posing, credited to kabuki actor Ichikawa Danjūrō I, alongside the development of the mask-like makeup worn by kabuki actors in some plays.

In the mid-18th century, kabuki fell out of favor for a time, with taking its place as the premier form of stage entertainment among the lower social classes. This occurred partly because of the emergence of several skilled playwrights in that time. Little of note would occur in the further development of kabuki until the end of the century, when it began to reemerge in popularity.

===1842–1868: kabuki===

In the 1840s, repeated periods of drought led to a series of fires affecting Edo, with kabuki theatres—traditionally made of wood—frequently burning down, forcing many to relocate. When the area that housed the Nakamura-za was completely destroyed in 1841, the refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt, saying that it was against fire code.

The shogunate, mostly disapproving of the socialisation and trade that occurred in kabuki theatres between merchants, actors and prostitutes, took advantage of the fire crisis in the following year, forcing the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za out of the city limits and into Asakusa, a northern suburb of Edo. This was part of the larger Tenpō Reforms that the shogunate instituted starting in 1842 to restrict the overindulgence of pleasures. Actors, stagehands, and others associated with the performances were also forced to move as a result of the death of their livelihood; despite the move of everyone involved in kabuki performance, and many in the surrounding areas, to the new location of the theatres, the inconvenience of the distance led to a reduction in attendance. These factors, along with strict regulations, pushed much of kabuki &quot;underground&quot; in Edo, with performances changing locations to avoid the authorities.

The theatres&#x27; new location was called Saruwaka-chō, or Saruwaka-machi; the last thirty years of the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s rule is often referred to as the &quot;Saruwaka-machi period&quot;, and is well known for having produced some of the most exaggerated kabuki in Japanese history.

Saruwaka-machi became the new theatre district for the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-za and Kawarazaki-za theatres. The district was located on the main street of Asakusa, which ran through the middle of the small city. The street was renamed after Saruwaka Kanzaburo, who initiated Edo kabuki in the Nakamura-za in 1624.

European artists began noticing Japanese theatrical performances and artwork, and many artists, such as Claude Monet, were inspired by Japanese woodblock prints. This Western interest prompted Japanese artists to increase their depictions of daily life, including the depiction of theatres, brothels, main streets and so on. One artist, Utagawa Hiroshige, produced a series of prints based on Saruwaka from the Saruwaka-machi period in Asakusa.

Despite the revival of kabuki in another location, the relocation diminished the tradition&#x27;s most abundant inspirations for costuming, make-up, and storylines. Ichikawa KodanjiIV was considered one of the most active and successful actors during the Saruwaka-machi period. Deemed unattractive, he mainly performed , or dancing, in dramas written by Kawatake Mokuami, who also wrote during the Meiji era to follow. Kawatake Mokuami commonly wrote plays that depicted the common lives of the people of Edo. He introduced (seven-and-five syllable meter) dialogue and music such as . His kabuki performances became quite popular once the Saruwaka-machi period ended and theatre returned to Edo; many of his works are still performed.

In 1868, the Tokugawa ceased to exist, with the restoration of the Emperor. Emperor Meiji was restored to power and moved from Kyoto to the new capital of Edo, or Tokyo, beginning the Meiji period. Kabuki once again returned to the pleasure quarters of Edo, and throughout the Meiji period became increasingly more radical, as modern styles of kabuki plays and performances emerged. Playwrights experimented with the introduction of new genres to kabuki, and introduced twists on traditional stories.

==Post-Meiji period kabuki==

Beginning in 1868, enormous cultural changes, such as the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, the elimination of the samurai class, and the opening of Japan to the West, helped to spark kabuki&#x27;s re-emergence. Both actors and playwrights strove to improve the reputation of kabuki in the face of new foreign influence and amongst the upper classes, partially through adapting traditional styles to modern tastes. This endeavour would prove successful, with the Emperor sponsoring a kabuki performance on 21 April 1887.

After World War II, the occupying forces briefly banned kabuki, which had formed a strong base of support for Japan&#x27;s war efforts since 1931. This ban was in conjunction with broader restrictions on media and art forms that the American military occupation instituted after WWII. However, by 1947 the ban on kabuki was rescinded, but censorship rules lingered.

==Post-war to modern day kabuki==
The ensuing period of occupation following World War II posited a difficult time for kabuki; besides the war&#x27;s physical impact and devastation upon the country, some schools of thought chose to reject both the styles and artforms of pre-war Japan, kabuki amongst them. Director Tetsuji Takechi&#x27;s popular and innovative productions of kabuki classics at this time are credited with sparking new interest in kabuki in the Kansai region. Of the many popular young stars who performed with the Takechi Kabuki, Nakamura Ganjiro III (b. 1931) was the leading figure, first known as Nakamura Senjaku before taking his current name. It was this period of kabuki in Osaka that became known as the &quot;Age of Senjaku&quot; in his honor.

Today, kabuki is the most popular of the traditional styles of Japanese drama, with its star actors often appearing in television or film roles. Well-known actor Bandō Tamasaburō V has appeared in several non-kabuki plays and movies, often in the role of a woman.

Kabuki also appears in works of Japanese popular culture such as anime. In addition to the handful of major theatres in Tokyo and Kyoto, there are many smaller theatres in Osaka and throughout the countryside. The troupe, based in Ōshika, Nagano Prefecture, is one example.

Some local kabuki troupes today use female actors in roles. The Ichikawa Shōjo Kabuki Gekidan, an all-female troupe, debuted in 1953 to significant acclaim, though the majority of kabuki troupes have remained entirely-male.

The introduction of earphone guides in 1975, including an English version in 1982, helped broaden the artform&#x27;s appeal. As a result, in 1991 the Kabuki-za, one of Tokyo&#x27;s best known kabuki theaters, began year-round performances and, in 2005, began marketing kabuki cinema films. Kabuki troupes regularly tour Asia, Europe and America, and there have been several kabuki-themed productions of Western plays such as those of Shakespeare. Western playwrights and novelists have also experimented with kabuki themes, an example of which is Gerald Vizenor&#x27;s (2004). Writer Yukio Mishima pioneered and popularised the use of kabuki in modern settings and revived other traditional arts, such as Noh, adapting them to modern contexts. There have even been kabuki troupes established in countries outside Japan. For instance, in Australia, the Za Kabuki troupe at the Australian National University has performed a kabuki drama each year since 1976, the longest regular kabuki performance outside Japan.

In November 2002, a statue was erected in honor of kabuki&#x27;s founder, Izumo no Okuni and to commemorate 400 years of kabuki&#x27;s existence. Diagonally across from the Minami-za, the last remaining kabuki theater in Kyoto, it stands at the east end of a bridge (Shijō Ōhashi) crossing the Kamo River in Kyoto.

Kabuki was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2005.

=== Super Kabuki ===
While still maintaining most of the historical practices of kabuki, aimed to broaden its appeal by creating a new genre of kabuki productions called . With as the first Super Kabuki production to premiere in 1986, remakes of traditional plays and new contemporary creations have been brought to local theaters throughout the country, including anime-based productions such as &quot;Naruto&quot; or &quot;One Piece&quot; starting from 2014.

Super Kabuki has sparked controversy within the Japanese population regarding the extent of modification of the traditional art form. Some say that it has lost its 400-year history, while others consider the adaptations necessary for contemporary relevance. Regardless, since incorporating more advanced technology in the new stage sets, costumes, and lighting, Super Kabuki has regained interest from the young demographic.

In addition, Square Enix announced a Super Kabuki adaptation of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; collaborating with Tokyo Broadcasting System in 2022. Entitled &quot;Kinoshita Group presents New Kabuki Final Fantasy X&quot; and part of celebrations of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise&#x27;s 35th anniversary, it is scheduled to be performed at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo from March 4 to April 12, 2023.

==Elements==
===Stage design===
The kabuki stage features a projection called a , a walkway which extends into the audience and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made. Okuni also performed on a stage with her entourage. The stage is used not only as a walkway or path to get to and from the main stage, but important scenes are also played on the stage.

Kabuki stages and theaters have steadily become more technologically sophisticated, and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century. A driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of kabuki theater, that of the sudden, dramatic revelation or transformation. A number of stage tricks, including actors&#x27; rapid appearance and disappearance, employ these innovations. The term , often translated as &quot;playing to the gallery&quot;, is sometimes used as a catch-all for these tricks. The , and several innovations including revolving stage, and have all contributed to kabuki. The creates depth and both and provide a vertical dimension.

 (revolving stage) developed in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). The trick was originally accomplished by the on-stage pushing of a round, wheeled platform. Later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement. The (&quot;darkened revolve&quot;) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition. More commonly the lights are left on for (&quot;lighted revolve&quot;), sometimes simultaneously performing the transitioning scenes for dramatic effect. This stage was first built in Japan in the early 18th century.

 refers to the stage &quot;traps&quot; that have been commonly employed in kabuki since the middle of the 18th century. These traps raise and lower actors or sets to the stage. or refers to trap(s) moving upward and or to traps descending. This technique is often used to lift an entire scene at once.


 (riding in mid-air) is a technique, which appeared toward the middle of the 19th century, by which an actor&#x27;s costume is attached to wires and he is made to &quot;fly&quot; over the stage or certain parts of the auditorium. This is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, in which Peter launches himself into the air. It is still one of the most popular (visual tricks) in kabuki today; major kabuki theaters, such as the National Theatre, Kabuki-za and Minami-za, are all equipped with installations.

Scenery changes are sometimes made mid-scene, while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open. This is sometimes accomplished by using a , or &quot;small wagon stage&quot;. This technique originated at the beginning of the 18th century, where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform. Also common are stagehands rushing onto the stage adding and removing props, backdrops and other scenery; these are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible. Stagehands also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as (&quot;quick change technique&quot;).
When a character&#x27;s true nature is suddenly revealed, the devices of and are often used. This involves layering one costume over another and having a stagehand pull the outer one off in front of the audience.

The curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black, red and green, in various order, or white instead of green, vertical stripes. The curtain consists of one piece and is pulled back to one side by a staff member by hand.

An additional outer curtain called was not introduced until the Meiji era following the introduction of western influence. These are more ornate in their appearance and are woven. They depict the season in which the performance is taking place, often designed by renowned artists.

=== Appearances ===
Since feudal laws in 17th century Japan prohibited replicating the looks of samurai or nobility and the use of luxurious fabrics, the kabuki costumes were groundbreaking new designs to the general public, even setting trends that still exist today.

Although the earliest kabuki costumes have not been preserved, separate and kabuki costumes today are made based on written records called and in collaboration with those whose families have been in the kabuki industry for generations. The kimono the actors wear for their costumes are typically made with vibrant colours and multiple layers. Both and wear - pleated trousers – in some plays, and both use padding underneath their costumes to create the correct body shape for the outfit.

Kabuki makeup provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form. Rice powder is used to create the white base for the characteristic stage makeup, and enhances or exaggerates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks. The colour of the is an expression of the character&#x27;s nature: red lines are used to indicate passion, heroism, righteousness, and other positive traits; blue or black, villainy, jealousy, and other negative traits; green, the supernatural; and purple, nobility.

Another special feature of kabuki costumes is the , or the wig. Each actor has a different wig made for every role, constructed from a thin base of hand-beaten copper custom-made to fit the actor perfectly, and each wig is usually styled in a traditional manner. The hair used in the wigs is typically real human hair hand-sewn onto a habotai base, though some styles of wig require yak hair or horse hair.

==Performance==

The three main categories of kabuki play are , , and .

, or history plays, are set within the context of major events in Japanese history. Strict censorship laws during the Edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited criticising the shogunate or casting it in a bad light, although enforcement varied greatly over the years. Many shows were set in the context of the Genpei War of the 1180s, the Nanboku-chō Wars of the 1330s, or other historical events. Frustrating the censors, many shows used these historical settings as metaphors for contemporary events. , one of the most famous plays in the kabuki repertoire, serves as an excellent example; it is ostensibly set in the 1330s, though it actually depicts the contemporary (18th century) affair of the revenge of the 47 &quot;rōnin&quot;.
Unlike , which generally focused upon the samurai class, focused primarily upon commoners, namely townspeople and peasants. Often referred to as &quot;domestic plays&quot; in English, generally related to themes of family drama and romance. Some of the most famous are the love suicide plays, adapted from works by the playwright Chikamatsu; these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead. Many if not most contain significant elements of this theme of societal pressures and limitations.

 pieces place their emphasis on dance, which may be performed with or without dialogue, where dance can be used to convey emotion, character and plot. Quick costume change techniques may sometimes be employed in such pieces. Notable examples include and . musicians may be seated in rows on stepped platforms behind the dancers.

Important elements of kabuki include the , in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character. At this point his house name () is sometimes heard in loud shout () from an expert audience member, serving both to express and enhance the audience&#x27;s appreciation of the actor&#x27;s achievement. An even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor&#x27;s father.

The main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen, drunkard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only faking his weakness, such as the character of Yuranosuke in . This is called or &quot;belly acting&quot;, which means he has to perform from within to change characters. It is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn, but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor&#x27;s emotion.

Emotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes, a key element in kabuki. Gaudy and strong colours can convey foolish or joyful emotions, whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus.

==Play structure and performance style==
Kabuki, like other forms of drama traditionally performed in Japan, was—and sometimes still is—performed in full-day programmes, with one play comprising a number of acts spanning the entire day. However, these plays—particularly —were commonly sequenced with acts from other plays in order to produce a full-day programme, as the individual acts in a kabuki play commonly functioned as stand-alone performances in and of themselves. plays, in contrast, were generally not sequenced with acts from other plays, and genuinely would take the entire day to perform.

The structure of a full-day performance was derived largely from the conventions of both and Noh theatre. Chief amongst these was the concept of , a pacing convention in theatre stating that the action of a play should start slow, speed up, and end quickly. The concept, elaborated on at length by master Noh playwright Zeami, governs not only the actions of the actors, but also the structure of the play, as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day-long programme.

Nearly every full-length play occupies five acts. The first corresponds to , an auspicious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot. The next three acts correspond to , where events speed up, culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act, and possibly a battle in the second or fourth acts. The final act, corresponding to , is almost always short, providing a quick and satisfying conclusion.

While many plays were written solely for kabuki, many others were taken from plays, Noh plays, folklore, or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot;. While plays tend to have serious, emotionally dramatic, and organised plots, plays written specifically for kabuki generally have looser, more humorous plots.

One crucial difference between and kabuki is a difference in storytelling focus; whereas focuses on the story and on the chanter who recites it, kabuki has a greater focus on the actors themselves. A play may sacrifice the details of sets, puppets, or action in favor of the chanter, while kabuki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor&#x27;s talents. It was not uncommon in kabuki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day&#x27;s schedule in order to cater to an individual actor—either scenes he was famed for, or that featured him, would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity. Certain plays were also performed uncommonly as they required an actor to be proficient in a number of instruments, which would be played live onstage, a skill that few actors possessed.

Kabuki traditions in Edo and the Kyoto-Osaka region (Kamigata) differed; throughout the Edo period, Edo kabuki was defined by its extravagance, both in the appearance of its actors, their costumes, stage tricks and bold poses. In contrast, Kamigata kabuki focused on natural and realistic styles of acting. Only towards the end of the Edo period did the two styles begin to merge to any significant degree. Before this time, actors from different regions often failed to adjust their acting styles when performing elsewhere, leading to unsuccessful performance tours outside of their usual region of performance.

==Famous plays==
While there are many famous plays known today, many of the most famous were written in the mid-Edo period, and were originally written for theatre.

* (&quot;Treasury of Loyal Retainers&quot;) is the famous story of the forty-seven , led by Oishi Kuranosuke, who exact revenge on their enemy before committing suicide upon the death of their master, Lord Takuminokami of the Asano clan. This story is one of the most popular traditional tales in Japan, and is based on a famous episode in 18th century Japanese history.
* ( &quot;and the Thousand Cherry Trees&quot;) follows Minamoto no Yoshitsune as he flees from agents of his brother Yoritomo. Three Taira clan generals supposedly killed in the Genpei War figure prominently, as their deaths ensure a complete end to the war and the arrival of peace, as does a named Genkurō.
* ( &quot;and the Secrets of Calligraphy&quot;) is based on the life of famed scholar Sugawara no Michizane (845–903), who is exiled from Kyoto, and upon his death causes a number of calamities in the capital. He is then deified, as (&quot;divine spirit&quot;) of scholarship, and worshipped in order to propitiate his angry spirit.

== Actors ==
Every kabuki actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stage names, most often those of the actor&#x27;s father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors&#x27; lineages, and hold great honor and importance. Many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.

 are grand naming ceremonies held in kabuki theatres in front of the audience. Most often, a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony, taking on new stage-names. Their participation in a represents their passage into a new chapter of their performing careers.

Kabuki actors are typically part of a school of acting, or are associated with a particular theatre.

== Influence of kabuki on other art forms ==

Since its beginning, kabuki has remained a significant piece of Japanese culture. The stories and actors have been recreated in many different art forms, including woodblock prints, books, magazines, oral storytelling, photography in later years, and others. Additionally, kabuki was and continues to be influenced by the books and stories circulating in Japan. In one such instance, the widely popular book , or Eight Dogs, was acted out in various episodes on the kabuki stage.

One important way the laboring class was able to enjoy kabuki performances outside of the stage was through home-brewed shows called . Also referred to as &quot;amateur kabuki&quot;, these performances took place at the local level across Japan, but were most commonly held in the Gifu and Aichi prefectures. In Gifu Prefecture specifically, kabuki was a prominent feature of the annual autumn festival, with children&#x27;s reenactments of kabuki performances taking place at Murakuni shrine for over 300 years.

Closer to the cultural epicenter of kabuki in Edo (later Tokyo), commoners had other methods to enjoy performances without attending the shows. was a type of performance shorter in length and more affordable to the common class than kabuki. performances were often based on plots used in kabuki, and the two styles shared common themes. was another popular medium for kabuki consumption among commoners and elites alike. During the course of its publication, this magazine allowed those unable to attend performances to enjoy the liveliness of kabuki culture.

<text>Kent State University (KSU) is a public research university in Kent, Ohio, United States. The university includes seven regional campuses in Northeast Ohio located in Ashtabula, Burton, East Liverpool, Jackson Township, New Philadelphia, Salem, and Warren, along with additional regional and international facilities in Cleveland, Independence, and Twinsburg, Ohio; New York City; and Florence, Italy.

The university was established in 1910 as a normal school. The first classes were held in 1912 at various locations and in temporary buildings in Kent and the first buildings of the original campus opened the following year. Since that time the university has grown to include many additional baccalaureate and graduate programs of study in the arts and sciences, research opportunities, as well as over and 119 buildings on the Kent campus. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the university was known internationally for its student activism in opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, due mainly to the Kent State shootings in 1970.

, Kent State was the third-largest university in Ohio with an enrollment of over 34,000 students in the eight-campus system and over 25,000 students at the main campus in Kent. Kent State offers over 300 degree programs, among them 250 baccalaureate, 40 associate, 50 master&#x27;s, and 23 doctoral programs of study. It is a member of the University System of Ohio and is classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – very high research activity&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===

Kent State University was established in 1910 as an institution for training public school teachers. It was part of the Lowry Bill, which also created a sister school in Bowling Green, Ohio – now known as Bowling Green State University. It was initially known under the working name of the Ohio State Normal College At Kent, but was named Kent State Normal School in honor of William S. Kent, son of the city’s namesake, who donated significant portions of land to the school. The first president was John Edward McGilvrey, who served from 1912 to 1926. McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect George F. Hammond, who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master plan. Classes began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent. These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region. By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall. The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914. In 1915, the school was renamed Kent State Normal College due to the addition of four-year degrees. By then additional buildings had been added or were under construction. Kent State&#x27;s enrollment growth was particularly notable during its summer terms. In 1924, the school&#x27;s registration for summer classes was the largest of any teacher-training school in the United States. In 1929, the state of Ohio changed the name to Kent State College as it allowed the school to establish a college of arts and sciences.

McGilvrey&#x27;s vision for Kent was not shared by many others outside the school, particularly at the state level and at other state schools. His efforts to have the state funding formula changed created opposition, particularly from Ohio State University and its president William Oxley Thompson. This resulted in a 1923 &quot;credit war&quot; where Ohio State refused Kent transfer credits and spread to several other schools taking similar action. It was this development – along with several other factors – which led to the firing of McGilvrey in January 1926. McGilvrey was succeeded first by David Allen Anderson (1926–1928) and James Ozro Engleman from 1928 to 1938, though he continued to be involved with the school for several years as president emeritus and as head of alumni relations from 1934 to 1945. He was present in Columbus on May 17, 1935, when Kent native Governor Martin L. Davey signed a bill that allowed Kent State and Bowling Green to add schools of business administration and graduate programs, giving them each university status; the college&#x27;s name was thus changed to Kent State University.

===1940s to 1960s===

From 1944 to 1963, the university was led by President George Bowman. During his tenure, the student senate, faculty senate and graduate council were organized. Although it had served Stark County from the 1920s, in 1946, the university&#x27;s first regional campus, the Stark Campus, was established in Canton, Ohio. In the fall of 1947, Bowman appointed Oscar W. Ritchie as a full-time faculty member. Ritchie&#x27;s appointment to the faculty made him the first African American to serve on the faculty at Kent State and also made him the first African American professor to serve on the faculty of any state university in Ohio. In 1977, the former Student Union, which had been built in 1949, was rededicated as Oscar Ritchie Hall in his honor. Recently renovated, Oscar Ritchie Hall currently houses the department of Pan-African Studies the Center of Pan-African Culture, the Henry Dumas Library, the Institute for African American Affairs, the Garrett Morgan Computer Lab and the African Community Theatre.

The 1950s and 1960s saw continued growth in both enrollment and in the physical size of the campus. Several new dorms and academic buildings were built during this time, including the establishment of additional regional campuses in Warren (1954), Ashtabula (1957), New Philadelphia (1962), Salem (1962), Burton (1964), and East Liverpool, Ohio (1965). In 1961, grounds superintendent Larry Wooddell and Biff Staples of the Davey Tree Expert Company released ten cages of black squirrels obtained from Victoria Park in London, Ontario, Canada, onto the Kent State campus. By 1964 their estimated population was around 150 and today they have spread in and around Kent and have become unofficial mascots of both the city and university. Since 1981, the annual Black Squirrel Festival is held every fall on campus.

In 1965, chemistry professor Glenn H. Brown established the Liquid Crystal Institute, a world leader in the research and development of the multibillion-dollar liquid crystal industry. James Fergason invented and patented the basic TN LCD in 1969 and ten liquid crystal companies have been spun off from the institute.

In 1967, Kent State became the first university to run an independent, student-operated Campus Bus Service. It was unique in that it provided jobs for students, receiving funding from student fees rather than bus fares. Campus Bus Service was the largest such operation in the country until it merged with the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority in 2004. 1969 saw the opening of a new Memorial Stadium on the far eastern edge of campus and the closure and dismantling of the old Memorial Stadium.

===Kent State shootings===
Kent State gained international attention on May 4, 1970, when an Ohio Army National Guard unit fired at students during an anti-war protest on campus, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard had been called into Kent after several protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of the ROTC building. The main cause of the protests was the United States&#x27; invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The shootings caused an immediate closure of the campus with students and faculty given just 60 minutes to pack belongings. Around the country, many college campuses canceled classes or closed for fear of similar violent protests. In Kent, schools were closed and the National Guard restricted entry into the city limits, patrolling the area until May 8. With the campus closed, faculty members came up with a variety of solutions—including holding classes in their homes, at public buildings and places, via telephone, or through the mail—to allow their students to complete the term, which was only a few weeks away at the time.

In 1971, the university established the Center for Peaceful Change, now known as the Center for Applied Conflict Management, as a &quot;living memorial&quot; to the students who had died. It offers degree programs in Peace and Conflict Studies and Conflict Resolution and is one of the earliest such programs in the United States.

In response to, and protest of, the Kent State shootings, Neil Young wrote the song &quot;Ohio&quot; which was performed by the folk rock group Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. In remembrance of the tragedy, a group of professors and students created a website that features a map with oral histories and eyewitness accounts of the event.

===1970s to 1980s===

Also in 1970, the university opened its 12-story library, moving from the previous home of Rockwell Hall to the tallest building in Portage County. Dedicated in 1971, the library became a member of the Association of Research Libraries in 1973. Kent State joined with the University of Akron and Youngstown State University in establishing the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in 1973. It was the world&#x27;s first medical consortium. Today it includes a college of pharmacy and Cleveland State University as an additional consortium member.

Kent State was again in the national spotlight in 1977 when construction was set to begin on the Memorial Gym Annex, adjacent to the area where the Kent State shootings had occurred in 1970. Protesters organized a tent city in May, which lasted into July. Several attempts were made to block construction even after the end of the tent city, including an appeal to the United States Congress and the Department of the Interior to have the area declared a National Historic Landmark, which ended up being unsuccessful. Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by Joan Baez on August 20. After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.

===1990–present===
In March 1991, Kent State once again made history by appointing Carol Cartwright as president of the university, the first female to hold such a position at any state university in Ohio. In 1994, Kent State was named a &quot;Research University II&quot; by the Carnegie Foundation. Beginning in the late 1990s, the university began a series of building renovations and construction, which included the complete renovation of the historic original campus, the construction of several new residence halls, a student recreation center, and additional academic buildings on the Kent Campus and at the regional campuses. In September 2010, the university announced its largest student body ever, with a total enrollment of 41,365. U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2017 rankings put Kent State as tied for #188 for National Universities and tied for #101 in Top Public Schools. Kent State had a Fall 2015 acceptance rate of 85%.

==Campuses==

Kent State University is an eight-campus system in Northeast Ohio, with the main administrative center and largest campus in Kent.

===Kent===

Within the Kent State University system, the main campus is officially referred to as the &quot;Kent Campus&quot;. The Kent Campus is a landscaped suburban environment in the Greater Akron area.

<text>Frank Kelly Freas (August 27, 1922 – January 2, 2005) was an American artist known for his work in science fiction and fantasy, with a career spanning more than 50 years. He was known as the &quot;Dean of Science Fiction Artists&quot; and he was the second artist inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame.

==Early life, education, and personal life==

He was born August 27, 1922, in Hornell, New York, as Francis Sylvester Kelly. After his parents divorced, his mother remarried in 1939, and he took on his stepfather&#x27;s last name of Freas. Frank Kelly Freas (pronounced like &quot;freeze&quot;) was the son of two photographers, and was raised in Canada. He was educated at Lafayette High School in Buffalo, where he received training from long-time art teacher Elizabeth Weiffenbach. He entered the United States Army Air Forces right out of high school (Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada). He flew as camera man for reconnaissance in the South Pacific and painted bomber noses during World War II. He then worked for Curtiss-Wright for a brief period, then went to study at The Art Institute of Pittsburgh and began to work in advertising. His first marriage was in 1948 to Nina Vaccaro, though they later divorced. He later married Pauline (Polly) Bussard in 1952; they had two children, Jacqui and Jerry. Polly died of cancer in January 1987. In 1988 he married (and is survived by) Dr. Laura Brodian.

==Career==
Freas began his work as a commercial artist in the late 1940s, mostly for television. His goal was to become a science fiction artist.
The fantasy magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published the first cover art by Freas on its November 1950 issue: &quot;The Piper&quot; illustrating &quot;The Third Shadow&quot; by H. Russell Wakefield. His second was a year later in the same magazine, followed by several &quot;Planet Stories&quot; or &quot;Weird Tales&quot; covers and interior illustrations for three Gnome Press books in 1952. With his illustrating career underway, he continued to devise unique and imaginative concepts for other fantasy and science fiction magazines of that period. In a field where airbrushing is common practice, paintings by Freas are notable for his use of bold brush strokes, and a study of his work reveals his experimentation with a wide variety of tools and techniques.

Over the next five decades, he created covers for hundreds of books and magazines (and much more interior artwork), notably &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, both before and after its title change to &quot;Analog&quot;, from 1953 to 2003. He started at &quot;Mad&quot; magazine in February 1957 and by July 1958 was the magazine&#x27;s new cover artist; he painted most of its covers until October 1962 (featuring the iconic character, Alfred E. Neuman). He also created cover illustrations for DAW, Signet, Ballantine Books, Avon, all 58 Laser Books (which are now collectors&#x27; items), and over 90 covers for Ace books alone. He was editor and artist for the first ten &quot;Starblaze&quot; books. He illustrated the cover of Jean Shepherd, Ian Ballantine, and Theodore Sturgeon&#x27;s literary hoax, &quot;I, Libertine&quot; (Ballantine Books, 1956). That same year he drew cartoon illustrations for Bernard Shir-Cliff&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Reader&quot;.

Freas also painted insignia and posters for Skylab I; pinup girls on bombers while in the United States Army Air Forces; comic book covers; the covers of the &quot;GURPS&quot; worldbooks &quot;Lensman&quot; and &quot;Planet Krishna&quot;; and more than 500 saints&#x27; portraits for the Franciscans executed simultaneously with his portraits of Alfred E. Neuman for &quot;Mad&quot;. He was very active in gaming and medical illustration. His cover of Queen&#x27;s album &quot;News of the World&quot; (1977) was a pastiche of his October 1953 cover illustration for Tom Godwin&#x27;s &quot;The Gulf Between&quot; for &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine.

Freas published several collections of his color and black-and-white artwork in the volumes &quot;Frank Kelly Freas: The Art of Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Frank Kelly Freas: As Others See it&quot;, as well as in a spiral-bound collection of his black-and-white illustrations from &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. He also frequently gave art presentations, and his work appeared in numerous exhibitions. He was among several of the inaugural recipients of the Hugo Award for Best Artist in 1955 and was recipient under different names of the next three conferred in 1956, 1958, and 1959. With six more Hugo awards to his name (1970 and 1972–76), he became the first person to receive ten Hugo awards (he was nominated 20 times). No other artist in science fiction has consistently matched his record and output.

Freas was twice a Guest of Honor at Worldcon, at Chicon IV in 1982 and at Torcon 3 in 2003, although a fall suffered shortly before the latter convention precluded him from attending.

He died in West Hills, California and is buried in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth.

<doc id="16988" wikidata="Q3179617" url="?curid=16988" title="Knock-knock joke">
<text>The knock-knock joke is an audience-participation joke cycle; a knock-knock joke is primarily a child&#x27;s joke, though there are exceptions.

The scenario is of a person knocking on the front door to a house. The teller of the joke says, &quot;Knock, knock!&quot;; the recipient responds, &quot;Who&#x27;s there?&quot; The teller gives a name (such as &quot;Noah&quot;), a description (such as &quot;Police&quot;), or something that purports to be a name (such as &quot;Needle&quot;). The other person then responds by asking the caller&#x27;s surname (&quot;Noah who?&quot; / &quot;Police who?&quot; / &quot;Needle who?&quot;), to which the joke-teller delivers a pun involving the name (&quot; place I can spend the night?&quot; / &quot; let me in—it&#x27;s cold out here!&quot; / &quot; help with the groceries!&quot;).

The formula of the joke is usually followed strictly, though there are cases where it is subverted.

==History==
A possible source of the joke is William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;; first performed in 1606. In Act 2, Scene 3, the porter is very hungover from the previous night. During his monologue, he uses &quot;Knock, knock! Who&#x27;s there&quot; as a refrain while he is speaking:

Writing in the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, Merely McEvoy recalled a style of joke from around 1900 where a person would ask a question such as &quot;Do you know Arthur?&quot;, the unsuspecting listener responding with &quot;Arthur who?&quot; and the joke teller answering &quot;!&quot;

A variation of the format in the form of a children&#x27;s game was described in 1929. In the game of Buff, a child with a stick thumps it on the ground, and the dialogue ensues:

In 1936, Bob Dunn authored the book &quot;Knock Knock: Featuring Enoch Knox&quot;, and he is regarded by some as having invented the modern knock-knock joke.

In 1936, the standard knock-knock joke format was used in a newspaper advertisement. That joke was:

A 1936 Associated Press newspaper article said that &quot;What&#x27;s This?&quot; had given way to &quot;Knock Knock!&quot; as a favorite parlor game. The article also said that &quot;knock knock&quot; seemed to be an outgrowth of making up sentences with difficult words, an old parlor favorite. A popular joke of 1936 (the year of Edward VIII&#x27;s brief reign) was &quot;Knock knock. Who&#x27;s there? Edward Rex. Edward Rex who? the Coronation.&quot; Fred Allen&#x27;s 30 December 1936 radio broadcast included a humorous wrapup of the year&#x27;s least important events, including a supposed interview with the man who &quot;invented a negative craze&quot; on 1 April: &quot;Ramrod Dank... the first man to coin a Knock Knock.&quot;

==Popular culture==
&quot;Knock knock&quot; was the catchphrase of music hall performer Wee Georgie Wood, who was recorded in 1936 saying it in a radio play, but he simply used the words as a reference to his surname and did not use it as part of the well-known joke formula. The format was well known in the UK and US in the 1950s and 1960s before falling out of favor. It then enjoyed a renaissance after the jokes became a regular part of the badinage on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

An example of a non-standard knock-knock joke is:
Knock knock.
Who&#x27;s there?
Death.
Death wh-gkh (gagging sound of sudden fatal choking).

Being familiar with the back-and-forth pattern of the joke is crucial. In an episode of the TV detective series &quot;Monk&quot;, Adrian Monk is feeling sad. His assistant, Natalie, tries to cheer him up. She says she has thought of something funny, and asks if he wants to hear it. &quot;Yes,&quot; he answers. She begins, using the standard formula, &quot;Knock knock.&quot; Adrian pauses, obviously thinking about this, but puzzled. Then he dismisses it, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s not funny.&quot; The joke, this time, is that he is not familiar with knock-knock jokes.

<doc id="16989" wikidata="Q3192653" url="?curid=16989" title="Kangol">
<text>Kangol is a British clothing company famous for its headwear. The name Kangol reflects the original materials for production, the K coming from the word &#x27;silK&#x27; (a recent attribution to &#x27;Knitting&#x27; is incorrect), the ANG from &#x27;ANGora&#x27;, and the OL from &#x27;woOL&#x27;. Although no Kangol hat has ever actually been manufactured in Australia, the Kangaroo logo was adopted by Kangol in 1983 because Americans commonly asked where they could get &quot;the Kangaroo hat&quot;.

==Early history==
Founded in 1938 by a Polish Jew, Jacques Spreiregen, Kangol produced hats for workers, golfers, and especially soldiers. Spreiregen, born Jacob Henryk Spreiregen in Warsaw in 1893, emigrated with his family to Paris in 1906. He then moved to London in 1914, where he worked as an importer and seller of various products that included wool, woollen goods, and berets. He served in the British Army in World War I, joining the Labour Corps to drive ambulances, and obtained British nationality in 1920. In 1938 he was joined by his nephew Joseph Meisner to open and run the first Kangol factory at Cleator, Cumbria, England. A second factory was opened at nearby Frizington, and later, under the direction of Spreiregen&#x27;s younger nephew Sylvain Meisner, a third factory, manufacturing motorcycle helmets and seat belts in Carlisle. Kangol was the major supplier of berets for the armed forces during World War II; the company also provided the berets for the British Olympic Team in 1948.

==Recent history==
Kangol has been owned by Frasers Group since 2006, when it acquired the brand from private-equity fund August Equity Trust. Licences to manufacture and sell Kangol apparel have been sold to many different companies, including D2 and Topshop. In 2002, the Kangol apparel brand was acquired by Kangol Clothing North America LLC, a subsidiary of Chesterfield Manufacturing Corp in Charlotte North Carolina. In 2003, Chesterfield was acquired by Tomasello Inc., which was wholly owned and led by David W. Tomasello. The global rights to Kangol hats have been held by American hatmakers Bollman Hat Company since 2002.

It was announced in February 2009 that Bollman were reviewing their worldwide operations, putting 33 jobs and the future of the Kangol head office in Cleator in doubt. On 6 April 2009, it was announced that the original factory would be converted to a warehouse with the loss of 25 jobs. No employees now remain employed at the company&#x27;s original site as the outlet shop closed at the end of August 2009. The site in Frizington is now a housing estate, whilst the original Cleator site has been partly demolished to provide a Park &amp; Ride facility for nearby Sellafield and to facilitate other potential redevelopment. However, hats will continue to be made at their sites in Eastern Europe and the United States.

==Pop fashion==
In the 1960s, designers Mary Quant and Pierre Cardin worked with the company, whose products graced the heads of the rich and famous, including the Beatles and Arnold Palmer, and later Diana, Princess of Wales. The company also supplied uniformed organisations such as the Scout Association.

In the 1980s Kangol berets entered a new phase of fashion history with their adoption by members of the hip-hop community, such as Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Kangol Kid of UTFO, and The Notorious B.I.G.

The brand was popularised even more by the 1991 movie &quot;New Jack City&quot;. The release of more consciously stylish products in the 1990s such as the furgora (angora-wool mix) Spitfire, was helped by its presence upon the head of Samuel L. Jackson in 1997. Kevin Eubanks, bandleader for &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, sported a Kangol beret on an almost nightly basis.

In 2009, Eminem wore the Cotton Twill Army Cap Kangol hat on his &quot;Beautiful&quot; video. As of 2024, Eminem&#x27;s main hat style has been Kangol&#x27;s army caps.

==In popular culture==
* The Kangol Bermuda Casual bucket hat served as the iconic signature headwear for rap artist/actor LL Cool J early in his music career.
* Rap and hip-hop artists Slick Rick, Dana Dane, De La Soul and N.W.A have referenced Kangol in their lyrics.
* Wesley Snipes as Nino Brown and his gang, the Cash Money Brothers, wear hats by Kangol throughout the movie &quot;New Jack City&quot;.
* Samuel L. Jackson is known for wearing Kangol hats. His character Ordell Robbie wore a Kangol back to front in the movie &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;.
* The movie &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; features a scene where Ice Cube gets into a dispute with a New York rapper, eventually telling him &quot;Wearing a Kangol don&#x27;t make you LL Cool J!&quot;

<doc id="16991" wikidata="Q211696" url="?curid=16991" title="Keith Moon">
<text>Keith John Moon (23 August 1946 – 7 September 1978) was an English musician who was the drummer for the rock band the Who. Regarded as one of the greatest drummers in the history of rock music, he was noted for his unique style of playing and his eccentric, often self-destructive behaviour.

Moon grew up in Wembley and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they recorded their first single. Moon was recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. Throughout his tenure with the Who, his drum kit steadily grew in size, and (along with Ginger Baker) he has been credited as one of the earliest rock drummers to regularly employ double bass drums in his setup. Moon occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation, and remained a member of the band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated with blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and destroying television sets. Moon also enjoyed touring and socialising, and became bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.

Moon suffered a number of setbacks during the 1970s, most notably the accidental death of chauffeur Neil Boland and the breakdown of his marriage. He suffered from alcoholism and acquired a reputation for decadence and dark humour; his nickname was &quot;Moon the Loon&quot;. While touring with the Who, on several occasions he passed out on stage and was hospitalised. By the time of their final tour with him in 1976, and particularly during production of the studio album &quot;Who Are You&quot; (1978) and the concert film &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, his deterioration was evident. Moon moved back to London from Los Angeles in 1978, dying that September from an overdose of clomethiazole, a drug intended to treat or prevent symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

Moon&#x27;s drumming continues to be praised by critics and musicians. He was posthumously inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011 he was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll. Moon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a member of the Who.

==Early life==

Keith John Moon was born to motor mechanic Alfred Charles Moon and Kathleen Winifred (&quot;Kit&quot;), née Hopley, on 23 August 1946 at Central Middlesex Hospital in northwest London; he grew up in Wembley. Moon was hyperactive as a boy, with a restless imagination and a particular fondness for music and &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. Moon attended Alperton Secondary Modern School after failing his eleven plus exam, which precluded his attending a grammar school. His art teacher said in a report: &quot;Retarded artistically. Idiotic in other respects.&quot; His music teacher wrote that Moon &quot;has great ability, but must guard against a tendency to show off.&quot;

Moon joined his local Sea Cadet Corps band at the age of twelve on the bugle, but found the instrument too difficult to learn and decided to take up drums instead. He was interested in practical jokes and home science kits, with a particular fondness for explosions. On his way home from school, Moon would often go to Macari&#x27;s Music Studio on Ealing Road to practise on the drums there, learning his basic skills on the instrument. He left school around Easter 1961, at age 14. Moon then enrolled at Harrow Technical College; this led to a job as a radio repairman, enabling him to buy his first drum kit.

==Career==
===Early years===
Moon took lessons from one of the loudest contemporary drummers, Screaming Lord Sutch&#x27;s Carlo Little, at ten shillings per lesson. His early style was influenced by jazz, American surf music and rhythm and blues, exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer Hal Blaine. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). He also admired Elvis Presley&#x27;s original drummer DJ Fontana, The Shadows&#x27; original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things&#x27; Viv Prince. Moon also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even at the peak of the Who&#x27;s fame.

During this time Moon joined his first serious band, the Escorts, replacing his best friend Gerry Evans. In December 1962 he joined the Beachcombers, a semi-professional London cover band playing hits by groups such as The Shadows. During his time in the group Moon incorporated theatrical tricks into his act, including &quot;shooting&quot; the group&#x27;s lead singer with a starter pistol. The Beachcombers all had day jobs; Moon, who worked in the sales department at British Gypsum, had the keenest interest in turning professional. In April 1964, aged 17, he auditioned for the Who as a replacement for Doug Sandom. The Beachcombers continued as a local cover band after his departure.

===The Who===
A commonly cited story of how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom&#x27;s departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a &quot;ginger vision&quot;), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; he played in the set&#x27;s second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process.

As Moon later recounted: &quot;[T]hey said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy&#x27;s drums and did one song—&#x27;Road Runner.&#x27; I&#x27;d several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went &quot;arrgggGhhhh&quot; on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: &#x27;You ... come &#x27;ere.&#x27; I said, mild as you please: &#x27;Yes, yes?&#x27; And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: &#x27;What are you doing next Monday?&#x27; I said: &#x27;Nothing.&#x27; I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: &#x27;You&#x27;ll have to give up work ... there&#x27;s this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we&#x27;ll pick you up in the van.&#x27; I said: &#x27;Right.&#x27; And that was it.&quot; Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had &quot;just been filling in for the last fifteen years.&quot;

Moon&#x27;s arrival in the Who changed the dynamics of the group. Sandom had generally been the peacemaker as Daltrey and Townshend feuded between themselves, but because of Moon&#x27;s temperament the group now had four members frequently in conflict. &quot;We used to fight regularly&quot;, remembered Moon in later years. &quot;John [Entwistle] and I used to have fights—it wasn&#x27;t very serious, it was more of an emotional spur-of-the moment thing.&quot; Moon also clashed with Daltrey and Townshend: &quot;We really have absolutely nothing in common apart from music&quot;, he said in a later interview. Although Townshend described him as a &quot;completely different person to anyone I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;, the pair had a rapport in the early years and enjoyed practical jokes and improvised comedy. Moon&#x27;s drumming style affected the band&#x27;s musical structure; although Entwistle initially found Moon&#x27;s lack of conventional timekeeping problematic, it created an original sound.

Moon was particularly fond of touring since it was his only chance to regularly socialise with his bandmates, and was generally restless and bored when not playing live. This later carried over to other aspects of his life, as he acted them out (according to journalist and Who biographer Dave Marsh) &quot;as if his life were one long tour&quot;. These antics earned him the nickname &quot;Moon the Loon&quot;.

====Musical contributions====

Moon&#x27;s style of drumming was considered unique by his bandmates, although they sometimes found his unconventional playing frustrating; Entwistle noted that he tended to play faster or slower according to his mood. &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t play across his kit&quot;, he later added. &quot;He&#x27;d play zig-zag. That&#x27;s why he had two sets of tom-toms. He&#x27;d move his arms forward like a skier.&quot; Daltrey said that Moon &quot;just instinctively put drum fills in places that other people would never have thought of putting them&quot;.

Who biographer John Atkins wrote that the group&#x27;s early test sessions for Pye Records in 1964 show that &quot;they seemed to have understood just how important was ... Moon&#x27;s contribution.&quot; Contemporary critics questioned his ability to keep time, with biographer Tony Fletcher suggesting that the timing on &quot;Tommy&quot; was &quot;all over the place&quot;. Who producer Jon Astley said, &quot;You didn&#x27;t think he was keeping time, but he was.&quot; In the opinion of Atkins, early recordings of Moon&#x27;s drumming sound tinny and disorganised; it was not until the recording of &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, with Glyn Johns&#x27; no-nonsense production techniques and the need to keep time to a synthesizer track, that Moon began developing more discipline in the studio. Fletcher considers the drumming on this album to be the best of Moon&#x27;s career.

Unlike contemporary rock drummers such as Ginger Baker and John Bonham, Moon hated drum solos and refused to play them in concert. At a Madison Square Garden show during The Who&#x27;s 1974 tour, Townshend and Entwistle decided to spontaneously stop playing during &quot;Waspman&quot; to listen to Moon&#x27;s drum solo. Moon continued briefly and then stopped, shouting, &quot;Drum solos are boring!&quot; On 23 June 1977, he made a guest appearance at a Led Zeppelin concert in Los Angeles.
Moon also aspired to sing lead vocal on some songs. While the other three members handled most of the onstage vocals, Moon would attempt to sing backup (particularly on &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;). He provided humorous commentary during song announcements, although sound engineer Bob Pridden preferred to mute his vocal microphone on the mixing desk whenever possible. Moon&#x27;s knack for making his bandmates laugh around the microphone led them to banish him from the studio when vocals were being recorded; this led to a game in which Moon would sneak in to join the singing. At the end of &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, Townshend can be heard saying, &quot;I saw ya!&quot; to Moon as he tries to sneak into the studio. The drummer&#x27;s interest in surf music and his desire to sing led to his performing lead vocals on several early tracks, including &quot;Bucket T&quot; and &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; (&quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; EP, 1966) and high backing vocals on other songs, such as &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot;. His performance on &quot;Bell Boy&quot; (&quot;Quadrophenia&quot;, 1973) saw him abandon &quot;serious&quot; vocal performances to sing in character, which gave him (in Fletcher&#x27;s words) &quot;full licence to live up to his reputation as a lecherous drunk&quot;; it was &quot;exactly the kind of performance the Who needed from him to bring them back down to earth.&quot;

Moon composed &quot;I Need You&quot;, the instrumental &quot;Cobwebs and Strange&quot; (from the album &quot;A Quick One&quot;, 1966), the single B-sides &quot;In The City&quot; (co-written with Entwistle) and &quot;Girl&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (from &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; sessions featured on &quot;Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B&quot; and a 1995 re-release of &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;), &quot;Dogs Part Two&quot; (1969) and &quot;Waspman&quot; (1972). Moon also co-composed &quot;The Ox&quot; (an instrumental from their debut album, &quot;My Generation&quot;) with Townshend, Entwistle and keyboardist Nicky Hopkins. &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot; (from &quot;Tommy&quot;) was credited to Moon because he came up with the idea, but the song was actually written by Townshend and, although there is a misconception that Moon sings on it, the album version is Townshend&#x27;s demo.

Moon produced the violin solo on &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;. Moon sat in on congas with East of Eden at London&#x27;s Lyceum Ballroom, and afterwards suggested to violinist Dave Arbus that he play on the track.

====Equipment====
Moon played a four- and later a five-piece drum kit during his early career. During much of 1964 and 1965 his setups consisted of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. He began to endorse Premier Drums in late 1965 and remained a loyal customer of the company. His first Premier kit was in red sparkle and featured two high toms. In 1966, Moon moved to an even larger kit, but without the customary hi-hat—at the time he preferred keeping ride rhythms with ride and crash cymbals, but he later reinstated the hi-hats. His new larger configuration was notable for the presence of two bass drums; he has been credited, along with Ginger Baker, as one of the early pioneers of double bass drumming in rock. This kit was not used at the Who&#x27;s performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. From 1967 to 1969, Moon used the &quot;Pictures of Lily&quot; drum kit (named for its artwork), which had two bass drums, two floor toms and three mounted toms. In recognition of his loyalty to the company, Premier reissued the kit in 2006 as the &quot;Spirit of Lily&quot;.

By 1970, Moon had begun to use timbales, gongs and timpani, and these were included in his setup for the rest of his career. In 1973, Premier&#x27;s marketing manager, Eddie Haynes, began consulting Moon about specific requirements. At one point, Moon asked Premier to make a white kit with gold-plated fittings. When Haynes said that it would be prohibitively expensive, Moon replied: &quot;Dear boy, do exactly as you feel it should be, but that&#x27;s the way I want it.&quot; The kit was eventually fitted with copper fittings and later given to a young Zak Starkey.

====Destroying instruments and other stunts====
At an early show at the Railway Tavern in Harrow, Townshend smashed his guitar after accidentally breaking it. When the audience demanded he do it again, Moon kicked over his drum kit. Subsequent live sets culminated in what the band later described as &quot;auto-destructive art&quot;, in which band members (particularly Moon and Townshend) elaborately destroyed their equipment. Moon developed a habit of kicking over his drums, claiming that he did so in exasperation at an audience&#x27;s indifference. Townshend later said, &quot;A set of skins is about $300 [then £96] and after every show he&#x27;d just go bang, bang, bang and then kick the whole thing over.&quot;

In May 1966, Moon discovered that the Beach Boys&#x27; Bruce Johnston was visiting London. After the pair socialised for a few days, Moon and Entwistle brought Johnston to the set of &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;, which made them late for a show with the Who that evening. During the finale of &quot;My Generation&quot;, an altercation broke out on stage between Moon and Townshend which was reported on the front page of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; the following week. Moon and Entwistle left the Who for a week (with Moon hoping to join the Animals or the Nashville Teens), but they changed their minds and returned.

On the Who&#x27;s early US package tour at the RKO 58th Street Theatre in New York in March and April 1967, Moon performed two or three shows a day, kicking over his drum kit after every show. Later that year, during their appearance on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, he bribed a stagehand to load gunpowder into one of his bass drums; the stagehand used about ten times the standard amount. During the finale of &quot;My Generation&quot;, he set off the charge. The intensity of the explosion singed Townshend&#x27;s hair and embedded a piece of cymbal in Moon&#x27;s arm. A clip of the incident became the opening scene for the film &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;.

Although Moon was known for kicking over his drum kit, Haynes claimed that it was done carefully and the kit rarely needed repairs. However, stands and foot pedals were frequently replaced; the drummer &quot;would go through them like a knife through butter&quot;.

===Other work===
====Music====

While Moon generally said he was only interested in working with the Who, he participated in outside musical projects. In 1966, he worked with Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck, pianist Nicky Hopkins and future Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones on the instrumental &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot;, which was the B-side to &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot; and appeared on the album &quot;Truth&quot;. Moon also played timpani on another track, a cover of Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;. He was credited on the album as &quot;You Know Who&quot;.

Moon may have inspired the name for Led Zeppelin when he supposedly briefly considered leaving the Who in 1966 and spoke with Entwistle and Page about forming a supergroup; Moon (or Entwistle) remarked that a particular suggestion had gone down like a &quot;lead zeppelin&quot; (a play on &quot;lead balloon&quot;). Although this supergroup was never formed, Page remembered the phrase and later adapted it as the name of his new band.

The Beatles became friends with Moon, and this led to occasional collaborations. In 1967, he contributed backing vocals to &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. On 15 December 1969, Moon joined John Lennon&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band for a live performance at the Lyceum Theatre in London for a UNICEF charity concert. In 1972, the performance was released as a companion disc to Lennon and Ono&#x27;s album &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;.

Moon&#x27;s friendship with Entwistle led to an appearance on &quot;Smash Your Head Against the Wall&quot;, Entwistle&#x27;s first solo album and the first by a member of the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album; Jerry Shirley did, with Moon providing percussion. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle&#x27;s decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.

Moon became involved in solo work when he moved to Los Angeles during the mid-1970s. Track Records-MCA released a Moon solo single in 1974, comprising cover versions of the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, Baby&quot; and &quot;Teenage Idol&quot;. The following year he released his only solo album, entitled &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot;. Although it featured Moon on vocals, he played drums on only three tracks; most of the drumming was left to others (including Ringo Starr, session musicians Curly Smith and Jim Keltner, and actor-musician Miguel Ferrer). The album was received poorly by critics. &quot;New Musical Express&quot;″s Roy Carr wrote, &quot;Moonie, if you didn&#x27;t have talent, I wouldn&#x27;t care; but you have, which is why I&#x27;m not about to accept &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot;.&quot; Dave Marsh, reviewing the album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote: &quot;There isn&#x27;t any legitimate reason for this album&#x27;s existence.&quot; During one of his few televised solo drum performances (for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World&quot;), Moon played a five-minute drum solo dressed as a cat on transparent acrylic drums filled with water and goldfish. When asked by an audience member what would happen to the kit, he joked that &quot;even the best drummers get hungry.&quot; His performance was not appreciated by animal lovers, several of whom called the station with complaints.

====Film====
In the 2007 documentary film &quot;Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who&quot;, Daltrey and Townshend reminisced about Moon&#x27;s talent for dressing as (and embodying) a variety of characters. They remembered his dream of getting out of music and becoming a Hollywood film actor, although Daltrey did not think Moon had the patience and work ethic required of a professional actor. Who manager Bill Curbishley agreed that Moon &quot;wasn&#x27;t disciplined enough to actually turn up or commit to doing the stuff&quot;.

Nevertheless, the drummer landed several acting roles. His first was in 1971, a cameo in Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;200 Motels&quot; as a nun afraid of dying from a drug overdose. Although it only took 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon spending off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon&#x27;s next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stormy Tempest (played by Billy Fury) at a holiday camp during the early days of British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, in 1973&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot;. He reprised the role for the film&#x27;s 1974 sequel, &quot;Stardust&quot;, in Jim MacLaine&#x27;s (David Essex) backing band the Stray Cats and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell&#x27;s 1975 film adaptation of &quot;Tommy&quot;. Moon&#x27;s last film appearance was in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Sextette&quot;.

==Destructive behaviour==
Moon led a destructive lifestyle. During the Who&#x27;s early days he began taking amphetamines, and in a &quot;NME&quot; interview said his favourite food was &quot;French Blues&quot;. He spent his share of the band&#x27;s income quickly, and was a regular at London clubs such as the Speakeasy (where manager Roy Flynn recalls having to throw him out on three occasions) and The Bag O&#x27;Nails. The combination of pills and alcohol escalated into alcoholism and drug addiction. &quot;[We] went through the same stages everybody goes through – the bloody drug corridor&quot;, he later reflected. &quot;Drinking suited the group a lot better.&quot;

According to Townshend, Moon began destroying hotel rooms when the Who stayed at the Berlin Hilton on tour in late 1966. In addition to hotel rooms, Moon destroyed friends&#x27; homes—and even his own—including throwing furniture from upper-storey windows. Andrew Neill and Matthew Kent estimated that his destruction of hotel toilets and plumbing cost as much as £300,000. These acts, often fuelled by drugs and alcohol, were Moon&#x27;s way of demonstrating his eccentricity and he enjoyed shocking the public with them. Longtime friend and personal assistant, Dougal Butler, observed: &quot;He was trying to make people laugh and be Mr Funny; he wanted people to love him and enjoy him, but he would go so far. Like a train ride you couldn&#x27;t stop.&quot;

In a limousine on the way to the airport, Moon insisted they return to their hotel, saying &quot;I forgot something.&quot; At the hotel he ran back to his room, grabbed the television and threw it out of the window into the swimming pool below. He then jumped back into the limo, saying &quot;I nearly forgot.&quot;

Fletcher argues that the Who&#x27;s lengthy break (15 December 1971 – 11 August 1972) between the end of their 1971 Who&#x27;s Next Tour and the beginning of the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; sessions devastated Moon&#x27;s health, as without the rigours of lengthy shows and regular touring that had previously kept him in shape, his hard-partying lifestyle took a greater toll on his body. He did not keep a drum kit or practise at Tara, and began to deteriorate physically as a result of his lifestyle. Around the same time he became a severe alcoholic, starting the day with drinks. He changed from the &quot;lovable boozer&quot; he presented himself as, to a &quot;boorish drunk&quot;. David Puttnam recalled, &quot;The drinking went from being a joke to being a problem. On &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; it was social drinking. By the time &quot;Stardust&quot; came round it was hard drinking.&quot;

===Exploding toilets===
Moon&#x27;s favourite stunt was to flush powerful explosives down toilets. According to Fletcher, Moon&#x27;s toilet pyrotechnics began in 1965 when he purchased a case of 500 cherry bombs. Townshend remembers walking into the bathroom of Moon&#x27;s hotel room and noticing the toilet had disappeared, with only the S-bend remaining. The drummer explained that since a cherry bomb was about to explode, he had thrown it down the toilet and showed Townshend the case of cherry bombs. &quot;And of course from that moment on,&quot; the guitarist remembered, &quot;we got thrown out of every hotel we ever stayed in.&quot;

Moon moved from cherry bombs to M-80 fireworks to sticks of dynamite, which became his explosive of choice. &quot;All that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable,&quot; Moon remembered. &quot;I never realised dynamite was so powerful. I&#x27;d been used to penny bangers before.&quot; He quickly developed a reputation for destroying bathrooms and blowing up toilets. The destruction mesmerised him, and enhanced his public image as rock&#x27;s premier hell-raiser. Tony Fletcher wrote that &quot;no toilet in a hotel or changing room was safe&quot; until Moon had exhausted his supply of explosives.

Entwistle recalled being close to Moon on tour and both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; interview he admitted, &quot;A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was standing behind him with the matches.&quot;

Once, a hotel manager called Moon in his room and asked him to lower the volume on his cassette recorder because it made &quot;too much noise&quot;. In response the drummer asked him up to his room, excused himself to go to the bathroom, put a lit stick of dynamite in the toilet and shut the bathroom door. Upon returning, he asked the manager to stay for a moment, as he wanted to explain something. Following the explosion, Moon turned the recorder back on and said, &quot;That, dear boy, was noise. This is the &#x27;Oo.

===Flint Holiday Inn incident===
On 23 August 1967, on tour opening for Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Moon celebrated what he said was his 21st birthday (although it was thought at the time to be his 20th) at a Holiday Inn in Flint, Michigan. Entwistle later said, &quot;He decided that if it was a publicised fact that it was his 21st birthday, he would be able to drink.&quot;

The drummer immediately began drinking upon his arrival in Flint. The Who spent the afternoon visiting local radio stations with Nancy Lewis (then the band&#x27;s publicist), and Moon posed for a photo outside the hotel in front of a &quot;Happy Birthday Keith&quot; sign put up by the hotel management. According to Lewis, Moon was drunk by the time the band went onstage at Atwood Stadium.

Returning to the hotel, Moon started a food fight and soon cake began flying through the air. The drummer knocked out part of his front tooth; at the hospital, doctors could not give him an anaesthetic (due to his inebriation) before removing the remainder of the tooth. Back at the hotel, a melee erupted; fire extinguishers were set off, guests (and objects) thrown into the swimming pool and a piano reportedly destroyed. The chaos ended only when police arrived with guns drawn.

A furious Holiday Inn management presented the groups with a bill for $24,000 (equivalent to about $ in ), which was reportedly settled by Herman&#x27;s Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life from all of the hotel&#x27;s properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York, a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel&#x27;s swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview. However, Roger Daltrey, in an interview on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;, stated that the group was banned from &quot;an entire state&#x27;s worth of Holiday Inns&quot;, presumably then Michigan. He also claimed that, while he had not personally seen a car in a swimming pool, he had seen a bill for damages and removal.

===Passing out on stage===
Moon&#x27;s lifestyle began to undermine his health and reliability. During the 1973 Quadrophenia tour, at the Who&#x27;s debut US date at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, Moon ingested a mixture of sedatives and brandy. During the concert, Moon passed out on his drum kit during &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. The band stopped playing, and a group of roadies carried Moon offstage. They gave him a shower and an injection of cortisone, sending him back onstage after a thirty-minute delay. Moon passed out again during &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, and was again removed from the stage. The band continued without him for several songs before Townshend asked, &quot;Can anyone play the drums? – I mean somebody good?&quot; A drummer in the audience, Scot Halpin, came up and played the rest of the show.

During the opening date of the band&#x27;s March 1976 US tour at the Boston Garden, Moon passed out over his drum kit after two numbers and the show was rescheduled. The next evening, Moon systematically destroyed everything in his hotel room, cut himself doing so, and passed out. He was discovered by manager Bill Curbishley, who took him to a hospital, telling him &quot;I&#x27;m gonna get the doctor to get you nice and fit, so you&#x27;re back within two days. Because I want to break your fucking jaw ... You have fucked this band around so many times and I&#x27;m not having it any more.&quot; Doctors told Curbishley that if he had not intervened, Moon would have bled to death. Marsh suggested that at this point Daltrey and Entwistle seriously considered firing Moon, but decided that doing so would make his life worse.

Entwistle has said that Moon and the Who reached their live peak in 1975–76. At the end of the 1976 US tour in Miami that August, Moon became delirious and was treated in Hollywood Memorial Hospital for eight days. The group was concerned that he would be unable to complete the last leg of the tour, which ended at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on 21 October (Moon&#x27;s last public show). During the band&#x27;s recording sabbatical between 1976 and 1978, Moon gained a considerable amount of weight. By the time of the Who&#x27;s invitation-only show at the Gaumont State Cinema on 15 December 1977 for &quot;The Kids are Alright&quot;, Moon was visibly overweight and had difficulty sustaining a solid performance. After recording &quot;Who Are You&quot;, Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking and said that if Moon&#x27;s playing did not improve he would be fired. Daltrey later denied threatening to fire him, but said that by this time Moon was out of control.

===Financial problems===
Because the Who&#x27;s early stage act relied on smashing instruments and owing to Moon&#x27;s enthusiasm for damaging hotels, the group were in debt for much of the 1960s; Entwistle estimated they lost about £150,000. Even when the group became relatively financially stable after &quot;Tommy&quot;, Moon continued to rack up debts. He bought a number of cars and gadgets and flirted with bankruptcy. Moon&#x27;s recklessness with money reduced his profit from the group&#x27;s 1975 UK tour to £47.35 ().

==Personal life and relationships==

===Birthdate===
Before the 1998 release of Tony Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon&quot;, Moon&#x27;s date of birth was presumed to be 23 August 1947. This erroneous date appeared in several otherwise-reliable sources, including the Townshend-authorised biography &quot;Before I Get Old: The Story of The Who&quot;. The incorrect date had been supplied by Moon in interviews before it was corrected by Fletcher to 1946.

===Kim Kerrigan===

Moon&#x27;s first serious relationship was with Kim Kerrigan, whom he started dating in January 1965 after she saw the Who play at Le Disque a Go! Go! in Bournemouth. By the end of the year she discovered she was pregnant. Her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options, and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. She and Moon were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Register Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage (and child) were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: &quot;if we went out after I had Mandy&quot;, she later said, &quot;if someone talked to me, he&#x27;d lose it. We&#x27;d go home and he&#x27;d start a fight with me.&quot; He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. &quot;He had no idea how to be a father&quot;, Kim said. &quot;He was too much of a child himself.&quot;

From 1971 to 1975 Moon owned Tara, a home in Chertsey where he initially lived with his wife and daughter. The Moons entertained extravagantly at home, and owned a number of cars. Jack McCullogh, then working for Track Records (the Who&#x27;s label), recalls Moon ordering him to purchase a milk float to store in the garage at Tara.

In 1973 Kim, convinced that neither she nor anyone else could moderate Keith&#x27;s behaviour, left her husband and took Amanda; she sued for divorce in 1975 and later married Faces keyboard player Ian McLagan. Marsh believes that Moon never truly recovered from the loss of his family. Butler agrees; despite his relationship with Annette Walter-Lax, he believes that Kim was the only woman Moon loved. McLagan commented that Moon &quot;couldn&#x27;t handle it&quot;. Moon would harass them with phone calls, and on one occasion before Kim sued for divorce, he invited McLagan for a drink at a Richmond pub and sent several &quot;heavies&quot; to break into McLagan&#x27;s home on Fife Road and look for Kim, forcing her to hide in a walk-in closet. She died in a car accident in Austin, Texas, on 2 August 2006.

===Annette Walter-Lax===
In 1975 Moon began a relationship with Swedish model Annette Walter-Lax, who later said that Moon was &quot;so sweet when he was sober, that I was just living with him in the hope that he would kick all this craziness.&quot; She begged Malibu neighbour Larry Hagman to check Moon into a clinic to dry out (as he had attempted to do before), but when doctors recorded Moon&#x27;s chemical intake at breakfast, a bottle of champagne, Courvoisier and amphetamines, they concluded that there was no hope for his rehabilitation.

===Friends===
Moon enjoyed being the life of the party. Bill Curbishley remembered that &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t walk into any room and just listen. He was an attention seeker and he had to have it.&quot;

Early in the Who&#x27;s career, Moon got to know the Beatles. He would join them at clubs, forming a particularly close friendship with Ringo Starr. Moon later became friends with Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band members Vivian Stanshall and &quot;Legs&quot; Larry Smith, and the trio would drink and play practical jokes together. Smith remembers one occasion where he and Moon tore apart a pair of trousers, with an accomplice later looking for one-legged trousers. In the early 1970s, Moon helped Stanshall with his &quot;Radio Flashes&quot; radio show for BBC Radio 1, filling in for the vacationing John Peel. Moon filled in for Peel in 1973&#x27;s &quot;A Touch of the Moon&quot;, a series of four programmes produced by John Walters.

Guitarist Joe Walsh enjoyed socialising with Moon. In an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, he recalled that the drummer &quot;taught me how to break things&quot;. In 1974, Moon struck up a friendship with actor Oliver Reed while working on the film version of &quot;Tommy&quot;. Although Reed matched Moon drink for drink, he appeared on set the next morning ready to perform; Moon, on the other hand, would cost several hours of filming time. Reed later said that Moon &quot;showed me the way to insanity&quot;.

===Dougal Butler===

Peter &quot;Dougal&quot; Butler began working for the Who in 1967, becoming Moon&#x27;s personal assistant the following year to help him stay out of trouble. He remembers managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp saying, &quot;We trust you with Keith but if you ever want any time off, for a holiday or some sort of rest, let us know and we&#x27;ll pay for it.&quot; Butler never took them up on the offer.

He followed Moon when the drummer relocated to Los Angeles, but felt that the drug culture prevalent at the time was bad for Moon: &quot;My job was to have eyes in the back of my head.&quot; Townshend agreed, saying that by 1975 Butler had &quot;no influence over him whatsoever.&quot; Although he was a loyal companion to Moon, the lifestyle eventually became too much for him; he phoned Curbishley, saying that they needed to move back to England or one of them might die. Butler quit in 1978, and later wrote of his experiences in a book entitled &quot;Full Moon: The Amazing Rock and Roll Life of Keith Moon&quot;.

===Neil Boland===
On 4 January 1970, Moon accidentally killed his friend, driver and bodyguard, Neil Boland, outside the Red Lion pub in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Pub patrons had begun to attack his Bentley; Moon, drunk, began driving to escape them and hit Boland. After an investigation, the coroner ruled Boland&#x27;s death an accident; Moon, having been charged with a number of offences, received an absolute discharge.

Those close to Moon said that he was haunted by Boland&#x27;s death for the rest of his life. According to Pamela Des Barres, Moon had nightmares (which woke them both) about the incident and said he had no right to be alive.

==Death==
In mid-1978, Moon moved into Flat 12, 9 Curzon Place (later Curzon Square), Shepherd Market, Mayfair, London, renting from Harry Nilsson. Singer Cass Elliot of the Mamas &amp; the Papas had died there four years earlier, at the age of 32; Nilsson was concerned about letting the flat to Moon, believing it was cursed. Townshend disagreed, assuring him that &quot;lightning wouldn&#x27;t strike the same place twice&quot;.

After moving in, Moon began a prescribed course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He wanted to get sober, but because of his fear of psychiatric hospitals, he wanted to do it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon&#x27;s lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.

By September 1978, Moon was having difficulty playing the drums, according to roadie Dave &quot;Cy&quot; Langston. After seeing Moon in the studio trying to overdub drums for &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, he said, &quot;After two or three hours, he got more and more sluggish, he could barely hold a drum stick.&quot;

On 6 September, Moon and Walter-Lax were guests of Paul and Linda McCartney at a preview of a film, &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot;. After dining with the McCartneys at Peppermint Park in Covent Garden, Moon and Walter-Lax returned to their flat. He watched a film (&quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;), and asked Walter-Lax to cook him lamb cutlets (which Walter-Lax had stated was his favourite meal). When she objected, Moon replied, &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, you can fuck off!&quot; These were his last words. Moon then took some clomethiazole tablets. When Walter-Lax checked on him the following afternoon, she discovered he was dead.

Curbishley phoned the flat at around 5:00p.m. looking for Moon, and Dymond gave him the news. Curbishley told Townshend, who informed the rest of the band. Entwistle was giving an interview to two journalists when he was interrupted by a phone call with the news of Moon&#x27;s death. When asked about the band&#x27;s future plans, Entwistle burst into tears and quickly ended the interview.

Moon&#x27;s death came shortly after the release of their eighth studio album &quot;Who Are You&quot;. On the album cover, he is straddling a chair to hide his weight gain; the words &quot;Not to be taken away&quot; are on the back of the chair. Police determined that there were 32 clomethiazole pills in Moon&#x27;s system. Six were digested, sufficient to cause his death; the other 26 were undigested when he died. Max Glatt, an authority on alcoholism, wrote in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that Moon should never have been given the drug. Moon was cremated on 13 September 1978 at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and his ashes were scattered in its Gardens of Remembrance.

Townshend persuaded Daltrey and Entwistle to carry on touring as the Who, although he later said that it was his means of coping with Moon&#x27;s death and &quot;completely irrational, bordering on insane&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder said, &quot;When Keith Moon died, the Who carried on and were far more competent and reliable musically, but that wasn&#x27;t what sold rock records.&quot; In November 1978, Faces drummer Kenney Jones joined the Who. Townshend later said that Jones &quot;was one of the few British drummers who could fill Keith&#x27;s shoes&quot;; Daltrey was less enthusiastic, saying that Jones &quot;wasn&#x27;t the right style&quot;. Keyboardist John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick, who had rehearsed with Moon earlier in the year, joined the live band as an unofficial member.

Jones left the Who in 1988, and drummer Simon Phillips (who praised Moon&#x27;s ability to drum over the backing track of &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;) toured with the band the following year. Since 1996, the Who&#x27;s drummer has been Ringo Starr&#x27;s son Zak Starkey who, as a child, had been given a drum kit by Moon (whom he called &quot;Uncle Keith&quot;). Starkey had previously toured in 1994 with Roger Daltrey, and contributed to solo studio albums by Daltrey, and John Entwistle.

The London 2012 Summer Olympic Committee contacted Curbishley about Moon performing at the games, evidently unaware he had been dead for 34 years. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; Curbishley quipped, &quot;I emailed back saying Keith now resides in Golders Green Crematorium, having lived up to the Who&#x27;s anthemic line &#x27;I hope I die before I get old&#x27; ... If they have a round table, some glasses and candles, we might contact him.&quot;

==Legacy==
Moon&#x27;s drumming has been praised by critics. Author Nick Talevski described him as &quot;the greatest drummer in rock&quot;, adding that &quot;he was to the drums what Jimi Hendrix was to the guitar.&quot; Holly George-Warren, editor and author of &quot;The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: The First 25 Years&quot;, said: &quot;With the death of Keith Moon in 1978, rock arguably lost its single greatest drummer.&quot; According to AllMusic critic Bruce Eder, &quot;Moon, with his manic, lunatic side, and his life of excessive drinking, partying, and other indulgences, probably represented the youthful, zany side of rock &amp; roll, as well as its self-destructive side, better than anyone else on the planet.&quot; &quot;The New Book of Rock Lists&quot; ranked Moon No. 1 on its list of &quot;50 Greatest Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Drummers&quot;, and he was ranked No. 2 on the 2011 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Best Drummers of All Time&quot; readers&#x27; poll. In 2016, the same magazine ranked him No. 2 in their list of the 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time, behind John Bonham. Adam Budofsky, editor of &quot;Drummer&quot; magazine, said that Moon&#x27;s performances on &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; &quot;represent a perfect balance of technique and passion&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s been no drummer who&#x27;s touched his unique slant on rock and rhythm since.&quot;

Several rock drummers, including Neil Peart have cited Moon as an influence. The Jam paid homage to Moon on the second single from their third album, &quot;Down in the Tube Station at Midnight&quot;; the B-side of the single is a Who cover (&quot;So Sad About Us&quot;), and the back cover of the record has a photo of Moon&#x27;s face. The Jam&#x27;s single was released about a month after Moon&#x27;s death. Animal, one of Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppet characters, may have been based on Keith Moon due to their similar hair, eyebrows, personality and drumming style. Jazz drummer Elvin Jones praised Moon&#x27;s work during &quot;Underture&quot;, as integral to the song&#x27;s effect.

Ray Davies notably lauded Moon&#x27;s drumming during his speech for the Kinks&#x27; induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1990: &quot;... Keith Moon changed the sound of drumming.&quot;

&quot;God bless his beautiful heart ...&quot; Ozzy Osbourne told &quot;Sounds&quot; a month after the drummer&#x27;s death. &quot;People will be talking about Keith Moon &#x27;til they die, man. Someone somewhere will say, &#x27;Remember Keith Moon?&#x27; Who will remember Joe Bloggs who got killed in a car crash? No one. He&#x27;s dead, so what? He didn&#x27;t do anything to talk of.&quot;

Clem Burke of Blondie has said &quot;Early on all I cared about was Keith Moon and the Who. When I was about eleven or twelve, my favourite part of drum lessons was the last ten minutes, when I&#x27;d get to sit at the drumset and play along to my favourite record. I&#x27;d bring in &#x27;My Generation&#x27;. At the end of the song, the drums go nuts. &#x27;My Generation&#x27; was a turning point for me because before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing.&quot;

In 1998 Tony Fletcher published a biography of Moon, &quot;Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon&quot;, in the United Kingdom. The phrase &quot;Dear Boy&quot; became a catchphrase of Moon&#x27;s when, influenced by Kit Lambert, he began affecting a pompous English accent. In 2000, the book was released in the US as &quot;Moon (The Life and Death of a Rock Legend)&quot;. &quot;Q Magazine&quot; called the book &quot;horrific and terrific reading&quot;, and &quot;Record Collector&quot; said it was &quot;one of rock&#x27;s great biographies.&quot;

In 2008, English Heritage declined an application for Moon to be awarded a blue plaque. Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Christopher Frayling said they &quot;decided that bad behaviour and overdosing on various substances wasn&#x27;t a sufficient qualification.&quot; The UK&#x27;s Heritage Foundation disagreed with the decision, presenting a plaque which was unveiled on 9 March 2009. Daltrey, Townshend, Robin Gibb and Moon&#x27;s mother Kit were present at the ceremony.

<doc id="16992" wikidata="Q76904" url="?curid=16992" title="Kerosene">
<text>Kerosene, or paraffin, is a combustible hydrocarbon liquid which is derived from petroleum. It is widely used as a fuel in aviation as well as households. Its name derives from (&quot;kērós&quot;) meaning &quot;wax&quot;, and was registered as a trademark by Nova Scotia geologist and inventor Abraham Gesner in 1854 before evolving into a generic trademark. It is sometimes spelled kerosine in scientific and industrial usage.

Kerosene is widely used to power jet engines of aircraft (jet fuel), as well as some rocket engines in a highly refined form called RP-1. It is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel, and for fire toys such as poi. In parts of Asia, kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small outboard motors or even motorcycles. World total kerosene consumption for all purposes is equivalent to about 5,500,000 barrels per day as of July 2023.

The term &quot;kerosene&quot; is common in much of Argentina, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Nigeria, and the United States, while the term paraffin (or a closely related variant) is used in Chile, East Africa, South Africa, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The term &quot;lamp oil&quot;, or the equivalent in the local languages, is common in the majority of Asia and the Southeastern United States, although in Appalachia, it is also commonly referred to as &quot;coal oil&quot;.

Confusingly, the name &quot;paraffin&quot; is also used to refer to a number of distinct petroleum byproducts other than kerosene. For instance, liquid paraffin (called mineral oil in the US) is a more viscous and highly refined product which is used as a laxative. Paraffin wax is a waxy solid extracted from petroleum.

To prevent confusion between kerosene and the much more flammable and volatile gasoline (petrol), some jurisdictions regulate markings or colourings for containers used to store or dispense kerosene. For example, in the United States, Pennsylvania requires that portable containers used at retail service stations for kerosene be colored blue, as opposed to red (for gasoline) or yellow (for diesel).

The World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that &quot;governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use&quot;. Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter, and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer, respiratory infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataracts, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

== Properties and grades ==
Kerosene is a low-viscosity, clear liquid formed from hydrocarbons obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between , resulting in a mixture with a density of 0.78–0.81 g/cm3. It is miscible with petroleum solvents but immiscible with water. It is composed of hydrocarbon molecules that typically contain between 6-20 carbon atoms per molecule, predominantly containing 9 to 16 carbon atoms.

Regardless of crude oil source or processing history, kerosene&#x27;s major components are branched- and straight-chain alkanes (hydrocarbon chains) and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% of volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.

The heat of combustion of kerosene is similar to that of diesel fuel; its lower heating value is 43.1 MJ/kg (around 18,500 Btu/lb), and its higher heating value is .

The ASTM recognizes two grades of kerosene: 1-K (less than 0.04% sulfur by weight) and 2-K (0.3% sulfur by weight). Grade 1-K kerosene burns cleaner with fewer deposits, fewer toxins, and less frequent maintenance than 2-K, and is the preferred grade for indoor heaters and stoves.

In the United Kingdom, two grades of heating oil are defined. BS 2869 Class C1 is the lightest grade used for lanterns, camping stoves, and wick heaters, and mixed with petrol in some vintage combustion engines as a substitute for tractor vaporizing oil. BS 2869 Class C2 is a heavier distillate, which is used as domestic heating oil. Premium kerosene is usually sold in 5- or 20-litre containers from hardware, camping and garden stores, and is often dyed purple. Standard kerosene is usually dispensed in bulk by a tanker and is undyed.

National and international standards define the properties of several grades of kerosene used for jet fuel. Flash point and freezing point properties are particularly interesting for operation and safety; the standards also define additives for control of static electricity and other purposes.

=== Melting, freeze and flash points ===
Kerosene is liquid around room temperature: . The flash point of kerosene is between and , and its autoignition temperature is . The freezing point of kerosene depends on grade, with commercial aviation fuel standardized at .

Grade 1-K kerosene freezes around −40 °C (−40 °F, 233 K).

== History ==

The process of distilling crude oil/petroleum into kerosene, as well as other hydrocarbon compounds, was first written about in the ninth century by the Persian scholar Rāzi (or Rhazes). In his &quot;Kitab al-Asrar&quot; (&quot;Book of Secrets&quot;), the physician and chemist Razi described two methods for the production of kerosene, termed &quot;naft abyad&quot; (نفط ابيض&quot;white naphtha&quot;), using an apparatus called an alembic. One method used clay as an absorbent, and later the other method using chemicals like ammonium chloride (&quot;sal ammoniac&quot;). The distillation process was repeated until most of the volatile hydrocarbon fractions had been removed and the final product was perfectly clear and safe to burn. Kerosene was also produced during the same period from oil shale and bitumen by heating the rock to extract the oil, which was then distilled. During the Chinese Ming Dynasty, the Chinese made use of kerosene through extracting and purifying petroleum and then converted it into lamp fuel. The Chinese made use of petroleum for lighting lamps and heating homes as early as 1500 BC.

===Illuminating oil from coal and oil shale===

Although &quot;coal oil&quot; was well known by industrial chemists at least as early as the 1700s as a byproduct of making coal gas and coal tar, it burned with a smoky flame that prevented its use for indoor illumination. In cities, much indoor illumination was provided by piped-in coal gas, but outside the cities, and for spot lighting within the cities, the lucrative market for fueling indoor lamps was supplied by whale oil, specifically that from sperm whales, which burned brighter and cleaner.

Canadian geologist Abraham Pineo Gesner claimed that in 1846, he had given a public demonstration in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island of a new process he had discovered. He heated coal in a retort, and distilled from it a clear, thin fluid that he showed made an excellent lamp fuel. He coined the name &quot;kerosene&quot; for his fuel, a contraction of &quot;keroselaion&quot;, meaning &quot;wax-oil&quot;. The cost of extracting kerosene from coal was high.

Gesner recalled from his extensive knowledge of New Brunswick&#x27;s geology a naturally occurring asphaltum called albertite. He was blocked from using it by the New Brunswick coal conglomerate because they had coal extraction rights for the province, and he lost a court case when their experts claimed albertite was a form of coal. In 1854, Gesner moved to Newtown Creek, Long Island, New York. There, he secured backing from a group of businessmen. They formed the North American Gas Light Company, to which he assigned his patents.

Despite clear priority of discovery, Gesner did not obtain his first kerosene patent until 1854, two years after James Young&#x27;s United States patent. Gesner&#x27;s method of purifying the distillation products appears to have been superior to Young&#x27;s, resulting in a cleaner and better-smelling fuel. Manufacture of kerosene under the Gesner patents began in New York in 1854 and later in Boston—being distilled from bituminous coal and oil shale. Gesner registered the word &quot;Kerosene&quot; as a trademark in 1854, and for several years, only the North American Gas Light Company and the Downer Company (to which Gesner had granted the right) were allowed to call their lamp oil &quot;Kerosene&quot; in the United States.

In 1848, Scottish chemist James Young experimented with oil discovered seeping in a coal mine as a source of lubricating oil and illuminating fuel. When the seep became exhausted, he experimented with the dry distillation of coal, especially the resinous &quot;boghead coal&quot; (torbanite). He extracted a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named &quot;paraffine oil&quot; because at low temperatures, it congealed into a substance that resembled paraffin wax. Young took out a patent on his process and the resulting products in 1850, and built the first truly commercial oil-works in the world at Bathgate in 1851, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal. In 1852, he took out a United States patent for the same invention. These patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits, and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties.

===Kerosene from petroleum===
In 1851, Samuel Martin Kier began selling lamp oil to local miners, under the name &quot;Carbon Oil&quot;. He distilled this from crude oil by a process of his own invention. He also invented a new lamp to burn his product. He has been dubbed the &quot;Grandfather of the American Oil Industry&quot; by historians. Kier&#x27;s salt wells began to be fouled with petroleum in the 1840s. At first, Kier simply dumped the oil into the nearby Pennsylvania Main Line Canal as useless waste, but later he began experimenting with several distillates of the crude oil, along with a chemist from eastern Pennsylvania.

Ignacy Łukasiewicz, a Polish pharmacist residing in Lviv, and his partner had been experimenting with different distillation techniques, trying to improve on Gesner&#x27;s kerosene process, but using oil from a local petroleum seep. Many people knew of his work, but paid little attention to it. On the night of 31 July 1853, doctors at the local hospital needed to perform an emergency operation, virtually impossible by candlelight. They therefore sent a messenger for Łukasiewicz and his new lamps. The lamp burned so brightly and cleanly that the hospital officials ordered several lamps plus a large supply of fuel. Łukasiewicz realized the potential of his work and quit the pharmacy to find a business partner, and then traveled to Vienna to register his technique with the government. Łukasiewicz moved to the Gorlice region of Poland in 1854, and sank several wells across southern Poland over the following decade, setting up a refinery near Jasło in 1859.

The petroleum discovery by Edwin Drake - Drake Well in western Pennsylvania in 1859 caused a great deal of public excitement and investment drilling in new wells, not only in Pennsylvania, but also in Canada, where petroleum had been discovered at Oil Springs, Ontario in 1858, and southern Poland, where Ignacy Łukasiewicz had been distilling lamp oil from petroleum seeps since 1852. The increased supply of petroleum allowed oil refiners to entirely side-step the oil-from-coal patents of both Young and Gesner, and produce illuminating oil from petroleum without paying royalties to anyone. As a result, the illuminating oil industry in the United States completely switched over to petroleum in the 1860s. The petroleum-based illuminating oil was widely sold as Kerosene, and the trade name soon lost its proprietary status, and became the lower-case generic product &quot;kerosene&quot;. Because Gesner&#x27;s original Kerosene had been also known as &quot;coal oil&quot;, generic kerosene from petroleum was commonly called &quot;coal oil&quot; in some parts of the United States well into the 20th century.

In the United Kingdom, manufacturing oil from coal (or oil shale) continued into the early 20th century, although increasingly overshadowed by petroleum oils.

As kerosene production increased, whaling declined. The American whaling fleet, which had been steadily growing for 50 years, reached its all-time peak of 199 ships in 1858. By 1860, just two years later, the fleet had dropped to 167 ships. The Civil War cut into American whaling temporarily, but only 105 whaling ships returned to sea in 1866, the first full year of peace, and that number dwindled until only 39 American ships set out to hunt whales in 1876. Kerosene, made first from coal and oil shale, then from petroleum, had largely taken over whaling&#x27;s lucrative market in lamp oil.

Electric lighting started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in the late 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial end-use for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by motor fuels. The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and refiners invented methods to increase their output of gasoline, while decreasing their output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.

=== Kerosene from carbon dioxide and water ===
A pilot project by ETH Zurich used solar power to produce kerosene from carbon dioxide and water in July 2022. The product can be used in existing aviation applications, and &quot;can also be blended with fossil-derived kerosene.&quot;

==Production== 
Kerosene is produced by fractional distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery. It condenses at a temperature intermediate between diesel fuel, which is less volatile, and naphtha and gasoline, which are more volatile.

Kerosene made up 8.5 percent by volume of petroleum refinery output in 2021 in the United States, of which nearly all was kerosene-type jet fuel (8.4 percent).

==Applications==
===As fuel===
====Heating and lighting====
The fuel, also known as heating oil in the UK and Ireland, remains widely used in kerosene lamps and lanterns in the developing world. Although it replaced whale oil, the 1873 edition of &quot;Elements of Chemistry&quot; said, &quot;The vapor of this substance [kerosene] mixed with air is as explosive as gunpowder.&quot; This statement may have been due to the common practice of adulterating kerosene with cheaper but more volatile hydrocarbon mixtures, such as naphtha.
Kerosene was a significant fire risk; in 1880, nearly two of every five New York City fires were caused by defective kerosene lamps.

In less-developed countries kerosene is an important source of energy for cooking and lighting. It is used as a cooking fuel in portable stoves for backpackers. As a heating fuel, it is often used in portable stoves, and is sold in some filling stations. It is sometimes used as a heat source during power failures.

Kerosene is widely used in Japan and Chile as a home heating fuel for portable and installed kerosene heaters. In Chile and Japan, kerosene can be readily bought at any filling station or be delivered to homes in some cases.
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, kerosene is often used as a heating fuel in areas not connected to a gas pipeline network. It is used less for cooking, with LPG being preferred because it is easier to light. Kerosene is often the fuel of choice for range cookers such as Rayburn. Additives such as RangeKlene can be put into kerosene to ensure that it burns cleaner and produces less soot when used in range cookers.

The Amish, who generally abstain from the use of electricity, rely on kerosene for lighting at night.
More ubiquitous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, kerosene space heaters were often built into kitchen ranges, and kept many farm and fishing families warm and dry through the winter. At one time, citrus growers used a smudge pot fueled by kerosene to create a pall of thick smoke over a grove in an effort to prevent freezing temperatures from damaging crops. &quot;Salamanders&quot; are kerosene space heaters used on construction sites to dry out building materials and to warm workers. Before the days of electrically lighted road barriers, highway construction zones were marked at night by kerosene fired, pot-bellied torches. Most of these uses of kerosene created thick black smoke because of the low temperature of combustion.

A notable exception, discovered in the early 19th century, is the use of a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp. Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick, the mantle is a residue of mineral materials (mostly thorium dioxide), heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick. The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would. These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity, because they give a much better light than a simple wick-type lamp does. Recently, a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity.

====Cooking====

In countries such as Nigeria, kerosene is the main fuel used for cooking, especially by the poor, and kerosene stoves have replaced traditional wood-based cooking appliances. As such, increase in the price of kerosene can have a major political and environmental consequence. The Indian government subsidizes the fuel to keep the price very low, to around 15 U.S. cents per liter as of February 2007, as keeping the price low discourages dismantling of forests for cooking fuel. In Nigeria an attempt by the government to remove a fuel subsidy that includes kerosene met with strong opposition.

Kerosene is used as a fuel in portable stoves, especially in Primus stoves invented in 1892. Portable kerosene stoves are reliable and durable in everyday use, and perform especially well under adverse conditions. In outdoor activities and mountaineering, a decisive advantage of pressurized kerosene stoves over gas cartridge stoves is their particularly high thermal output and their ability to operate at very low ambient temperatures in winter or at high altitude. Wick stoves like Perfection&#x27;s or wickless like Boss continue to be used by the Amish and off grid living and in natural disasters where there is no power available.

==== Engines ====
In the early to mid-20th century, kerosene or tractor vaporizing oil was used as a cheap fuel for tractors and hit &#x27;n miss engines. A petrol-paraffin engine would start on gasoline, then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up. On some engines a heat valve on the manifold would route the exhaust gasses around the intake pipe, heating the kerosene to the point where it was vaporized and could be ignited by an electric spark.

In Europe following the Second World War, automobiles were similarly modified to run on kerosene rather than gasoline, which they would have to import and pay heavy taxes on. Besides additional piping and the switch between fuels, the head gasket was replaced by a much thicker one to diminish the compression ratio (making the engine less powerful and less efficient, but able to run on kerosene). The necessary equipment was sold under the trademark &quot;Econom&quot;.

During the fuel crisis of the 1970s, Saab-Valmet developed and series-produced the Saab 99 Petro that ran on kerosene, turpentine or gasoline. The project, codenamed &quot;Project Lapponia&quot;, was headed by Simo Vuorio, and towards the end of the 1970s, a working prototype was produced based on the Saab 99 GL. The car was designed to run on two fuels. Gasoline was used for cold starts and when extra power was needed, but normally it ran on kerosene or turpentine. The idea was that the gasoline could be made from peat using the Fischer–Tropsch process. Between 1980 and 1984, 3,756 Saab 99 Petros and 2,385 Talbot Horizons (a version of the Chrysler Horizon that integrated many Saab components) were made. One reason to manufacture kerosene-fueled cars was that in Finland kerosene was less heavily taxed than gasoline.

Kerosene is used to fuel smaller-horsepower outboard motors built by Yamaha, Suzuki, and Tohatsu. Primarily used on small fishing craft, these are dual-fuel engines that start on gasoline and then transition to kerosene once the engine reaches optimum operating temperature. Multiple fuel Evinrude and Mercury Racing engines also burn kerosene, as well as jet fuel.

Today, kerosene is mainly used in fuel for jet engines in several grades. One highly refined form of the fuel is known as RP-1, and is often burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel. These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications for smoke points and freeze points. The combustion reaction can be approximated as follows, with the molecular formula C12H26 (dodecane):

: 2 C12H26(&quot;l&quot;) + 37 O2(&quot;g&quot;) → 24 CO2(&quot;g&quot;) + 26 H2O(&quot;g&quot;); ∆&quot;H&quot;˚ = -7513 kJ

In the initial phase of liftoff, the Saturn V launch vehicle was powered by the reaction of liquid oxygen with RP-1. For the five 6.4 meganewton sea-level thrust F-1 rocket engines of the Saturn V, burning together, the reaction generated roughly 1.62 × 1011 watts (J/s) (162 gigawatt) or 217 million horsepower.

Kerosene is sometimes used as an additive in diesel fuel to prevent gelling or waxing in cold temperatures.

&quot;Ultra-low sulfur kerosene&quot; is a custom-blended fuel used by the New York City Transit Authority to power its bus fleet. The transit agency started using this fuel in 2004, prior to the widespread adoption of ultra-low-sulfur diesel, which has since become the standard. In 2008, the suppliers of the custom fuel failed to tender for a renewal of the transit agency&#x27;s contract, leading to a negotiated contract at a significantly increased cost.

JP-8 (for &quot;Jet Propellant 8&quot;), a kerosene-based fuel, is used by the United States military as a replacement in diesel fueled vehicles and for powering aircraft. JP-8 is also used by the U.S. military and its NATO allies as a fuel for heaters, stoves, tanks, and as a replacement for diesel fuel in the engines of nearly all tactical ground vehicles and electrical generators.

=== Chemical processes ===
Aliphatic kerosene is a type of kerosene which has a low aromatic hydrocarbon content, the aromatic content of crude oil varies greatly from oil field to oil field. However by solvent extraction it is possible to separate aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic (alkane) hydrocarbons. A common method is solvent extraction with methanol, DMSO or sulfolane. Aromatic kerosene is a grade of kerosene with a large concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons, an example of this would be Exon&#x27;s Solvesso 150.

Kerosene is commonly used in metal extraction as the diluent, for example in copper extraction by LIX-84 it can be used in mixer settlers.

Kerosene is used as a diluent in the PUREX extraction process, but it is increasingly being supplanted by dodecane and other artificial hydrocarbons such as TPH (Hydrogenated Propylene Trimer). Traditionally the UK plants at Sellafield used aromatic kerosene to reduce the radiolysis of TBP while the French nuclear industry tended to use diluents with very little aromatic content. The French nuclear reprocessing plants typically use TPH as their diluent. In recent times it has been shown by Mark Foreman at Chalmers that aliphatic kerosene can be replaced in solvent extraction with HVO100 which is a second generation biodiesel made by Neste.

In X-ray crystallography, kerosene can be used to store crystals. When a hydrated crystal is left in air, dehydration may occur slowly. This makes the color of the crystal become dull. Kerosene can keep air away from the crystal.

It can be also used to prevent air from re-dissolving in a boiled liquid, and to store alkali metals such as potassium, sodium, and rubidium (with the exception of lithium, which is less dense than kerosene, causing it to float).

=== In entertainment ===
Kerosene is often used in the entertainment industry for fire performances, such as fire breathing, fire juggling or poi, and fire dancing. Because of its low flame temperature when burnt in free air, the risk is lower should the performer come in contact with the flame. Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing, as it produces an unpleasant (to some) odor, which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration. Ethanol was sometimes used instead, but the flames it produces look less impressive, and its lower flash point poses a high risk.

=== In industry ===
As a petroleum product miscible with many industrial liquids, kerosene can be used as both a solvent, able to remove other petroleum products, such as chain grease, and as a lubricant, with less risk of combustion when compared to using gasoline. It can also be used as a cooling agent in metal production and treatment (oxygen-free conditions).

In the petroleum industry, kerosene is often used as a synthetic hydrocarbon for corrosion experiments to simulate crude oil in field conditions.

=== Solvent ===
Kerosene can be used as an adhesive remover on hard-to-remove mucilage or adhesive left by stickers on a glass surface (such as in show windows of stores).

It can be used to remove candle wax that has dripped onto a glass surface; it is recommended that the excess wax be scraped off prior to applying kerosene via a soaked cloth or tissue paper.

It can be used to clean bicycle and motorcycle chains of old lubricant before relubrication.

It can also be used to thin oil-based paint used in fine art. Some artists even use it to clean their brushes; however, it leaves the bristles greasy to the touch.

=== Others ===
It has seen use for water tank mosquito control in Australia, where a temporary thin floating layer above the water protects it until the defective tank is repaired.

== Toxicity ==
The World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that &quot;governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use&quot;. Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter, and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer, respiratory infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataract, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Ingestion of kerosene is harmful. Kerosene is sometimes recommended as a folk remedy for killing head lice, but health agencies warn against this as it can cause burns and serious illness. A kerosene shampoo can even be fatal if fumes are inhaled.

People can be exposed to kerosene in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit of 100 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.

<text>Kwashiorkor ( , is also ) is a form of severe protein malnutrition characterized by edema and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates. It is thought to be caused by sufficient calorie intake, but with insufficient protein consumption (or lack of good quality protein), which distinguishes it from marasmus. Recent studies have found that a lack of antioxidant micronutrients such as β-carotene, lycopene, other carotenoids, and vitamin C as well as the presence of aflatoxins may play a role in the development of the disease. However, the exact cause of kwashiorkor is still unknown. Inadequate food supply is correlated with kwashiorkor; occurrences in high-income countries are rare. It occurs amongst weaning children to ages of about five years old.

Conditions analogous to kwashiorkor were well documented around the world throughout history. However, Jamaican pediatrician Cicely Williams introduced the term in 1935, two years after she published the disease&#x27;s first formal description. Williams was the first to research kwashiorkor and differentiate it from other dietary deficiencies. She was the first to suggest that this might be a protein deficiency. The name is derived from the Ga language of coastal Ghana, translated as &quot;the sickness the baby gets when the new baby comes&quot; or &quot;the disease of the deposed child&quot;, and reflecting the development of the condition in an older child who has been weaned from the breast when a younger sibling comes. Breast milk contains amino acids vital to a child&#x27;s growth. In at-risk populations, kwashiorkor may develop after children are weaned from breast milk and begin consuming a diet high in carbohydrates, including maize, cassava, or rice.

== Classification ==

Kwashiorkor is a type of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). SAM is a category, composed of two conditions: marasmus and kwashiorkor. Both kwashiorkor and marasmus fall under the umbrella of protein–energy malnutrition (PEM). These diseases are oftentimes discussed together, but are distinctly separate conditions of malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is marked by an array of metabolic disturbances of uncertain cause. In contrast, marasmus is more clearly an energy deficiency syndrome, marked by weight loss. On physical exam, kwashiorkor is also distinguished from marasmus by the presence of edema. When children present with both kwashiorkor and marasmus, the condition is referred to as &quot;marasmic-kwashiorkor&quot;. In general, kwashiorkor is marked by more profound serum depletions of antioxidant molecules and minerals, relative to marasmus.

===Wellcome&#x27;s classification===
Wellcome classification is a system for classifying protein-energy malnutrition in children based on weight for their age and based on presence of edema. Other classifications include Gomez classification and Waterlow classification.
== Signs and symptoms ==
The defining sign of kwashiorkor in children is bilateral edema in the feet. Edema may also involve the hands, trunk, and face. Kwashiorkor is characterized by a fatty liver. This fatty liver of the undernutrition phenotype is often accompanied by evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. Whereas a fatty liver of undernutrition is a consistent feature of kwashiorkor, it is only encountered sometimes in children with marasmus. In addition to this characteristic hepatic steatosis, kwashiorkor is marked by a parallel pattern of multi-organ dysfunction. Organs often affected in children with kwashiorkor include the kidneys, pancreas, heart, and nervous system. Other findings that may be encountered on physical exam include a distended abdomen, hair thinning, loss of teeth, skin or hair depigmentation, and dermatitis. Children with kwashiorkor often develop irritability and anorexia. Generally, kwashiorkor is treated by introducing a high-quality source of protein to the diet. Ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) as well as F-100 and F-75 milk powders, which both include skim milk powder, are recommended for the treatment of kwashiorkor. These products are designed for use in low-resource settings. The limited number of kwashiorkor cases that occur in high resource settings, where there is good access to advanced therapeutic tools, are typically treated with partially hydrolyzed or elemental enteral formulas, with parenteral nutrition provided in extreme cases.

== Causes ==
The precise etiology of kwashiorkor remains unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed that are associated with and explain some, but not all aspects of the pathophysiology of kwashiorkor. They include, but are not limited to protein deficiency causing hypoalbuminemia, amino acid deficiency, oxidative stress, and gut microbiome changes.

=== Low protein intake ===

Kwashiorkor is a severe form of malnutrition associated with a low-protein diet. The extreme lack of protein causes an osmotic imbalance in the gastrointestinal system causing swelling of the gut diagnosed as an edema or retention of water.

Extreme fluid retention observed in individuals suffering from kwashiorkor is accompanied by irregularities in the lymphatic system as well as disruptions of capillary exchange. The lymphatic system serves three major purposes: fluid recovery, immunity, and lipid absorption. Victims of kwashiorkor commonly exhibit reduced ability to recover fluids, immune system failure, and low lipid absorption. Fluid recovery by the lymphatic system is accomplished by the re-vascularization of fluid and macromolecules from the interstitial space, allowing these constituents of whole blood to be returned to the venous circulation. Compromised fluid recovery may contribute to the phenomenon of extravascular fluid accumulation in kwashiorkor.

The low protein theory for the pathogenesis of kwashiorkor has been used to teach that capillary exchange between the lymphatic system and circulating blood is impaired by a reduced oncotic (i.e. colloid osmotic pressure, COP) in the blood, as a consequence of inadequate protein intake, so that the hydrostatic pressure gradient, which favors extravasation of fluid from small vessels, is not overcome. Proteins, mainly albumin, are responsible for creating the COP observed in the blood and tissue fluids. The difference in the COP of the blood and tissue tends to favor the reentry of fluid from the extravascular space, into the circulatory system. This tendency is opposed by the venous hydrostatic pressure, which tends to favor the exit of fluid from small vessels, into the interstitial space. The low protein theory for the pathogenesis of kwashiorkor held that a deficiency of serum proteins, caused by inadequate protein intake, disrupted this balance, and thus impaired the return flow of fluid from the interstitium into the capillary and venous structures. It has been taught that this is what accounts for the accumulation of extravascular fluid in kwashiorkor, and the subsequent pedal edema and abdominal distension.

The low protein theory, which relies heavily upon Starling&#x27;s theory for the movement of fluid in biological systems, provided a compelling rationale for the pathogenesis of edema in kwashiorkor. What it does not explain, however, is the entire array of disturbances that define the kwashiorkor syndrome. These include irritability, anorexia, skin desquamation, skin depigmentation, hair discoloration, reduced mitochondrial respiration, impaired lipid export from the liver without an accompanying reduction of lipoprotein synthesis, &#x27;oxidative stress&#x27;, glutathione depletions, transsulfuration disturbances, diffuse DNA hypomethylation, immune dysfunction, decreased transmethylation activity, and sulfated glycosaminoglycan deficiencies. It is now generally acknowledged that by itself, the low protein theory does not adequately account for the pathogenesis of kwashiorkor. More complex deficiencies are at work. These have still not been established. 

Social factors are also relevant. Ignorance of nutrition can be a cause. A case was described where parents who fed their child cassava failed to recognize malnutrition because of the edema caused by the syndrome and believed the child was well-nourished despite the development of kwashiorkor.

=== Aflatoxins ===
Recent studies have attempted to pinpoint a relationship between kwashiorkor and high levels of aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins produced by the mold &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, a fungus found in areas with hot and humid climates. These toxins tend to grow and can be found in agricultural crops such as millet, maize, and rice. An analysis found that the presence of aflatoxins was found more frequently and in higher concentrations in individuals with kwashiorkor when compared to individuals with marasmus (another form of severe acute malnutrition). In particular, biological samples showed greater levels of aflatoxins in the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lungs, serum, stool, and urine. Aflatoxins were not found in liver samples of individuals with marasmus. It has been known that the liver organ is the main target of aflatoxins and chronic toxicity can result in immunosuppressive and carcinogenic effects. However, there is currently conflicting evidence to pinpoint a connection between kwashiorkor and aflatoxins. Studies have shown that not all children with kwashiorkor present with detectable aflatoxin levels. It has also been proposed that damage done by aflatoxins may be due to glutathione depletion (another proposed mechanism of the disease) in children with kwashiorkor.

== Mechanisms ==
=== Peripheral edema and hypoalbuminemia ===
Kwashiorkor is a form of protein deficiency, which can result in both osmotic imbalances and irregularities in the lymphatic system.

Kwashiorkor is most notable for peripheral edema. The presence of edema in kwashiorkor is correlated with very low albumin concentration (hypoalbuminemia). Edema results from a loss of fluid balance between the hydrostatic and oncotic pressures across the capillary blood vessel walls due to the lack of protein which affects the body&#x27;s ability to draw fluid from the tissues into the bloodstream. Low albumin concentration influences negatively the strength of oncotic pressure. Failure leads to fluid buildup in the abdomen, resulting in edema and belly distension.

Furthermore, the release of antidiuretic hormone is stimulated by hypovolemia, also leading to the development of peripheral edema. Plasma renin is also stimulated, promoting sodium retention.

It is important to distinguish the pathophysiology of marasmus and kwashiorkor when it comes to treating malnourished children who may have hypovolemic shock that is caused by an acute loss of salt and water. Children with severe albumin deficiency struggle physiologically to maintain their blood volume.

=== Low glutathione levels ===
Kwashiorkor is also marked by low glutathione levels. Glutathione is used in many of the body processes on a molecule level.

It is believed to be related to high oxidant levels commonly seen in people who suffer from starvation and rarely in chronic inflammation. Glutathione serves vital functions including management of oxidative stress which is an imbalance that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of many diseases.

Evidence indicates that amino acid balance has an important effect on protein nutrition and therefore on glutathione homeostasis.

Cysteine is an essential amino acid that acts as the limiting amino acid for glutathione synthesis in humans. Factors that increase demand for glutathione may increase demand for cysteine, and hence methionine. Such demands have been hypothesized to increase the risk for kwashiorkor.

=== Others ===
A proposed experimental theory suggests that alterations in the microbiome/virome contribute to edematous malnutrition, but further studies are required to understand the mechanism.

== Diagnosis ==
Kwashiorkor, or edematous malnutrition, like many other malnutrition diseases, is indirectly assessed using anthropometry. Kwashiorkor is a subtype of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) characterized by bilateral peripheral pitting edema. According to the World Health Organization, the SAM diagnosis parameters are a &quot;mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of &lt; 115 mm, weight-for-height/length Z-score (WHZ) of &lt; -3Z and nutritional edema or any combination of these parameters.&quot; Additional clinical findings on physical exam include marked muscle atrophy, abdominal distension, dermatitis, and hepatomegaly.

WHO criteria for clinical assessment of malnutrition are based on the degree of wasting (MUAC), stunting (weight-for-height Z-score), and the presence of edema (mild to severe).&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO 10665/95584&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screening ==
Because it can be difficult to measure weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) frequently, screening is performed by physical exam, with careful examination of the child&#x27;s feet to detect the presence of bilateral pitting edema. Screening for edema is essential for the diagnosis of kwashiorkor, since nearly two-thirds of kwashiorkor cases do not have evidence of acute wasting (i.e. mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) &lt; 125 mm, or WHZ &lt; -2) when diagnosed with kwashiorkor.

==Prevention==
As for the prevention of childhood malnutrition, there needs to be public health changes such as improving agriculture and improving access to healthcare to effectively reduce the rates of malnutrition in children. By educating individuals of childbearing age on proper nutrition and health during and after pregnancy, they can provide their children with the appropriate nutrients from a young age. By ensuring they are equipped with the proper education and resources, caretakers and infants are in better health, ultimately preventing childhood malnutrition.

Because edema can hide decreased muscle mass, it can be hard to diagnose kwashiorkor in young children; however, if cases are overlooked, children become more susceptible to infections and can ultimately lead to morbidity and mortality. To prevent this from happening, parents can be educated on proper nutrition and the importance of breastfeeding infants to ensure they receive all the nutrients they need.

A diet rich in carbohydrates, fats that provide 10% of the total caloric needs, and proteins that provide 15% of the caloric needs can prevent kwashiorkor.

Proteins can be found in the following foods
* Seafood
* Peas
* Nuts
* Seeds
* Eggs
* Lean meat or fish
* Beans

== Treatment ==
WHO guidelines outline 10 general principles for the inpatient management of severely malnourished children.

# Treat/prevent hypoglycemia
# Treat/prevent hypothermia
# Treat/prevent dehydration
# Correct electrolyte imbalance
# Treat/prevent infection
# Correct micronutrient deficiencies
# Start cautious feeding
# Achieve catch-up growth
# Provide sensory stimulation and emotional support
# Prepare for follow-up after recovery

Both clinical subtypes of severe acute malnutrition (kwashiorkor and marasmus) are treated similarly. Upon initial treatment, children with kwashiorkor may experience weight loss as their edema resolves. Therefore, after concerns of refeeding syndrome have passed, children may require 120-140% of their estimated caloric needs to achieve catch-up growth.

The cause, type, and severity of malnutrition determine what type of treatment would be most appropriate. For primary acute malnutrition, children with no complications are treated at home and are encouraged to either continue breastfeeding (for infants) or start using ready-to-use therapeutic foods (for children). For secondary acute malnutrition, the underlying cause needs to be identified to appropriately treat children. Only after the primary disease is determined can an appropriate dietary plan be made, as fluid, vitamins, and macronutrients may need to be considered to not exacerbate the cause of malnutrition.

Ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) and F-75 and F-100 milks were created to provide appropriate nutrition and caloric intake to those experiencing malnutrition. F-75 milk would be ideal when trying to reintroduce food into a malnourished person, and F-100 milk would be used to aid in weight gain. While RUTFs and F-100 milk were made to have the same nutritional value, RUTFs are beneficial as they are dehydrated and do not require much preparation.

== Prognosis ==

Kwashiorkor is associated with a high risk of mortality and long-term complications. Treatment under the guidelines of the World Health Organization has proven to reduce this mortality risk and affected children tend to recover faster than children with other severe malnutrition diseases. However, physical and intellectual capabilities are not fully restored. Growth stunting and chronic disruption of microbiota are commonly observed after recovery.

A high risk of death is identified by a brachial perimeter &lt; 11 cm or by a weight-for-age threshold &lt; −3 z-scores below the median of the WHO child growth standards. In practice, malnourished children with edema are suffering from potentially life-threatening severe malnutrition.

== Epidemiology ==
Kwashiorkor is rare in high-income countries. It is mostly observed in low-income and middle-income nations and regions such as Southeast Asia, Central America, Congo, Ethiopia, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, South Africa, and Uganda, where poverty is prominent. Occurrences of severe malnutrition also tend to trend higher under conditions of food insecurity, higher prevalence of infectious diseases, lack of access to appropriate care, and poor living situations with inadequate sanitation. Communities experiencing famine are affected the most, especially during the rainy season. Prevalence varies, but it affects children of either sex commonly under five years old. &quot;Globally, kwashiorkor indirected accounted for 53% of deaths among children under five between 2000 and 2003 when associated with other common childhood diseases like acute respiratory infections, malaria, measles, HIV/AIDS and other causes of perinatal deaths.&quot;

When compared to marasmus in developing countries, kwashiorkor typically has a lower prevalence, &quot;0.2%-1.6% for kwashiorkor and 1.2%-6.8% for marasmus.&quot; Factors such as &quot;diet, geographical locations, climate, and aflatoxin exposure&quot; have been invoked as potential causes for observed differences in the prevalence of kwashiorkor and marasmus.

In general, in areas where Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) is prevalent, marasmus is more often the dominant SAM condition. However, in certain areas, kwashiorkor may be more common than marasmus.

== History ==
Kwashiorkor was present in the world long before 1933 when Cicely Williams published research that took the Ga name for the disease. There were already many names for the illness which referenced the cessation of breastfeeding, or the consumption of monotonous diets high in starch. However, Williams was the first to suggest that this might be a deficiency of protein or an amino acid. Despite publishing in 1933, it was only in 1949 that the World Health Organization officially recognized kwashiorkor as a public health concern. This period also correlated with the promotion of infant formula, often by European colonial powers. The substitution of formula for breastmilk contributed significantly to the increasing visibility of kwashiorkor throughout the twentieth century. Cicely Williams later described the promotion of formula as &quot;the most criminal form of sedition, and that those deaths should be regarded as murder.&quot; These arguments underpinned the 1970s Nestlé boycott.

== Effects on pharmacokinetics ==
Those experiencing poverty-related infectious diseases (PRDs) such as malaria and tuberculosis are also likely to be malnourished. Malnutrition can affect the pharmacokinetics of various drugs used to treat PRDs by changing a drug&#x27;s bioavailability, distribution, and elimination. To optimize the treatment of those diseases, there needs to be more research into how severe malnutrition, specifically kwashiorkor, can affect treatment response.

== Research directions ==
Current research and recommendations to manage severe acute malnutrition (SAM), such as kwashiorkor, in children, are largely based on expert opinions. Only one-third of the WHO guidelines for the management of SAM are based on epidemiological and clinical research. Further studies are needed to &quot;improve treatment outcomes in the large number of children with SAM.&quot;

<text>In Hinduism, kundalini (, ) is a form of divine feminine energy (or &quot;Shakti&quot;) believed to be located at the base of the spine, in the &quot;muladhara&quot;. It is an important concept in Śhaiva Tantra, where it is believed to be a force or power associated with the divine feminine or the formless aspect of the Goddess. This energy in the body, when cultivated and awakened through tantric practice, is believed to lead to spiritual liberation. Kuṇḍalinī is associated with the goddess Parvati or Adi Parashakti, the supreme being in Shaktism, and with the goddesses Bhairavi and Kubjika. The term, along with practices associated with it, was adopted into Hatha Yoga in the 9th century. It has since then been adopted into other forms of Hinduism as well as modern spirituality and New Age thought.

Kuṇḍalinī awakenings are said to occur by a variety of methods. Many systems of yoga focus on awakening kuṇḍalinī through: meditation, pranayama, the practice of asana, and chanting of mantras. Kundalini yoga is influenced by Shaktism and Tantra schools of Hinduism. It derives its name from its focus upon the awakening of kundalini energy through regular practice of mantra, Tantra, yantra, asanas or meditation. When kundalini is awakened spontaneously or without guidance it can lead to kundalini syndrome which sometimes presents as psychosis.

== Etymology ==

The concept of Kuṇḍalinī is mentioned in the Upanishads (9th – 7th centuries BCE). The Sanskrit adjective &#x27; means &quot;circular, annular&quot;. It is mentioned as a noun for &quot;snake&quot; (in the sense of &quot;coiled&quot;) in the 12th-century &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; chronicle (I.2). &#x27; (a noun meaning &quot;bowl, water-pot&quot; is found as the name of a Nāga (serpent deity) in Mahabharata 1.4828). The 8th-century &quot;Tantrasadbhava Tantra&quot; uses the term &quot;kundalī&quot;, glossed by David Gordon White as &quot;she who is ring-shaped&quot;.

The use of &quot;kuṇḍalī&quot; as a name for Goddess Durga (a form of Shakti) appears often in Tantrism and Shaktism from as early as the 11th century in the &quot;Śaradatilaka&quot;. It was adopted as a technical term in Hatha yoga during the 15th century, and became widely used in the Yoga Upanishads by the 16th century. Eknath Easwaran has paraphrased the term as &quot;the coiled power&quot;, a force which ordinarily rests at the base of the spine, described as being &quot;coiled there like a serpent&quot;.

== In Shaivism ==

Kuṇḍalinī arose as a central concept in Shaiva Tantra, especially among the Śākta sects like the Kaula. In these Tantric traditions, Kuṇḍalinī is &quot;the innate intelligence of embodied Consciousness&quot;. The first possible mention of the term is in the &quot;Tantrasadbhāva-tantra&quot; (eighth century), but other earlier tantras mention the visualization of Shakti in the central channel and the upward movement of prana or vital force (which is often associated with Kuṇḍalinī in later works). According to David Gordon White, this feminine spiritual force is also termed &quot;bhogavati,&quot; which has a double meaning of &quot;enjoyment&quot; and &quot;coiled&quot; and signifies her strong connection to bliss and pleasure, both mundane physical pleasure and the bliss of spiritual liberation (moksha), which is the enjoyment of Shiva&#x27;s creative activity and ultimate union with the Goddess.

In the influential Shakta tradition called Kaula, Kuṇḍalinī is seen as a &quot;latent innate spiritual power&quot; associated with the Goddess Kubjika (lit. &quot;the crooked one&quot;), who is the supreme Goddess (Paradevi). She is also pure bliss and power (Shakti), the source of all mantras, and resides in the six chakras along the central channel. In Shaiva Tantra, various practices like pranayama, bandhas, mantra recitation, and tantric ritual were used to awaken this spiritual power and create a state of bliss and spiritual liberation.

According to Abhinavagupta, the great tantric scholar and master of the Kaula and Trika lineages, there are two main forms of Kuṇḍalinī, an upward moving Kuṇḍalinī (&quot;urdhva&quot;) associated with expansion, and a downward moving Kuṇḍalinī (&quot;adha&quot;) associated with contraction. According to the scholar of comparative religion Gavin Flood, Abhinavagupta links Kuṇḍalinī with &quot;the power that brings into manifestation the body, breath, and experiences of pleasure and pain&quot;, with &quot;the power of sexuality as the source of reproduction&quot; and with:

== In Vaishnavism ==

Despite mostly being associated with Shaiva and Shakta traditions, the concept of Kundalini Shakti is not at all alien to Vaishnavism. A popular Vaishnava text called &quot;Narada Pancharatra&quot; gives a detailed, although somewhat different description of Chakras and Kundalini Shakti compared to Shaivism and Shaktism. 
== Description ==

According to William F. Williams, kuṇḍalinī is a type of religious experience within the Hindu tradition, within which it is held to be a kind of &quot;cosmic energy&quot; that accumulates at the base of the spine.

When awakened, kuṇḍalinī is described as rising up from the muladhara chakra, through the central nadi (called &quot;sushumna&quot;) inside or alongside the spine reaching the top of the head. The progress of kuṇḍalinī through the different chakras is believed to achieve different levels of awakening and a mystical experience, until Kundalini finally reaches the top of the head, Sahasrara or crown chakra, producing a profound transformation of consciousness.

Swami Sivananda Saraswati of the Divine Life Society stated in his book &quot;Kundalini Yoga&quot; that &quot;Supersensual visions appear before the mental eye of the aspirant, new worlds with indescribable wonders and charms unfold themselves before the Yogi, planes after planes reveal their existence and grandeur to the practitioner and the Yogi gets divine knowledge, power and bliss, in increasing degrees, when Kuṇḍalinī passes through Chakra after Chakra, making them to bloom in all their glory...&quot;

== Kundalini experiences ==

=== Invoking Kundalini experiences ===

Yoga gurus consider that Kuṇḍalinī can be awakened by &quot;shaktipat&quot; (spiritual transmission by a Guru or teacher), or by spiritual practices such as yoga or meditation.

There are two broad approaches to Kuṇḍalinī awakening: active and passive. The &quot;active approach&quot; involves systematic physical exercises and techniques of concentration, visualization, pranayama (breath practice) and meditation under the guidance of a competent teacher. These techniques come from any of the main branches of yoga, and some forms of yoga, such as Kriya yoga and Kundalini yoga, which emphasize Kuṇḍalinī techniques.

The &quot;passive approach&quot; is instead a path of surrender where one lets go of all the impediments to the awakening rather than trying to actively awaken Kuṇḍalinī. A chief part of the passive approach is shaktipat where one individual&#x27;s Kuṇḍalinī is awakened by another who already has the experience. Shaktipat only raises Kuṇḍalinī temporarily but gives the student an experience to use as a basis.

The twentieth century yogi and mystic Gopi Krishna, who helped to bring the concept of Kuṇḍalinī to the Western world, stated that

The American comparative religions scholar Joseph Campbell describes the concept of Kuṇḍalinī as &quot;the figure of a coiled female serpent—a serpent goddess not of &quot;gross&quot; but &quot;subtle&quot; substance—which is to be thought of as residing in a torpid, slumbering state in a subtle center, the first of the seven, near the base of the spine: the aim of the yoga then being to rouse this serpent, lift her head, and bring her up a subtle nerve or channel of the spine to the so-called &quot;thousand-petaled lotus&quot; (Sahasrara) at the crown of the head...She, rising from the lowest to the highest lotus center will pass through and wake the five between, and with each waking, the psychology and personality of the practitioner will be altogether and fundamentally transformed.&quot;

==== Hatha yoga ====

According to the &quot;Gorakṣaśataka&quot;, or &quot;Hundred Verses of Goraksa&quot;, hatha yoga practices such as the mudras mula bandha, uddiyana bandha, and jalandhara bandha, and the pranayama practice of kumbhaka can awaken Kundalini. Another hatha yoga text, the &quot;Khecarīvidyā&quot;, states that khechari mudra enables one to raise Kundalini and access the stores of amrita in the head, which subsequently flood the body.

==== Shaktipat ====

The spiritual teacher Meher Baba emphasized the need for a master when actively trying to awaken Kuṇḍalinī:

In his book, &quot;Building a Noble World&quot;, Shiv R. Jhawar describes his Shaktipat experience at Muktananda&#x27;s public program at Lake Point Tower in Chicago on 16 September 1974 as follows:

=== Kundalini awakening ===

The experience of Kuṇḍalinī awakening can happen when one is either prepared or unprepared.

According to Hindu tradition, in order to be able to integrate this spiritual energy, a period of careful purification and strengthening of the body and nervous system is usually required beforehand. Yoga and Tantra propose that Kuṇḍalinī can be awakened by a guru (teacher), but body and spirit must be prepared by yogic austerities, such as pranayama, or breath control, physical exercises, visualization, and chanting. The student is advised to follow the path in an open-hearted manner.

Kuṇḍalinī is considered to occur in the chakra and nadis of the subtle body. Each chakra is said to contain special characteristics and with proper training, moving Kuṇḍalinī through these chakras can help express or open these characteristics.

Kuṇḍalinī is described as a sleeping, dormant potential force in the human organism.

It is one of the components of an esoteric description of the &quot;subtle body&quot;, which consists of nadis (energy channels), chakras (psychic centres), prana (subtle energy), and bindu (drops of essence).

Kuṇḍalinī is described as being coiled up at the base of the spine. The description of the location can vary slightly, from the rectum to the navel. Kuṇḍalinī is said to reside in the triangular sacrum bone in three and a half coils.

Swami Vivekananda describes Kuṇḍalinī briefly in his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; as follows:

When Kuṇḍalinī Shakti is conceived as a goddess, then, when it rises to the head, it unites itself with the Supreme Being of (Lord Shiva). The aspirant then becomes engrossed in deep meditation and infinite bliss. Paramahansa Yogananda in his book &quot;God Talks with Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita&quot; states:

Paramahansa Yogananda also states:
Krishnamacharya, often called the &quot;father of modern yoga&quot;, described kuṇḍalinī differently. To him, Kuṇḍalinī is not an energy that rises: it is a blockage that prevents prāṇa vāyu (breath) from entering the suṣumnā and rising. This interpretation came partly from his own experience and partly from teachings of two sects of Vishnu-worshiping temple priests.

== Western significance ==

Sir John Woodroffe (1865–1936) – also known by his pseudonym Arthur Avalon – was a British Orientalist whose published works stimulated a far-reaching interest in Hindu philosophy and Yogic practices. While serving as a High Court Judge in Calcutta, he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy, particularly as it related to Hindu Tantra. He translated numerous original Sanskrit texts and lectured on Indian philosophy, Yoga and Tantra. His book, &quot;The Serpent Power: The Secrets of Tantric and Shaktic Yoga&quot; became a major source for many modern Western adaptations of Kundalini yoga practice. It presents an academically and philosophically sophisticated translation of, and commentary on, two key Eastern texts: &quot;Shatchakranirūpana&quot; (Description and Investigation into the Six Bodily Centers) written by Tantrik Pūrnānanda Svāmī (1526) and the &quot;Paduka-Pancakā&quot; from the Sanskrit of a commentary by Kālīcharana (Five-fold Footstool of the Guru). The Sanskrit term &quot;Kundali Shakti&quot; translates as &quot;Serpent Power&quot;. Kundalini is thought to be an energy released within an individual using specific meditation techniques. It is represented symbolically as a serpent coiled at the base of the spine.

When Woodroffe later commented upon the reception of his work he clarified his objective, &quot;All the world (I speak of course of those interested in such subjects) is beginning to speak of Kundalinî Shakti.&quot; He described his intention as follows: &quot;We, who are foreigners, must place ourselves in the skin of the Hindu, and must look at their doctrine and ritual through their eyes and not our own.&quot;

=== Carl Jung ===

Western awareness of Kuṇḍalinī was strengthened by the interest of Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung (1875–1961).

In the introduction to Jung&#x27;s book &quot;The Psychology of Kundalini Yoga&quot;, Sonu Shamdasani puts forth: 

=== More recent viewpoints ===

The American writer William Buhlman began to conduct an international survey of out-of-body experiences in 1969 in order to gather information about symptoms: sounds, vibrations and other phenomena that commonly occur at the time of the OBE event. His primary interest was to compare the findings with reports made by yogis such as Gopi Krishna who have referred to similar phenomena, such as the &quot;vibrational state&quot; as components of their kundalini-related spiritual experience. He explains:

Sri Aurobindo was the other great scholarly authority on Kuṇḍalinī, with a viewpoint parallel to that of Woodroffe but of a somewhat different slant - this according to Mary Scott, herself a latter-day scholar on Kuṇḍalinī and its physical basis, and a former member of the Theosophical Society.

=== Psychology ===

According to Carl Jung &quot;the concept of Kundalini has for us only one use, that is, to describe our own experiences with the unconscious&quot;. Jung used the Kundalini system symbolically as a means of understanding the dynamic movement between conscious and unconscious processes.

According to Shamdasani, Jung claimed that the symbolism of Kuṇḍalinī yoga suggested that the bizarre symptomatology that patients at times presented, actually resulted from the awakening of the Kuṇḍalinī. He argued that knowledge of such symbolism enabled much that would otherwise be seen as the meaningless by-products of a disease process to be understood as meaningful symbolic processes, and explicated the often peculiar physical localizations of symptoms.

The popularization of eastern spiritual practices has been associated with psychological problems in the west. Psychiatric literature notes that &quot;since the influx of eastern spiritual practices and the rising popularity of meditation starting in the 1960s, many people have experienced a variety of psychological difficulties, either while engaged in intensive spiritual practice or spontaneously.&quot; Among the psychological difficulties associated with intensive spiritual practice we find &quot;Kundalini awakening,&quot; &quot;a complex physio-psychospiritual transformative process described in the yogic tradition.&quot; Researchers in the fields of Transpersonal psychology, and Near-death studies have described a complex pattern of sensory, motor, mental, and affective symptoms associated with the concept of Kundalini, sometimes called the Kundalini syndrome.

The differentiation between spiritual emergency associated with Kuṇḍalinī awakening may be viewed as an acute psychotic episode by psychiatrists who are not conversant with the culture. The biological changes of increased P300 amplitudes that occurs with certain yogic practices may lead to acute psychosis. Biological alterations by Yogic techniques may be used to warn people against such reactions.

<text>Kaj Harald Leininger Munk (commonly called Kaj Munk) (13 January 1898 – 4 January 1944) was a Danish playwright and Lutheran pastor, known for his cultural engagement and his martyrdom during the Occupation of Denmark of World War II. He is commemorated as a martyr in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 14 August, alongside Maximilian Kolbe.

==Biography==
He was born Kaj Harald Leininger Petersen on the island of Lolland, Denmark, and raised by a family named Munk after the death of his parents. From 1924 until his death, Munk was the vicar of Vedersø in Western Jutland. Munk&#x27;s plays were mostly performed and made public during the 1930s, although many were written in the 1920s. Much of his other work concerns the &quot;philosophy-on-life debate&quot; (religion—Marxism—Darwinism) which marked much of Danish cultural life during this period.

On one occasion, in the early 1930s, in a comment that came back to haunt him in later years, Munk expressed admiration for Hitler (for uniting Germans) and wished a similar unifying figure for Danes. However, Munk&#x27;s attitude towards Hitler (and Mussolini) turned to outspoken criticism as he witnessed Hitler&#x27;s persecution of the German Jewish community, and Mussolini&#x27;s conduct of the war in Ethiopia. In 1938, the Danish newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; published on its front page an open letter to Benito Mussolini written by Kaj Munk criticising the persecutions against Jews.

Early on, Munk was a strong opponent of the German Occupation of Denmark (1940–1945), although he continually opposed the idea of democracy as such, preferring the idea of a &quot;Nordic dictator&quot; who should unite the Nordic countries and keep them neutral during periods of international crisis. His plays &quot;Han sidder ved Smeltediglen&quot; (&quot;He sits by the melting pot&quot;) and &quot;Niels Ebbesen&quot; were direct attacks on Nazism. The latter, centering on the figure of Niels Ebbesen, a medieval Danish squire considered a national hero for having assassinated an earlier German occupier of Denmark, Count Gerhard III, was a contemporary analogue to World War II-era Denmark. Despite his friends urging Munk to go underground, he continued to preach against Danes who collaborated with the Nazis.

The Gestapo arrested Munk on the night of 4 January 1944, a month after he had defied a Nazi ban and preached the first Advent sermon at the national cathedral in Copenhagen. Munk&#x27;s body was found in a roadside ditch in rural Hørbylunde near Silkeborg the next morning with a note stating, &quot;Swine, you worked for Germany just the same.&quot; 

Munk&#x27;s body was returned to his parish church, Vedersø, where it is buried outside the choir. A simple stone cross was also erected on a small hill overlooking the site where Munk&#x27;s body was dumped.

Half of the January 1944 issue of the resistance newspaper &quot;De frie Danske&quot; was dedicated to Munk with his portrait filling the front page. The obituary &quot;Danmarks store Søn—Kaj Munk&quot; (The great son of Denmark—Kaj Munk) filled the next page, followed by excerpts from a new year&#x27;s sermon he had given. Next came a description of his murder and a photo reportage from his funeral. Lastly the paper featured condemning reactions from influential Scandinavians, namely Prince Wilhelm, Duke of Södermanland, Jarl Hemmer, Johannes Jørgensen, Sigrid Undset, Erling Eidem and Harald Bohr.

The Danish government allowed his widow, Lise, to live at the parish house until she died in 1998. The church and parish house were restored as a memorial and opened to the public in 2010.

==Playwright==
Munk often used a historical background for his plays—among his influences were William Shakespeare, Adam Oehlenschläger, Henrik Ibsen, and George Bernard Shaw. As a playwright, Munk became known for &quot;strong characters&quot;—integrated people who fight wholeheartedly for their ideals (whether good or bad). In his play &quot;En Idealist&quot;, for example, the &quot;hero&quot; is King Herod whose fight to maintain power is the motive behind all of his acts until he is at last defeated by a show of kindness to the Christ child in a weak moment.

His 1925 play &quot;Ordet&quot; (&quot;The Word&quot;) is generally considered to be his best work; it is an investigation of miracles from the unique (at least, to theatre) viewpoint of one who was not prepared to dismiss them. A family of farmers—of differing degrees of faith—find themselves reconciled to their neighbours through a miracle. A 1943 film adaptation titled &quot;The Word&quot; was directed by Gustaf Molander. A 1955 film version of &quot;Ordet&quot; was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, and won numerous awards, including the Golden Lion at the 16th Venice International Film Festival and the 1956 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Munk&#x27;s plays, many of which have been performed at the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen, and elsewhere, include:
* &quot;Pilatus&quot; (1917. Published 1937)

<doc id="17001" wikidata="Q147202" url="?curid=17001" title="Kohlrabi">
<text>Kohlrabi (; pronounced in English; scientific name &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; Gongylodes Group), also called German turnip or turnip cabbage, is a biennial vegetable, a low, stout cultivar of wild cabbage. It is a cultivar of the same species as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, Savoy cabbage, and gai lan.

It can be eaten raw or cooked. Edible preparations are made with both the stem and the leaves. Despite its common names, it is not the same species as turnip, although both are in the genus &quot;Brassica&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from the German (&quot;cabbage&quot;) plus &quot;Rübe&quot; ~ &quot;Rabi&quot; (Swiss German variant) (&quot;turnip&quot;), because the swollen stem resembles the latter.

Its Group name Gongylodes (or lowercase and italicized &quot;gongylodes&quot; or &quot;gongyloides&quot; as a variety name) means &quot;roundish&quot; in Greek, from (, &#x27;round&#x27;).

== History ==
The first European written record is by the botanist Mattioli in 1554 who wrote that it had &quot;come lately into Italy&quot;. By the end of the 16th century, kohlrabi spread to North Europe and was being grown in Austria, Germany, England, Italy, Spain, Tripoli and parts of the eastern Mediterranean.

== Description ==

Kohlrabi has been created by artificial selection for lateral meristem growth (a swollen, nearly spherical shape); its origin in nature is the same as that of cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts: they are all bred from, and are the same species as, the wild cabbage plant (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;).

The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter, with a higher ratio of flesh to skin. The young stem in particular can be as crisp and juicy as an apple, although much less sweet.

Except for the &quot;Gigante&quot; cultivar, spring-grown kohlrabi that are much over in size tend to be woody, as do full-grown kohlrabi much over perhaps in size; the Gigante cultivar can achieve great size while remaining of good eating quality. The plant matures in 55–60 days after sowing and has good standing ability for up to 30 days after maturity. The approximate weight is g . It grows well in hydroponic systems, producing a large edible bulk without clogging the nutrient troughs.

There are several varieties commonly available, including &#x27;White Vienna&#x27;, &#x27;Purple Vienna&#x27;, &#x27;Grand Duke&#x27;, &#x27;Gigante&#x27; (also known as &quot;Superschmelz&quot;), &#x27;Purple Danube&#x27;, and &#x27;White Danube&#x27;. Colouration of the purple types is superficial: the edible parts are all pale yellow. The leafy greens can also be eaten. One commonly used variety grows without a swollen stem, having just leaves and a very thin stem, and is called &quot;Haakh&quot;. &quot;Haakh&quot; and &quot;Monj&quot; are popular Kashmiri dishes made using this vegetable. In the second year, the plant will bloom and develop seeds.

==Nutrition==

Raw kohlrabi is 91% water, 6% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference amount, raw kohlrabi supplies 27 calories, and is a rich source (20% of more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (65% DV) and a moderate source (10-19% DV) of copper and potassium, with no other micronutrients in significant amounts (table).

== Preparation and use ==
Kohlrabi stems (the enlarged vegetal part) are surrounded by two distinct fibrous layers that do not soften appreciably when cooked. These layers are generally peeled away prior to cooking or serving raw, with the result that the stems often provide a smaller amount of food than one might assume from their intact appearance.

Although all parts of kohlrabi are edible, the bulbous stem is most frequently used, typically raw in salad or slaws. It has a texture similar to that of a broccoli stem, but with a flavor that is sweeter and less vegetal. It is also more crunchy and crisp than a raw broccoli stem.

Kohlrabi leaves are edible and can be used similarly to collard greens and kale, but take longer to cook.

Kohlrabi is an important part of Kashmiri cuisine, where it is called &quot;Mŏnji.&quot; It is one of the most commonly cooked vegetables, along with collard greens (&quot;haakh&quot;). It is prepared with its leaves and served with a light soup and eaten with rice.

In Cyprus, it is popularly sprinkled with salt and lemon and served as an appetizer.

Kohlrabi is a common ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine. It can also be found in the dish nem rán, stir fry and canh. Raw kohlrabi is usually sliced thinly for nộm or nước chấm.

Some varieties are grown as feed for cattle.

<doc id="17003" wikidata="Q727919" url="?curid=17003" title="Tettigoniidae">
<text>Insects in the family Tettigoniidae are commonly called katydids (especially in North America) or bush crickets. They have previously been known as &quot;long-horned grasshoppers&quot;. More than 8,000 species are known. Part of the suborder Ensifera, the Tettigoniidae are the only extant (living) family in the superfamily Tettigonioidea.

Many species are nocturnal in habit, having strident mating calls and may exhibit mimicry or camouflage, commonly with shapes and colours similar to leaves.

==Etymology==
The family name Tettigoniidae is derived from the genus &quot;Tettigonia&quot;, of which the great green bush cricket is the type species; it was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. In Latin &quot;tettigonia&quot; means a kind of small cicada, leafhopper; it is from the Greek τεττιγόνιον &quot;tettigonion&quot;, the diminutive of the imitative (onomatopoeic) τέττιξ, &quot;tettix&quot;, cicada. All of these names such as &quot;tettix&quot; with repeated sounds are onomatopoeic, imitating the stridulation of these insects. The common name &quot;katydid&quot; is also onomatopoeic and comes from the particularly loud, three-pulsed song, often rendered &quot;ka-ty-did&quot;, of the nominate subspecies of the North American &quot;Pterophylla camellifolia&quot;, belonging to the subfamily Pseudophyllinae, which are known as &quot;true katydids&quot;.

==Description and life cycle==
===Description===

Tettigoniids range in size from as small as to as large as . The smaller species typically live in drier or more stressful habitats which may lead to their small size. The small size is associated with greater agility, faster development, and lower nutritional needs. Tettigoniids are tree-living insects that are most commonly heard at night during summer and early fall. Tettigoniids may be distinguished from the grasshopper by the length of their filamentous antennae, which may exceed their own body length, while grasshoppers&#x27; antennae are always relatively short and thickened.

===Life cycle===

Eggs are typically oval and may be attached in rows to plants. Where the eggs are deposited relates to the way the ovipositor is formed. It consists of up to three pairs of appendages formed to transmit the egg, to make a place for it, and place it properly. Tettigoniids have either sickle-shaped ovipositors which typically lay eggs in dead or living plant matter, or uniform long ovipositors which lay eggs in grass stems. When tettigoniids hatch, the nymphs often look like small, wingless versions of the adults, but in some species, the nymphs look nothing at all like the adult and rather mimic other species such as ants, spiders and assassin bugs, or flowers, to prevent predation. The nymphs remain in a mimic state only until they are large enough to escape predation. Once they complete their last molt (after about 5 successful molts), they are then prepared to mate.

==Distribution==
Tettigoniids are found on every continent except Antarctica. The vast majority of katydid species live in the tropical regions of the world. For example, the Amazon basin tropical forests are home to over 2,000 species. However, katydids are found in the cool, dry temperate regions, as well, with about 255 species in North America.

==Classification==
The Tettigoniidae are a large family and have been divided into a number of subfamilies:


The Copiphorinae were previously considered a subfamily, but are now placed as tribe Copiphorini in the subfamily Conocephalinae. The genus &quot;Acridoxena&quot; is now placed in the tribe Acridoxenini of the Mecopodinae (previously its own subfamily, Acridoxeninae).

===Extinct taxa===
The &quot;Orthoptera species file&quot; lists:
*†Pseudotettigoniinae (North America, Europe)
*†Rammeinae (Europe)
*†Tettigoidinae (Australia)
;Genera &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
* †&quot;Locustites&quot; Heer, 1849: 3 spp.
* †&quot;Locustophanes&quot; Handlirsch, 1939: †&quot;L. rhipidophorus&quot; Handlirsch, 1939
* †&quot;Prophasgonura&quot; Piton, 1940: †&quot;P. lineatocollis&quot; Piton, 1940
* †&quot;Protempusa&quot; Piton, 1940: †&quot;P. incerta&quot; Piton, 1940
* †&quot;Prototettix&quot; Giebel, 1856: †&quot;P. lithanthraca&quot; (Goldenberg, 1854)

The genus †&quot;Triassophyllum&quot; is extinct and may be placed here or in the Archaeorthoptera.

==Ecology==
 
The diet of most tettigoniids includes leaves, flowers, bark, and seeds, but many species are exclusively predatory, feeding on other insects, snails, or even small vertebrates such as snakes and lizards. Some are also considered pests by commercial crop growers and are sprayed to limit growth, but population densities are usually low, so a large economic impact is rare.

Tettigoniids are serious insect pests of karuka (&quot;Pandanus julianettii&quot;). The species &quot;Segestes gracilis&quot; and &quot;Segestidea montana&quot; eat the leaves and can sometimes kill trees. Growers will stuff leaves and grass in between the leaves of the crown to keep insects out.

By observing the head and mouthparts, where differences can be seen in relation to function, it is possible to determine what type of food the tettigoniids consume. Large tettigoniids can inflict a painful bite or pinch if handled, but seldom break the skin.

Some species of bush crickets are consumed by people, such as the &quot;nsenene&quot; (&quot;Ruspolia differens&quot;) in Uganda and neighbouring areas.

===Communication===
The males of tettigoniids have sound-producing organs located on the hind angles of their front wings. In some species, females are also capable of stridulation. Females chirp in response to the shrill of the males. The males use this sound for courtship, which occurs late in the summer. The sound is produced by rubbing two parts of their bodies together, called stridulation. In many cases this is done with the wings, but not exclusively. One body part bears a file or comb with ridges; the other has the plectrum, which runs over the ridges to produce a vibration. For tettigoniids, the fore wings are used to sing. Tettigoniids produce continuous songs known as trills. The size of the insect, the spacing of the ridges, and the width of the scraper all influence what sound is made.

Many species stridulate at a tempo which is governed by ambient temperature, so that the number of chirps in a defined period of time can produce a fairly accurate temperature reading. For American katydids, the formula is generally given as the number of chirps in 15 seconds plus 37 to give the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

===Predation===

Some tettigoniids have spines on different parts of their bodies that work in different ways. The Listroscelinae have limb spines on the ventral surfaces of their bodies. This works in a way to confine their prey to make a temporary cage above their mouthparts. The spines are articulated and comparatively flexible, but relatively blunt. Due to this, they are used to cage and not penetrate the prey&#x27;s body. Spines on the tibiae and the femora are usually more sharp and nonarticulated. They are designed more for penetration or help in the defensive mechanism they might have. This usually works with their diurnal roosting posture to maximize defense and prevent predators from going for their head.

===Defense mechanisms===

When tettigoniids go to rest during the day, they enter a diurnal roosting posture to maximize their cryptic qualities. This position fools predators into thinking the katydid is either dead or just a leaf on the plant. Various tettigoniids have bright coloration and black apical spots on the inner surfaces of the tegmina, and brightly colored hind wings. By flicking their wings open when disturbed, they use the coloration to fool predators into thinking the spots are eyes. This, in combination with their coloration mimicking leaves, allows them to blend in with their surroundings, but also makes predators unsure which side is the front and which side is the back.

==Reproductive behavior==
The males provide a nuptial gift for the females in the form of a spermatophylax, a body attached to the males&#x27; spermatophore and consumed by the female, to distract her from eating the male&#x27;s spermatophore and thereby increase his paternity.

===Polygamy===
The Tettigoniidae have polygamous relationships. The first male to mate is guaranteed an extremely high confidence of paternity when a second male couples at the termination of female sexual refractoriness. The nutrients that the offspring ultimately receive will increase their fitness. The second male to mate with the female at the termination of her refractory period is usually cuckolded.

===Competition===
The polygamous relationships of the Tettigoniidae lead to high levels of male-male competition. Male competition is caused by the decreased availability of males able to supply nutritious spermaphylanges to the females. Females produce more eggs on a high-quality diet; thus, the female looks for healthier males with a more nutritious spermatophylax. Females use the sound created by the male to judge his fitness. The louder and more fluent the trill, the higher the fitness of the male.

===Stress response===
In species which produce larger food gifts, the female often seeks out the males to copulate. This, however, is a cost to females as they risk predation while searching for males. Also, a cost-benefit tradeoff exists in the size of the spermatophore which the male tettigoniids produce. When males possess a large spermatophore, they benefit by being more highly selected for by females, but they are only able to mate one to two times during their lifetimes. Inversely, male Tettigoniidae with smaller spermatophores have the benefit of being able to mate two to three times per night, but have lower chances of being selected by females. Even in times of nutritional stress, male Tettigoniidae continue to invest nutrients within their spermatophores. In some species, the cost of creating the spermatophore is low, but even in those which it is not low, it is still not beneficial to reduce the quality of the spermatophore, as it would lead to lower reproductive selection and success. This low reproductive success is attributed to some Tettigoniidae species in which the spermatophylax that the female receives as a food gift from the male during copulation increases the reproductive output of the reproduction attempt. However, in other cases, the female receives few, if any, benefits.

The reproductive behavior of bush crickets has been studied in great depth. Studies found that the tuberous bush cricket (&quot;Platycleis affinis&quot;) has the largest testes in proportion to body mass of any animal recorded. They account for 14% of the insect&#x27;s body mass and are thought to enable a fast remating rate.

<text>The Heaviside layer, sometimes called the Kennelly–Heaviside layer, named after Arthur E. Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside, is a layer of ionised gas occurring roughly between 90km and 150 km (56 and 93 mi) above the ground — one of several layers in the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. It is also known as the E region. It reflects medium-frequency radio waves. Because of this reflective layer, radio waves radiated into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon. This &quot;skywave&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; propagation technique has been used since the 1920s for radio communication at long distances, up to transcontinental distances.

Propagation is affected by the time of day. During the daytime the solar wind presses this layer closer to the Earth, thereby limiting how far it can reflect radio waves. Conversely, on the night (lee) side of the Earth, the solar wind drags the ionosphere further away, thereby greatly increasing the range which radio waves can travel by reflection. The extent of the effect is further influenced by the season, and the amount of sunspot activity.

==History==
Existence of a reflective layer was predicted in 1902 independently and almost simultaneously by the American electrical engineer Arthur Edwin Kennelly (1861–1939) and the British polymath Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925), as an explanation for the propagation of radio waves beyond the horizon observed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1901. However, it was not until 1924 that its existence was shown by British scientist Edward V. Appleton, for which he received the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Physicists resisted the idea of the reflecting layer for one very good reason; it would require total internal reflection, which in turn would require that the speed of light in the ionosphere would be greater than in the atmosphere below it. Since the latter speed is essentially the same as the speed of light in vacuum (&quot;c&quot;), scientists were unwilling to believe the speed in the ionosphere could be higher. Nevertheless, Marconi had received signals in Newfoundland that were broadcast in England, so clearly there must be some mechanism allowing the transmission to reach that far. The paradox was resolved by the discovery that there were two velocities of light, the &quot;phase velocity&quot; and the &quot;group velocity&quot;. The phase velocity can in fact be greater than &quot;c&quot;, but the group velocity, being capable of transmitting information, cannot, by special relativity, be greater than &quot;c&quot;. The phase velocity for radio waves in the ionosphere is indeed greater than &quot;c&quot;, and that makes total internal reflection possible, and so the ionosphere can reflect radio waves. The geometric mean of the phase velocity and the group velocity cannot exceed &quot;c&quot;, so when the phase velocity goes above &quot;c&quot;, the group velocity must go below it. 

In 1925, Americans Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve first mapped the Heaviside layer&#x27;s variations in altitude. The ITU standard model of absorption and reflection of radio waves by the Heaviside Layer was developed by the British Ionospheric physicist Louis Muggleton in the 1970s.

==Etymology==
Around 1910, William Eccles proposed the name &quot;Heaviside Layer&quot; for the radio-wave reflecting layer in the upper atmosphere, and the name has subsequently been widely adopted. The name Kennelly–Heaviside layer was proposed in 1925 to give credit to the work of Kennelly, which predated the proposal by Heaviside by several months.

<doc id="17006" wikidata="Q527395" url="?curid=17006" title="Knot">
<text>A knot is an intentional complication in cordage which may be practical or decorative, or both. Practical knots are classified by function, including hitches, bends, loop knots, and splices: a &quot;hitch&quot; fastens a rope to another object; a &quot;bend&quot; fastens two ends of a rope to each another; a &quot;loop knot&quot; is any knot creating a loop; and &quot;splice&quot; denotes any multi-strand knot, including bends and loops. A knot may also refer, in the strictest sense, to a stopper or knob at the end of a rope to keep that end from slipping through a grommet or eye. Knots have excited interest since ancient times for their practical uses, as well as their topological intricacy, studied in the area of mathematics known as knot theory.


==History==
Knots and knotting have been used and studied throughout history. For example, Chinese knotting is a decorative handicraft art that began as a form of Chinese folk art in the Tang and Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD) in China, later popularized in the Ming. Knot theory is the recent mathematical study of knots.

Knots of ancient origin include the bottle sling, bowline, cat&#x27;s paw, clove hitch, cow hitch, double fisherman&#x27;s knot, eskimo bowline, figure-eight knot, fisherman&#x27;s knot, half hitch, kalmyk loop, one-sided overhand bend, overhand knot, overhand loop, reef knot, running bowline, single hitch, thief knot, Turk&#x27;s head knot, and two half-hitches.

The eleven main knots of Chinese knotting are the four-flower knot, six-flower knot, Chinese button knot, double connection knot, double coin knot, agemaki, cross knot, square knot, Plafond knot, Pan Chang knot, and the good luck knot.

Knots of more recent origin include the friendship knot of Chinese knotting. The sheepshank knot originates from 1627 while the Western Union splice originates from the beginning of telegraphy.

==Use==
There is a large variety of knots, each with properties that make it suitable for a range of tasks. Some knots are used to attach the rope (or other knotting material) to other objects such as another rope, cleat, ring, or stake. Some knots are used to bind or constrict objects. Decorative knots usually bind to themselves to produce attractive patterns.

===Teaching===
While some people can look at diagrams or photos and tie the illustrated knots, others learn best by watching how a knot is tied. Knot tying skills are often transmitted by sailors, scouts, climbers, canyoners, cavers, arborists, rescue professionals, stagehands, fishermen, linemen and surgeons. The International Guild of Knot Tyers is an organization dedicated to the promotion of knot tying.

===Applications===

Truckers in need of securing a load may use a trucker&#x27;s hitch, gaining mechanical advantage. Knots can save spelunkers from being buried under rock. Many knots can also be used as makeshift tools, for example, the bowline can be used as a rescue loop, and the munter hitch can be used for belaying. The diamond hitch was widely used to tie packages on to donkeys and mules.

In hazardous environments such as mountains, knots are very important. In the event of someone falling into a ravine or a similar terrain feature, with the correct equipment and knowledge of knots a rappel system can be set up to lower a rescuer down to a casualty and set up a hauling system to allow a third individual to pull both the rescuer and the casualty out of the ravine. Further application of knots includes developing a high line, which is similar to a zip line, and which can be used to move supplies, injured people, or the untrained across rivers, crevices, or ravines. Note the systems mentioned typically require carabiners and the use of multiple appropriate knots. These knots include the bowline, double figure eight, munter hitch, munter mule, prusik, autoblock, and clove hitch. Thus any individual who goes into a mountainous environment should have basic knowledge of knots and knot systems to increase safety and the ability to undertake activities such as rappelling.

Knots can be applied in combination to produce complex objects such as lanyards and netting. In ropework, the frayed end of a rope is held together by a type of knot called a whipping knot. Many types of textiles use knots to repair damage. Macramé, one kind of textile, is generated exclusively through the use of knotting, instead of knits, crochets, weaves or felting. Macramé can produce self-supporting three-dimensional textile structures, as well as flat work, and is often used ornamentally or decoratively.

==Properties==

===Strength===

Knots weaken the rope in which they are made. When knotted rope is strained to its breaking point, it almost always fails at the knot or close to it, unless it is defective or damaged elsewhere. The bending, crushing, and chafing forces that hold a knot in place also unevenly stress rope fibers and ultimately lead to a reduction in strength. The exact mechanisms that cause the weakening and failure are complex and are the subject of continued study. Special fibers that show differences in color in response to strain are being developed and used to study stress as it relates to types of knots.

Relative knot strength, also called knot efficiency, is the breaking strength of a knotted rope in proportion to the breaking strength of the rope without the knot. Determining a precise value for a particular knot is difficult because many factors can affect a knot efficiency test: the type of fiber, the style of rope, the size of rope, whether it is wet or dry, how the knot is dressed before loading, how rapidly it is loaded, whether the knot is repeatedly loaded, and so on. The efficiency of common knots ranges between 40 and 80% of the rope&#x27;s original strength.

In most situations forming loops and bends with conventional knots is far more practical than using rope splices, even though the latter can maintain nearly the rope&#x27;s full strength. Prudent users allow for a large safety margin in the strength of rope chosen for a task due to the weakening effects of knots, aging, damage, shock loading, etc. The working load limit of a rope is generally specified with a significant safety factor, up to 15:1 for critical applications. For life-threatening applications, other factors come into play.

===Security===
Even if the rope does not break, a knot may still fail to hold. Knots that hold firm under a variety of adverse conditions are said to be more secure than those that do not.

The following sections describe the main ways that knots fail to hold.

====Slipping====
The load creates tension that pulls the rope back through the knot in the direction of the load. If this continues far enough, the working end passes into the knot and the knot unravels and fails. This behavior can worsen when the knot is repeatedly strained and let slack, dragged over rough terrain, or repeatedly struck against hard objects such as masts and flagpoles.

Even with secure knots, slippage may occur when the knot is first put under real tension. This can be mitigated by leaving plenty of rope at the working end outside of the knot, and by dressing the knot cleanly and tightening it as much as possible before loading. Sometimes, the use of a stopper knot or, even better, a backup knot can prevent the working end from passing through the knot; but if a knot is observed to slip, it is generally preferable to use a more secure knot. Life-critical applications often require backup knots to maximize safety.

====Capsizing====

To capsize (or spill) a knot is to change its form and rearrange its parts, usually by pulling on specific ends in certain ways. When used inappropriately, some knots tend to capsize easily or even spontaneously. Often the capsized form of the knot offers little resistance to slipping or unraveling. A reef knot, when misused as a bend, can capsize dangerously.

Sometimes a knot is intentionally capsized as a method of tying another knot, as with the &quot;lightning method&quot; of tying a bowline. Some knots, such as the carrick bend, are generally tied in one form then capsized to obtain a stronger or more stable form.

====Sliding====
In knots that are meant to grip other objects, failure can be defined as the knot moving relative to the gripped object. While the knot itself is not untied, it ceases to perform the desired function. For instance, a simple rolling hitch tied around a railing and pulled parallel to the railing might hold up to a certain tension, then start sliding. Sometimes this problem can be corrected by working-up the knot tighter before subjecting it to load, but usually the problem requires either a knot with more wraps or a rope of different diameter or material.

===Releasability===
Knots differ in the effort required to untie them after loading. Knots that are very difficult to untie, such as the water knot, are said to &quot;jam&quot; or be jamming knots. Knots that come untied with less difficulty, such as the Zeppelin bend, are referred to as &quot;non-jamming&quot;.

==Components==


=== Bight ===
:A bight is any curved section, slack part, or loop between the ends of a rope, string, or yarn.

=== Bitter end ===
:As a ropeworker&#x27;s term, &quot;bitter end&quot; refers to the end of a rope that is tied off. In British nautical usage, the bitter end is the ship end of the anchor cable, secured by the anchor bitts and the bitter pin in the cable locker under the forecastle. At anchor, the more anchor line that is payed out, the better the anchor&#x27;s hold. In a storm, if the anchor drags, ships will pay out more and more anchor line until they reach the &quot;bitter end.&quot; At this point, they can only hope the anchor holds, hence the expression &quot;hanging on to the bitter end&quot;. (A &quot;bitt&quot; is a metal block with a crosspin for tying lines to, also found on piers.) Also, the working end.

=== Loop ===
:A curve narrower than a bight but with separate ends.

=== Elbow ===
:Two crossing points created by an extra twist in a loop or a circle.

=== Standing end ===
:The standing end is the longer end of the rope not involved in the knot, often shown as unfinished. It is often (but not always) the end of the rope under load after the knot is complete. For example, when a clove hitch ties a boat to a pier, the end going to the boat is the &quot;standing end&quot;.

=== Standing part ===
:Section of line between knot and the standing end (seen above).

=== Turn ===
:A turn or single turn is a curve with crossed legs.
:A round turn is the complete encirclement of an object; requires two passes.
:Two round turns circles the object twice; requires three passes.

=== Working end ===
:The active end of a line used in making the knot. May also be called the &quot;running end&quot;, &quot;live end&quot;, or &quot;tag end&quot;.

=== Working part ===
:Section of line between knot and the working end.

==Knot categories==
The list of knots is extensive, but common properties allow for a useful system of categorization. For example, &quot;loop&quot; knots share the attribute of having some kind of an anchor point constructed on the standing end (such as a loop or overhand knot) into which the working end is easily hitched, using a round turn. An example of this is the bowline. &quot;Constricting&quot; knots often rely on friction to cinch down tight on loose bundles; an example is the Miller&#x27;s knot. Knots may belong to more than one category.

;Bend :A knot uniting two lines (for knots joining two ends of the same line, see binding knots or loops).
;Binding :A knot that restricts object(s) by making multiple winds.
;Coil knot :Knots used to tie up lines for storage.
;Decorative knot :A complex knot exhibiting repeating patterns often constructed around and enhancing an object.
;Hitch :A knot tied to a post, cable, ring, or spar.
;Lashing :A knot used to hold (usually) poles together.
;Loop :A knot used to create a closed circle in a line.
;Plait (or braid):A number of lines interwoven in a simple regular pattern.
;Slip (or running) :A knot tied with a hitch around one of its parts. In contrast, a loop is closed with a bend. While a slip knot can be closed, a loop remains the same size.
;Slipped :Some knots may be finished by passing a bight rather than the end, for ease of untying. The common shoelace knot is an example, being a reef knot with both ends slipped.
;Seizing :A knot used to hold two lines or two parts of the same line together.
;Sennit :A number of lines interwoven in a complex pattern. See also Chain sinnet.
;Splice :A knot formed by interweaving strands of rope rather than whole lines. More time-consuming but usually stronger than simple knots.
;Stopper :A knot tied to hold a line through a hole.
;Whipping :A binding knot used to prevent another line from fraying.

===Basic useful knots===
* Alpine butterfly knot for a secure loop in the middle of a rope when the ends are not free
* Bowline for tying a loop in the end of a rope, as around one&#x27;s waist or to secure a ring or grommet. The knot is also used as an anchor knot and is used in many knot systems that are used in mountainous terrain such as a highline or hauling system.
* Constrictor knot for making bundles or cinching the neck of a sack, though this knot jams and may need to be cut
* Figure-eight knot as a stopper
* Grass bend for tying belts together, though insecure with ropes
* Monkey&#x27;s fist used to weight the end of a rope
* Prusik for ascending a rope
* Reef knot (square knot), a common but insecure binding knot for joining the ends of a piece of cordage wrapped around an object or objects
* Sheet bend for joining the ends of two ropes, which need not be the same diameter
** Double sheet bend for tying the ends of two dissimilarly sized ropes together
* Spanish bowline used to hoist crewmen aloft or suspend them over the side
* Versatackle for hoisting heavy loads and tightening rigging
* Water knot for tying a knot in flat material such as nylon webbing

====Hitches====
* Anchor bend (or anchor hitch) for tying a rope to a boat anchor
* Clove hitch for tying a rope to a pole – simple and will not jam, but not particularly secure and will not work on rectangular shapes
* Buntline hitch for tying a rope to a pole or other shape, but can jam
* Diamond hitch for packing trail animals
* Rolling hitch for securing a rope to a pole when the pull is lengthwise rather than outward, or to tie one rope to the middle of another
* Taut-line hitch (or Midshipman&#x27;s hitch) for forming an adjustable (ratcheting) loop that does not slip smaller under tension
* Timber hitch for securing or hauling long narrow loads, with the pull in one direction
* Trucker&#x27;s hitch for clinching down a load

===Trick knots===
Trick knots are knots that are used as part of a magic trick, a joke, or a puzzle. They are useful for these purposes because they have a deceptive appearance, being easier or more difficult to tie or untie than their appearance would suggest. The easiest trick knot is the slip knot. Other noted trick knots include:
* Grief knot. The starkly differing behavior of the knot, depending on how it is arranged, has been exploited as the basis of a parlor trick. When pulling on the standing ends the knot starts slipping and the working ends become crossed. By twisting the working ends so that they uncross and then recross in reverse, the knot&#x27;s structure capsizes so that it will no longer slip. The twisting motion resembles the turning of a key, &quot;locking&quot; and &quot;unlocking&quot; the knot.
* Tom fool&#x27;s knot, used as a trick knot due to the speed with which it can be made.

==Coxcombing==

Coxcombing is a decorative knotwork performed by sailors during the Age of Sail.

The general purpose was to dress-up, protect, or help identify specific items and parts of ships and boats.

It is still found today in some whippings and wrappings of small diameter line on boat tillers and ships&#x27; wheels to enhance the grip, or to identify rudder amidships.

Knots used in coxcombing include Turk&#x27;s head knot, Flemish, French whipping, and others.

==Knot theory==

Knot theory is a branch of topology. It deals with the mathematical analysis of knots, their structure and properties, and with the relationships between different knots. In topology, a knot is a figure consisting of a single loop with any number of crossing or knotted elements: a closed curve in space which may be moved around so long as its strands never pass through each other. As a closed loop, a mathematical knot has no proper ends, and cannot be undone or untied; however, any physical knot in a piece of string can be thought of as a mathematical knot by fusing the two ends. A configuration of several knots winding around each other is called a &quot;link&quot;. Various mathematical techniques are used to classify and distinguish knots and links. For instance, the Alexander polynomial associates certain numbers with any given knot; these numbers are different for the trefoil knot, the figure-eight knot, and the unknot (a simple loop), showing that one cannot be moved into the other (without strands passing through each other).

==Physical theory of friction knots==
A simple mathematical theory of hitches has been proposed by Bayman and extended by Maddocks and Keller. It makes predictions that are approximately correct when tested empirically. No similarly successful theory has been developed for knots in general.

==Knot tying==

Knot tying consists of the techniques and skills employed in tying a knot in rope, nylon webbing, or other articles. The proper tying of a knot can be the difference between an attractive knot and a messy one, and occasionally life and death. It is important to understand the often subtle differences between what works, and what does not. For example, many knots &quot;spill&quot; or pull through, particularly if they are not &quot;backed up,&quot; usually with a single or double overhand knot to make sure the end of the rope does not make its way through the main knot, causing all strength to be lost.

===Difficulty===
The tying of a knot may be very straightforward (such as with an overhand knot), or it may be more complicated, such as a monkey&#x27;s fist knot. Tying knots correctly requires an understanding of the type of material being tied (string, cord, monofilament line, kernmantle rope, or nylon webbing). For example, cotton string may be very small and easy to tie with much internal friction to keep it from falling apart once tied, while stiff 5/8&quot; thick kernmantle rope will be very difficult to tie, and may be so slick as to tend to come apart once tied.

===Material===
The form of the material will influence the tying of a knot as well. Rope is round in cross-section, and has little dependence upon the manner in which the material is tied. Nylon webbing, on the other hand, is flat, and usually &quot;tubular&quot; in construction, meaning that it is spiral-woven, and has a hollow core. In order to retain as much of the strength as possible with webbing, the material must be tied &quot;flat&quot; such that parallel sections do not cross, and that the sections of webbing are not twisted when they cross each other within a knot.

The crossing of strands is important when dealing with round rope in other knots; for example, the figure-eight loop loses strength when strands are crossed while the knot is being &quot;finished&quot; and tightened. Moreover, the standing end or the end from which the hauling will be done must have the greater radius of curvature in the finished knot to maximize the strength of the knot.

===Tools===
Tools are sometimes employed in the finishing or untying of a knot, such as a fid, a tapered piece of wood that is often used in splicing. With the advent of wire rope, many other tools are used in the tying of &quot;knots.&quot; However, for cordage and other non-metallic appliances, the tools used are generally limited to sharp edges or blades such as a sheepsfoot blade, occasionally a fine needle for proper whipping of laid rope, a hot cutter for nylon and other synthetic fibers, and (for larger ropes) a shoe for smoothing out large knots by rolling them on the ground.

==Use by animals==
The hagfish is known to strip slime from its skin by tying itself into a simple overhand knot, and moving its body to make the knot travel toward the tail. It also uses this action in reverse (tail to head) to pry out flesh after biting into a carcass.

<doc id="17011" wikidata="Q26843" url="?curid=17011" title="Orca">
<text>The orca (Orcinus orca), or killer whale, is a toothed whale and the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family. It is the only extant species in the genus &quot;Orcinus&quot; and is recognizable by its black-and-white patterned body. A cosmopolitan species, it is found in diverse marine environments, from Arctic to Antarctic regions to tropical seas.

Orcas are apex predators with a diverse diet. Individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. This includes a variety of fish, sharks, rays, and marine mammals such as seals and other dolphins and whales. They are highly social; some populations are composed of highly stable matrilineal family groups (pods). Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, often specific to a particular group and passed along from generation to generation, are considered to be manifestations of animal culture.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca&#x27;s conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more orca types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the southern resident orcas were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list.

Orcas are not usually a threat to humans, and no fatal attack has ever been documented in their natural habitat. There have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks.

==Naming==
Orcas, despite being dolphins, are commonly called &#x27;killer whales&#x27; due to a mistranslation of the Spanish &#x27;asesino de ballenas&#x27; (literally &#x27;whale killer&#x27;), reflecting their historical predation on whales. Since the 1960s, the use of &quot;orca&quot; instead of &quot;killer whale&quot; has steadily grown in common use.

Although some book introduced that &quot;Orcinus&quot; means &#x27;of the kingdom of the dead&#x27;, International Code of Zoological Nomenclature mentions that the name orca originates from Latin word &quot;orca&quot;, which means a large-bellied pot, and &quot;Orcinus&quot; is a derived word formed by adding a masculine suffix to it. Ancient Romans originally used &quot;orca&quot; ( &quot;orcae&quot;) for these animals, possibly borrowing Ancient Greek (&quot;óryx&quot;), which referred (among other things) to a whale species, perhaps a narwhal. As part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other oceanic dolphins than to other whales.

They are sometimes referred to as &#x27;blackfish&#x27;, a name also used for other whale species. &#x27;Grampus&#x27; is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of &#x27;grampus&#x27; should not be confused with the genus &quot;Grampus&quot;, whose only member is Risso&#x27;s dolphin.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Orcinus orca&quot; is the only recognized extant species in the genus &quot;Orcinus&quot;, and one of many animal species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of an orca in his &quot;Piscium &amp; aquatilium animantium natura&quot; of 1558, part of the larger &quot;Historia animalium&quot;, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.

The orca is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The orca lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences indicates that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus &quot;Orcaella&quot;. However, a more recent (2018) study places the orca as a sister taxon to the Lissodelphininae, a clade that includes &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;. In contrast, a 2019 phylogenetic study found the orca to be the second most basal member of the Delphinidae, with only the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (&quot;Leucopleurus acutus&quot;) being more basal.

===Types===
The three to five types of orcas may be distinct enough to be considered different races, subspecies, or possibly even species (see Species problem). The IUCN reported in 2008, &quot;The taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely that &quot;O. orca&quot; will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years.&quot; Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different orca groups complicate simple differentiation into types, research off the west coast of North America has identified fish-eating &quot;residents&quot;, mammal-eating &quot;transients&quot; and &quot;offshores&quot;. Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish and mammal eating orcas have been distinguished elsewhere. Mammal-eating orcas in different regions were long thought likely to be closely related, but genetic testing has refuted this hypothesis.

A 2024 study supported the elevation of Eastern North American resident and transient orcas as distinct species, &quot;O. ater&quot; and &quot;O. rectipinnus&quot; respectively. The Society for Marine Mammalogy declined to recognize the two species, citing uncertainty as to whether the types constituted unique species or subspecies. &quot;Pending a more complete global review and revision&quot;, the Society provisionally recognized them as subspecies &quot;Orcinus orca ater&quot; and &quot;O. o. rectipinnus&quot;, with &quot;O. o. orca&quot; as the nominate subspecies.

Four types have been documented in the Antarctic, Types A–D. Two dwarf species, named &quot;Orcinus nanus&quot; and &quot;Orcinus glacialis&quot;, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status. Complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups (types B and C) should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. A 2019 study of Type D orcas also found them to be distinct from other populations and possibly even a unique species.

==Characteristics==

Orcas are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from long and weigh in excess of . Females are smaller, generally ranging from and weighing about . Orcas may attain larger sizes as males have been recorded at and females at . Large males can reach a weight of over . Calves at birth weigh about and are about long. The skeleton of the orca is typical for an oceanic dolphin, but more robust.

With their distinctive pigmentation, adult orcas are seldom confused with any other species. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with false killer whales or Risso&#x27;s dolphins. The orca is mostly black but with sharply bordered white areas. The entire lower jaw is white and from here, the colouration stretches across the underside to the genital area; narrowing and expanding some, and extending into lateral flank patches close to the end. The tail fluke (fin) is also white on the underside, while the eyes have white oval-shaped patches behind and above them, and a grey or white &quot;saddle patch&quot; exists behind the dorsal fin and across the back. Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas. In newborns, the white areas are yellow or orange coloured. Antarctic orcas may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Some Antarctic orcas are brown and yellow due to diatoms in the water. Both albino and melanistic orcas have been documented.
Orca pectoral fins are large and rounded, resembling paddles, with those of males significantly larger than those of females. Dorsal fins also exhibit sexual dimorphism, with those of males about high, more than twice the size of the female&#x27;s, with the male&#x27;s fin more like an elongated isosceles triangle, whereas the female&#x27;s is more curved. In the skull, adult males have longer lower jaws than females, as well as larger occipital crests. The snout is blunt and lacks the beak of other species. The orca&#x27;s teeth are very strong, and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The firm middle and back teeth hold prey in place, while the front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward to protect them from powerful jerking movements.

Orcas have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in the water by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family. The mean body temperature of the orca is . Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from thick beneath the skin. The pulse is about 60 heartbeats per minute when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.

An individual orca can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of orcas to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into life cycles and social structures.

==Range and habitat==

Orcas are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their enormous range, numbers, and density, relative distribution is difficult to estimate, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments. Areas which serve as major study sites for the species include the coasts of Iceland, Norway, the Valdés Peninsula of Argentina, the Crozet Islands, New Zealand and parts of the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska. Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of orcas (&gt;0.40 individuals per 100 km2) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered &quot;common&quot; (0.20–0.40 individuals per 100 km2) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

In the Antarctic, orcas range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. However, orcas are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Occasionally, orcas swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented up the Columbia River in the United States. They have also been found in the Fraser River in Canada and the Horikawa River in Japan.

Migration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California.

===Population===
Worldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests a minimum of 50,000 (2006). Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250–2,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500–1,500 off Norway. Japan&#x27;s Fisheries Agency estimated in the 2000s that 2,321 orcas were in the seas around Japan.

==Feeding==
Orcas are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called &quot;wolves of the sea&quot;, because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Orcas hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles. Different populations or ecotypes may specialize, and some can have a dramatic impact on prey species. However, whales in tropical areas appear to have more generalized diets due to lower food productivity. Orcas spend most of their time at shallow depths, but occasionally dive several hundred metres depending on their prey.

===Fish===
Fish-eating orcas prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish&#x27;s autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents&#x27; diet, including 65% of large, fatty Chinook. Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, an orca eats each day. While salmon are usually hunted by an individual whale or a small group, herring are often caught using carousel feeding: the orcas force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time, then eating them one by one. Carousel feeding has been documented only in the Norwegian orca population, as well as some oceanic dolphin species.

In New Zealand, sharks and rays appear to be important prey, including eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks, basking sharks, and shortfin makos. With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. In other parts of the world, orcas have preyed on broadnose sevengill sharks, whale sharks, and even great white sharks. Competition between orcas and white sharks is probable in regions where their diets overlap. The arrival of orcas in an area can cause white sharks to flee and forage elsewhere. Orcas appear to target the liver of sharks. In one case a single orca was observed killing and eating a great white shark on its own.

===Mammals and birds===
Orcas are sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals. They are recorded to prey on other cetacean species, usually smaller dolphins and porpoises such as common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, dusky dolphins, harbour porpoises and Dall&#x27;s porpoises. While hunting these species, orcas usually have to chase them to exhaustion. For highly social species, orca pods try to separate an individual from its group. Larger groups have a better chance of preventing their prey from escaping, which is killed by being thrown around, rammed and jumped on. Arctic orcas may attack beluga whales and narwhals stuck in pools enclosed by sea ice, the former are also driven into shallower water where juveniles are grabbed. By contrast, orcas appear to be wary of pilot whales, which have been recorded to mob and chase them. Nevertheless, possible predation on long-finned pilot whales has been recorded in Iceland, and one study suggests short-finned pilot whales are among Caribbean Orcas&#x27; prey. Killer whales have been recorded attacking short-finned pilot whales in Peru as well.
Orcas also prey on larger species such as sperm whales, grey whales, humpback whales and minke whales. On three separate occasions in 2019 orcas were recorded to have killed blue whales off the south coast of Western Australia, including an estimated individual. Large whales require much effort and coordination to kill and orcas often target calves. A hunt begins with a chase followed by a violent attack on the exhausted prey. Large whales often show signs of orca attack via tooth rake marks. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. There is also evidence that humpback whales will defend against or mob orcas who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species.

Prior to the advent of industrial whaling, great whales may have been the major food source for orcas. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided orcas by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating the availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for orcas, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to the decline of these as well.
Other marine mammal prey includes seal species such as harbour seals, elephant seals, California sea lions, Steller sea lions, South American sea lions and walruses. Often, to avoid injury, orcas disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. In steeply banked beaches off Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, orcas feed on South American sea lions and southern elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young. Orcas can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. In the Antarctic, type B orcas hunt Weddell seals and other prey by &quot;wave-hunting&quot;. They &quot;spy-hop&quot; to locate them on resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other orcas lie in wait.

In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to orca predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in seal populations, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling. Orcas have been observed preying on terrestrial mammals, such as moose swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Orca cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One orca was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident orcas have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason. Some dolphins recognize resident orcas as harmless and remain in the same area.

Orcas do consume seabirds but are more likely to kill and leave them uneaten. Penguin species recorded as prey in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters include gentoo penguins, chinstrap penguins, king penguins and rockhopper penguins. Orcas in many areas may prey on cormorants and gulls. A captive orca at Marineland of Canada discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.

==Behaviour==

Day-to-day orca behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Orcas frequently engage in surface behaviour such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings. Resident orcas swim alongside porpoises and other dolphins.

Orcas will engage in surplus killing, that is, killing that is not designed to be for food. As an example, a BBC film crew witnessed orca in British Columbia playing with a male Steller sea lion to exhaustion, but not eating it.

Some orcas have been observed swimming with dead salmon on their heads, resembling hats.

===Social structure===
Orcas are notable for their complex societies. Only elephants and higher primates live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas&#x27; complex social bonds, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep them in captivity.

Resident orcas in the eastern North Pacific live in particularly complex and stable social groups. Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, an orca named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.
Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The highest association layer is the community, which consists of pods that regularly associate with each other but share no maternal relations or dialects.

Transient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become &quot;rovers&quot; and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.

As with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating orcas off Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating orcas in Argentina and the Crozet Islands behave more like transients.

Orcas of the same sex and age group may engage in physical contact and synchronous surfacing. These behaviours do not occur randomly among individuals in a pod, providing evidence of &quot;friendships&quot;.

===Vocalizations===


Like all cetaceans, orcas depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.

Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, which are insensitive to orca calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear whale calls well and thus transients are typically silent. Vocal behaviour in these whales is mainly limited to surfacing activities and milling (slow swimming with no apparent direction) after a kill.

All members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with pod members. Family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf&#x27;s birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation growing over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.

Dialects also distinguish types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore orcas have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.

Norwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting. A population that live in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica have 28 complex burst-pulse and whistle calls.

===Intelligence===

Orcas have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). Orcas have more gray matter and more cortical neurons than any mammal, including humans. They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring &quot;intelligence&quot; is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans. Orcas imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed. In March 2023, a female orca was spotted with a newborn pilot whale in Snæfellsnes.
People who have interacted closely with orcas offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales&#x27; curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan orcas have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. The tactic worked initially, but the orcas adapted quickly and split into groups.

In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild orcas playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.

The orca&#x27;s use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture.

==Life cycle==

Female orcas begin to mature at around the age of 10–13 and reach peak fertility around 20, experiencing periods of polyestrous cycling separated by non-cycling periods of three to 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, followed by a rapid decrease in fertility. Orcas are among the few animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. The lifespans of wild females average 50 to 80 years. Some are claimed to have lived substantially longer: Granny (J2) was estimated by some researchers to have been as old as 105 years at the time of her death, though a biopsy sample indicated her age as 65 to 80 years. It is thought that orcas held in captivity tend to have shorter lives than those in the wild, although this is subject to scientific debate.

Males mate with females from other pods, which prevents inbreeding. Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months. Mothers usually calve a single offspring about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37–50% of all calves die. Weaning begins at about 12 months of age, and is complete by two years. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.

Males sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia, which would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010. Orcas are unique among cetaceans, as their caudal sections elongate with age, making their heads relatively shorter.

Infanticide, once thought to occur only in captive orcas, was observed in wild populations by researchers off British Columbia on December 2, 2016. In this incident, an adult male killed the calf of a female within the same pod, with the adult male&#x27;s mother also joining in the assault. It is theorized that the male killed the young calf in order to mate with its mother (something that occurs in other carnivore species), while the male&#x27;s mother supported the breeding opportunity for her son. The attack ended when the calf&#x27;s mother struck and injured the attacking male. Such behaviour matches that of many smaller dolphin species, such as the bottlenose dolphin.

==Conservation==

In 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the orca&#x27;s conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more orca types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are the most significant worldwide threats. In January 2020, the first orca in England and Wales since 2001 was found dead with a large fragment of plastic in its stomach.

Like other animals at the highest trophic levels, the orca is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in orcas were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. A 2018 study published in &quot;Science&quot; found that global orca populations are poised to dramatically decline due such toxic pollution.

In the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. In the Puget Sound region, only 75 whales remain with few births over the last few years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.

In 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past 10 years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.

Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied orcas since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm orcas. He studied orcas from the Center for Whale Research, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was also able to study orcas from &quot;his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months&quot;. In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the orcas. The whales seemed &quot;agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water&quot; to escape the sound of the sonars. &quot;Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometres) distant, Balcomb said.&quot; The impact of sonar waves on orcas is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb&#x27;s discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.

Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along with their habitats) for orcas aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming orcas were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 orcas on the British Columbia Coast in danger.

Underwater noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key orca habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Orcas also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs orcas along with other marine mammals. Orcas are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.

The &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill adversely affected orcas in Prince William Sound and Alaska&#x27;s Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local orcas. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.

Orcas are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning international trade (including in parts/derivatives) is regulated.

==Relationship with humans==

===Indigenous cultures===

The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast feature orcas throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded orcas as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of orcas living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these stories, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw, the orca was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw mythology, orcas may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the orca as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.
The Lummi consider orca to be people, referring to them as &quot;qwe&#x27;lhol&#x27;mechen&quot; which means &quot;our relations under the waves&quot;.

The Maritime Archaic people of Newfoundland also had great respect for orcas, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial at the Port au Choix Archaeological Site.

In the tales and beliefs of the Siberian Yupik people, orcas are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as orcas in summer. Orcas are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter&#x27;s belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco or meat are strewn into the sea for them.

The Ainu people of Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, and southern Sakhalin often referred to orcas in their folklore and myth as &quot;Repun Kamuy&quot; (God of Sea/Offshore) to bring fortunes (whales) to the coasts, and there had been traditional funerals for stranded or deceased orcas akin to funerals for other animals such as brown bears.

===Attacks by wild orcas on humans and animals===
In Western cultures, orcas were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of an orca was given by Pliny the Elder &quot;circa&quot; AD 70, who wrote, &quot;Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other kinds of whale]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming.&quot; (see citation in section &quot;Naming&quot;, above).

Of the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild orcas, none have been fatal. In one instance, orcas tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs&#x27; barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the orca&#x27;s hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, but the Orca then retreated, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbour seals was bumped by an orca that apparently misidentified him as prey.

=== Orca attacks on sailboats and small vessels ===

Beginning around 2020, one or more pods of orcas began to attack sailing vessels off the southern tip of Europe, and a few were sunk. At least 15 interactions between orcas and boats off the Iberian coast were reported in 2020. According to the Atlantic Orca Working Group (GTOA) as many as 500 vessels have been damaged between 2020 and 2023. In one video, an orca can be seen biting on one of the two rudders ripped from a catamaran near Gibraltar. The captain of the vessel reported this was the second attack on a vessel under his command and the orcas focused on the rudders. &quot;Looks like they knew exactly what they are doing. They didn&#x27;t touch anything else.&quot; After an orca repeatedly rammed a vessel off the coast of Norway in 2023, there is a concern the behavior is spreading to other areas. This has led to recommendations that sailors now carry bags of sand. Dropping sand into the water near the rudder is thought to confuse the sonar signal. Experts were divided as to whether the behavior was some sort of revenge or protection response to a previous traumatic incident, or playful or frustrated attempts to get a boat&#x27;s propeller to emit a stream of high-speed water.

===Attacks on humans by captive orcas===

Unlike wild orcas, captive orcas have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.

===Human attacks on orcas===
Competition with fishermen also led to orcas being regarded as pests. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of orcas was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the orcas captured in Puget Sound for aquariums through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of orcas in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine guns, rockets, and depth charges.

===Modern Western attitudes===

Western attitudes towards orcas have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, orcas came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the live-capture and display of an orca known as Moby Doll, a southern resident orca harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. He was the first ever orca to be studied at close quarters alive, not postmortem. Moby Doll&#x27;s impact in scientific research at the time, including the first scientific studies of an orca&#x27;s sound production, led to two articles about him in the journal &quot;Zoologica&quot;. So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale&#x27;s keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, non-aggressive whale who made no attempts to attack humans.
Between 1964 and 1976, 50 orcas from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species&#x27; complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother–offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.

Bigg&#x27;s techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.

The public&#x27;s growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale–keeping in aquarium. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public&#x27;s interest in orcas has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film &quot;Free Willy&quot;, the movie&#x27;s captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland in 2002. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. Keiko however did not adapt to the harsh climate of the Arctic Ocean, and died a year into his release after contracting pneumonia, at the age of 27. In 2002, the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region&#x27;s orcas. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young orca named Luna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.

===Whaling===

The earliest known records of commercial hunting of orcas date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored orcas because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, orcas were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 orcas (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Extensive hunting of orcas, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompted the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, orcas were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.

====Cooperation with humans====
Orcas have helped humans hunting other whales. One well-known example was the orcas of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers&#x27; catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska&#x27;s Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.

===Whale watching===
Whale watching continues to increase in popularity, but may have some problematic impacts on orcas. Exposure to exhaust gases from large amounts of vessel traffic is causing concern for the overall health of the 75 remaining southern resident orcas (SRKWs) left as of early 2019. This population is followed by approximately 20 vessels for 12 hours a day during the months May–September. Researchers discovered that these vessels are in the line of sight for these whales for 98–99.5% of daylight hours. With so many vessels, the air quality around these whales deteriorates and impacts their health. Air pollutants that bind with exhaust fumes are responsible for the activation of the cytochrome P450 1A gene family. Researchers have successfully identified this gene in skin biopsies of live whales and also the lungs of deceased whales. A direct correlation between activation of this gene and the air pollutants can not be made because there are other known factors that will induce the same gene. Vessels can have either wet or dry exhaust systems, with wet exhaust systems leaving more pollutants in the water due to various gas solubility. A modelling study determined that the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) of exhaust pollutants was about 12% of the human dose.

As a response to this, in 2017 boats off the British Columbia coast now have a minimum approach distance of 200 metres compared to the previous 100 metres. This new rule complements Washington State&#x27;s minimum approach zone of 180 metres that has been in effect since 2011. If a whale approaches a vessel it must be placed in neutral until the whale passes. The World Health Organization has set air quality standards in an effort to control the emissions produced by these vessels.

===Captivity===
The orca&#x27;s intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.

Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. That said, a 2015 study coauthored by staff at SeaWorld and the Minnesota Zoo suggested no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive orcas. However, in the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales&#x27; social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild orca behaviour, see above. Wild orcas may travel up to in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known as Tilikum was involved in the death of three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film &quot;Blackfish&quot;. Tilikum lived at SeaWorld from 1992 until his death in 2017.

In March 2016, SeaWorld announced that they would be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows. However, as of 2020, theatrical shows featuring orcas are still ongoing.
