<text>The Indus ( ) is a transboundary river of Asia and a trans-Himalayan river of South and Central Asia. The river rises in mountain springs northeast of Mount Kailash in the Western Tibet region of China, flows northwest through the disputed region of Kashmir, bends sharply to the left after the Nanga Parbat massif, and flows south-by-southwest through Pakistan, before emptying into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi.

The river has a total drainage area of circa . Its estimated annual flow is around , making it one of the 50 largest rivers in the world in terms of average annual flow. Its left-bank tributary in Ladakh is the Zanskar River, and its left-bank tributary in the plains is the Panjnad River which is formed by the successive confluences of the five Punjab rivers, namely the Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers. Its principal right-bank tributaries are the Shyok, Gilgit, Kabul, Kurram, and Gomal rivers. Beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush ranges, the river supports the ecosystems of temperate forests, plains, and arid countryside.

Geologically, the headwaters of the Indus and to their east those of the Yarlung Tsangpo (later in its course, the Brahmaputra) flow along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone, which defines the boundary along which the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate in the Early Eocene (approximately 50 Million years ago). These two Eurasian rivers, whose courses were continually diverted by the rising Himalayas, define the western and eastern limits, respectively, of the mountain range. After the Indus debouches from its narrow Himalayan valley, it forms, along with its tributaries, the Punjab region of South Asia. The lower course of the river ends in a large delta in the Sindh province of Pakistan. 

Historically, the Indus was important to many cultures. The 3rd millennium BC saw the rise of Indus Valley Civilisation, a major urban civilization of the Bronze Age. During the 2nd millennium BC, the Punjab region was mentioned in the Rigveda hymns as &quot;Sapta Sindhu&quot; and in the Avesta religious texts as &quot;Hapta Həndu&quot; (both terms meaning &quot;seven rivers&quot;). Early historical kingdoms that arose in the Indus Valley include Gandhāra, and the Ror dynasty of Sauvīra. The Indus River came into the knowledge of the Western world early in the classical period, when King Darius of Persia sent his Greek subject Scylax of Caryanda to explore the river, .

== Etymology and names ==
Etymologically, English language word &quot;Indus&quot; comes from Late Latin Indus (1598), specifically a use of classical Latin &quot;Indus&quot; (inhabitant of India, Indian) from ancient Greek Ἰνδός &quot;inhabitant of India, Indian, the River Indus&quot; from Achaemenian Old Persian &quot;hindu,&quot; denoting an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire (Persian language &quot;hind&quot; India), and Avestan &quot;hiṇdu&quot;, &quot;həṇdu&quot; &quot;river,&quot; (natural) frontier; with same Proto Indo-Iranian language-root as Sanskrit sindhu (river), specifically the River Indus; hence also the region of the Indus, the province Sindh (which also developed into Hellenistic Greek Σίνθος (&quot;the River Indus&quot;). This river&#x27;s traditional name in Sanskrit and Tibetan is &quot;sindhu&quot;. In Sanskrit, its range of meanings includes: stream, river; Indus; flood; sea or ocean; region or country in the vicinity of the Indus, Sindh, people of Sindh.&quot;

The modern name in Urdu is &quot;Sindh&quot; () or &quot;Daryā-i-Sindh&quot; (), contrasting to the Province of Sindh (). The Ladakhis and Tibetans call the river &quot;Senge Tsangpo&quot; (སེང་གེ་གཙང་པོ།), Baltis call it &quot;Gemtsuh&quot; and &quot;Tsuh-Fo&quot;, Pashtuns call it &quot;Nilab&quot;, &quot;Sher Darya&quot; and &quot;Abbasin&quot;, while Sindhis call it &quot;Sindhu&quot;, &quot;Mehran&quot;, &quot;Purali&quot; and &quot;Samundar&quot;.

==Description==
The Indus River provides key water resources for Pakistan&#x27;s economy – especially the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of Punjab province, which accounts for most of the nation&#x27;s agricultural production, and Sindh. The word Punjab means &quot;land of five rivers&quot; and the five rivers are Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, all of which finally flow into the Indus. The Indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in Pakistan.

The total length of the river varies in different sources. The length used in this article is , taken from the &quot;Himalayan Climate and Water Atlas&quot; (2015). Historically, the 1909 &quot;The Imperial Gazetteer of India&quot; gave it as &quot;just over 1,800 miles&quot;. A shorter figure of has been widely used in modern sources, as has the one of . The modern &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; was originally published in 1999 with the shorter measurement, but was updated in 2015 to use the longer measurement. Both lengths are commonly found in modern publications; in some cases, both measurements can be found within the same work. An extended figure of circa was announced by a Chinese research group in 2011, based on a comprehensive remeasurement from satellite imagery, and a ground expedition to identify an alternative source point, but detailed analysis has not yet been published.

The ultimate source of the Indus is in Tibet, but there is some debate about the exact source. The traditional source of the river is the &quot;Sênggê Kanbab&quot; (Sênggê Zangbo) or &quot;Lion&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, a perennial spring not far from the sacred Mount Kailash, marked by a long low line of Tibetan chortens. There are several other tributaries nearby, which may form a longer stream than Sênggê Kanbab, but unlike the Sênggê Kanbab, are all dependent on snowmelt. The Zanskar River, which flows into the Indus in Ladakh, has a greater volume of water than the Indus itself before that point. An alternative reckoning begins the river around 300 km further upstream, at the confluence of the &quot;Sênggê&quot; Zangbo and Gar Tsangpo rivers, which drain the Nganglong Kangri and Gangdise Shan (Gang Rinpoche, Mt. Kailash) mountain ranges. The 2011 remeasurement suggested the source was a small lake northeast of Mount Kailash, rather than either of the two points previously used.

The Indus then flows northwest through Ladakh (Indian-administered Kashmir) and Baltistan and Gilgit (Pakistan-administered Kashmir), just south of the Karakoram range. The Shyok, Shigar and Gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river. It gradually bends to the south and descends into the Punjab plains at Kalabagh, Pakistan. The Indus passes gigantic gorges deep near the Nanga Parbat massif. It flows swiftly across Hazara and is dammed at the Tarbela Reservoir. The Kabul River joins it near Attock. The remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab and Sindh, where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided. It is joined by the Panjnad at Mithankot. Beyond this confluence, the river, at one time, was named the &quot;Satnad River&quot; (&quot;sat&quot; = &quot;seven&quot;, &quot;nadī&quot; = &quot;river&quot;), as the river now carried the waters of the Kabul River, the Indus River and the five Punjab rivers. Passing by Jamshoro, it ends in a large delta to the South of Thatta in the Sindh province of Pakistan.

The Indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore. The Indus system is largely fed by the snow and glaciers of the Himalayas, Karakoram and the Hindu Kush ranges. The flow of the river is also determined by the seasons – it diminishes greatly in the winter while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from July to September. There is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times – it deviated westwards from flowing into the Rann of Kutch and adjoining Banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake. , Indus water flows in to the Rann of Kutch during its floods breaching flood banks.

==History==
The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300 BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world. The Indus Valley Civilisation extended from across northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and northwest India, with an upward reach from east of the Jhelum River to Ropar on the upper Sutlej. The coastal settlements extended from Sutkagan Dor at the Pakistan-Iran border to Kutch in modern Gujarat, India. There is an Indus site on the Amu Darya at Shortughai in northern Afghanistan, and the Indus site Alamgirpur at the Hindon River is located only from Delhi. As of now, over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found, mainly in the general region of the Ghaggar-Hakra River and its tributaries. Among the settlements were the major urban centres of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, as well as Lothal, Dholavira, Ganeriwala, and Rakhigarhi. Only 40 Indus Valley sites have been discovered on the Indus and its tributaries. However, it is notable that majority of the Indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered were found at sites along the Indus river.

Most scholars believe that settlements of Gandhara grave culture of the early Indo-Aryans flourished in Gandhara from 1700 BC to 600 BC, when Mohenjo-daro and Harappa had already been abandoned.

The Rigveda describes several rivers, including one named &quot;Sindhu&quot;. The Rigvedic &quot;Sindhu&quot; is thought to be the present-day Indus River. It is attested 176 times in its text, 94 times in the plural, and most often used in the generic sense of &quot;river&quot;. In the Rigveda, notably in the later hymns, the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the Indus river in particular; for example, in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of &quot;Nadistuti sukta&quot;. The Rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein, except for the Brahmaputra.

The word &quot;India&quot; is derived from the Indus River. In ancient times, &quot;India&quot; initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the Indus, where are Punjab and Sindh now but by 300 BC, Greek writers including Herodotus and Megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.

The lower basin of the Indus forms a natural boundary between the Iranian Plateau and the Indian subcontinent; this region embraces all or parts of the Pakistani provinces Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh and the countries Afghanistan and India. The first West Eurasian empire to annex the Indus Valley was the Persian Empire, during the reign of Darius the Great. During his reign, the Greek explorer Scylax of Caryanda was commissioned to explore the course of the Indus. It was crossed by the invading armies of Alexander. Still, after his Macedonians conquered the west bank—joining it to the Hellenic world, they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river, ending Alexander&#x27;s Asian campaign. Alexander&#x27;s admiral Nearchus set out from the Indus Delta to explore the Persian Gulf, until reaching the Tigris. The Indus Valley was later dominated by the Mauryan and Kushan Empires, Indo-Greek Kingdoms, Indo-Scythians and Hepthalites. Over several centuries Muslim armies of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad of Ghor, Timur and Babur crossed the river to invade Sindh and Punjab, providing a gateway to the Indian subcontinent.

==Geology==
Indus is an antecedent river, meaning that it existed before the Himalayas and entrenched itself while they were rising.

The Indus River feeds the Indus submarine fan, which is the second largest sediment body on Earth. It consists of around 5 million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains. Studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the Karakoram Mountains in northern Pakistan and India are the single most important source of material, with the Himalayas providing the next largest contribution, mostly via the large rivers of the Punjab (Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas and Sutlej). Analysis of sediments from the Arabian Sea has demonstrated that before five million years ago the Indus was not connected to these Punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the Ganga and were captured after that time. Earlier work showed that sand and silt from western Tibet was reaching the Arabian Sea by 45 million years ago, implying the existence of an ancient Indus River by that time. The delta of this proto-Indus river has subsequently been found in the Katawaz Basin, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.

In the Nanga Parbat region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area are thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.

In November 2011, satellite images showed that the Indus river had re-entered India and was feeding the Great Rann of Kutch, Little Rann of Kutch and a lake near Ahmedabad known as Nal Sarovar. Heavy rains had left the river basin along with the Lake Manchar, Lake Hemal and Kalri Lake (all in modern-day Pakistan) inundated. This happened two centuries after the Indus river shifted its course westwards following the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake.

The Induan Age at the start of the Triassic Period of geological time is named for the Indus region.

==Wildlife==

Accounts of the Indus valley from the times of Alexander&#x27;s campaign indicate a healthy forest cover in the region. The Mughal Emperor Babur writes of encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs (the Baburnama). Extensive deforestation and human interference in the ecology of the Shivalik Hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions. The Indus valley regions are arid with poor vegetation. Agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works.
The Indus river and its watershed have a rich biodiversity. It is home to around 25 amphibian species.

===Mammals===
The Indus river dolphin (&quot;Platanista indicus minor&quot;) is found only in the Indus River. It is a subspecies of the South Asian river dolphin. The Indus river dolphin formerly also occurred in the tributaries of the Indus river. According to the World Wildlife Fund it is one of the most threatened cetaceans with only about 1,816 still existing. It is threatened by habitat degradation from the construction of dams and canals, entanglement in fishing gear, and industrial water pollution.

There are two otter species in the Indus River basin: the Eurasian otter in the northeastern highland sections and the smooth-coated otter elsewhere in the river basin. The smooth-coated otters in the Indus River represent a subspecies found nowhere else, the Sindh otter (&quot;Lutrogale perspicillata sindica&quot;).

===Fish===
The Indus River basin has high diversity, being the home of more than 180 freshwater fish species, including 22 which are found nowhere else. Fish also played a major role in earlier cultures of the region, including the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation where depictions of fish were frequent. The Indus script has a commonly used fish sign, which in its various forms may simply have meant &quot;fish&quot;, or referred to stars or gods.

In the uppermost, highest part of the Indus River basin there are relatively few genera and species: &quot;Diptychus&quot;, &quot;Ptychobarbus&quot;, &quot;Schizopyge&quot;, &quot;Schizopygopsis&quot; and &quot;Schizothorax&quot; snowtrout, &quot;Triplophysa&quot; loaches, and the catfish &quot;Glyptosternon reticulatum&quot;. Going downstream these are soon joined by the golden mahseer &quot;Tor putitora&quot; (alternatively &quot;T. macrolepis&quot;, although it often is regarded as a synonym of &quot;T. putitora&quot;) and &quot;Schistura&quot; loaches. Downriver from around Thakot, Tarbela, the Kabul–Indus river confluence, Attock Khurd and Peshawar the diversity rises strongly, including many cyprinids (&quot;Amblypharyngodon&quot;, &quot;Aspidoparia&quot;, &quot;Barilius&quot;, &quot;Chela&quot;, &quot;Cirrhinus&quot;, &quot;Crossocheilus&quot;, &quot;Cyprinion&quot;, &quot;Danio&quot;, &quot;Devario&quot;, &quot;Esomus&quot;, &quot;Garra&quot;, &quot;Labeo&quot;, &quot;Naziritor&quot;, &quot;Osteobrama&quot;, &quot;Pethia&quot;, &quot;Puntius&quot;, &quot;Rasbora&quot;, &quot;Salmophasia&quot;, &quot;Securicula&quot; and &quot;Systomus&quot;), true loaches (&quot;Botia&quot; and &quot;Lepidocephalus&quot;), stone loaches (&quot;Acanthocobitis&quot; and &quot;Nemacheilus&quot;), ailiid catfish (&quot;Clupisoma&quot;), bagridae catfish (&quot;Batasio&quot;, &quot;Mystus&quot;, &quot;Rita&quot; and &quot;Sperata&quot;), airsac catfish (&quot;Heteropneustes&quot;), schilbid catfish (&quot;Eutropiichthys&quot;), silurid catfish (&quot;Ompok&quot; and &quot;Wallago&quot;), sisorid catfish (&quot;Bagarius&quot;, &quot;Gagata&quot;, &quot;Glyptothorax&quot; and &quot;Sisor&quot;), gouramis (&quot;Trichogaster&quot;), nandid leaffish (&quot;Nandus&quot;), snakeheads (&quot;Channa&quot;), spiny eel (&quot;Macrognathus&quot; and &quot;Mastacembelus&quot;), knifefish (&quot;Notopterus&quot;), glassfish (&quot;Chanda&quot; and &quot;Parambassis&quot;), clupeids (&quot;Gudusia&quot;), needlefish (&quot;Xenentodon&quot;) and gobies (&quot;Glossogobius&quot;), as well as a few introduced species. As the altitude further declines the Indus basin becomes overall quite slow-flowing as it passes through the Punjab Plain. Major carp become common, and chameleonfish (&quot;Badis&quot;), mullet (&quot;Sicamugil&quot;) and swamp eel (&quot;Monopterus&quot;) appear. In some upland lakes and tributaries of the Punjab region snow trout and mahseer are still common, but once the Indus basin reaches its lower plain the former group is absent and the latter are rare. Many of the species of the middle sections of the Indus basin are also present in the lower. Notable examples of genera that are present in the lower plain but generally not elsewhere in the Indus River basin are the &quot;Aphanius&quot; pupfish, &quot;Aplocheilus&quot; killifish, palla fish (&quot;Tenualosa ilisha&quot;), catla (&quot;Labeo catla&quot;), rohu (&quot;Labeo rohita&quot;) and &quot;Cirrhinus mrigala&quot;. The lowermost part of the river and its delta are home to freshwater fish, but also several brackish and marine species. This includes pomfret and prawns. The large delta has been recognized by conservationists as an important ecological region. Here, the river turns into many marshes, streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels.

Palla fish (&quot;Tenualosa ilisha&quot;) of the river is a delicacy for people living along the river. The population of fish in the river is moderately high, with Sukkur, Thatta, and Kotri being the major fishing centres – all in the lower Sindh course. As a result, damming and irrigation have made fish farming an important economic activity.

==Economy==

The Indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the Punjab and Sindh plains – it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in Pakistan. The river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower Indus valley. Irrigation canals were first built by the people of the Indus Valley civilisation, and later by the engineers of the Kushan Empire and the Mughal Empire. Modern irrigation was introduced by the British East India Company in 1850 – the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals. The British supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world. The Guddu Barrage is long – irrigating Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana and Kalat. The Sukkur Barrage serves over .

After Pakistan came into existence, a water control treaty signed between India and Pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that Pakistan would receive water from the Indus River and its two tributaries the Jhelum River and the Chenab River independently of upstream control by India.

The Indus Basin Project consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams, the Mangla Dam built on the Jhelum River and the Tarbela Dam constructed on the Indus River, together with their subsidiary dams. The Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority undertook the construction of the Chashma-Jhelum link canal – linking the waters of the Indus and Jhelum rivers – extending water supplies to the regions of Bahawalpur and Multan. Pakistan constructed the Tarbela Dam near Rawalpindi – standing long and high, with an long reservoir. It supports the Chashma Barrage near Dera Ismail Khan for irrigation use and flood control and the Taunsa Barrage near Dera Ghazi Khan which also produces 100,000 kilowatts of electricity. The Kotri Barrage near Hyderabad is long and provides additional water supplies for Karachi. The extensive linking of tributaries with the Indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of Peshawar, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for Pakistan&#x27;s large production of crops such as cotton, sugarcane and wheat. The dams also generate electricity for heavy industries and urban centres.

==People==

The Indus River is sacred to Hindus. The Sindhu Darshan Festival is held on every Guru Purnima on the banks of the Indus.

The ethnicities of the Indus Valley (Pakistan and Northwest India) have a greater amount of ANI (or West Eurasian) admixture than other South Asians, including inputs from Western Steppe Herders, with evidence of more sustained and multi-layered migrations from the west.

==Modern issues==
===Indus delta===

Originally, the delta used to receive almost all of the water from the Indus River, which has an annual flow of approximately , and is accompanied by of silt. Since the 1940s, dams, barrages and irrigation works have been constructed on the river. The Indus Basin Irrigation System is the &quot;largest contiguous irrigation system developed over the past 140 years&quot; anywhere in the world. This has reduced the flow of water and by 2018, the average annual flow of water below the Kotri barrage was , and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated at . As a result, the 2010 Pakistan floods were considered &quot;good news&quot; for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much-needed fresh water. Any further utilization of the river basin water is not economically feasible.

Vegetation and wildlife of the Indus delta are threatened by the reduced inflow of fresh water, along with extensive deforestation, industrial pollution and global warming. Damming has also isolated the delta population of Indus River dolphins from those further upstream.

Large-scale diversion of the river&#x27;s water for irrigation has raised far-reaching issues. Sediment clogging from poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation on numerous occasions. Irrigation itself is increasing soil salinization, reducing crop yields and in some cases rendering farmland useless for cultivation.

===Effects of climate change on the river===
The Tibetan Plateau contains the world&#x27;s third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, said the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term, but issued a strong warning:

Temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in China, and the Tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world... In the short term, this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows... In the long run, the glaciers are vital lifelines of the Indus River. Once they vanish, water supplies in Pakistan will be in peril.

&quot;There is insufficient data to say what will happen to the Indus,&quot; says David Grey, the World Bank&#x27;s senior water advisor in South Asia. &quot;But we all have very nasty fears that the flows of the Indus could be severely, severely affected by glacier melt as a consequence of climate change,&quot; and reduced by perhaps as much as 50 per cent. &quot;Now what does that mean to a population that lives in a desert [where], without the river, there would be no life? I don&#x27;t know the answer to that question,&quot; he says. &quot;But we need to be concerned about that. Deeply, deeply concerned.&quot;

U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke said, shortly before he died in 2010, that he believed that falling water levels in the Indus River &quot;could very well precipitate World War III.&quot;

===Pollution===
Over the years factories on the banks of the Indus River have increased levels of water pollution in the river and the atmosphere around it. High levels of pollutants in the river have led to the deaths of endangered Indus river dolphin. The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency has ordered polluting factories around the river to shut down under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997. Death of the Indus river dolphin has also been attributed to fishermen using poison to kill fish and scooping them up. As a result, the government banned fishing from Guddu Barrage to Sukkur.

The Indus is second among a group of ten rivers responsible for about 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans. The Yangtze is the only river contributing more plastic.

===2010 floods===
Frequently, Indus River is prone to moderate to severe flooding. In July 2010, following abnormally heavy monsoon rains, the Indus River rose above its banks and started flooding. The rain continued for the next two months, devastating large areas of Pakistan. In Sindh, the Indus burst its banks near Sukkur on 8 August, submerging the village of Mor Khan Jatoi. In early August, the heaviest flooding moved southward along the Indus River from severely affected northern regions toward western Punjab, where at least of cropland was destroyed, and the southern province of Sindh. , over two thousand people had died and over a million homes had been destroyed since the flooding began.

===2011 floods===

The 2011 Sindh floods began during the Pakistani monsoon season in mid-August 2011, resulting from heavy monsoon rains in Sindh, eastern Balochistan, and southern Punjab. The floods caused considerable damage; an estimated 434 civilians were killed, with 5.3 million people and 1,524,773 homes affected. Sindh is a fertile region and often called the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the country; the damage and toll of the floods on the local agrarian economy was said to be extensive. At least of arable land were inundated. The flooding followed the previous year&#x27;s floods, which devastated a large part of the country. Unprecedented torrential monsoon rains caused severe flooding in 16 districts of Sindh.

==Barrages, bridges, levees and dams==

In Pakistan currently there are six barrages on the Indus: Guddu Barrage, Sukkur Barrage, Kotri Barrage (also called Ghulam Muhammad barrage), Taunsa Barrage, Chashma Barrage and Jinnah Barrage. Another new barrage called &quot;Sindh Barrage&quot; is planned as a terminal barrage on the Indus River. There are some bridges on River Indus, such as Dadu Moro Bridge, Larkana Khairpur Indus River Bridge, Thatta-Sujawal bridge, Jhirk-Mula Katiar bridge and recently planned Kandhkot-Ghotki bridge.

The entire left bank of Indus river in Sind province is protected from river flooding by constructing around 600 km long levees. The right bank side is also leveed from Guddu barrage to Lake Manchar. In response to the levees construction, the river has been aggrading rapidly over the last 20 years leading to breaches upstream of barrages and inundation of large areas.

Tarbela Dam in Pakistan is constructed on the Indus River, while the controversial Kalabagh dam is also being constructed on Indus river. Pakistan is also building Munda Dam.

<text>In mathematics, integer factorization is the decomposition of a positive integer into a product of integers. Every positive integer greater than 1 is either the product of two or more integer factors greater than 1, in which case it is a composite number, or it is not, in which case it is a prime number. For example, is a composite number because , but is a prime number because it cannot be decomposed in this way. If one of the factors is composite, it can in turn be written as a product of smaller factors, for example . Continuing this process until every factor is prime is called prime factorization; the result is always unique up to the order of the factors by the prime factorization theorem.

To factorize a small integer using mental or pen-and-paper arithmetic, the simplest method is trial division: checking if the number is divisible by prime numbers , , , and so on, up to the square root of . For larger numbers, especially when using a computer, various more sophisticated factorization algorithms are more efficient. A prime factorization algorithm typically involves testing whether each factor is prime each time a factor is found.

When the numbers are sufficiently large, no efficient non-quantum integer factorization algorithm is known. However, it has not been proven that such an algorithm does not exist. The presumed difficulty of this problem is important for the algorithms used in cryptography such as RSA public-key encryption and the RSA digital signature. Many areas of mathematics and computer science have been brought to bear on this problem, including elliptic curves, algebraic number theory, and quantum computing.

Not all numbers of a given length are equally hard to factor. The hardest instances of these problems (for currently known techniques) are semiprimes, the product of two prime numbers. When they are both large, for instance more than two thousand bits long, randomly chosen, and about the same size (but not too close, for example, to avoid efficient factorization by Fermat&#x27;s factorization method), even the fastest prime factorization algorithms on the fastest classical computers can take enough time to make the search impractical; that is, as the number of digits of the integer being factored increases, the number of operations required to perform the factorization on any classical computer increases drastically.

Many cryptographic protocols are based on the presumed difficulty of factoring large composite integers or a related problem—for example, the RSA problem. An algorithm that efficiently factors an arbitrary integer would render RSA-based public-key cryptography insecure.

== Prime decomposition ==

By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. (By convention, 1 is the empty product.) Testing whether the integer is prime can be done in polynomial time, for example, by the AKS primality test. If composite, however, the polynomial time tests give no insight into how to obtain the factors.

Given a general algorithm for integer factorization, any integer can be factored into its constituent prime factors by repeated application of this algorithm. The situation is more complicated with special-purpose factorization algorithms, whose benefits may not be realized as well or even at all with the factors produced during decomposition. For example, if where are very large primes, trial division will quickly produce the factors 3 and 19 but will take divisions to find the next factor. As a contrasting example, if is the product of the primes , , and , where , Fermat&#x27;s factorization method will begin with which immediately yields and hence the factors and . While these are easily recognized as composite and prime respectively, Fermat&#x27;s method will take much longer to factor the composite number because the starting value of for is a factor of 10 from .

== Current state of the art ==
Among the -bit numbers, the most difficult to factor in practice using existing algorithms are those semiprimes whose factors are of similar size. For this reason, these are the integers used in cryptographic applications.

In 2019, a 240-digit (795-bit) number (RSA-240) was factored by a team of researchers including Paul Zimmermann, utilizing approximately 900 core-years of computing power. These researchers estimated that a 1024-bit RSA modulus would take about 500 times as long.

The largest such semiprime yet factored was RSA-250, an 829-bit number with 250 decimal digits, in February 2020. The total computation time was roughly 2700 core-years of computing using Intel Xeon Gold 6130 at 2.1 GHz. Like all recent factorization records, this factorization was completed with a highly optimized implementation of the general number field sieve run on hundreds of machines.

=== Time complexity ===

No algorithm has been published that can factor all integers in polynomial time, that is, that can factor a -bit number in time for some constant . Neither the existence nor non-existence of such algorithms has been proved, but it is generally suspected that they do not exist.

There are published algorithms that are faster than for all positive , that is, sub-exponential. , the algorithm with best theoretical asymptotic running time is the general number field sieve (GNFS), first published in 1993, running on a -bit number in time:
: formula_1

For current computers, GNFS is the best published algorithm for large (more than about 400 bits). For a quantum computer, however, Peter Shor discovered an algorithm in 1994 that solves it in polynomial time. Shor&#x27;s algorithm takes only time and space on -bit number inputs. In 2001, Shor&#x27;s algorithm was implemented for the first time, by using NMR techniques on molecules that provide seven qubits.

In order to talk about complexity classes such as P, NP, and co-NP, the problem has to be stated as a decision problem.

It is known to be in both NP and co-NP, meaning that both &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of &quot;yes&quot; can be certified by exhibiting a factorization with . An answer of &quot;no&quot; can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of into distinct primes, all larger than ; one can verify their primality using the AKS primality test, and then multiply them to obtain . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees that there is only one possible string of increasing primes that will be accepted, which shows that the problem is in both UP and co-UP. It is known to be in BQP because of Shor&#x27;s algorithm.

The problem is suspected to be outside all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and co-NP-complete.
It is therefore a candidate for the NP-intermediate complexity class.

In contrast, the decision problem &quot;Is a composite number?&quot; (or equivalently: &quot;Is a prime number?&quot;) appears to be much easier than the problem of specifying factors of . The composite/prime problem can be solved in polynomial time (in the number of digits of ) with the AKS primality test. In addition, there are several probabilistic algorithms that can test primality very quickly in practice if one is willing to accept a vanishingly small possibility of error. The ease of primality testing is a crucial part of the RSA algorithm, as it is necessary to find large prime numbers to start with.

== Factoring algorithms ==

=== Special-purpose ===
A special-purpose factoring algorithm&#x27;s running time depends on the properties of the number to be factored or on one of its unknown factors: size, special form, etc. The parameters which determine the running time vary among algorithms.

An important subclass of special-purpose factoring algorithms is the &quot;Category 1&quot; or &quot;First Category&quot; algorithms, whose running time depends on the size of smallest prime factor. Given an integer of unknown form, these methods are usually applied before general-purpose methods to remove small factors. For example, naive trial division is a Category 1 algorithm.

* Trial division
* Wheel factorization
* Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm, which has two common flavors to identify group cycles: one by Floyd and one by Brent.
* Algebraic-group factorization algorithms, among which are Pollard&#x27;s algorithm, Williams&#x27; algorithm, and Lenstra elliptic curve factorization
* Fermat&#x27;s factorization method
* Euler&#x27;s factorization method
* Special number field sieve
* Difference of two squares

=== General-purpose ===
A general-purpose factoring algorithm, also known as a &quot;Category 2&quot;, &quot;Second Category&quot;, or &quot;Kraitchik&quot; &quot;family&quot; algorithm, has a running time which depends solely on the size of the integer to be factored. This is the type of algorithm used to factor RSA numbers. Most general-purpose factoring algorithms are based on the congruence of squares method.

* Dixon&#x27;s factorization method
* Continued fraction factorization (CFRAC)
* Quadratic sieve
* Rational sieve
* General number field sieve
* Shanks&#x27;s square forms factorization (SQUFOF)

=== Other notable algorithms ===
* Shor&#x27;s algorithm, for quantum computers

== Heuristic running time ==
In number theory, there are many integer factoring algorithms that heuristically have expected running time
: formula_2
in little-o and L-notation.
Some examples of those algorithms are the elliptic curve method and the quadratic sieve.
Another such algorithm is the class group relations method proposed by Schnorr, Seysen, and Lenstra, which they proved only assuming the unproved generalized Riemann hypothesis.

== Rigorous running time ==
The Schnorr–Seysen–Lenstra probabilistic algorithm has been rigorously proven by Lenstra and Pomerance to have expected running time by replacing the GRH assumption with the use of multipliers.
The algorithm uses the class group of positive binary quadratic forms of discriminant denoted by .
 is the set of triples of integers in which those integers are relative prime.

=== Schnorr–Seysen–Lenstra algorithm ===
Given an integer that will be factored, where is an odd positive integer greater than a certain constant. In this factoring algorithm the discriminant is chosen as a multiple of , , where is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one there exist enough smooth forms in . Lenstra and Pomerance show that the choice of can be restricted to a small set to guarantee the smoothness result.

Denote by the set of all primes with Kronecker symbol . By constructing a set of generators of and prime forms of with in a sequence of relations between the set of generators and are produced.
The size of can be bounded by for some constant .

The relation that will be used is a relation between the product of powers that is equal to the neutral element of . These relations will be used to construct a so-called ambiguous form of , which is an element of of order dividing 2. By calculating the corresponding factorization of and by taking a gcd, this ambiguous form provides the complete prime factorization of . This algorithm has these main steps:

Let be the number to be factored.
 x^{r(x)}\right).\left(\prod_{q \in P_\Delta} f^{t(q)}_{q}\right) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
| Construct an ambiguous form that is an element of order dividing 2 to obtain a coprime factorization of the largest odd divisor of in which or or .
| If the ambiguous form provides a factorization of then stop, otherwise find another ambiguous form until the factorization of is found. In order to prevent useless ambiguous forms from generating, build up the 2-Sylow group of .
To obtain an algorithm for factoring any positive integer, it is necessary to add a few steps to this algorithm such as trial division, and the Jacobi sum test.

=== Expected running time ===
The algorithm as stated is a probabilistic algorithm as it makes random choices. Its expected running time is at most .

<text>The imperial system of units, imperial system or imperial units (also known as British Imperial or Exchequer Standards of 1826) is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act 1824 and continued to be developed through a series of Weights and Measures Acts and amendments.

The imperial system developed from earlier English units as did the related but differing system of customary units of the United States. The imperial units replaced the Winchester Standards, which were in effect from 1588 to 1825. The system came into official use across the British Empire in 1826.

By the late 20th century, most nations of the former empire had officially adopted the metric system as their main system of measurement, but imperial units are still used alongside metric units in the United Kingdom and in some other parts of the former empire, notably Canada.

The modern UK legislation defining the imperial system of units is given in the Weights and Measures Act 1985 (as amended).

==Implementation==
The Weights and Measures Act 1824 was initially scheduled to go into effect on 1 May 1825. The Weights and Measures Act 1825 pushed back the date to 1 January 1826. The 1824 act allowed the continued use of pre-imperial units provided that they were customary, widely known, and clearly marked with imperial equivalents.

===Apothecaries&#x27; units===
Apothecaries&#x27; units are not mentioned in the acts of 1824 and 1825. At the time, apothecaries&#x27; weights and measures were regulated &quot;in England, Wales, and Berwick-upon-Tweed&quot; by the London College of Physicians, and in Ireland by the Dublin College of Physicians. In Scotland, apothecaries&#x27; units were unofficially regulated by the Edinburgh College of Physicians. The three colleges published, at infrequent intervals, pharmacopoeias, the London and Dublin editions having the force of law.

Imperial apothecaries&#x27; measures, based on the imperial pint of 20 fluid ounces, were introduced by the publication of the &quot;London Pharmacopoeia&quot; of 1836, the &quot;Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia&quot; of 1839, and the &quot;Dublin Pharmacopoeia&quot; of 1850. The Medical Act 1858 transferred to the Crown the right to publish the official pharmacopoeia and to regulate apothecaries&#x27; weights and measures.

==Units==

===Length===
Metric equivalents in this article usually assume the latest official definition. Before this date, the most precise measurement of the imperial Standard Yard was metres.
===Area===
=== Volume ===

The Weights and Measures Act 1824 invalidated the various different gallons in use in the British Empire, declaring them to be replaced by the statute gallon (which became known as the imperial gallon), a unit close in volume to the ale gallon. The 1824 act defined as the volume of a gallon to be that of of distilled water weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at at a temperature of . The 1824 act went on to give this volume as . The Weights and Measures Act 1963 refined this definition to be the volume of 10 pounds of distilled water of density weighed in air of density against weights of density , which works out to . The Weights and Measures Act 1985 defined a gallon to be exactly (approximately ).

====British apothecaries&#x27; volume measures====
These measurements were in use from 1826, when the new imperial gallon was defined. For pharmaceutical purposes, they were replaced by the metric system in the United Kingdom on 1 January 1971. In the US, though no longer recommended, the apothecaries&#x27; system is still used occasionally in medicine, especially in prescriptions for older medications.
=== Mass and weight ===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the UK used three different systems for mass and weight.

* troy weight, used for precious metals;
* avoirdupois weight, used for most other purposes; and
* apothecaries&#x27; weight, now virtually unused since the metric system is used for all scientific purposes.

The distinction between mass and weight is not always clearly drawn. Strictly a pound is a unit of mass, but it is commonly referred to as a weight. When a distinction is necessary, the term &quot;pound-force&quot; may refer to a unit of force rather than mass. The troy pound () was made the primary unit of mass by the Weights and Measures Act 1824 and its use was abolished in the UK on 1 January 1879, with only the troy ounce () and its decimal subdivisions retained. The Weights and Measures Act 1855 made the avoirdupois pound the primary unit of mass. In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the pound, and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it.

== Natural equivalents ==
The 1824 Act of Parliament defined the yard and pound by reference to the prototype standards, and it also defined the values of certain physical constants, to make provision for re-creation of the standards if they were to be damaged. For the yard, the length of a pendulum beating seconds at the latitude of Greenwich at Mean Sea Level &quot;in vacuo&quot; was defined as inches. For the pound, the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water at an atmospheric pressure of 30 inches of mercury and a temperature of 62° Fahrenheit was defined as 252.458 grains, with there being 7,000 grains per pound.

Following the destruction of the original prototypes in the 1834 Houses of Parliament fire, it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions, and a new Weights and Measures Act 1855 was passed which permitted the recreation of the prototypes from recognized secondary standards.

== Current use ==
=== United Kingdom ===
Since the Weights and Measures Act 1985, British law defines base imperial units in terms of their metric equivalent. The metric system is routinely used in business and technology within the United Kingdom, with imperial units remaining in widespread use amongst the public. All UK roads use the imperial system except for weight limits, and newer height or width restriction signs give metric alongside imperial.
Traders in the UK may accept requests from customers specified in imperial units, and scales which display in both unit systems are commonplace in the retail trade. Metric price signs may be accompanied by imperial price signs provided that the imperial signs are no larger and no more prominent than the metric ones.

The United Kingdom completed its official partial transition to the metric system in 1995, with imperial units still legally mandated for certain applications such as draught beer and cider, and road-signs. Therefore, the speedometers on vehicles sold in the UK must be capable of displaying miles per hour. Even though the troy pound was outlawed in the UK in the Weights and Measures Act 1878, the &quot;troy ounce&quot; may still be used for the weights of precious stones and metals. The original railways (many built in the Victorian era) are a big user of imperial units, with distances officially measured in miles and yards or miles and chains, and also feet and inches, and speeds are in miles per hour.

Some British people still use one or more imperial units in everyday life for distance (miles, yards, feet, and inches) and some types of volume measurement (especially milk and beer in pints; rarely for canned or bottled soft drinks, or petrol). , many British people also still use imperial units in everyday life for body weight (stones and pounds for adults, pounds and ounces for babies). Government documents aimed at the public may give body weight and height in imperial units as well as in metric. A survey in 2015 found that many people did not know their body weight or height in both systems. As of 2017, people under the age of 40 preferred the metric system but people aged 40 and over preferred the imperial system. As in other English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States, the height of horses is usually measured in hands, standardised to . Fuel consumption for vehicles is commonly stated in miles per gallon (mpg), though official figures always include litres per equivalents and fuel is sold in litres. When sold draught in licensed premises, beer and cider must be sold in pints, half-pints or third-pints. Cow&#x27;s milk is available in both litre- and pint-based containers in supermarkets and shops. Areas of land associated with farming, forestry and real estate are commonly advertised in acres and square feet but, for contracts and land registration purposes, the units are always hectares and square metres.

Office space and industrial units are usually advertised in square feet. Steel pipe sizes are sold in increments of inches, while copper pipe is sold in increments of millimetres. Road bicycles have their frames measured in centimetres, while off-road bicycles have their frames measured in inches. Display sizes for screens on television sets and computer monitors are always diagonally measured in inches. Food sold by length or width, e.g. pizzas or sandwiches, is generally sold in inches. Clothing is usually sized in inches, with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator. Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre, but is billed like electricity by the kilowatt hour.

Pre-packaged products can show both metric and imperial measures, and it is also common to see imperial pack sizes with metric only labels, e.g. a tin of Lyle&#x27;s Golden Syrup is always labelled with no imperial indicator. Similarly most jars of jam and packs of sausages are labelled with no imperial indicator.

===India===

India began converting to the metric system from the imperial system between 1955 and 1962. The metric system in weights and measures was adopted by the Indian Parliament in December 1956 with the &quot;Standards of Weights and Measures Act&quot;, which took effect beginning 1 October 1958. By 1962, metric units became &quot;mandatory and exclusive.&quot;

Today all official measurements are made in the metric system. In common usage some older Indians may still refer to imperial units. Some measurements, such as the heights of mountains, are still recorded in feet. Tyre rim diameters are still measured in inches, as used worldwide. Industries like the construction and the real estate industry still use both the metric and the imperial system though it is more common for sizes of homes to be given in square feet and land in acres.

In Standard Indian English, as in Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, Singaporean, and British English, metric units such as the litre, metre, and tonne utilise the traditional spellings brought over from French, which differ from those used in the United States and the Philippines. The imperial long ton is invariably spelt with one &#x27;n&#x27;.

===Hong Kong===

Hong Kong has three main systems of units of measurement in current use:

* The Chinese units of measurement of the Qing Empire (no longer in widespread use in China);
* British imperial units; and
* The metric system.

In 1976 the Hong Kong Government started the conversion to the metric system, and as of 2012 measurements for government purposes, such as road signs, are almost always in metric units. All three systems are officially permitted for trade, and in the wider society a mixture of all three systems prevails.

The Chinese system&#x27;s most commonly used units for length are (&quot;lei5&quot;), (&quot;zoeng6&quot;), (&quot;cek3&quot;), (&quot;cyun3&quot;), (&quot;fan1&quot;) in descending scale order. These units are now rarely used in daily life, the imperial and metric systems being preferred. The imperial equivalents are written with the same basic Chinese characters as the Chinese system. In order to distinguish between the units of the two systems, the units can be prefixed with &quot;Ying&quot; (, &quot;jing1&quot;) for the imperial system and &quot;Wa&quot; (, &quot;waa4&quot;) for the Chinese system. In writing, derived characters are often used, with an additional (mouth) radical to the left of the original Chinese character, for writing imperial units. The most commonly used units are the mile or &quot;li&quot; (, &quot;li1&quot;), the yard or &quot;ma&quot; (, &quot;maa5&quot;), the foot or &quot;chek&quot; (, &quot;cek3&quot;), and the inch or &quot;tsun&quot; (, &quot;cyun3&quot;).

The traditional measure of flat area is the square foot (, &quot;fong1 cek3, ping4 fong1 cek3&quot;) of the imperial system, which is still in common use for real estate purposes. The measurement of agricultural plots and fields is traditionally conducted in (&quot;mau5&quot;) of the Chinese system.

For the measurement of volume, Hong Kong officially uses the metric system, though the gallon (, &quot;gaa1 leon4-2&quot;) is also occasionally used.

=== Canada ===

During the 1970s, the metric system and SI units were introduced in Canada to replace the imperial system. Within the government, efforts to implement the metric system were extensive; almost any agency, institution, or function provided by the government uses SI units exclusively. Imperial units were eliminated from all public road signs and both systems of measurement will still be found on privately owned signs, such as the height warnings at the entrance of a parkade. In the 1980s, momentum to fully convert to the metric system stalled when the government of Brian Mulroney was elected. There was heavy opposition to metrication and as a compromise the government maintains legal definitions for and allows use of imperial units as long as metric units are shown as well.

The law requires that measured products (such as fuel and meat) be priced in metric units and an imperial price can be shown if a metric price is present. There tends to be leniency in regards to fruits and vegetables being priced in imperial units only.
Environment Canada still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units, even though weather is typically measured and reported in metric units in the Canadian media. Some radio stations near the United States border (such as CIMX and CIDR) primarily use imperial units to report the weather. Railways in Canada also continue to use imperial units.

Imperial units are still used in ordinary conversation. Today, Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. The use of the metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Quebec has implemented metrication more fully. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers&#x27; licences use SI units, though many English-speaking Canadians give their height and weight in imperial. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening. Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units whilst initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farmland on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces. 

In English-speaking Canada commercial and residential spaces are mostly (but not exclusively) constructed using square feet, while in French-speaking Quebec commercial and residential spaces are constructed in metres and advertised using both square metres and square feet as equivalents. Carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot, but less frequently also in square metres. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per and statute miles per imperial gallon, leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity (tons), speed (mph), and trackage (miles).

Imperial units also retain common use in firearms and ammunition. Imperial measures are still used in the description of cartridge types, even when the cartridge is of relatively recent invention (e.g., .204 Ruger, .17 HMR, where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch). Ammunition that is already classified in metric is still kept metric (e.g., 9×19mm). In the manufacture of ammunition, bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of grains for both metric and imperial cartridges.

In keeping with the international standard, air navigation is based on &quot;nautical&quot; units, e.g., the nautical mile, which is neither imperial nor metric, and altitude is measured in imperial feet.

===Australia===

While metrication in Australia has largely ended the official use of imperial units, for particular measurements, international use of imperial units is still followed.

* In licensed venues, draught beer and cider is sold in glasses and jugs with sizes based on the imperial fluid ounce, though rounded to the nearest 5 mL.
* Newborns are measured in metric at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is sometimes also announced to family and friends in imperial units.
* Screen sizes, are frequently described in inches instead of or as well as centimetres.
* Property size is infrequently described in acres, but is mostly as square metres or hectares.
* Marine navigation is done in nautical miles, and water-based speed limits are in nautical miles per hour.
* Historical writing and presentations may include pre-metric units to reflect the context of the era represented.
* The illicit drug trade in Australia still often uses imperial measurements, particularly when dealing with smaller amounts closer to end user levels e.g. &quot;8-ball&quot; an 8th of an ounce or ; cannabis is often traded in ounces (&quot;oz&quot;) and pounds (&quot;p&quot;)
* Firearm barrel length are almost always referred by in inches, ammunition is also still measured in grains and ounces as well as grams.
* A persons height is frequently and informally described in feet and inches, but on official records is described in metres.

The influence of British and American culture in Australia has been noted to be a cause for residual use of imperial units of measure.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand introduced the metric system on 15 December 1976. Aviation was exempt, with altitude and airport elevation continuing to be measured in feet whilst navigation is done in nautical miles; all other aspects (fuel quantity, aircraft weight, runway length, etc.) use metric units.

Screen sizes for devices such as televisions, monitors and phones, and wheel rim sizes for vehicles, are stated in inches, as is the convention in the rest of the world - and a 1992 study found a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units.

===Ireland===

Ireland has officially changed over to the metric system since entering the European Union, with distances on new road signs being metric since 1997 and speed limits being metric since 2005. The imperial system remains in limited use – for sales of beer in pubs (traditionally sold by the pint). All other goods are required by law to be sold in metric units with traditional quantities being retained for goods like butter and sausages, which are sold in packaging. The majority of cars sold pre-2005 feature speedometers with miles per hour as the primary unit, but with a kilometres per hour display. Often signs such as those for bridge height can display both metric and imperial units. Imperial measurements continue to be used colloquially by the general population especially with height and distance measurements such as feet, inches, and acres as well as for weight with pounds and stones still in common use among people of all ages. Measurements such as yards have fallen out of favour with younger generations. Ireland&#x27;s railways still use imperial measurements for distances and speed signage. Property is usually listed in square feet as well as metres also.

Horse racing in Ireland still continues to use stones, pounds, miles and furlongs as measurements.

===Bahamas===
Imperial measurements remain in general use in the Bahamas.

Legally, both the imperial and metric systems are recognised by the Weights and Measures Act 2006.

===Belize===
Both imperial units and metric units are used in Belize. Both systems are legally recognized by the National Metrology Act.

===Myanmar===
According to the CIA, in June 2009, Myanmar was one of three countries that had not adopted the SI metric system as their official system of weights and measures. Metrication efforts began in 2011. The Burmese government set a goal to metricate by 2019, which was not met, with the help of the German National Metrology Institute.
===Other countries===
Some imperial measurements remain in limited use in Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and South Africa. Measurements in feet and inches, especially for a person&#x27;s height, are frequently encountered in conversation and non-governmental publications.

Prior to metrication, it was a common practice in Malaysia for people to refer to unnamed locations and small settlements along major roads by referring to how many miles the said locations were from the nearest major town. In some cases, these eventually became the official names of the locations; in other cases, such names have been largely or completely superseded by new names. An example of the former is Batu 32 (literally &quot;Mile 32&quot; in Malay), which refers to the area surrounding the intersection between Federal Route 22 (the Tamparuli-Sandakan highway) and Federal Route 13 (the Sandakan-Tawau highway). The area is so named because it is 32 miles west of Sandakan, the nearest major town.

Petrol is still sold by the imperial gallon in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Myanmar, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The United Arab Emirates Cabinet in 2009 issued the Decree No. (270 / 3) specifying that, from 1 January 2010, the new unit sale price for petrol will be the litre and not the gallon, which was in line with the UAE Cabinet Decision No. 31 of 2006 on the national system of measurement, which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country. Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May 2011.

In October 2011, the Antigua and Barbuda government announced the re-launch of the Metrication Programme in accordance with the Metrology Act 2007, which established the International System of Units as the legal system of units. The Antigua and Barbuda government has committed to a full conversion from the imperial system by the first quarter of 2015.

<doc id="15494" wikidata="Q7919015" url="?curid=15494" title="Incompatible-properties argument">
<text>The incompatible-properties argument is the idea that no description of God is consistent with reality. For example, if one takes the definition of God to be described fully from the Bible, then the claims of what properties God has described therein might be argued to lead to a contradiction.

==Evil vs. good and omnipotence==
The problem of evil is the argument that the existence of evil is incompatible with the concept of an omnipotent and perfectly good God.

A variation does not depend on the existence of evil. A truly omnipotent God could create all possible worlds. A &quot;good&quot; God can create only &quot;good&quot; worlds. A God that created all possible worlds would have no moral qualities whatsoever, and could be replaced by a random generator. The standard response is to argue a distinction between &quot;could create&quot; and &quot;would create.&quot; In other words, God &quot;could&quot; create all possible worlds but that is simply not in God&#x27;s nature. This has been argued by theologians for centuries. However, the result is that a &quot;good&quot; God is incompatible with some possible worlds, thus incapable of creating them without losing the property of being a totally different God. Yet, it is not necessary for God to be &quot;good&quot;. He simply is good, but is capable of evil.

==Purpose vs. timelessness==
One argument based on incompatible properties rests on a definition of God that includes a will, plan or purpose and an existence outside of time. To say that a being possesses a purpose implies an inclination or tendency to steer events toward some state that does not yet exist. This, in turn, implies a privileged direction, which we may call &quot;time&quot;. It may be one direction of causality, the direction of increasing entropy, or some other emergent property of a world. These are not identical, but one must exist in order to progress toward a goal.

In general, God&#x27;s time would not be related to our time. God might be able to operate within our time without being constrained to do so. However, God could then step outside this game for any purpose. Thus God&#x27;s time must be aligned with our time if human activities are relevant to God&#x27;s purpose. (In a relativistic universe, presumably this means—at any point in spacetime—time measured from t=0 at the Big Bang or end of inflation.)

A God existing outside of any sort of time could not create anything because creation substitutes one thing for another, or for nothing. Creation requires a creator that existed, by definition, prior to the thing created.

==Omniscience vs. indeterminacy or free will==
Another pair of alleged incompatible properties is omniscience and either indeterminacy or free will. Omniscience concerning the past and present (properly defined relative to Earth) is not a problem, but there is an argument that omniscience regarding the future implies it has been determined, what seems possible only in a deterministic world.

<doc id="15495" wikidata="Q379193" url="?curid=15495" title="International Society of Olympic Historians">
<text>The International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH) is a non-profit organization founded in 1991 with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games. The majority of recent books on the Olympic Games have been written by ISOH members. The ISOH publishes the Journal of Olympic History (&quot;JOH&quot;, formerly &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot;) three times a year.

==History==

The International Society of Olympic Historians was formed as the result of a meeting in London, England, in December 1991. The idea of forming an Olympic historical society had been the subject of correspondence – mainly between Bill Mallon (United States) and Ture Widlund (Sweden) – for many years. On Thursday, 5 December 1991, a group of potential members met at the Duke of Clarence, a small pub in the Kensington section of London. Those present were Ian Buchanan (Great Britain), Stan Greenberg (Great Britain), Ove Karlsson (Sweden), Bill Mallon (United States), Peter Matthews (Great Britain), David Wallechinsky (United States), and Ture Widlund (Sweden). The invited guests who sent regrets were: Anthony Bijkerk (Netherlands), Peter Diamond (United States), Pim Huurman (Netherlands), Erich Kamper (Austria), Volker Kluge (Germany), John Lucas (United States), and Wolf Lyberg (Sweden).

ISOH was formed with the purpose of promoting and studying the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games. This purpose is achieved primarily through research into their history, through the gathering of historical and statistical data concerning the Olympic Movement and Olympic Games, through the publication of the research via journals and other publications, and through the cooperation of the membership.

From its inception to 2000, Ian Buchanan has been the president of the ISOH. In 2000, this function was taken over by Bill Mallon. From 2004 to 2012 Dr. Karl Lennartz (Germany) and from 2012 to 2020 David Wallechinsky (United States) served as presidents. Since 2020 the archaeologist and sports historian Dr. Christian Wacker (Germany) has been president.

==&quot;Journal of Olympic History&quot;==

The ISOH publishes the &quot;Journal of Olympic History&quot; (formerly &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot;).

==Membership==
, the ISOH has about 340 members from 48 nations. The membership includes well-known Olympic historians and researchers on Olympic topics. The majority of recent books on the Olympic Games have been written by ISOH members. Over 20 ISOH members have received the Olympic Order for their contributions to the Olympic Movement, and several members of the IOC and several Olympians are members.

<doc id="15496" wikidata="Q15804" url="?curid=15496" title="Serie A">
<text>The Serie A (), officially known as Serie A [[Eni]]live in Italy and Serie A Made in Italy abroad for sponsorship reasons, is a professional association football league in Italy and the highest level of the Italian football league system. The winners are awarded the Coppa Campioni d&#x27;Italia trophy and the &quot;scudetto&quot;, a decoration that they wear on the jersey the season after the victory. It has been operating as a round-robin tournament for over ninety years since the 1929–30 season. It had been organized by the Direttorio Divisioni Superiori until 1943, the Lega Calcio until 2010, and the Lega Serie A ever since. Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical and defensively sound national league. In 2023–24, Serie A was ranked as the best league by UEFA coefficient.

In its current format, the Italian Football Championship was revised from having regional and interregional rounds, to a single-tier league from the 1929–30 season onwards. The championship titles won before 1929 are officially recognised by FIGC with the same weighting as titles that were subsequently awarded. Similarly, the 1945–46 season, when the round-robin was suspended and the league was played over two geographical groups due to the ravages of World War II, is not statistically considered, even if its title is fully official.

The league hosts three of the world&#x27;s most famous clubs as Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan, all founding members of the G-14, a group which represented the largest and most prestigious European football clubs from 2000 to 2008, with the first two also being founding members of its successive organisation, European Club Association (ECA). More players have won the Ballon d&#x27;Or award while playing at a Serie A club than any league in the world other than Spain&#x27;s La Liga. Juventus, Italy&#x27;s most successful club of the 20th century and the most winning Italian team, is tied for sixth in Europe and twelfth in the world with the most official international titles with eleven. Prior the first Europa Conference League final in 2022, it was also the only one in the world to have won all the historical five official confederation competitions, an achievement reached after its triumph in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup and revalidated after winning a sixth tournament, the UEFA Intertoto Cup, fourteen years later. Milan is joint third club overall for official international titles won with nineteen. Inter, following their achievements in the 2009–10 season, became the first Italian team to have achieved a seasonal treble. It is also the team to have competed uninterruptedly for the most time in the top flight of Italian football, having seen its debut in 1909. All these clubs, along with Lazio, Fiorentina, Roma and Napoli, are known as the &quot;seven sisters&quot; () of Italian football.

Serie A is one of the most storied football leagues in the world. Of the 100 greatest footballers in history chosen by &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; in 2017, 42 players have played in Serie A, more than any other league in the world. Juventus is the team that has produced the most World Cup champions (27), with Inter (20), Roma (16) and Milan (10), being respectively third, fourth and ninth in that ranking.

==History==
Serie A, as it is structured today, began during the 1929–30 season. From 1898 to 1922, the competition was organised into regional groups. Because of ever growing teams attending regional championships, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) split the CCI (Italian Football Confederation) in 1921, which founded in Milan the Lega Nord (Northern Football League), ancestor of present-day Lega Serie A. When CCI teams rejoined the FIGC created two interregional divisions renaming Categories into Divisions and splitting FIGC sections into two north–south leagues. In 1926, due to internal crises and fascist pressures, the FIGC changed internal settings, adding southern teams to the national division, ultimately leading to the 1929–30 final settlement.

The Serie A Championship title is often referred to as the &quot;scudetto&quot; (&quot;small shield&quot;) because since the 1923–24 season, the winning team will bear a small coat of arms with the Italian tricolour on their strip in the following season. The most successful club is Juventus with 36 championships, followed by Inter Milan with 20 championships and AC Milan with 19 championships. From the 2004–05 season onwards, an actual trophy was awarded to club on the pitch after the last turn of the championship. The trophy, called the Coppa Campioni d&#x27;Italia, has officially been used since the 1960–61 season, but between 1961 and 2004 was consigned to the winning clubs at the head office of the Lega Nazionale Professionisti.

In April 2009, Serie A announced a split from Serie B. Nineteen of the twenty clubs voted in favour of the move in an argument over television rights; the relegation-threatened Lecce had voted against the decision. Maurizio Beretta, the former head of Italy&#x27;s employers&#x27; association, became president of the new league.

In April 2016, it was announced that Serie A was selected by the International Football Association Board to test video replays, which were initially private for the 2016–17 season, allowing them to become a live pilot phase, with replay assistance implemented in the 2017–18 season. On the decision, FIGC President Carlo Tavecchio said: &quot;We were among the first supporters of using technology on the pitch and we believe we have everything required to offer our contribution to this important experiment.&quot;

Serie A will continue the 20 club format after sixteen clubs voted against reducing the division to 18 teams in February 2024.

==Format==
For most of Serie A&#x27;s history, there were 16 or 18 clubs competing at the top level. Since 2004–05, however, there have been 20 clubs in total. One season (1947–48) was played with 21 teams for political reasons, following post-war tensions with Yugoslavia. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history:
* 18 clubs: 1929–1934
* 16 clubs: 1934–1943
* 20 clubs: 1946–1947
* 21 clubs: 1947–1948
* 20 clubs: 1948–1952
* 18 clubs: 1952–1967
* 16 clubs: 1967–1988
* 18 clubs: 1988–2004
* 20 clubs: 2004–present
During the season, which runs from August to May, each club plays each of the other teams twice; once at home and once away, totalling 38 games for each team by the end of the season. Thus, in Italian football a true round-robin format is used. In the first half of the season, called the &quot;andata&quot;, each team plays once against each league opponent, for a total of 19 games. In the second half of the season, called the &quot;ritorno&quot;, the teams play another 19 games, once more against each opponent, in which home and away matches are reversed. The two halves of the season had exactly the same order of fixtures until the 2021–22 season, when an asymmetrical calendar was introduced, following the format of the English, Spanish and French leagues. Since the 1994–95 season, teams are awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Prior to this, teams were awarded two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. The three lowest-placed teams at the end of the season are relegated to Serie B, and three Serie B teams are promoted to replace them for the next season.

=== European qualification ===
In 2023–24, Serie A was ranked as the best league by UEFA coefficient. This was due to a combination of all seven Serie A teams progressing into the knockout stages in European competition, picking up extra coefficient points. Additionally, Atalanta won the Europa League Final and Fiorentina were losing finalists in the UEFA Europa Conference League. This continued a strong recent record where five of the six European club finals have featured at least one Serie A side over the past two seasons. As a result of this ranking the top 5 clubs in Serie A qualify for the champions league in 2024.

=== Tiebreaking ===

If after all 38 games, two teams are tied on points for either first place or for 17th (the last safety spot), the outcome is decided by a single-legged play-off match. This match consists of 90 minutes of regulation time followed by penalties if necessary (no extra time). The game is to be held at a neutral venue, with the home team determined by the tiebreakers listed below. In cases where there are at least three teams tied for one of these positions, a mini table is created using the same tiebreakers to determine which two teams will play in the decider. For ties concerning all other league positions, the following tiebreakers are applied:

# Head-to-head points
# Goal difference of head-to-head games
# Goal difference overall
# Higher number of goals scored
# Play-off game at a neutral venue if relevant to decide European qualification or relegation; otherwise by coin flip

Between 2006–07 and 2021–22, the tiebreakers currently used for all places to decide the scudetto winner if necessary, though this was never needed. Before 2005–06, a play-off would immediately be used if teams were tied for first place, a European qualification spot, or a relegation spot. In some past years, the playoff was a single game at a neutral site while in others it was a two-legged tie decided by aggregate score. A playoff game has never been needed since the tiebreaking format changed.

The only time a playoff was used to decide the champion occurred in the 1963–64 season when Bologna and Inter both finished on 54 points. Bologna won the playoff 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome to win the scudetto. Playoff games were used on multiple occasions to decide European competition qualifications (most recently in 1999–2000) and relegation (most recently in 2022–23).

==Clubs==

Before 1929, many clubs competed in the top level of Italian football as the earlier rounds were competed up to 1922 on a regional basis then interregional up to 1929. Below is a list of Serie A clubs who have competed in the competition since it has been a league format (68 in total).

==Logos==
Serie A had logos that featured its sponsor Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM). The logo that was introduced in 2010 had a minor change in 2016 due to the change of the logo of TIM itself. In August 2018, a new logo was announced, and another one in August 2019.

On 5 February 2024, Serie A signed a new sponsor deal with Eni, otherwise known as Enilive, to take the main sponsor role of the Serie A.

==Television rights==

In the past, individual clubs competing in the league had the rights to sell their broadcast rights to specific channels throughout Italy, unlike in most other European countries. Currently, the two broadcasters in Italy are the satellite broadcaster Sky Italia and streaming platform DAZN for its own pay television networks; RAI is allowed to broadcast only highlights (in exclusive from 13:30 to 22:30 CET).
This is a list of television rights in Italy (since 2021–22):
* Sky Italia (3 matches per week)
* DAZN (all matches, including the previous 3)
* OneFootball (highlights)

Since the 2010–11 season, Serie A clubs have negotiated television rights collectively rather than on an individual club basis, having previously abandoned collective negotiation at the end of the 1998–99 season.

=== International broadcasters ===

In the 1990s, Serie A was at its most popular in the United Kingdom when it was shown on &quot;Football Italia&quot; on Channel 4, although it has actually appeared on more UK channels than any other league, rarely staying in one place for long since 2002. Serie A has appeared in the UK on BSB&#x27;s The Sports Channel (1990–91), Sky Sports (1991–1992), Channel 4 (1992–2002), Eurosport (2002–2004), Setanta Sports and Bravo (2004–2007), Channel 5 (2007–2008), ESPN (2009–2013), Eleven Sports Network (2018), Premier, FreeSports (2019–2021) and currently BT Sport (2013–2018; 2021–present).

In the United States, Serie A is currently shown on CBS Sports and its streaming network Paramount+. Prior to 2021–22 it was shown on the ESPN family of networks.

====2024–29====
For the 2024–29 cycle, the Serie A sold its international rights to the Infront agency (except in United States and MENA), which is in charge of reaching an agreement with the interested companies.

==Champions==
Although Serie A was not formed until 1929–30, the league recognizes clubs who were named Italian champions before the league&#x27;s foundation. No champions was awarded in 1926–27 and 2004-05 seasons, after Torino and Juventus were stripped from their titles due to their involvement in football scandals.

==Players==

===Non-EU players===
Unlike La Liga, for example, which has long imposed a quota on the number of players able to play for each club who hold passports from countries that are not in the European Union, Serie A has undergone many rule changes concerning the number of non-EU players clubs could sign.

During the 1980s and 1990s, most Serie A clubs signed a large number of players from foreign nations (both EU and non-EU members). Notable foreign players to play in Serie A during this era included Irish international Liam Brady, England internationals Paul Gascoigne and David Platt, France&#x27;s Michel Platini and Laurent Blanc, Lothar Matthäus and Jürgen Klinsmann from Germany, Dutchmen Ruud Gullit and Dennis Bergkamp, and Argentina&#x27;s Diego Maradona.

In the middle of the 2000–01 season, the old quota system, which limited each team to having no more than five non-EU players and using no more than three in each match, was abolished. Concurrent with the abolishment of the quota, the FIGC had investigated footballers that used fake passports. Alberto and Warley, Alejandro Da Silva and Jorginho Paulista of Udinese; Fábio Júnior and Gustavo Bartelt of Roma; Dida of Milan; Álvaro Recoba of Inter; Thomas Job, Francis Zé, Jean Ondoa of Sampdoria; and Jeda and Dede of Vicenza were all banned in July 2001 for lengths ranging from six months to one year. However, most of the bans were subsequently reduced.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, a quota was imposed on each of the clubs limiting the number of non-EU, non-EFTA and non-Swiss players who may be signed from abroad each season, following provisional measures introduced in the 2002–03 season, which allowed Serie A and B clubs to sign only one non-EU player in the 2002 summer transfer window.

The rule underwent minor changes in August 2004, June 2005, June 2006, and June 2007.

The number of non-EU players was reduced from 265 in 2002–03 season to 166 in 2006–07 season. This reduction also included players who received EU status after their respective countries joined the EU (see 2004 and 2007 enlargement), which made players such as Adrian Mutu, Valeri Bojinov, Marek Jankulovski and Marius Stankevičius EU players.

The quota system changed again at the beginning of the 2008–09 season: three quotas were awarded to clubs that do not have non-EU players in their squad (previously only newly promoted clubs could have three quotas); clubs that had one non-EU player had two quotas. Those clubs that had two non-EU players were awarded one quota and one conditional quota, which was awarded after: 1) Transferred 1 non-EU player abroad, or 2) Release 1 non-EU player as free agent, or 3) A non-EU player received EU nationality. Clubs with three or more non-EU players had two conditional quotas, but releasing two non-EU players as free agent only gave one quota instead of two. Serie B and Lega Pro clubs could not sign non-EU players from abroad, except those that followed a club promoted from Serie D.

On 2 July 2010, the above conditional quota was reduced back to one, though if a team did not have any non-EU players, that team could still sign up to three non-EU players. In 2011 the signing quota reverted to two.

Large clubs with many foreigners usually borrow quotas from other clubs that have few foreigners or no foreigners in order to sign more non-EU players. For example, Adrian Mutu joined Juventus via Livorno in 2005, as at the time Romania was not a member of the EU. Other examples include Júlio César, Victor Obinna and Maxwell, who joined Inter from Chievo (first two) and Empoli, respectively.

===Homegrown players===
Serie A also imposed Homegrown players rule, a modification of Homegrown Player Rule (UEFA). Unlike UEFA, Serie A at first did not cap the number of players in first team squad at 25, meaning the club could employ more foreigners by increasing the size of the squad. However, a cap of 25 (under-21 players were excluded) was introduced to 2015–16 season (in 2015–16 season, squad simply require 8 homegrown players but not require 4 of them from their own youth team). In the 2016–17 season, the FIGC sanctioned Sassuolo for fielding ineligible player, Antonino Ragusa. Although the club did not exceed the capacity of 21 players that were not from their own youth team (only Domenico Berardi was eligible as youth product of their own) as well as under 21 of age (born 1995 or after, of which four players were eligible) in their 24-men call-up, It was reported that on Lega Serie A side the squad list was not updated.

In 2015–16 season, the following quota was announced.

<text>Inhalants are a broad range of household and industrial chemicals whose volatile vapors or pressurized gases can be concentrated and breathed in via the nose or mouth to produce intoxication, in a manner not intended by the manufacturer. They are inhaled at room temperature through volatilization (in the case of gasoline or acetone) or from a pressurized container (e.g., nitrous oxide or butane), and do not include drugs that are sniffed after burning or heating.

While a few inhalants are prescribed by medical professionals and used for medical purposes, as in the case of inhaled anesthetics and nitrous oxide (an anxiolytic and pain relief agent prescribed by dentists), this article focuses on inhalant use of household and industrial propellants, glues, fuels, and other products in a manner not intended by the manufacturer, to produce intoxication or other psychoactive effects. These products are used as recreational drugs for their intoxicating effect. According to a 1995 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the most serious inhalant use occurs among homeless children and teenagers who &quot;live on the streets completely without family ties.&quot; Inhalants are the only substance used more by younger teenagers than by older teenagers. Inhalant users inhale vapor or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from a solvent-soaked rag or an open container. The practices are known colloquially as &quot;sniffing&quot;, &quot;huffing&quot; or &quot;bagging&quot;.

The effects of inhalants range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid hallucinations, depending on the substance and the dose. Some inhalant users are injured due to the harmful effects of the solvents or gases or due to other chemicals used in the products that they are inhaling. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. In some cases, users have died from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, heart failure, cardiac arrest, or aspiration of vomit. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use of solvents as opposed to short-term exposure.

While legal when used as intended, in England, Scotland, and Wales it is illegal to sell inhalants to persons likely to use them as an intoxicant. As of 2017, thirty-seven US states impose criminal penalties on some combination of sale, possession or recreational use of various inhalants. In 15 of these states, such laws apply only to persons under the age of 18.

==Medical inhalants==

A small number of recreational inhalant drugs are pharmaceutical products that are used illicitly.

* Antidote to cyanide poisoning
** Alkyl nitrites (poppers)
* Inhalational anesthetics used as general anesthetics
** Nitrous oxide
** Xenon
* Historical general anesthetics
** Chloroethane
** Chloroform
** Ether

Several medical anesthetics are used as recreational drugs, including diethyl ether (a drug that is no longer used medically, due to its high flammability and the development of safer alternatives) and nitrous oxide, which has been widely used since the late 20th century by dentists as an anti-anxiety drug and mild anesthetic during dental procedures. Diethyl ether has a long history of use as a recreational drug. The effects of ether intoxication are similar to those of alcohol intoxication, but more potent. Also, due to NMDA antagonism, the user may experience all the psychedelic effects present in classical dissociatives such as ketamine in the forms of thought loops and the feeling of the mind being disconnected from one&#x27;s body. Nitrous oxide is a dental anesthetic that is used as a recreational drug, either by users who have access to medical-grade gas canisters (e.g., dental hygienists or dentists) or by using the gas contained in whipped cream aerosol containers. Nitrous oxide inhalation can cause pain relief, depersonalization, derealization, dizziness, euphoria, and some sound distortion.

=====Alkyl nitrites=====
Ingestion of alkyl nitrites can cause methemoglobinemia, and by inhalation it has not been ruled out.

The sale of alkyl nitrite-based poppers was banned in Canada in 2013. Although not considered a narcotic and not illegal to possess or use, they are considered a drug. Sales that are not authorized can now be punished with fines and prison. Since 2007, reformulated poppers containing isopropyl nitrite are sold in Europe because only isobutyl nitrite is prohibited. In France, the sale of products containing butyl nitrite, pentyl nitrite, or isomers thereof, has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers. In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs. After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the Council of State on the grounds that the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.

In the United Kingdom, poppers are widely available and frequently (legally) sold in gay clubs/bars, sex shops, drug paraphernalia head shops, over the Internet and on markets. It is illegal under Medicines Act 1968 to sell them advertised for human consumption, and to bypass this, they are usually sold as odorizers. In the U.S., originally marketed as a prescription drug in 1937, amyl nitrite remained so until 1960, when the Food and Drug Administration removed the prescription requirement due to its safety record. This requirement was reinstated in 1969, after observation of an increase in recreational use. Other alkyl nitrites were outlawed in the U.S. by Congress through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The law includes an exception for commercial purposes. The term &quot;commercial purpose&quot; is defined to mean any use other than for the production of consumer products containing volatile alkyl nitrites meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl nitrites into the human body for euphoric or physical effects. The law came into effect in 1990. Visits to retail outlets selling these products reveal that some manufacturers have since reformulated their products to abide by the regulations, through the use of the legal cyclohexyl nitrite as the primary ingredient in their products, which are sold as video head cleaners, polish removers, or room odorants.

====Gases====

=====Nitrous oxide=====


Nitrous oxide can be categorized as a dissociative drug, as it can cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Anesthetic gases used for surgery, such as nitrous oxide or enflurane, are believed to induce anesthesia primarily by acting as NMDA receptor antagonists, open-channel blockers that bind to the inside of the calcium channels on the outer surface of the neuron, and provide high levels of NMDA receptor blockade for a short period of time.

This makes inhaled anesthetic gases different from other NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, which bind to a regulatory site on the NMDA-sensitive calcium transporter complex and provide slightly lower levels of NMDA blockade, but for a longer and much more predictable duration. This makes a deeper level of anesthesia achievable more easily using anesthetic gases but can also make them more dangerous than other drugs used for this purpose.
Nitrous oxide is thought to be particularly non-toxic, though heavy long-term use can lead to a variety of serious health problems linked to the destruction of vitamin B12 and folic acid.

In the United States, possession of nitrous oxide is legal under federal law and is not subject to DEA purview. It is, however, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act; prosecution is possible under its &quot;misbranding&quot; clauses, prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption as a recreational drug. Many states have laws regulating the possession, sale, and distribution of nitrous oxide. Such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount of nitrous oxide that may be sold without a special license. For example, in the state of California, possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanor. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Health has warned that nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine, and its sale or possession without a prescription is an offense under the Medicines Act. This statement would seemingly prohibit all non-medicinal uses of the chemical, though it is implied that only recreational use will be legally targeted. In India, for general anesthesia purposes, nitrous oxide is available as Nitrous Oxide IP. India&#x27;s gas cylinder rules (1985) prohibit the transfer of gas from one cylinder to another for breathing purposes. Because India&#x27;s Food &amp; Drug Authority (FDA-India) rules state that transferring a drug from one container to another (refilling) is equivalent to manufacturing, anyone found doing so must possess a drug manufacturing license.

====Safety====
In contrast, a few inhalants like amyl nitrite and diethyl ether have medical applications and are not toxic in the same sense as solvents, though they can still be dangerous when used recreationally.

==Non-medical inhalants==
Ethanol (the alcohol which is normally drunk) is sometimes inhaled.

The ethanol must be converted from liquid into gaseous state (vapor) or aerosol (mist), in some cases using a nebulizer, a machine that agitates the liquid into an aerosol. The sale of nebulizers for inhaling ethanol was banned in some US states due to safety concerns.

==Toxic inhalants==
Most inhalant drugs that are used non-medically are ingredients in household or industrial chemical products that are not intended to be concentrated and inhaled.

* Hydrocarbon poisoning
** Gases
*** Butane
*** Propane
** Solvents
*** Gasoline/petrol
*** Toluene
** Liquid/gas mixtures
*** Freon
* Ketones
** Solvents
*** Acetone

===Solvents===
A wide range of volatile solvents intended for household or industrial use are inhaled as recreational drugs. This includes petroleum products (gasoline and kerosene), toluene (used in paint thinner, permanent markers, contact cement and model glue), and acetone (used in nail polish remover). These solvents vaporize at room temperature.

Until the early 1990s, the most common solvents that were used for the ink in permanent markers were toluene and xylene. These two substances are both harmful and characterized by a very strong smell. Today, the ink is usually made on the basis of alcohols (e.g. 1-Propanol, 1-butanol, diacetone alcohol and cresols).

Organochlorine solvents are particularly hazardous; many of these are now restricted in developed countries due to their environmental impact.

====Legality====
Even though solvent glue is normally a legal product, there is a 1983 case where a court ruled that supplying glue to children is illegal. &quot;Khaliq v HM Advocate&quot; was a Scottish criminal case decided by the High Court of Justiciary on appeal, in which it was decided that it was an offense at common law to supply glue-sniffing materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used recreationally by children. Two shopkeepers in Glasgow were arrested and charged for supplying children with &quot;glue-sniffing kits&quot; consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They argued there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well that the children were going to use the articles as inhalants and the charge on the indictment should stand. When the case came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment.

As of 2023, in England, Scotland, and Wales it is illegal to sell inhalants, including solvent glues, to persons of any age likely to use them as an intoxicant. As of 2017, thirty-seven US states impose criminal penalties on some combination of sale, possession or recreational use of various inhalants. In 15 of these states, such laws apply only to persons under the age of 18.

====Gasoline====
Gasoline sniffing can cause lead poisoning, in locations where leaded gas is not banned.

====Toluene====
Toluene can damage myelin.

===Gases===

A number of gases intended for household or industrial use are inhaled as recreational drugs. This includes chlorofluorocarbons used in aerosols and propellants (e.g., aerosol hair spray, aerosol deodorant). A gas used as a propellant in whipped cream aerosol containers, nitrous oxide, is used as a recreational drug. Pressurized canisters of propane and butane gas, both of which are intended for use as fuels, are used as inhalants.

====Legality====

&quot;New Jersey... prohibits selling or offering to sell minors products containing chlorofluorocarbon that is used in refrigerant.&quot;

===Dangers===

Statistics on deaths caused by heavy inhalant use are difficult to determine. It may be severely under-reported because death is often attributed to a discrete event such as a stroke or a heart attack, even if the event happened because of inhalant use. Inhalant use was mentioned on 144 death certificates in Texas during the period 1988–1998 and was reported in 39 deaths in Virginia between 1987 and 1996 from acute voluntary exposure to used inhalants.

====Chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy====
Chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy (CSE) is a condition induced by long-term exposure to organic solvents, often—but not always—in the workplace, that lead to a wide variety of persisting sensorimotor polyneuropathies and neurobehavioral deficits even after solvent exposure has been removed.

====Sudden sniffing death syndrome====
Sudden sniffing death syndrome, first described by Millard Bass in 1970, is commonly known as SSDS.

Solvents have many potential risks in common, including pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest, and aspiration of vomit. The inhaling of some solvents can cause hearing loss, limb spasms, and damage to the central nervous system and brain. Serious but potentially reversible effects include liver and kidney damage and blood-oxygen depletion. Death from inhalants is generally caused by a very high concentration of fumes. Deliberately inhaling solvents from an attached paper or plastic bag or in a closed area greatly increases the chances of suffocation. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use as opposed to short-term exposure. Parkinsonism (see: Signs and symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease) has been associated with huffing.
Female inhalant users who are pregnant may have adverse effects on the fetus, and the baby may be smaller when it is born and may need additional health care (similar to those seen with alcohol – fetal alcohol syndrome). There is some evidence of birth defects and disabilities in babies born to women who sniffed solvents such as gasoline.

In the short term, death from solvent use occurs most commonly from aspiration of vomit while unconscious or from a combination of respiratory depression and hypoxia.

Inhaling butane gas can cause drowsiness, unconsciousness, asphyxia, and cardiac arrhythmia. Butane is the most commonly misused volatile solvent in the UK and caused 52% of solvent-related deaths in 2000. When butane is sprayed directly into the throat, the jet of fluid can cool rapidly to −20 °C by adiabatic expansion, causing prolonged laryngospasm.

Some inhalants can also indirectly cause sudden death by cardiac arrest, in a syndrome known as &quot;sudden sniffing death&quot;. The anaesthetic gases present in the inhalants appear to sensitize the user to adrenaline and, in this state, a sudden surge of adrenaline (e.g., from a frightening hallucination or run-in with aggressors), may cause fatal cardiac arrhythmia.

Furthermore, the inhalation of any gas that is capable of displacing oxygen in the lungs (especially gases heavier than oxygen) carries the risk of hypoxia as a result of the very mechanism by which breathing is triggered. Since reflexive breathing is prompted by elevated carbon dioxide levels (rather than diminished blood oxygen levels), breathing a concentrated, relatively inert gas (such as computer-duster tetrafluoroethane or nitrous oxide) that removes carbon dioxide from the blood without replacing it with oxygen will produce no outward signs of suffocation even when the brain is experiencing hypoxia. Once full symptoms of hypoxia appear, it may be too late to breathe without assistance, especially if the gas is heavy enough to lodge in the lungs for extended periods. Even completely inert gases, such as argon, can have this effect if oxygen is largely excluded.

===Patterns of use===
Inhalant drugs are often used by children, teenagers, incarcerated or institutionalized people, and impoverished people, because these solvents and gases are ingredients in hundreds of legally available, inexpensive products, such as deodorant sprays, hair spray, contact cement and aerosol air fresheners. However, most users tend to be &quot;... adolescents (between the ages of 12 and 17).&quot; In some countries, chronic, heavy inhalant use is concentrated in marginalized, impoverished communities. Young people who become used to heavy amounts of inhalants chronically are also more likely to be those who are isolated from their families and community. The article &quot;Epidemiology of Inhalant Abuse: An International Perspective&quot; notes that &quot;[t]he most serious form of obsession with inhalant use probably occurs in countries other than the United States where young children live on the streets completely without family ties. These groups almost always use inhalants at very high levels (Leal et al. 1978). This isolation can make it harder to keep in touch with the sniffer and encourage him or her to stop sniffing.&quot;

The article also states that &quot;... high [inhalant use] rates among barrio Hispanics almost undoubtedly are related to the poverty, lack of opportunity, and social dysfunction that occur in barrios&quot; and states that the &quot;... same general tendency appears for Native-American youth&quot; because &quot;... Indian reservations are among the most disadvantaged environments in the United States; there are high rates of unemployment, little opportunity, and high rates of alcoholism and other health problems.&quot; There are a wide range of social problems associated with inhalant use, such as feelings of distress, anxiety and grief for the community; violence and damage to property; violent crime; stresses on the juvenile justice system; and stresses on youth agencies and support services.

====Africa and Asia====
Glue and gasoline (petrol) sniffing is also a problem in parts of Africa, especially with street children. In India and South Asia, three of the most widely used inhalants are the Dendrite brand and other forms of contact adhesives and rubber cement manufactured in Kolkata, and toluenes in paint thinners. Genkem is a brand of glue, which had become the generic name for all the glues used by glue-sniffing children in Africa before the manufacturer replaced n-hexane in its ingredients in 2000.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has reported that glue sniffing is at the core of &quot;street culture&quot; in Nairobi, Kenya, and that the majority of street children in the city are habitual solvent users. Research conducted by Cottrell-Boyce for the African Journal of Drug and Alcohol Studies found that glue sniffing amongst Kenyan street children was primarily functional – dulling the senses against the hardship of life on the street – but it also provided a link to the support structure of the &quot;street family&quot; as a potent symbol of shared experience.

Similar incidents of glue sniffing among destitute youth in the Philippines have also been reported, most commonly from groups of street children and teenagers collectively known as &quot;Rugby&quot; boys, which were named after a brand of toluene-laden contact cement. Other toluene-containing substances have also been used, most notably the Vulca Seal brand of roof sealants. Bostik Philippines, which currently owns the Rugby and Vulca Seal brands, has since responded to the issue by adding bitterants such as mustard oil to their Rugby line, as well as reformulating it by replacing toluene with xylene. Several other manufacturers have also followed suit.

Another very common inhalant is Erase-X, a correction fluid that contains toluene. It has become very common for school and college students to use it, because it is easily available in stationery shops in India. This fluid is also used by street and working children in Delhi.

====Europe and North America====
In the UK, marginalized youth use a number of inhalants, such as solvents and propellants. In Russia and Eastern Europe, gasoline sniffing became common on Russian ships following attempts to limit the supply of alcohol to ship crews in the 1980s. The documentary &quot;Children Underground&quot; depicts the huffing of a solvent called Aurolac (a product used in chroming) by Romanian homeless children. During the interwar period, the inhalation of ether (etheromania) was widespread in some regions of Poland, especially in Upper Silesia. Tens of thousands of people were affected by this problem.

In Canada, Native children in the isolated Northern Labrador community of Davis Inlet were the focus of national concern in 1993, when many were found to be sniffing gasoline. The Canadian and provincial Newfoundland and Labrador governments intervened on a number of occasions, sending many children away for treatment. Despite being moved to the new community of Natuashish in 2002, serious inhalant use problems have continued. Similar problems were reported in Sheshatshiu in 2000 and also in Pikangikum First Nation. In 2012, the issue once again made the news media in Canada. In Mexico, the inhaling of a mixture of gasoline and industrial solvents, known locally as &quot;Activo&quot; or &quot;Chemo&quot;, has risen in popularity among the homeless and among the street children of Mexico City in the 21st century. The mixture is poured onto a handkerchief and inhaled while held in one&#x27;s fist.

In the US, ether was used as a recreational drug during the 1930s Prohibition era, when alcohol was made illegal. Ether was either sniffed or drunk and, in some towns, replaced alcohol entirely. However, the risk of death from excessive sedation or overdose is greater than that with alcohol, and ether drinking is associated with damage to the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Use of glue, paint and gasoline became more common after the 1950s. Model airplane glue-sniffing as problematic behavior among youth was first reported in 1959 and increased in the 1960s. Use of aerosol sprays became more common in the 1980s, as older propellants such as CFCs were phased out and replaced by more environmentally friendly compounds such as propane and butane. Most inhalant solvents and gases are not regulated under drug laws such as the United States Controlled Substances Act. However, many US states and Canadian cities have placed restrictions on the sale of some solvent-containing products to minors, particularly for products widely associated with sniffing, such as model cement. The practice of inhaling such substances is sometimes colloquially referred to as huffing, sniffing (or glue sniffing), dusting, or chroming.

====Australia====
Australia has long faced a petrol (gasoline) sniffing problem in isolated and impoverished aboriginal communities. Although some sources argue that sniffing was introduced by United States servicemen stationed in the nation&#x27;s Top End during World War II or through experimentation by 1940s-era Cobourg Peninsula sawmill workers, other sources claim that inhalant abuse (such as glue inhalation) emerged in Australia in the late 1960s. Chronic, heavy petrol sniffing appears to occur among remote, impoverished indigenous communities, where the ready accessibility of petrol has helped to make it a common addictive substance.

In Australia, petrol sniffing now occurs widely throughout remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, northern parts of South Australia, and Queensland. The number of people sniffing petrol goes up and down over time as young people experiment or sniff occasionally. &quot;Boss&quot;, or chronic, sniffers may move in and out of communities; they are often responsible for encouraging young people to take it up.

A 1983 survey of 4,165 secondary students in New South Wales showed that solvents and aerosols ranked just after analgesics (e.g., codeine pills) and alcohol for drugs that were inappropriately used. This 1983 study did not find any common usage patterns or social class factors. The causes of death for inhalant users in Australia included pneumonia, cardiac failure/arrest, aspiration of vomit, and burns. In 1985, there were 14 communities in Central Australia reporting young people sniffing. In July 1997, it was estimated that there were around 200 young people sniffing petrol across 10 communities in Central Australia. Approximately 40 were classified as chronic sniffers. There have been reports of young Aboriginal people sniffing petrol in the urban areas around Darwin and Alice Springs.

In 2005, the Government of Australia and BP Australia began the usage of opal fuel in remote areas prone to petrol sniffing. Opal is a non-sniffable fuel (which is much less likely to cause a high) and has made a difference in some indigenous communities.

==Administration and effects==
Inhalant users inhale vapors or aerosol propellant gases using plastic bags held over the mouth or by breathing from an open container of solvents, such as gasoline or paint thinner. Nitrous oxide gases from whipped cream aerosol cans, aerosol hairspray or non-stick frying spray are sprayed into plastic bags. Some nitrous oxide users spray the gas into balloons. When inhaling non-stick cooking spray or other aerosol products, some users may filter the aerosolized particles out with a rag. Some gases, such as propane and butane gases, are inhaled directly from the canister. Once these solvents or gases are inhaled, the extensive capillary surface of the lungs rapidly absorbs the solvent or gas, and blood levels peak rapidly. The intoxication effects occur so quickly that the effects of inhalation can resemble the intensity of effects produced by intravenous injection of other psychoactive drugs.

Ethanol is also inhaled, either by vaporizing it by pouring it over dry ice in a narrow container and inhaling with a straw or by pouring alcohol in a corked bottle with a pipe, and then using a bicycle pump to make a spray. Alcohol can be vaporized using a simple container and open-flame heater. Medical devices such as asthma nebulizers and inhalers were also reported as a means of application. The practice gained popularity in 2004, with the marketing of the device dubbed AWOL (Alcohol without liquid), a play on the military term AWOL (Absent Without Leave). AWOL, created by British businessman Dominic Simler, was first introduced in Asia and Europe, and then in the United States in August 2004. AWOL was used by nightclubs, at gatherings and parties, and it garnered attraction as a novelty, as people &#x27;enjoyed passing it around in a group&#x27;. AWOL uses a nebulizer, a machine that agitates the liquid into an aerosol. AWOL&#x27;s official website states that &quot;AWOL and AWOL 1 are powered by &quot;Electrical Air Compressors&quot; while AWOL 2 and AWOL 3 are powered by &quot;electrical oxygen generators&quot;&quot;, which refer to a couple of mechanisms used by the nebulizer drug delivery device for inhalation. Although the AWOL machine is marketed as having no downsides, such as the lack of calories or hangovers, Amanda Shaffer of &quot;Slate&quot; describes these claims as &quot;dubious at best&quot;. Although inhaled alcohol does reduce the caloric content, the savings are minimal. After expressed safety and health concerns, sale or use of AWOL machines was banned in a number of American states.

The effects of solvent intoxication can vary widely depending on the dose and what type of solvent or gas is inhaled. A person who has inhaled a small amount of rubber cement or paint thinner vapor may be impaired in a manner resembling alcohol inebriation. A person who has inhaled a larger quantity of solvents or gases, or a stronger chemical, may experience stronger effects such as distortion in perceptions of time and space, hallucinations, and emotional disturbances. The effects of inhalant use are also modified by the combined use of inhalants and alcohol or other drugs.

In the short term, many users experience headaches, nausea and vomiting, slurred speech, loss of motor coordination, and wheezing. A characteristic &quot;glue sniffer&#x27;s rash&quot; around the nose and mouth is sometimes seen after prolonged use. An odor of paint or solvents on clothes, skin, and breath is sometimes a sign of inhalant abuse, and paint or solvent residues can sometimes emerge in sweat.

According to NIH, even a single session of inhalant use &quot;can disrupt heart rhythms and lower oxygen levels&quot;, which can lead to death. &quot;Regular abuse can result in serious harm to the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver.&quot;

==General risks==
Many inhalants are volatile organic chemicals and can catch fire or explode, especially when combined with smoking. As with many other drugs, users may also injure themselves due to loss of coordination or impaired judgment, especially if they attempt to operate machinery.

===Hypoxia===
All commonly abused inhalants act as asphyxiant gases, although a common myth is that their primary effects are only due to oxygen deprivation. In reality, the majority of abused inhalants still exhibit psychoactive effects, although oxygen deprivation does add to the notable effects.

Regardless of which inhalant is used, inhaling vapors or gases can lead to injury or death. One major risk is hypoxia (lack of oxygen), which can occur due to inhaling fumes from a plastic bag, or from using proper inhalation mask equipment (e.g., a medical mask for nitrous oxide) but not adding oxygen or room air.

===Frostbite===
Another danger is freezing the throat. When a gas that was stored under high pressure is released, it cools abruptly and can cause frostbite if it is inhaled directly from the container. This can occur, for example, with inhaling nitrous oxide. When nitrous oxide is used as an automotive power adder, its cooling effect is used to make the fuel-air charge denser. In a person, this effect is potentially lethal.

The second cause being especially a risk with heavier-than-air vapors such as butane or gasoline vapor. Deaths typically occur from complications related to excessive sedation and vomiting. Actual overdose from the drug does occur, however, and inhaled solvent use is statistically more likely to result in life-threatening respiratory depression than intravenous use of opioids such as heroin. Most deaths from solvent use could be prevented if individuals were resuscitated quickly when they stopped breathing and their airways cleared if they vomited. However, most inhalant use takes place when people inhale solvents by themselves or in groups of people who are intoxicated. Certain solvents are more hazardous than others, such as gasoline.

===Aerosol burn===
Use of butane, propane, nitrous oxide and other inhalants can create a risk of freezing burns from contact with the extremely cold liquid. The risk of such contact is greatly increased by the impaired judgement and motor coordination brought on by inhalant intoxication.

===Risks of specific agents===
* Methylene chloride, after being metabolized, can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.
* Carbon tetrachloride can cause significant damage to multiple systems, but its association with liver damage is so strong that it is used in animal models to induce liver injury.
* Benzene use can cause bone marrow depression. It is also a known carcinogen.

===Excess NMDA antagonism===
Toxicity may also result from the pharmacological properties of the drug; excess NMDA antagonism can completely block calcium influx into neurons and provoke cell death through apoptosis, although this is more likely to be a long-term result of chronic solvent use than a consequence of short-term use.

==In popular culture==

===Music and musical culture===
One of the early musical references to inhalant use occurs in the 1974 Elton John song &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot;, in the line &quot;I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue.&quot; Inhalant use, especially glue-sniffing, is widely associated with the late-1970s punk youth subculture in the UK and North America. Raymond Cochrane and Douglas Carroll claim that when glue sniffing became widespread in the late 1970s, it was &quot;adopted by punks because public [negative] perceptions of sniffing fitted in with their self-image&quot; as rebels against societal values. While punks at first used inhalants &quot;experimentally and as a cheap high, adult disgust and hostility [to the practice] encouraged punks to use glue sniffing as a way of shocking society.&quot; As well, using inhalants was a way of expressing their anti-corporatist DIY (do it yourself) credo; by using inexpensive household products as inhalants, punks did not have to purchase industrially manufactured liquor or beer.

One history of the punk subculture argues that &quot;substance abuse was often referred to in the music and did become synonymous with the genre, glue-sniffing especially&quot; because the youths&#x27; &quot;faith in the future had died and that the youth just didn&#x27;t care anymore&quot; due to the &quot;awareness of the threat of nuclear war and a pervasive sense of doom.&quot; In a BBC interview with a person who was a punk in the late 1970s, they said that &quot;there was a real fear of imminent nuclear war—people were sniffing glue knowing that it could kill them, but they didn&#x27;t care because they believed that very soon everybody would be dead anyway.&quot;

A number of 1970s punk rock and 1980s hardcore punk songs refer to inhalant use. The Ramones, an influential early US punk band, referred to inhalant use in several of their songs. The song &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; describes adolescent boredom, and the song &quot;Carbona not Glue&quot; states, &quot;My brain is stuck from shooting glue.&quot; An influential punk fanzine about the subculture and music took its name (&quot;Sniffin&#x27; Glue&quot;) from the Ramones song. The 1980s punk band The Dead Milkmen wrote a song, &quot;Life is Shit&quot; from their album &quot;Beelzebubba&quot;, about two friends hallucinating after sniffing glue. Punk-band-turned-hip-hop group the Beastie Boys penned a song &quot;Hold it Now – Hit It&quot;, which includes the line &quot;cause I&#x27;m beer drinkin, breath stinkin, sniffing glue.&quot; Their song &quot;Shake Your Rump&quot; includes the lines, &quot;Should I have another sip no skip it/In the back of the ride and bust with the whippits&quot;. Pop punk band Sum 41 wrote a song, &quot;Fat Lip&quot;, which refers to a character who does not &quot;make sense from all the gas you be huffing...&quot; The song &quot;Lança-Perfume&quot;, written and performed by Brazilian pop star Rita Lee, became a national hit in 1980. The song is about chloroethane and its widespread recreational sale and use during the rise of Brazil&#x27;s carnivals.

Inhalants are referred to by bands from other genres, including several grunge bands—an early 1990s genre that was influenced by punk rock. The 1990s grunge band Nirvana, which was influenced by punk music, penned a song, &quot;Dumb&quot;, in which Kurt Cobain sings &quot;my heart is broke / But I have some glue / help me inhale / And mend it with you&quot;. L7, an all-female grunge band, penned a song titled &quot;Scrap&quot; about a skinhead who inhales spray-paint fumes until his mind &quot;starts to gel&quot;. Also in the 1990s, the Britpop band Suede had a UK hit with their song &quot;Animal Nitrate&quot; whose title is a thinly veiled reference to amyl nitrite. The Beck song &quot;Fume&quot; from his &quot;Fresh Meat and Old Slabs&quot; release is about inhaling nitrous oxide. Another Beck song, &quot;Cold Ass Fashion&quot;, contains the line &quot;O.G. – Original Gluesniffer!&quot; Primus&#x27;s 1999 song &quot;Lacquer Head&quot; is about adolescents who use inhalants to get high. Hip hop performer Eminem wrote a song, &quot;Bad Meets Evil&quot;, which refers to breathing &quot;... ether in three lethal amounts.&quot; The Brian Jonestown Massacre, a retro-rock band from the 1990s, has a song, &quot;Hyperventilation&quot;, which is about sniffing model-airplane cement. Frank Zappa&#x27;s song &quot;Teenage Wind&quot; from 1981 has a reference to glue sniffing: &quot;Nothing left to do but get out the &#x27;ol glue; Parents, parents; Sniff it good now...&quot;

===Films===
A number of films have depicted or referred to the use of solvent inhalants. In the 1980 comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot;, the character of McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) refers to his inhalant use when he states, &quot;I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.&quot; In the 1996 film &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot;, the character Ruth (Laura Dern), a homeless drifter, is depicted inhaling patio sealant from a paper bag in an alleyway. In the tragicomedy &quot;Love Liza&quot;, the main character, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays a man who takes up building remote-controlled airplanes as a hobby to give him an excuse to sniff the fuel in the wake of his wife&#x27;s suicide.

Harmony Korine&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Gummo&quot; depicts adolescent boys inhaling contact cement for a high. Edet Belzberg&#x27;s 2001 documentary &quot;Children Underground&quot; chronicles the lives of Romanian street children addicted to inhaling paint. In &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, a group of boys is huffing Carbona cleaning liquid at 3 minutes and 27 seconds into the movie; further on, a boy is reading a diary describing the experience of sniffing the cleaning liquid.

In the David Lynch film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, the bizarre and manipulative character played by Dennis Hopper uses a mask to inhale amyl nitrite. In &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, Steve Martin&#x27;s character dies from nitrous oxide inhalation. The 1999 independent film &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; depicts two young low-income women inhaling aerosol computer cleaner (compressed gas) for a buzz. In &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, Michael Caine&#x27;s character is addicted to inhaling ether vapors.

In &quot;Thirteen&quot;, the main character, a teen, uses a can of aerosol computer cleaner to get high. In the action movie &quot;Shooter&quot;, an ex-serviceman on the run from the law (Mark Wahlberg) inhales nitrous oxide gas from a number of Whip-It! whipped cream canisters until he becomes unconscious. The South African film &quot;The Wooden Camera&quot; also depicts the use of inhalants by one of the main characters, a homeless teen, and their use in terms of socio-economic stratification. The title characters in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; sniff petrol; in Samson&#x27;s case, possibly causing brain damage.

In the 2004 film &quot;Taxi&quot;, Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon are trapped in a room with a burst tank containing nitrous oxide. Queen Latifah&#x27;s character curses at Fallon while they both laugh hysterically. Fallon&#x27;s character asks if it is possible to die from nitrous oxide, to which Queen Latifah&#x27;s character responds with &quot;It&#x27;s laughing gas, stupid!&quot; Neither of them had any side effects other than their voices becoming much deeper while in the room.

In the French horror film &quot;Them&quot; (2006), a French couple living in Romania are pursued by a gang of street children who break into their home at night. Olivia Bonamy&#x27;s character is later tortured and forced to inhale aurolac from a silver-colored bag. During a flashback scene in the 2001 film &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Hannibal Lecter gets Mason Verger high on amyl nitrite poppers, then convinces Verger to cut off his own face and feed it to his dogs.

===Books===
The science fiction story &quot;Waterspider&quot; by Philip K. Dick (first published in January 1964 in &quot;If&quot; magazine) contains a scene in which characters from the future are discussing the culture of the early 1950s. One character says: &quot;You mean he sniffed what they called &#x27;airplane dope&#x27;? He was a &#x27;glue-sniffer&#x27;?&quot;, to which another character replies: &quot;Hardly. That was a mania among adolescents and did not become widespread in fact until a decade later. No, I am speaking about imbibing alcohol.&quot;

The book &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; describes how the two main characters inhale diethyl ether and amyl nitrite.

===Television===
In the comedy series &quot;Newman and Baddiel in Pieces&quot;, Rob Newman&#x27;s inhaling gas from a foghorn was a running joke in the series. One episode of the &quot;Jeremy Kyle Show&quot; featured a woman with a 20-year butane gas addiction. In the series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, Charlie Kelly has an addiction to huffing glue. Additionally, season nine episode 8 shows Dennis, Mac, and Dee getting a can of gasoline to use as a solvent, but instead end up taking turns huffing from the canister.

A 2008 episode of the reality show &quot;Intervention&quot; (season 5, episode 9) featured Allison, who was addicted to huffing computer duster for the short-lived, psychoactive effects. Allison has since achieved a small but significant cult following among bloggers and YouTube users. Several remixes of scenes from Allison&#x27;s episode can be found online. Since 2009, Allison has worked with drug and alcohol treatment centers in Los Angeles County. In the seventh episode of the fourteenth season of &quot;South Park&quot;, Towelie, an anthropomorphic towel, develops an addiction to inhaling computer duster. In the show &quot;Squidbillies&quot;, the main character Early Cuyler is often seen inhaling gas or other substances.

<doc id="15505" wikidata="Q838088" url="?curid=15505" title="Iceman (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Iceman (Robert Louis &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and is a founding member of the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #1 (Sept. 1963). Iceman is a mutant born with superhuman abilities. He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing water vapor around him. This allows him to freeze objects, as well as cover his body with ice.

Iceman has a relatively high profile among &quot;X-Men&quot; characters due to being frequently adapted into X-Men and Spider-Man-related media, including video games, animated series, and films. The character later received widespread media attention when a storyline retconned the original version of the character as a closeted gay man in &quot;All-New X-Men&quot; #40 (April 2015), leading to his coming out.

Following the publication of this storyline, Iceman has been described as one of the most notable and powerful gay characters in comic books.

From 2000 to 2014, Shawn Ashmore portrayed Iceman in the 20th Century Fox &quot;X-Men&quot; films and voiced the character in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (September 1963). Lee later admitted that Iceman was created essentially as a copy of the Human Torch, only using the opposite element for his power.

Iceman was featured in two self-titled limited comic book miniseries, one in 1984–85 written by J. M. DeMatteis and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, with art by Karl Kerschl. DeMatteis said of the first series, &quot;It was my idea, so there was no one to blame but myself. I&#x27;ll just say that it was a mistake and if the series made any sense whatsoever it was due to [editor] Bob Budiansky. That was a case where the editor&#x27;s input was really needed—and Bob was a big help.&quot;

A mainstay in most X-Men titles, Iceman has been a main character in both &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; and the second volume of &quot;X-Men&quot; and was also featured in &quot;The Champions&quot; from 1975 to 1978 and &quot;The New Defenders&quot; from 1983 to 1986 as a member. He was a main character in the first volume of &quot;X-Factor&quot;, and a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in &quot;X-Men: The Hidden Years&quot; and &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;.

In April 2015, in issue 40 of &quot;All-New X-Men&quot;, a time-displaced version of the teenaged Iceman was revealed as gay by his teammate, Jean Grey, who discerned this with her telepathic ability. This raised questions, because the character&#x27;s adult, present-day counterpart had previously been portrayed dating women. In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #600, which was published in November that year, the young Iceman confronts his older self, who confirms that he is gay as well but repressed his true self, not wanting to be both gay and a mutant. In 2017, Iceman received his first ongoing solo series, which focused on the adult Bobby Drake coming to terms with life as an out gay man, his status as an Omega-level mutant, his legacy as a hero and fighting some of the biggest villains in the Marvel Universe. The book had been cancelled, with its last issue being in early 2018. However, Marvel later reversed the decision and announced that a new book written by original writer Sina Grace as a part of their Fresh Start initiative and was released in 2019.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Robert Louis &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake was born in Floral Park, Long Island, New York, to William Robert Drake and Madeline Beatrice Bass-Drake. His parents are Irish Catholics. His mother was also stated to be Jewish. Bobby&#x27;s powers first manifested when he was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight, Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard of the incident, came looking for him in the form of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own &quot;protection&quot;. While Bobby sat in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a young man named Scott Summers walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After Bobby turned him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which was soon ended by the arrival of Professor Charles Xavier.

=== Original X-Men ===
After Xavier spoke with Bobby and his parents, Bobby&#x27;s parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his &quot;school for gifted youngsters&quot;. Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the X-Men. He is later joined by Henry &quot;Hank&quot; McCoy, Jean Grey, and Warren Worthington III as the founding members of the X-Men. Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. Appearing in his original snow covered form, he first battles Magneto along with the rest of the team, and later the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Bobby Drake&#x27;s first girlfriend is Zelda. Not long after, he takes on a new ice-covered form. He then teams up with the Human Torch for the first time. The two would become close friends as time went on. With the X-Men, he visits the Savage Land and meets Ka-Zar for the first time. He then battles the Juggernaut, and is badly injured in his first battle against the Sentinels. He next battles Magneto by himself. Later, he visits Subterranea for the first time. Then, he and Beast battle the Maha Yogi. During his original stint with the X-Men, Drake pursues a relationship with Lorna Dane, although the relationship does not last. Iceman is among the original X-Men captured by Krakoa, leading to a new incarnation of X-Men of which he is not a member. With most of the original team, he quits the X-Men.

===Champions and Defenders===
Iceman moves to the American west coast to attend UCLA and becomes a founding member of The Champions of Los Angeles. However, the Champions soon dissolve.

Iceman is then abducted by Master Mold, and alongside Angel, he encounters the Hulk. Iceman next aids the Thing in battling the Circus of Crime. Drake retires from life as a superhero to earn a college degree in accounting – but apparently at a college on the east coast, not UCLA. While in college, he briefly rejoins the X-Men to rescue the captives of Arcade&#x27;s henchman, Miss Locke.

Iceman is reunited with Beast, encounters Cloud, and then returns as a full-time superhero in an incarnation of the Defenders alongside his former teammates, Angel and Beast. He also battles Professor Power&#x27;s Secret Empire while with the Defenders. After the Defenders disband, Drake embarks on his career as an accountant.

Some time later, Iceman encounters Mirage, the &quot;daughter&quot; of Oblivion. Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.

===X-Factor===
The original X-Men, including Iceman, reunite to form the superhero team X-Factor. With this new team, he encounters Apocalypse for the first time.

During his time with the team, Loki captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the Frost Giants. Loki enhances Bobby&#x27;s powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the Frost Giants. Iceman is rescued by Thor. Loki&#x27;s tampering increases Bobby&#x27;s powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the Right, he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the Empire State Building. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.

With X-Factor, Bobby then defeats Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen. Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help Boom Boom gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the New Mutants and their sister team, the X-Terminators. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of Infectia.

Bobby also develops a romantic relationship with Opal Tanaka. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza, which Bobby helps her out with.

After the &quot;Muir Island Saga&quot;, Iceman rejoins the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.

===Back with the X-Men===
When he rejoined the X-Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt, this made him believe he reached the limit of his powers. The X-Men were separated into two groups, Iceman was placed in the gold team, led by Storm, along with fellow original X-Men Jean Grey (now without a code name) and Archangel.

One day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake&#x27;s prejudices about the girl. When Bobby came across Mikhail Rasputin he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it. By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.

Too busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.

Later, as he was checking on Emma Frost who was in a comatose state after the mutant Trevor Fitzroy unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the Hellions, the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown. Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby&#x27;s mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby&#x27;s body.

Bobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.

During the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop Legion from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the Age of Apocalypse. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman&#x27;s fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue&#x27;s mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship, Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.

When the entity known as Onslaught first appeared, Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects, along with Storm, Cyclops and Wolverine. They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named Post, in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman&#x27;s chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form. He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.

When Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father&#x27;s connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.

Zero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the Morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.

Much later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny&#x27;s journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the Living Monolith. They also learned that the Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War. Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse&#x27;s new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and life force to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.

After that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary&#x27;s satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.

Iceman was recruited by the living ship Prosh, along with other mutants, like Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad and Juggernaut, to preserve evolution and save it. In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men. He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channelling the power and not turning his body into ice.

===Second mutation===

During a heated battle with a recently evolved Black Tom Cassidy, he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.

Nobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse Annie Ghazikhanian recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.

He developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like Stacy X, Juggernaut and Northstar, he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending Nightcrawler by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.

Bobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist – feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a &quot;mere&quot; human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.

Upon encountering Azazel and his followers, Iceman&#x27;s body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.

===Rogue&#x27;s Team===
Iceman joins Rogue&#x27;s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member. Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the Children of the Vault. The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc.

The next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him. The team was again successful, but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88. Cable took the team, including Bobby, to his island so Rogue could get treatment.

While on Cable&#x27;s island, the team and Iceman began working to defeat the Shi&#x27;ar weapon known as the Hecatomb. During the chaos, he shared a passionate kiss with Mystique. Even as he did so, he saved many lives by containing the explosion of the Conquistador, and, later, the Hecatomb itself.

===Blinded by the Light===
As the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue&#x27;s childhood home, it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship. This was a front, as Mystique was using Iceman and the X-Men as a Marauder spy for Mister Sinister. Marauders soon infiltrated the house; they attempt to gain access to Destiny&#x27;s Diaries on the order of Mr. Sinister (who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything that could foretell the future). Bobby and Cannonball escape from the Marauders in the X-Jet, with help from Emma Frost. They are pursued by Sunfire; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders&#x27; plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny&#x27;s Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.

Cannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier&#x27;s Cerebro to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell. Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape.

===Messiah Complex===

The New X-Men team decided to raid the headquarters of the Purifiers in Washington, D.C., but were forced to retreat. Pixie teleported them back to the mansion in a rush, but the entire team was scattered between D.C. and Westchester. Iceman, after recovering from his injuries, volunteered to go look for them and was given telepathic directions by Emma Frost.

Iceman was successful in finding the New X-Men, most of them injured. On the way back, they found that the O*N*E* Sentinels guarding the Xavier Institute had become infected by nano-Sentinels and attacked the school. Iceman and New X-Man X-23 helped out in the battle with the O*N*E* Sentinels. With the help of Dust and X-23, the X-Men were able to survive this battle but the nano-Sentinel infected human escaped.

Soon, Iceman participated in the final battle against the Marauders, the Acolytes, and Predator X. He was one of the X-Men who came running in to fight Predator X after it swallowed Wolverine whole. However, he also witnesses his mentor, Professor Xavier, &quot;killed&quot; by Bishop&#x27;s bullet, which was not meant for him.

===Divided We Stand===

Iceman arrives in San Francisco, where he was set to meet Hepzibah, Warpath, and Angel. All four are caught in the effects of a citywide illusion created by Martinique Jason, who used her powers to transform the city into a hippie paradise. Now calling himself &quot;Frosty&quot;, he and the others are sent by Martinique to confront Scott Summers and Emma Frost. Emma Frost is able to break up the illusion and free everyone. They eventually set up their base of operations in San Francisco as X-Men.

===Secret Invasion and Utopia===

Iceman is one of the X-Men that assists in fighting the Skrull invasion in San Francisco.

Iceman rescues Colossus from Venom and is later made a part of a team to battle Emma Frost&#x27;s Dark X-Men. During the final battle on Utopia, Iceman teams up with the X-Students to take on Mimic. Iceman had the labor of providing water to the population. He attempted to use humor to keep everyone&#x27;s spirits up even though he believed that the situation was helpless and that the X-Men were living in the last days of mutantkind. Bobby then helped defeat Predator X and also helped stop Selene&#x27;s resurrected army&#x27;s invasion of Utopia.

===Second Coming===
During the battle with Bastion&#x27;s Nimrod Sentinels, Iceman is severely injured following an attack from one of them that reversed his ice form and left him with burns on his body. He is only there for a short time because his mutant powers help him minimize the injuries he suffered and he is seen back in battle alongside Psylocke and the other X-Men.

===Post Schism===
Early solicitations show that after Wolverine and Cyclops have a major falling out, Wolverine decides to branch off and open &quot;The Jean Grey School for Higher Learning&quot; back in New York. Iceman is the first person Wolverine approaches and recruits to his new X-Men squad as both a professor and teammate. Iceman is chosen because Wolverine feels he has the kind of spirit the new school needs. He also has an off-and-on romantic relationship with Kitty Pryde.

===Extraordinary X-Men===
When the Terrigen became toxic for mutants, Iceman was one of the recruits in Storm&#x27;s new team dedicated to protecting mutants from the Terrigen by leading them to X-haven. Iceman mostly works alongside Nightcrawler, helping him search for Colossus after he is transformed into one of Apocalypse&#x27;s new horsemen. Iceman and Nightcrawler manage to track Colossus to Egypt, where he ambushes them and almost kills them until another squad of X-Men comes in to help. After that Iceman joins the X-Men when they declare war against the Inhumans after discovering that in a matter of weeks the Terrigen will render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants.

===Fantastic Four Returns===
Iceman is among the heroes summoned by Mister Fantastic - a group consisting of former substitute members of the Fantastic Four - to help the Future Foundation against the cosmic entity known as the Griever. However, the Human Torch objects to Iceman&#x27;s presence during the battle, emphatically asserting that Iceman was &quot;never&quot; a member of the FF. Iceman states that he &quot;was&quot; made a member during an adventure involving Namor. The Torch simply counters with &quot;That didn&#x27;t COUNT!&quot;

As recounted in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; vol. 6 #24, Iceman&#x27;s induction into the FF did not feature Namor, but occurred during the early days of the FF and the original X-Men. One morning years ago, the youthful Torch &#x27;quit&#x27; the FF in an immature fit of pique. That same day, the sensitive teen-aged Iceman left the X-Men after being laughed at by his peers for his poor showing in a Danger Room exercise. Iceman encountered the remaining FF members and assisted them with a day-long series of crises, being casually admitted to the team as a result. When the Torch discovered that he had been replaced, he attacked Iceman during the FF&#x27;s current battle and forcefully declared that Iceman was &quot;not&quot; an FF member. The Invisible Girl forced the pair to work together to help defeat the FF&#x27;s final opponent of the day. Iceman was then telepathically summoned back to the X-Men by Professor X, who praised his student&#x27;s performance. Mr. Fantastic told the departing Iceman that he could return to the FF whenever he wanted. The Torch was also &#x27;readmitted&#x27;, with a penance of a week&#x27;s laundry detail.

In the present time, Iceman returns the teen-aged Franklin Richards to the FF&#x27;s Yancy Street home/headquarters from Krakoa and is recognized by the building&#x27;s security system as an FF member. This angers the Torch once again, and he declares that Iceman had &quot;never&quot; been a member of the team. The two men bicker over the issue until Iceman realizes that the Torch was never upset about Iceman replacing him on the &quot;team&quot;, but believes that he was trying to take his place in the FF &quot;family&quot;. The Torch finally admits that what bothered him most was that other substitute members—who were also considered family by the FF—were always brought in due to major events, and that if Iceman was the actual first substitute member, that meant the Torch had given up his place &quot;over nothing.&quot; The Torch ultimately drops the matter of Iceman&#x27;s legitimacy and says that he was an official substitute FF member, and is also a part of the FF &#x27;family&#x27;.

===Solo series===
After being outed as gay by the time-displaced Jean Grey, the younger time-displaced Iceman confronts his older self, asking him why he has been presenting as straight for most of his adult life. The older Bobby breaks down and admits that he has known he was gay for a long time but forcibly repressed that part of himself, fearful of how others would react. He further acknowledges that he was scared to reveal his true self to the world due to already facing prejudice for being a mutant and not wanting to receive hatred for another part of himself. Following all of this, Bobby decides to take a break from the limelight and focus on himself, declining to join the new X-team formed by Kitty Pryde, instead acting as a reserve member and teaching classes at the Xavier School. After a training session with his younger self, Bobby sees the time-displaced Iceman head out for a date with his boyfriend Romeo while he tries to set up an online dating profile to meet guys. He receives a text from his mother stating that his father has had a heart attack so Bobby rushes to the hospital only to be chastises by his father for missing family events due to his commitments as a superhero. Following a brief battle in the hospital, Bobby&#x27;s parents ask him to leave, angry that their mutant son is bringing yet more trouble into their lives. On a mission with Kitty to rescue a new mutant, she confronts Bobby about being gay, asking why he could not tell her himself, meaning she had to find out from a secondary source. She reassures him that she only wants to help him and lets him know she is there if he ever wants to talk but suggests he should come out to his parents. Bobby arranges dinner with his family but he is constantly subjected anti-mutant rhetoric from his parents. The dinner is interrupted by a gang of Purifiers but, although Iceman takes them down quickly and the lives of his parents, they are angry that their house has been destroyed because of him and send him away (although his mother promises to try and convince his father to visit him at the X-Mansion). When the mutant that he and Kitty rescues goes missing, Iceman tracks him to a nearby nightclub where he discovers that Daken is responsible for luring him away. Daken tries to flirt with Bobby to distract him but Iceman freezes him and attempts to convince the mutant to return to the Xavier School, though he refuses. Daken mocks Bobby, saying that he can smell his fear and insecurity. Upon returning, Kitty surprises Bobby by revealing that his parents have arrived for a visit. He tells them he is gay and they both react negatively, angry that their son is both a mutant and a gay man. They chastise him for letting everyone else find out before them and try to convince him that he is straight, due to having been with women in the past. The family argument is interrupted by Juggernaut, who attacks the school looking for the young X-Men. Iceman defeats him by pushing his powers and returns to the mansion to find his father is still there. He had obtained Bobby&#x27;s draft of a coming out letter from Kitty and the two men begin to reconcile.

Bobby reconnects with his former Champions teammates, Angel, Hercules, Ghost Rider and Darkstar, so they reminisce about their time with Black Widow. Bobby runs into a guy, Judah, while out shopping and he agrees to meet him that night at a local gay bar, with the rest of the Champions acting as his wingmen. The date appears to be going well but is interrupted by an attack by some Sentinels. Bobby&#x27;s relationship with Judah continues to develop and he decides to move to L.A. to be closer to him. While fighting Pyro with his younger self, Bobby explains that his mother has finally made contact with him for the first time since he came out and that she wants to invite both of them to dinner. Time-displaced Iceman agrees on the condition that Bobby tries to talk sense into Romeo, who hasn&#x27;t called him in weeks. Meanwhile, Daken begins training his new mutant protégée for a secret mission. When both the younger Bobby and the older Bobby arrive at the restaurant, their parents see the younger Bobby as a chance to raise a new son in a way that suits them but the time-displaced Iceman refuses, saying that he is still gay and wants to live life on his own terms before they both storm out. During Bobby&#x27;s moving away party at the X-Mansion, Daken uses the Purifiers to distract the other X-Men while he and his apprentice infiltrate the school and ambush Bobby. The young mutant uses his levelled-up powers to increase Daken&#x27;s strength by turning him into Apocalypse&#x27;s horseman Death and he mortally wounds Judah with his claws before engaging Iceman in combat. Bobby manages to defeat Daken with a kiss which freezes Death&#x27;s powers but Daken escapes and Judah breaks up with Bobby because his life is too much for him to deal with.

After teaming with Bishop to help the Morlocks who came under threat by Mister Sinister, Bobby finds himself approached by Emma Frost who asks him for his help. Ignoring Kitty&#x27;s protests, he agrees and Emma explains that her father, who subjected her brother Christian to conversion therapy before having him institutionalized, has recently let him out and reinstalled him as the new heir to the Frost business empire. When they arrive, they discover that Christian has murdered their father and is exhibiting his own powers. Bobby and Emma help to free Christian from his mental breakdown and Emma decides to stay with him. Joining with his friends Spider-Man and Firestar, Bobby discovers that Sinister was behind the attack on the Morlocks and confronts him in his safehouse. Sinister, intent on trying to unlock the secrets of Iceman&#x27;s DNA by dissecting him, sends forth an army of experimental ice creatures but Bobby&#x27;s Omega Level powers absorb them all into him and he fires Mister Sinister into space. Celebrating his birthday, Bobby is confronted by Ice Wizard, a future version of himself from an alternate timeline. Ice Wizard warns Bobby that he must quit the X-Men and stop using his powers to avoid a world-destroying series of events happening. He explains that Daken seduces him and manipulates him into sacrificing the other X-Men before betraying him and gaining Thanos-level powers. Bobby is adamant that this won&#x27;t happen and the two engage in battle. Jean Grey arrives and Bobby finally confronts her for the actions of her younger self when she outed him. Bobby explains to Ice Wizard that he is going to live life on his terms and that nobody, not even his future self, is going to decide for him. Bobby returns to his birthday celebration where Christian arrives and hands him a large sum of money which Bobby gives to the Morlocks. A content Bobby messages Judah, asking if he would like to meet up as friends.

===Hellfire Gala and The Astonishing Iceman===

Bobby was one of the first casualties of the third annual Hellfire Gala, in which he did battle with Nimrod. He had gained the upper hand in the fight at first, only to be injected with cellular napalm that literally melted him into nothing before the horrified eyes of Kitty Pryde and Romeo. But sometime later, it was shown that Romeo had used his Inhuman powers and his emotional connection to Bobby to re-integrate him and restore him to life. However, his physical and mental cohesion is reliant on his proximity to Romeo.

==Powers and abilities==

Iceman possesses the power to instantly decrease the temperature of ambient water vapor in his immediate environment to below zero degrees Celsius, thereby freezing it into ice. He is able to make ice that will not break unless he wills it to. In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures, including projectiles, shields, ladders, baseball bats, etc. Iceman often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, moving him along the slick surface at high speeds. He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time, such as miniature cities. Originally, Iceman&#x27;s own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active, reaching within a few tenths of a second (now his body usually converts to organic ice; see below). Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the thermal energy level of objects around him. Because cold is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually &#x27;emanate&#x27; cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy. As mentioned by writer Mike Carey, Iceman is &quot;an Omega-level mutant ... [and] has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world.&quot; Iceman has yet to tap into his full mutant potential, but over the years he has taken more interest in developing his abilities.

In his early appearances, Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow; hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice-man. Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.

Iceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength. He can survive not only as ice, but as liquid water and water vapor. He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing. Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the &quot;&quot; story arc. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of David Haller. Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.

Iceman&#x27;s powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her Hellions. During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people&#x27;s bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas. Not even the combined might of the X-Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman&#x27;s body. Following this, Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively. While together they made some initial progress, she refused to train him further. Instead he turned to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agreed to tutor him.

When Iceman was injected with Mister Sinister&#x27;s neuro-inhibitor by Mystique, he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him, rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him.

During the 2013–2014 &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot; storyline, Iceman&#x27;s future self revealed that he has the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures—demonstrating a Hulk-like physique and intellect—has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood.

Aside from his superhuman powers, Iceman is also a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received combat training at Xavier&#x27;s School as well as coaching from the Black Widow and Hercules while serving with the Champions of Los Angeles. Iceman has taken as much combat training as Cyclops or Beast.

==Characterization==

===Personality===
According to writer Mike Carey &quot;one of Iceman&#x27;s best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates—not cold but transparent. &#x27;He&#x27;s devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Also, he&#x27;s obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes.&quot;

===Friendships and relationships===
Iceman had a long term relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal Tanaka. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man Polaris, but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. Northstar developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this. Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School&#x27;s nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar. When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok. Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men&#x27;s enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty. He had a relationship with Kitty Pryde.

Iceman has long-lasting friendships with Spider-Man, Firestar and the Human Torch.

===Sexuality===
In &quot;All-New X-Men&quot; #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn&#x27;t cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality, and comes out to fellow gay X-Man Anole in &quot;Extraordinary X-Men&quot; #6. The end of the Extermination X-Men event saw the redirecting of the time displaced version of Bobby back into the &quot;closet&quot; when he returned to his original timeline alongside the other X-Men, due to a mind lock by Jean Grey. In the present day, the current version retains both sets of memories and remains an out gay man.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical reception ===
Peter Eckhardt of &quot;CBR.com&quot; referred to Iceman as &quot;the biggest name amongst queer X-Men,&quot; writing, &quot;Iceman is an Omega-Level mutant and a longtime fan-favorite character. Iceman was only recently revealed as gay in a story handled somewhat clumsily in 2014&#x27;s &quot;All-New X-Men #40&quot; (written by Brian Michael Bendis and drawn by Mahmud Asrar). Nevertheless, writers as far back as the 1980s hinted that Bobby was gay, particularly in the 1990s when Iceman struggled with his sense of identity. Today, Iceman&#x27;s story inspires and excites those looking for anything from understanding their own identity to epic, ice-based colossi.&quot; Mey Rude of &quot;Out&quot; stated, &quot;While Northstar was the first out gay superhero in a Marvel comic, Iceman is his more famous gay X-Men teammate. Bobby Drake didn&#x27;t come out until just recently in the comics, following some time travel shenanigans, but he’s already become a gay favorite.&quot; Alyssa Gawaran of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; said, &quot;Iceman, also a big part of the X-Men in the Marvel Comics, is one of the more groundbreaking LGBTQ+ characters in Marvel. Iceman broke boundaries in the franchise as he became the first-ever gay leading superhero to headline a comic, the &quot;coming out moment&quot; reported in a 2015 &quot;Vox&quot; article. Marvel has recently released &quot;Marauders Annual #1&quot; that features a very heartwarming prom segment between Bobby Drake (Iceman) and his boyfriend, a new face to the comics, Christian Frost.&quot; Joshua Yehl of &quot;IGN&quot; described Iceman as &quot;the perfect gay boyfriend,&quot; saying, &quot;Bobby isn’t out to be the biggest, baddest guy around. He’s a more grounded and relatable guy, and while he often broadcasts his cocky attitude and wisecracking humor during battle, he’s proven time and time again that his heart is in the right place when it comes to being there for his teammates. There’s something incredibly charming about a guy who could become the Indomitable Iceman, laying waste to enemies with his icy wrath, yet he chooses to stay boy-next-door Bobby Drake, a funny, self-sacrificing guy who values being a friend and hero over becoming the most powerful guy in the room. Being gay has a lot in common with being a mutant, as excellently displayed during Iceman’s “coming out” scene in X2: X-Men United. You’re born that way, you will face bullying and discrimination for it, and those who claim to be your friends and family may turn their backs on you because of it. Bobby’s experiences as both a mutant and an out gay man would make him an incredibly empathetic and understanding partner, one who would share his feelings and be there to help with yours. So even though he may not be the strongest mutant around, he’d be a hero to you in every way that counts.&quot;

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; - 2011 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; #1 was the 161st best selling comic book in March 2011.

Ryan K. Lindsay of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; #1 &quot;as much fun as you want, but as pithy as you expect too,&quot; asserting, &quot;A one-shot should be a comic that stands on its own, and this issue certainly does that. It needs to give you enough narrative meat to feel like the money was well invested, and this issue mostly does that. It should elicit some form of strong reaction from you in the few pages it has, and this issue works hard to make you laugh and is more successful than not. See Namor score some bagels and Googam become a broheim. It&#x27;s not earth shattering but it is solid fun and sometimes that&#x27;s just what you need. Pick up this comic and feel the freedom of old funny done-in-one comics just like they did when you were a kid where the parts add up to greater than the actual whole.&quot; David Brothers of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; ranked &quot;Iceman and Angel&quot; #1 10th in their &quot;10 Top Marvel Comics Coming in March 2011,&quot; saying, &quot;One of the best things we don&#x27;t see much of any more is the relationship between the original X-Men. The modern series is all about hard decisions, hard edges, and hard core self protection, but back in the day, they were just a bunch of kids who hung out together. Iceman and Angel in particular were pretty fun together, because one was a goofball and the other was a self-styled ladies man. Brian Clevinger has proven that he can do stories like this, where he takes a slice of time and expands on it in a meaningful way, and Juan Doe is a pretty great artist. Add in GOOM, a classic Marvel villain, and you&#x27;ve got a story that I think is going to be a pretty good read. &quot;X-Men First Class&quot; may be dead in name, but these one-shots are doing a pretty good job of keeping the feeling alive.&quot;

==== &quot;Iceman&quot; - 2017 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 was the 62nd best selling comic book in June 2017. &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 was the 655-656th best selling comic book in 2017.

Matthew Aguilar of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, writing, &quot;On the art side of things, the book is a mixed bag. Alessandro Vitti&#x27;s pencils and Rachelle Rosenberg&#x27;s colors shine when ice is involved in some form or fashion, as referenced early and later in the book. In the middle, though things get a bit muddy, and the facial expressions suffer. Not enough to detract in a huge way, but the book definitely improves when Drake is in his ice form. Overall writer Sina Grace is off to an excellent start here, providing a refreshing look into a fan favorite character that has always been more than his powers but needed someone to bring that out of him. It looks like this time is up for the task.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 a grade of 7.8 out of 10, stating, &quot;&quot;Iceman&quot; #1 doesn&#x27;t make the strongest case for this series as an ongoing story, as it could just as easily be a standalone one-shot starring the frozen X-Man. But it&#x27;s a very well-executed story regardless, one that showcases Bobby Drake&#x27;s crazy personal life while still making the most of his incredible powers. Iceman is shaping up to be a worthy addition to the ResurrXion lineup.&quot;

==== &quot;Iceman&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 was the 43rd best selling comic book in September 2018. &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 was the 508th best selling comic book in 2018.

Jamie Lovett of &quot;Comicook.com&quot; called &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 a &quot;well-crafted book,&quot; saying,&quot;&quot;Iceman&quot; #1 is a stellar return. Most impressive is how the issue is completely capable of standing alone, but also seeds an exciting story to come. Even a casual X-Men fan will recognize the deadliness of the threat behind this issue&#x27;s attempts to recreate the &quot;Mutant Massacre.&quot; Longtime X-Men fans, and fans of Iceman, in particular, will get something extra out of the last page reveal of who&#x27;s waiting for Bobby at home. &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 is a triumphant return for an underappreciated series. The longer Sina Grace writes Bobby Drake, the more Iceman develops into a truly compelling, relatable leading man. Grace found the perfect artistic partners in Nathan Stockman and Frederico Blee. Here&#x27;s hoping Iceman gets more of the attention it deserves the second time around.&quot; Maite Molina of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; gave &quot;Iceman&quot; #1 a score of 80%, asserting, &quot;&quot;Iceman&quot; #1 is a resolute start to a new run. Thanks to some palpable character development and an intriguing plot, the issue succeeds in gripping a reader’s attention. The stage has been set for some intriguing new story arcs, ones that will feature some familiar, sinister villains. Hopefully, Bobby Drake is ready for these impending challenges, ones that he may not even see coming.&quot;

==Other versions==

===Time-displaced Iceman===
====All-New X-Men====
Following the war with the Phoenix Five, as Cyclops begins to lash out against government oppression of mutants, a chance comment by Bobby about how the old Cyclops wouldn&#x27;t tolerate what he is currently doing inspires Beast to travel back in time and recruit the original five X-Men to stop Cyclops. The team decides to stay in the present instead of returning into the past. They are now called the All-New X-Men and led by Kitty Pryde. The past and present Bobby are particularly shocked when they see each other. The younger Bobby is especially shocked by the older Bobby&#x27;s Omega level powers, like creating ice golems, and especially his future &quot;Ice Wizard&quot; self in the Battle of the Atom. Eventually he and the All-New X-Men and the Guardians of the Galaxy travel to the Shiar Empire to rescue Jean Grey from a trial for the genocide that her future Dark Phoenix self committed. The team is then teleported into the Ultimate Marvel universe, where he stumbles into Mole Man&#x27;s lair. He proudly creates his first ice golem in order to escape.

Returning to their universe, the team are reunited with Cyclops when they are called upon to aid the Guardians of the Galaxy again in retrieving the fabled Black Vortex. Cyclops, Iceman and Groot become superpowered by the Vortex before returning it to Captain Marvel.

Later, the younger, time-displaced Bobby is forced to confront being gay by his teammate, Jean, who privately asks him why he calls women &quot;hot&quot;, when she knows via her psychic abilities that he is gay. This causes the younger Bobby to speculate as to the complicated identity issues faced by his older self and the decisions his older self may have made in the time between them. Together with the young Jean, the young Bobby confronts his older self, who admits to being gay, having &#x27;concealed&#x27; that part of himself so that he could have avoid being prejudiced against for another part of himself.

Bobby joins the time-displaced Cyclops, Angel and Beast, as well as Kid Apocalypse, All-New Wolverine and Oya as they road-trip around America trying to make their own mark on the world. Bobby is initially reluctant to talk about his sexuality with his teammates until Oya and Kid Apocalypse take him to a gay club in an attempt to make him more comfortable. He embarrasses himself and runs into Romeo, an Inhuman with the ability to manipulate and feel others&#x27; emotions. Romeo makes Bobby more comfortable and the two begin a relationship. The two are later caught in the middle when the X-Men declare war on the Inhumans. Bobby joins the X-Men when they attack New Attilan but quickly breaks off from the battle to find Romeo, with the two escaping together.

====X-Men Blue====

After the X-Men&#x27;s war against the Inhumans for the Terrigen ends, Iceman joins the rest of the young X-Men on an attempted return to their original timeline but they quickly realize that theirs isn&#x27;t part of the Earth 616 timeline, leaving them stuck in that present time with no knowledge where they were originally from. Upon learning this, Iceman joins the rest of the young X-Men and leaves the rest of the X-Men to find their place in the world. Iceman then joins Magneto in Madripoor along with the rest of the time-displaced X-Men; however, due to a lack of trust in their new leader, the X-Men make plans and train in case Magneto returns to his former villainous ways to kill them. Instead of training with his teammates, Iceman spends most of his time trying to reach out Romeo unsuccessfully, placing him into a stupor.

The time-displaced X-Men continue fighting crime in the present day although following a battle with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants from an alternate timeline, they are disheartened to realize that they must eventually return to their original time. This particularly upsets Bobby who is sad that all of their growth as people will be undone once they go back. While the team are in space working alongside Venom to defeat the Poisons, a race of mind-controlling symbiotes, Magneto attacks several Hellfire Club parties searching for Emma Frost. The X-Men find her first and offer to protect her from Magneto although they quickly discover that he had taken mutant growth hormones to enhance his powers and, rather than kill the team he has mentored, Magneto leaves. Young Jean senses that they must return to their own time period soon and the X-Men have heart-to-hearts with their adult selves. During a game of pool with older Iceman, Bobby breaks down, knowing that his memory of the present must be erased and he will be forced back into the closet and, despite Iceman&#x27;s best efforts to convince his younger self that he will grow up to be someone awesome, Bobby admits that he likes the person he has already become but that remaining that person is no longer an option. As the team prepare to leave, a news report announces that Magneto has formed a new brotherhood, leading the X-Men to decide to stay in the present for a little while longer.

====Extermination====
While en route to help young Cyclops, Bobby is attacked by a mysterious assailant but is rescued by Cable, who urges him to flee. Iceman refuses but is incapacitated and captured while Cable is killed. Young Jean attempts to use Cerebro to locate Bobby but states that she is unable to find him. In a secret lab, the man who attacked Bobby is revealed to be a time-displaced version of Cable who has him locked up in a tube. Kitty gathers all of the X-Men, who split into four teams tasked with protecting one of the remaining time-displaced X-Men. Young Jean uses her telepathy to guide her team to young Cable&#x27;s base, where he admits to murdering his older self because he had failed in his mission to maintain the timeline by allowing the young X-Men to stay in the present for so long. They discover that Cable has been genetically modifying young Iceman so that he looks the way he looked when he left his original time period. He releases Bobby and teleports them all to Atlantis, where Ahab is attempting to kill young Cyclops so that the timeline can never be restored. The X-Men find themselves overwhelmed by Ahab&#x27;s forces and Cable convinces the young X-Men that they must return home immediately in order to save the others. Young Iceman breaks down to his older self, admitting he doesn&#x27;t want to be forced back into the closet but the present day Bobby tells him that his younger self finally allowed him to accept that he was gay and promises that he will be finally be able to truly be himself when he grows up. Cable then sends the X-Men back to their original time, informing them that everything will return to normal once they officially close the time loop. In 1964, the young X-Men change into their original clothes and young Jean performs a mind wipe so that they won&#x27;t remember their time in the present day although she informs them that she is able to lock their memories away so that, once the loop is closed, their older selves will regain those memories. Back in modern day, the founding X-Men inherit the memories of their younger selves allowing them to defeat Ahab. Returned to their original time, the young X-Men forget about their adventures in the present and are greeted by Professor Xavier.

===1602===
Iceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;, a member of the group of &quot;witchbreeds&quot; founded by Carlos Javier and led by Scotius Summerisle. He is the nephew of naval commander Sir Francis Drake. As in the Marvel Universe, he generates ice and can assume a physical ice form.

===&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;===

In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, Bobby, along with the rest of the X-Men, is trained by Magneto. Because Magneto is harder on his students than Professor X, Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart&#x27;s sense of humor. Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls &quot;moisture molecular inversion&quot;, though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse&#x27;s defeat, Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister. A couple of months later, Iceman, Exodus, Wild Child, and Morph were sent on a secret mission by Magneto; for a time, only Wild Child&#x27;s fate was revealed.

Iceman returned in the &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; arc &quot;The Dark Angel Saga&quot;, when the title team was forced to travel to the AoA reality. He abandoned the X-Men during a battle with the minions of Weapon X, who had by this time been transformed into that world&#x27;s new Apocalypse, a defection later revealed to be the result of Iceman&#x27;s having lost faith in his X-Men&#x27;s ability to save their world. He was soon brought to Earth-616 by the Dark Beast, where he joined forces with Archangel on his quest to eradicate all life on Earth so he could create a new evolution process. Tired of seeing the people he cared about being killed fighting what he thought to be an unwinnable war, Drake agreed to help Archangel – despite the latter&#x27;s now being the mainstream Marvel Universe&#x27;s version of Drake&#x27;s X-Men&#x27;s arch-enemy, Apocalypse – in exchange for transport to the relative paradise that was Earth-616.

After X-Force defeated Archangel, Bobby managed to escape with McCoy and most of Archangel&#x27;s other minions, but eventually broke away from them and went into hiding, living a life of hedonistic bliss in Madripoor. The &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; version of Nightcrawler – who, after being brought to Earth-616 along with the rest of his world&#x27;s X-Men to help take down Archangel, decided to stay behind there in order to track down and kill the various villains who also came to the mainstream Marvel Universe – eventually tracked Bobby down to execute him for his treason. Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake&#x27;s avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there&#x27;s not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers. Nightcrawler quickly disables his former friend, and shoves him into an incinerator, killing the once noble hero.

===&quot;Earth X&quot;===
During the miniseries &quot;Earth X&quot;, Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting. He moves to the Arctic regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the Inuit. Due to a series of events where Earth&#x27;s orbital path moves, Bobby is able to return to the United States to aid in the battle against the demon Mephisto.

===&quot;House of M&quot;===
In the alternate timeline of the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline, Iceman was seen in Magneto&#x27;s army during his rise to power. Bobby later appears as one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse because Apocalypse rescued Bobby from a mutant internment camp that his parents had sent him to. Magneto sends Apocalypse to dispose of his rival Black Panther; when Apocalypse is attacked en route by Black Panther&#x27;s allies, Iceman aids him by freezing Namor solid and attempting to attack Storm, but he is severely injured by Sunfire.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
A zombified Iceman appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot; alongside zombies Wolverine and Cyclops. Ultimately, he is seen attacking Magneto. But Iceman perished at the hands of the Master Of Magnetism himself when Iceman is cut apart.

===&quot;Mutant X&quot;===
In the Mutant X universe, the Asgardian god Loki amplified Bobby&#x27;s powers to a dangerous level, leaving him unable to touch any living thing without killing it. Despite this, he retains a jovial and optimistic personality. When Havok has a disagreement with Magneto and decides to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man is one of those who follow him, becoming a founding member of the Six, who eventually come to be considered the world&#x27;s premiere mutant team.

===&quot;New Exiles&quot;===
After the New Exiles land on the world of warring empires, they encounter Dame Emma Frost, head of Britain&#x27;s Department X and founder of Force-X. This team includes Roberta &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake, a female version of Bobby who is code named Aurion and displays ice-based abilities.

===&quot;Battle of the Atom&quot;===
In the alternate future witnessed in the &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot; storyline, Iceman&#x27;s had truly evolved to become Sir Robert, the wizard-like Icemaster. As one of the most respected X-Men, he had incredible control over his powers and could even grow a beard! Though never outright mentioned, he may had a relationship with Kitty Pryde and even fathered a son with her, denoting the existence of Carmen Drake, a boy with the powers of both Iceman and Shadowcat. He has also developed the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures, possessing a Hulk-like physique and intellect, has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood, resulting in the Brotherhood using the duplicate to reinforce the illusion of themselves as the future X-Men. The duplicate Iceman was defeated by the O5 Iceman, the present Iceman, and the future Iceman during the battle in the past (Prompting the youngest Iceman to note that they only needed one more Iceman for a five-a-side basketball team).

Icemaster later returned to the mainstream marvel universe and confronts Iceman about trusts and decisions. He does it in order to prevent him from doing the same mistakes Icemaster did in the future. Knowing he had little time left, Icemaster eventually revealed to Iceman that after beginning a relationship with Daken, they both led the X-Men to space in order to prevent the Shi&#x27;ar from overwhelm the Earth and lay waste to it. However Icemaster would discover that Daken&#x27;s plan was actually to obtain the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal in the first place, killing in the process the other X-Men and later Deathbird herself. Icemaster attempts to stop Daken, but he is seconds too late as having the Nexus of all Realities made Daken a Thanos-level player in the cosmos, and he acted as such. Icemaster eventually became convinced, after seeing Bobby&#x27;s character growth, that his present self had matured beyond what he remembered, leaving the future open for new decisions to be made. With his mission apparently completed, Icemaster turns into thin air soon afterwards.

===Ronin===
In the alternate reality of &quot;X-Men: Ronin&quot;, Iceman is a murderous ninja in the employ of the Hellfire Club. He works with Pyro and Avalanche as part of the &#x27;Shadowcat Clan&#x27; and battles the X-Men.

===Shadow-X===
New Excalibur battles an evil counterpart of Iceman, who is a member of the Shadow-X, the X-Men of an alternate reality in which Professor X was possessed by the Shadow King. They are brought to Earth-616 as a result of M-Day. He appeared to be mute and died during the final battle against Albion.

===Spider-Verse===
In &quot;Edge of Spider-verse: Web of Fear&quot;, a Spider-Man who is a member of the Captain Britain Corps witnesses Morlun about to kill Spider-Man. Later, a larger picture is shown of Firestar and Iceman lying dead, with Ms. Lion being left out, mourning her comrades.

===Marvel Noir===
Iceman appears in &quot;X-Men Noir&quot; as one of the X Men, a crew of talented criminals. He is depicted as being very short-tempered and paranoid. He is dubbed &quot;Iceman&quot;, and angrily insists others refer to him that way, due to his custom of using an icepick as a weapon.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Bobby Drake is the youngest founding member of the X-Men. He ran away from his family at the peak of government-supported Sentinel attacks, fearing his family would be killed in such an attack.

Ultimate Iceman never had the snowman look of his counterpart, instead generating a flexible ice armor from the beginning. Bobby establishes himself as a valuable asset, single-handedly taking out the Ultimates once with a gigantic ice wall (&quot;see Ultimate War&quot;), as well as single-handedly halting an invasion by Colonel Wraith and Weapon X. He was only able to be stopped by Rogue, who was in temporary possession of Marvel Girl&#x27;s telepathy. Professor X has stated that Bobby is one of the three most powerful X-Men. During the &quot;World Tour&quot; arc, after enlarging his armor to form a gigantic ice troll, Bobby is greatly injured by Proteus, which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier. Bobby eventually rebels against his parents, and later returns to the X-Men.

While Bobby was away from the X-Men on a vacation, he had a girlfriend, but Professor Xavier erased all memories of her from Bobby&#x27;s mind when he told her too much about the X-Men (he presumably also erased the girl&#x27;s memories). Upon her acceptance into the X-Men, Bobby begins to date Rogue. The pair date for a considerable amount of time, but eventually break up due to Bobby&#x27;s growing feelings for Shadowcat and Rogue&#x27;s feelings for Gambit. Eventually Rogue leaves, and Bobby starts to date Kitty. After this, the two rekindle their relationship, but problems erupted.

In &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #80, Bishop and Hammer, time-travelers from the future, comment on how powerful Bobby will one day become. Cyclops disbanded the X-Men in &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; #81 and Bishop and Storm created a new team. Iceman stayed at the Institute as a student only until Xavier returned and reformed his X-Men.

Professor X is later revealed to be alive and the X-Men return to the Xavier Institute, which is also when Iceman rejoins the X-Men line up. Jean Grey soon discovers that fellow X-Man, Colossus, is using a drug called Banshee to enhance his mutant abilities. The X-Men are highly against this, but Colossus manages to convince Rogue, Dazzler, Angel, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops to join him on his own X-Men team. Iceman remains on Professor X&#x27;s drug-free X-Men and fights the Banshee enhanced X-Men. Xavier&#x27;s X-Men win and the two teams combine again with nobody using drugs.

The Ultimatum Wave hits the X-Men next killing several of the X-Men (Beast, Dazzler, and Nightcrawler). Magneto and the Brotherhood attack the world and Iceman helps the world&#x27;s heroes fight them off. Most of the X-Men die, but Iceman (alongside Rogue, Storm, Colossus, and Jean Grey) is able to survive Magneto&#x27;s attack. He is last seen demolishing the X-Mansion alongside Rogue and Jean Grey and burying the deceased X-Men in its place. He finds it hard to destroy their home, but he feels it to be the right thing to do now that Professor Xavier is dead.

Later, Bobby Drake is kicked out of his home for being a mutant. With nowhere else to go, Kitty suggests to Peter Parkers&#x27; Aunt May that he move in with her, Peter, Gwen Stacy, and Johnny Storm (who also recently moved in their household). Aunt May agrees and enrolls Bobby at Midtown High under the guise of Bobby Parker, one of Peters&#x27; cousins and shaves his hair off to help keep his, Peter&#x27;s and Johnny&#x27;s secret identities safe.

Without knowing where to go after Peter&#x27;s death, Bobby Drake asked Kitty Pride if Johnny could come with them searching for a place where to live and hide from authorities. They found the Morlock Tunnels where they live now and help mutants in danger. Firstly they rescued Rogue, who joined them, and later Jimmy Hudson (the son of Wolverine), came to them for help after escaping Stryker&#x27;s imprisonment along with other mutants he freed.

===&quot;X-Men Fairy Tales&quot;===

<doc id="15506" wikidata="Q166876" url="?curid=15506" title="Isidore of Seville">
<text>Isidore of Seville (; 4 April 636) was a Hispano-Roman scholar, theologian, and archbishop of Seville. He is widely regarded, in the words of 19th-century historian Montalembert, as &quot;the last scholar of the ancient world&quot;.

At a time of disintegration of classical culture, aristocratic violence, and widespread illiteracy, Isidore was involved in the conversion of the Arian Visigothic kings to Chalcedonian Christianity, both assisting his brother Leander of Seville and continuing after his brother&#x27;s death. He was influential in the inner circle of Sisebut, Visigothic king of Hispania. Like Leander, he played a prominent role in the Councils of Toledo and Seville.

His fame after his death was based on his &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, an etymological encyclopedia that assembled extracts of many books from classical antiquity that would have otherwise been lost. This work also helped standardize the use of the period (full stop), comma, and colon.

Since the early Middle Ages, Isidore has sometimes been called Isidore the Younger or Isidore Junior (), because of the earlier history purportedly written by Isidore of Córdoba.

==Life==

===Childhood and education===
Isidore was born in Cartagena, Spain, a former Carthaginian colony, to Severianus and Theodora. Both Severian and Theodora belonged to notable Hispano-Roman families of high social rank. His parents were members of an influential family who were instrumental in the political-religious manoeuvring that converted the Visigothic kings from Arianism to Chalcedonian Christianity. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches celebrate him and all his siblings as known saints:
* An elder brother, Leander of Seville, immediately preceded Isidore as Archbishop of Seville and, while in office, opposed King Liuvigild.
* A younger brother, Fulgentius of Cartagena, served as the Bishop of Astigi at the start of the new reign of the Christian King Reccared.
* His sister, Florentina of Cartagena, was a nun who allegedly ruled over forty convents and one thousand consecrated religious. This claim seems unlikely, however, given the few functioning monastic institutions in Spania during her lifetime.

Isidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. In this institution, the first of its kind in Spania, a body of learned men including Archbishop Leander of Seville taught the trivium and quadrivium, the classic liberal arts. Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered classical Latin, and acquired some Greek and Hebrew.

Two centuries of Gothic control of Iberia incrementally suppressed the ancient institutions, classical learning, and manners of the Roman Empire. The associated culture entered a period of long-term decline. The ruling Visigoths nevertheless showed some respect for the outward trappings of Roman culture. Arianism meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received.

Scholars may debate whether Isidore ever personally embraced monastic life or affiliated with any religious order, but he undoubtedly esteemed the monks highly.

===Bishop of Seville===

After the death of Leander of Seville on 13 March 600 or 601, Isidore succeeded to the See of Seville. On his elevation to the episcopate, he immediately constituted himself as the protector of monks.

Recognizing that the spiritual and material welfare of the people of his see depended on the assimilation of remnant Roman and ruling barbarian cultures, Isidore attempted to weld the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation. He used all available religious resources toward this end and succeeded. Isidore practically eradicated the heresy of Arianism and completely stifled the new heresy of Acephali at its outset. Archbishop Isidore strengthened religious discipline throughout his see.

Archbishop Isidore also used resources of education to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction. His quickening spirit animated the educational movement centered on Seville. Isidore introduced his countrymen to Aristotle long before the Arabs studied Greek philosophy extensively.

In 619, Isidore of Seville pronounced anathema against any ecclesiastic who in any way should molest the monasteries.

===Second Synod of Seville (November 619)===
Isidore presided over the Second Council of Seville, begun on 13 November 619 in the reign of King Sisebut, a provincial council attended by eight other bishops, all from the ecclesiastical province of Baetica in southern Spain. The Acts of the Council fully set forth the nature of Christ, countering the conceptions of Gregory, a Syrian representing the heretical Acephali.

===Third Synod of Seville (624)===
Based on a few surviving canons found in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, Isidore is known to have presided over an additional provincial council around 624.

The council dealt with a conflict over the See of Écija and wrongfully stripped bishop Martianus of his see, a situation that was rectified by the Fourth Council of Toledo. It also addressed a concern over Jews who had been forced to convert to Christianity.

The records of the council, unlike the First and Second Councils of Seville, were not preserved in the Hispana, a collection of canons and decretals likely edited by Isidore himself.

===Fourth National Council of Toledo===
All bishops of Hispania attended the Fourth National Council of Toledo, begun on 5 December 633. The aged Archbishop Isidore presided over its deliberations and originated most enactments of the council.

Through Isidore&#x27;s influence, this Council of Toledo promulgated a decree commanding all bishops to establish seminaries in their cathedral cities along the lines of the cathedral school at Seville, which had educated Isidore decades earlier. The decree prescribed the study of Greek, Hebrew, and the liberal arts and encouraged interest in law and medicine. The authority of the council made this education policy obligatory upon all bishops of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. The council granted remarkable position and deference to the king of the Visigoths. The independent Church bound itself in allegiance to the acknowledged king; it said nothing of allegiance to the Bishop of Rome.

===Death===
Isidore of Seville died on 4 April 636 after serving more than 32 years as archbishop of Seville.

==Works==

Isidore&#x27;s Latin style in the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; and elsewhere, though simple and lucid, reveals increasing local Visigothic traditions.

===&quot;Etymologiae&quot;===

Isidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a &quot;summa&quot; of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era&#x27;s knowledge). It is also known by classicists as the &quot;Origines&quot; (the standard abbreviation being &quot;Orig&quot;.). This encyclopedia—the first such Christian epitome—formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes.

In it, Isidore entered his own terse digest of Roman handbooks, miscellanies and compendia. He continued the trend towards abridgements and summaries that had characterised Roman learning in Late Antiquity. In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved that otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; &quot;in fact, in the majority of his works, including the &quot;Origines&quot;, he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the &quot;stilus maiorum&quot; than his own,&quot; his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks.

Some of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore&#x27;s work was so highly regarded—Braulio called it &quot;quaecunque fere sciri debentur&quot;, &quot;practically everything that it is necessary to know&quot;—that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: &quot;all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further&quot;.

The fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the Middle Ages. It was the most popular compendium in medieval libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore&#x27;s continued popularity in the Renaissance. Until the 12th century brought translations from Arabic sources, Isidore transmitted what western Europeans remembered of the works of Aristotle and other Greeks, although he understood only a limited amount of Greek. The &quot;Etymologiae&quot; was much copied, particularly into medieval bestiaries.

===&quot;On the Catholic Faith against the Jews&quot;===
Isidore&#x27;s &quot;De fide catholica contra Iudaeos&quot; furthers Augustine of Hippo&#x27;s ideas on the Jewish presence in the Christian society of the ancient world. Like Augustine, Isidore held an acceptance of the Jewish presence as necessary to society because of their expected role in the anticipated Second Coming of Christ.

But Isidore had access to Augustine&#x27;s works, out of which one finds more than forced acceptance &quot;of&quot; but rather broader reasons than just an endtime role &quot;for&quot; Jews in society:

:[D]iversities in the manners, laws, and institutions whereby earthly peace is secured and maintained [are not scrupled in the heavenly city for which we strive, while its citizens sojourn on earth], but recognizing that, however various they are, they all tend to one and the same end of earthly peace.

:[The heavenly city] is therefore so far from rescinding and abolishing these diversities, that it even preserves and adopts them, so long only as no hindrance to the worship of the one supreme and true God is thus introduced...and makes this earthly peace bear upon the peace of heaven; for this alone can be truly called and esteemed the peace of the reasonable creatures, consisting as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God and of one another in God. (&quot;City of God&quot;, Book 19, Chapter 17)

According to Jeremy Cohen, Isidore exceeds the anti-rabbinic polemics of earlier theologians by criticizing Jewish practice as deliberately disingenuous in &quot;De fide catholica contra Iudaeos&quot;.

But once again Isidore&#x27;s same predecessor, Augustine, seems to have written of at least the possibility of Jewish rabbinical practice along that subject&#x27;s content&#x27;s purportedly deceptive lines in the same work cited above:

:They say that it is not credible that the seventy translators [of the Septuagint] who simultaneously and unanimously produced one rendering, could have erred, or, in a case in which no interest of theirs was involved, could have falsified their translation, but that the Jews, envying us our translation of their Law and Prophets, have made alterations in their texts to undermine the authority of ours. (&quot;City of God&quot;, Book 15, Chapter 11)

He contributed two decisions to the Fourth Council of Toledo: Canon 60 calling for the forced removal of children from parents practising Crypto-Judaism and their education by Christians on the basis that while their parents were concealing themselves under the guise of Christians, they had presumably allowed their children to be baptised with intent to deceive. This removal was an exception to the general rule of the treatment of Jewish children according to the 13th century &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, &quot;[I]t was never the custom of the Church to baptize the children of Jews against the will of their parents...&quot;

He also contributed Canon 65 thought to forbid Jews and Christians of Jewish origin from holding public office.

===Other works===
Isidore&#x27;s authored more than a dozen major works on various topics including mathematics, holy scripture, and monastic life, all in Latin:
* &quot;Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum&quot;, a history of the Gothic, Vandal and Suebi kings. The longer edition, issued in 624, includes the &quot;Laus Spaniae&quot; and the &quot;Laus Gothorum&quot;.
* &quot;Chronica Majora&quot;, a universal history
* &quot;De differentiis verborum&quot;, a brief theological treatise on the doctrine of the Trinity, the nature of Christ, of Paradise, angels, and men
* &quot;De natura rerum&quot; (&quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;), a book of astronomy and natural history dedicated to the Visigothic king Sisebut
* &quot;Questions on the Old Testament&quot;
* &quot;Liber numerorum qui in sanctis Scripturis occurrunt&quot;, a mystical treatise on the allegorical meanings of numbers
* a number of brief letters
* &quot;Sententiae libri tres&quot; Codex Sang. 228; 9th century
* &quot;De viris illustribus&quot;
* &quot;De ecclesiasticis officiis&quot;
* &quot;De summo bono&quot;
* &quot;De ortu et obitu patrum&quot;
* &quot;Regula Monachorum&quot;

==Veneration==

Isidore was one of the last of the ancient Christian philosophers and was contemporary with Maximus the Confessor. He has been called the most learned man of his age by some scholars, and he exercised a far-reaching and immeasurable influence on the educational life of the Middle Ages. His contemporary and friend, Braulio of Zaragoza, regarded him as a man raised up by God to save the Spanish peoples from the tidal wave of barbarism that threatened to inundate the ancient civilization of Hispania.

The Eighth Council of Toledo (653) recorded its admiration of his character in these glowing terms: &quot;The extraordinary doctor, the latest ornament of the Catholic Church, the most learned man of the latter ages, always to be named with reverence, Isidore&quot;. This tribute was endorsed by the Fifteenth Council of Toledo, held in 688. Isidore was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1722 by Pope Innocent XIII.

Isidore was interred in Seville. His tomb represented an important place of veneration for the Mozarabs during the centuries after the Arab conquest of Visigothic Hispania. In the middle of the 11th century, with the division of Al Andalus into taifas and the strengthening of the Christian holdings in the Iberian peninsula, Ferdinand I of León and Castile found himself in a position to extract tribute from the fractured Arab states. In addition to money, Abbad II al-Mu&#x27;tadid, the Abbadid ruler of Seville (1042–1069), agreed to turn over St. Isidore&#x27;s remains to Ferdinand I. A Catholic poet described al-Mutatid placing a brocaded cover over Isidore&#x27;s sarcophagus, and remarked, &quot;Now you are leaving here, revered Isidore. You know well how much your fame was mine!&quot; Ferdinand had Isidore&#x27;s remains reinterred in the then-recently constructed Basilica of San Isidoro in León. Today, many of his bones are buried in the cathedral of Murcia, Spain.

== Criticisms and contemporary appraisal ==

Contemporary researchers have criticized Isidore. Specifically, the point of contention is his work in the &quot;Etymologies.&quot; Historian Sandro D&#x27;Onofrio has argued that &quot;job consisted here and there of restating, recapitulating, and sometimes simply transliterating both data and theories that lacked research and originality.&quot;

In this view, Isidore—considering the large popularity his works enjoyed during the Middle Ages and the founding role he had in Scholasticism—would be less a brilliant thinker than a Christian gatekeeper making etymologies fit into the Christian worldview. &quot;[H]e prescribed what they should mean,&quot; asserts D&#x27;Onofrio.

Researcher Victor Bruno has countered this argument. According to him, it was not the meaning of the &quot;Etymologies&quot;, or of Isidore&#x27;s work as a whole, to give a scientific or philological account of the words, as a modern researcher would do. &quot;It is obvious that, from a material point of view,&quot; argues Bruno, &quot;Isidore&#x27;s practical knowledge on etymology, geography, and history are considered outdated; his methods, from the current academic and scientific standpoint, are questionable, and some of his conclusions are indeed incorrect. But Isidore is less concerned about being etymologically or philologically right than being &quot;ontologically&quot; right.&quot;

Therefore, Isidore, despite living in the early Middle Ages, is an archaic or &quot;traditional&quot; thinker. Being religiously inclined, Isidore would be concerned with the redeeming meaning of words and history, the ultimate quest of religions. The same researcher also found parallels between Isidore&#x27;s interpretation of the word &quot;year&quot; (&quot;annus&quot;) and the meaning of the same words in the &quot;Jāiminīya-Upaniṣad-Brāmaṇa&quot;.

<text>Carbon compounds are defined as chemical substances containing carbon. More compounds of carbon exist than any other chemical element except for hydrogen. Organic carbon compounds are far more numerous than inorganic carbon compounds. In general bonds of carbon with other elements are covalent bonds. Carbon is tetravalent but carbon free radicals and carbenes occur as short-lived intermediates. Ions of carbon are carbocations and carbanions are also short-lived. An important carbon property is catenation as the ability to form long carbon chains and rings.

==Allotropes of carbon==

The known inorganic chemistry of the allotropes of carbon (diamond, graphite, and the fullerenes) blossomed with the discovery of buckminsterfullerene in 1985, as additional fullerenes and their various derivatives were discovered. One such class of derivatives is inclusion compounds, in which an ion is enclosed by the all-carbon shell of the fullerene. This inclusion is denoted by the &quot;@&quot;symbol in endohedral fullerenes. For example, an ion consisting of a lithium ion trapped within buckminsterfullerene would be denoted Li+@C60. As with any other ionic compound, this complex ion could in principle pair with a counterion to form a salt. Other elements are also incorporated in so-called graphite intercalation compounds.

==Carbides==
Carbides are binary compounds of carbon with an element that is less electronegative than it. The most important are
Al4C3,
B4C,
CaC2,
Fe3C,
HfC,
SiC,
TaC,
TiC, and
WC.

==Organic compounds==

It was once thought that organic compounds could only be created by living organisms. Over time, however, scientists learned how to synthesize organic compounds in the lab. The number of organic compounds is immense and the known number of defined compounds is close to 10 million. However, an indefinitely large number of such compounds is theoretically possible. 
By definition, an organic compound must contain at least one atom of carbon, but this criterion is not generally regarded as sufficient. Indeed, the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds is ultimately a matter of convention, and there are several compounds that have been classified either way, such as:
COCl2,
CSCl2,
CS(NH2)2,
CO(NH2)2.
With carbon bonded to metals the field of organic chemistry crosses over into organometallic chemistry.

===Carbon-oxygen compounds===
There are many oxides of carbon (oxocarbons), of which the most common are carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). Other less known oxides include carbon suboxide (C3O2) and mellitic anhydride (C12O9). There are also numerous unstable or elusive oxides, such as dicarbon monoxide (C2O), oxalic anhydride (C2O4), and carbon trioxide (CO3).

There are several oxocarbon anions, negative ions that consist solely of oxygen and carbon. The most common are the carbonate (CO32−) and oxalate (C2O42−). The corresponding acids are the highly unstable carbonic acid (H2CO3) and the quite stable oxalic acid (H2C2O4), respectively. These anions can be partially deprotonated to give the bicarbonate (HCO3−) and hydrogenoxalate (HC2O4−). Other more exotic carbon–oxygen anions exist, such as acetylenedicarboxylate (O2C–C≡C–CO22−), mellitate (C12O96−), squarate (C4O42−), and rhodizonate (C6O62−). The anhydrides of some of these acids are oxides of carbon; carbon dioxide, for instance, can be seen as the anhydride of carbonic acid.

Some important carbonates are
Ag2CO3,
BaCO3,
CaCO3,
CdCO3,
Ce2(CO3)3,
CoCO3,
Cs2CO3,
CuCO3,
FeCO3,
K2CO3,
La2(CO3)3,
Li2CO3,
MgCO3,
MnCO3,
(NH4)2CO3,
Na2CO3,
NiCO3,
PbCO3,
SrCO3, and
ZnCO3.

The most important bicarbonates include 
NH4HCO3,
Ca(HCO3)2,
KHCO3, and
NaHCO3.

The most important oxalates include
Ag2C2O4,
BaC2O4,
CaC2O4, 
Ce2(C2O4)3,
K2C2O4, and
Na2C2O4.

Carbonyls are coordination complexes between transition metals and carbonyl ligands. Metal carbonyls are complexes that are formed with the neutral ligand CO. These complexes are covalent. Here is a list of some carbonyls:
Cr(CO)6,
Co2(CO)8,
Fe(CO)5,
Mn2(CO)10,
Mo(CO)6,
Ni(CO)4,
W(CO)6.

===Carbon-sulfur compounds===
Important inorganic carbon-sulfur compounds are the carbon sulfides carbon disulfide (CS2) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS). Carbon monosulfide (CS) unlike carbon monoxide is very unstable. Important compound classes are thiocarbonates, thiocarbamates, dithiocarbamates and trithiocarbonates. 
===Carbon-nitrogen compounds===
Small inorganic carbon – nitrogen compounds are cyanogen, hydrogen cyanide, cyanamide, isocyanic acid and cyanogen chloride.
Paracyanogen is the polymerization product of cyanogen. Cyanuric chloride is the trimer of cyanogen chloride and 2-cyanoguanidine is the dimer of cyanamide.

Other types of inorganic compounds include the inorganic salts and complexes of the carbon-containing cyanide, cyanate, fulminate, thiocyanate and cyanamide ions. Examples of cyanides are copper cyanide (CuCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN), examples of cyanates are potassium cyanate (KNCO) and silver cyanate (AgNCO), examples of fulminates are silver fulminate (AgOCN) and mercury fulminate (HgOCN) and an example of a thiocyanate is potassium thiocyanate (KSCN).

==Carbon halides==
The common carbon halides are carbon tetrafluoride (CF4), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), carbon tetrabromide (CBr4), carbon tetraiodide (CI4), and a large number of other carbon-halogen compounds.

==Carboranes==
A carborane is a cluster composed of boron and carbon atoms such as H2C2B10H10.

==Alloys==
There are hundreds of alloys that contain carbon. The most common of these alloys is steel, sometimes called &quot;carbon steel&quot; (see :Category:Steels). All kinds of steel contain some amount of carbon, by definition, and all ferrous alloys contain some carbon.

Some other common alloys that are based on iron and carbon include anthracite iron, cast iron, pig iron, and wrought iron.

In more technical uses, there are also spiegeleisen, an alloy of iron, manganese, and carbon; and stellite, an alloy of cobalt, chromium, tungsten, and carbon.

Whether it was placed there deliberately or not, some traces of carbon is also found in these common metals and their alloys: aluminum, chromium, magnesium, molybdenum, niobium, thorium, titanium, tungsten, uranium, vanadium, zinc, and zirconium. For example, many of these metals are smelted with coke, a form of carbon; and aluminum and magnesium are made in electrolytic cells with carbon electrodes. Some distribution of carbon into all of these metals is inevitable.

<doc id="15508" wikidata="Q1160650" url="?curid=15508" title="Industrial espionage">
<text>Industrial espionage, also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage, is a form of espionage conducted for commercial purposes instead of purely national security.

While political espionage is conducted or orchestrated by governments and is international in scope, industrial or corporate espionage is more often national and occurs between companies or corporations.

==Forms of economic and industrial espionage==

Economic or industrial espionage takes place in two main forms. In short, the purpose of espionage is to gather knowledge about one or more organizations. It may include the acquisition of intellectual property, such as information on industrial manufacture, ideas, techniques and processes, recipes and formulas. Or it could include sequestration of proprietary or operational information, such as that on customer datasets, pricing, sales, marketing, research and development, policies, prospective bids, planning or marketing strategies or the changing compositions and locations of production. It may describe activities such as theft of trade secrets, bribery, blackmail and technological surveillance. As well as orchestrating espionage on commercial organizations, governments can also be targets – for example, to determine the terms of a tender for a government contract.

==Target industries==
Economic and industrial espionage is most commonly associated with technology-heavy industries, including computer software and hardware, biotechnology, aerospace, telecommunications, transportation and engine technology, automobiles, machine tools, energy, materials and coatings and so on. Silicon Valley is known to be one of the world&#x27;s most targeted areas for espionage, though any industry with information of use to competitors may be a target.

==Information theft and sabotage==

Information can make the difference between success and failure; if a trade secret is stolen, the competitive playing field is leveled or even tipped in favor of a competitor. Although a lot of information-gathering is accomplished legally through competitive intelligence, at times corporations feel the best way to get information is to take it. Economic or industrial espionage is a threat to any business whose livelihood depends on information.

In recent years, economic or industrial espionage has taken on an expanded definition. For instance, attempts to sabotage a corporation may be considered industrial espionage; in this sense, the term takes on the wider connotations of its parent word. That espionage and sabotage (corporate or otherwise) have become more clearly associated with each other is also demonstrated by a number of profiling studies, some government, some corporate. The United States government currently has a polygraph examination entitled the &quot;Test of Espionage and Sabotage&quot; (TES), contributing to the notion of the interrelationship between espionage and sabotage countermeasures. In practice, particularly by &quot;trusted insiders&quot;, they are generally considered functionally identical for the purpose of informing countermeasures.

==Agents and the process of collection==

Economic or industrial espionage commonly occurs in one of two ways. Firstly, a dissatisfied employee appropriates information to advance interests or to damage the company. Secondly, a competitor or foreign government seeks information to advance its own technological or financial interest. &quot;Moles&quot;, or trusted insiders, are generally considered the best sources for economic or industrial espionage. Historically known as a &quot;patsy&quot;, an insider can be induced, willingly or under duress, to provide information. A patsy may be initially asked to hand over inconsequential information and, once compromised by committing a crime, blackmailed into handing over more sensitive material. Individuals may leave one company to take up employment with another and take sensitive information with them. Such apparent behavior has been the focus of numerous industrial espionage cases that have resulted in legal battles. Some countries hire individuals to do spying rather than the use of their own intelligence agencies. Academics, business delegates, and students are often thought to be used by governments in gathering information. Some countries, such as Japan, have been reported to expect students to be debriefed on returning home. A spy may follow a guided tour of a factory and then get &quot;lost&quot;. A spy could be an engineer, a maintenance man, a cleaner, an insurance salesman, or an inspector: anyone who has legitimate access to the premises.

A spy may break into the premises to steal data and may search through waste paper and refuse, known as &quot;dumpster diving&quot;. Information may be compromised via unsolicited requests for information, marketing surveys, or use of technical support or research or software facilities. Outsourced industrial producers may ask for information outside the agreed-upon contract.

Computers have facilitated the process of collecting information because of the ease of access to large amounts of information through physical contact or the Internet.

== History ==

===Origins===

Economic and industrial espionage has a long history. Father Francois Xavier d&#x27;Entrecolles, who visited Jingdezhen, China in 1712 and later used this visit to reveal the manufacturing methods of Chinese porcelain to Europe, is sometimes considered to have conducted an early case of industrial espionage.

Historical accounts have been written of industrial espionage between Britain and France. Attributed to Britain&#x27;s emergence as an &quot;industrial creditor&quot;, the second decade of the 18th century saw the emergence of a large-scale state-sponsored effort to surreptitiously take British industrial technology to France. Witnesses confirmed both the inveigling of tradespersons abroad and the placing of apprentices in England. Protests by those such as ironworkers in Sheffield and steelworkers in Newcastle, about skilled industrial workers being enticed abroad, led to the first English legislation aimed at preventing this method of economic and industrial espionage. This did not prevent Samuel Slater from bringing British textile technology to the United States in 1789. In order to catch up with technological advances of European powers, the US government in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries actively encouraged intellectual piracy.

American founding father and first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton advocated rewarding those bringing &quot;improvements and secrets of extraordinary value&quot; into the United States. This was instrumental in making the United States a haven for industrial spies.

===20th century===
East-West commercial development opportunities after World War I saw a rise in Soviet interest in American and European manufacturing know-how, exploited by Amtorg Corporation. Later, with Western restrictions on the export of items thought likely to increase military capabilities to the USSR, Soviet industrial espionage was a well known adjunct to other spying activities up until the 1980s. &quot;BYTE&quot; reported in April 1984, for example, that although the Soviets sought to develop their own microelectronics, their technology appeared to be several years behind the West&#x27;s. Soviet CPUs required multiple chips and appeared to be close or exact copies of American products such as the Intel 3000 and DEC LSI-11/2.

====&quot;Operation Brunnhilde&quot;====
Some of these activities were directed via the East German Stasi (Ministry for State Security). One such operation, &quot;Operation Brunnhilde,&quot; operated from the mid-1950s until early 1966 and made use of spies from many Communist Bloc countries. Through at least 20 forays, many western European industrial secrets were compromised. One member of the &quot;Brunnhilde&quot; ring was a Swiss chemical engineer, Dr. Jean Paul Soupert (also known as &quot;Air Bubble&quot;), living in Brussels. He was described by Peter Wright in Spycatcher as having been &quot;doubled&quot; by the Belgian Sûreté de l&#x27;État. He revealed information about industrial espionage conducted by the ring, including the fact that Russian agents had obtained details of Concorde&#x27;s advanced electronics system. He testified against two Kodak employees, living and working in Britain, during a trial in which they were accused of passing information on industrial processes to him, though they were eventually acquitted.

According to a 2020 &quot;American Economic Review&quot; study, East German industrial espionage in West Germany significantly reduced the gap in total factor productivity between the two countries.

====Soviet system====
A secret report from the Military-Industrial Commission of the USSR (VPK), from 1979–80, detailed how (, &quot;special records&quot;) could be utilised in twelve different military industrial areas. Writing in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Philip Hanson detailed a system in which 12 industrial branch ministries formulated requests for information to aid technological development in their military programs. Acquisition plans were described as operating on 2-year and 5-year cycles with about 3000 tasks underway each year. Efforts were aimed at civilian and military industrial targets, such as in the petrochemical industries. Some information was gathered to compare Soviet technological advancement with that of their competitors. Much unclassified information was also gathered, blurring the boundary with &quot;competitive intelligence&quot;.

The Soviet military was recognised as making much better use of acquired information than civilian industries, where their record in replicating and developing industrial technology was poor.

===Legacy of Cold War espionage===
Following the demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, commentators, including the US Congressional Intelligence Committee, noted a redirection amongst the espionage community from military to industrial targets, with Western and former communist countries making use of &quot;underemployed&quot; spies and expanding programs directed at stealing information.

The legacy of Cold War spying included not just the redirection of personnel but the use of spying apparatus such as computer databases, scanners for eavesdropping, spy satellites, bugs and wires.

===Industrial espionage as part of US foreign policy===

Former CIA Director Stansfield Turner stated in 1991, &quot;as we increase emphasis on securing economic intelligence, we will have to spy on the more developed countries-our allies and friends with whom we compete economically-but to whom we turn first for political and military assistance in a crisis. This means that rather than instinctively reaching for human, on-site spying, the United States will want to look to those impersonal technical systems, primarily satellite photography and intercepts&quot;.

Former CIA Director James Woolsey acknowledged in 2000 that the United States steals economic secrets from foreign firms and their governments &quot;with espionage, with communications, with reconnaissance satellites&quot;. He listed the three reasons as understanding whether sanctions are functioning for countries under sanction, monitoring dual-use technology that could be used to produce or develop weapons, and to spy on bribery.

In 2013 The United States was accused of spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras. Brazil&#x27;s President Dilma Rousseff stated that it was tantamount to industrial espionage and had no security justification.

In 2014 former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden stated that America&#x27;s National Security Agency was engaged in industrial espionage and that they spied on German companies that compete with US firms. He also highlighted the fact the NSA uses mobile phone apps such as Angry Birds to gather personal data.

According to a 2014 Glenn Greenwald article, &quot;potentially sabotaging another country&#x27;s hi-tech industries and their top companies has long been a sanctioned American strategy.&quot; The article was based on a leaked report issued from former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper&#x27;s office that evaluated how intelligence could be used to overcome a loss of the United States&#x27; technological and innovative edge. When contacted, the Director of National Intelligence office responded, &quot;the United States—unlike our adversaries—does not steal proprietary corporate information&quot;, and insisted that &quot;the Intelligence Community regularly engages in analytic exercises&quot;. The report, he said, &quot;is not intended to be, and is not, a reflection of current policy or operations&quot;.

In September 2019, security firm Qi An Xin published report linking the CIA to a series of attacks targeting Chinese aviation agencies between 2012 and 2017.

===Israel&#x27;s economic espionage in the United States===
Israel has an active program to gather proprietary information within the United States. These collection activities are primarily directed at obtaining information on military systems and advanced computing applications that can be used in Israel&#x27;s sizable armaments industry.

Israel was accused by the US government of selling US military technology and secrets to China in 1993.

In 2014 American counter-intelligence officials told members of the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees that Israel&#x27;s current espionage activities in America are &quot;unrivaled&quot;.

==Use of computers and the Internet==

===Personal computers===
Computers have become key in exercising industrial espionage due to the enormous amount of information they contain and the ease at which it can be copied and transmitted. The use of computers for espionage increased rapidly in the 1990s. Information has commonly been stolen by individuals posing as subsidiary workers, such as cleaners or repairmen, gaining access to unattended computers and copying information from them. Laptops were, and still are, a prime target, with those traveling abroad on business being warned not to leave them for any period of time. Perpetrators of espionage have been known to find many ways of conning unsuspecting individuals into parting, often only temporarily, from their possessions, enabling others to access and steal information. A &quot;bag-op&quot; refers to the use of hotel staff to access data, such as through laptops, in hotel rooms. Information may be stolen in transit, in taxis, at airport baggage counters, baggage carousels, on trains and so on.

===The Internet===
The rise of the Internet and computer networks has expanded the range and detail of information available and the ease of access for the purpose of industrial espionage. This type of operation is generally identified as state backed or sponsored, because the &quot;access to personal, financial or analytic resources&quot; identified exceed that which could be accessed by cyber criminals or individual hackers. Sensitive military or defense engineering or other industrial information may not have immediate monetary value to criminals, compared with, say, bank details. Analysis of cyberattacks suggests deep knowledge of networks, with targeted attacks, obtained by numerous individuals operating in a sustained organized way.

===Opportunities for sabotage===
The rising use of the internet has also extended opportunities for industrial espionage with the aim of sabotage. In the early 2000s, energy companies were increasingly coming under attack from hackers. Energy power systems, doing jobs like monitoring power grids or water flow, once isolated from the other computer networks, were now being connected to the internet, leaving them more vulnerable, having historically few built-in security features. The use of these methods of industrial espionage have increasingly become a concern for governments, due to potential attacks by hostile foreign governments or terrorist groups.

===Malware===
One of the means of perpetrators conducting industrial espionage is by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer software. Malware and spyware are &quot;tool[s] for industrial espionage&quot;, in &quot;transmitting digital copies of trade secrets, customer plans, future plans and contacts&quot;. Newer forms of malware include devices which surreptitiously switch on mobile phones camera and recording devices. In attempts to tackle such attacks on their intellectual property, companies are increasingly keeping important information &quot;off network,&quot; leaving an &quot;air gap&quot;, with some companies building Faraday cages to shield from electromagnetic or cellphone transmissions.

===Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack===
The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack uses compromised computer systems to orchestrate a flood of requests on the target system, causing it to shut down and deny service to other users. It could potentially be used for economic or industrial espionage with the purpose of sabotage. This method was allegedly utilized by Russian secret services, over a period of two weeks on a cyberattack on Estonia in May 2007, in response to the removal of a Soviet era war memorial.

==Notable cases==

===British East India Company===
In 1848, the British East India Company broke Qing China&#x27;s global near-monopoly on tea production by smuggling Chinese tea out of the nation and copying Chinese tea-making processes. The British Empire had previously run a considerable trade deficit with China by importing the nation&#x27;s tea and other goods. The British attempted to rectify the deficit by trading opium to the Chinese, but encountered difficulties after the Daoguang Emperor banned the opium trade and the First Opium War broke out. To avoid further issues in trading tea with China, the East India Company hired Scottish botanist Robert Fortune to travel to China under the guise of a Chinese nobleman and obtain Chinese trade secrets and tea plants for replanting. Infiltrating Chinese tea-making facilities, Fortune recorded the Chinese process for creating tea and smuggled tea leaves and seeds back to the East India Company. The East India Company later introduced these methods to company-ruled India, using India to compete and surpass China in tea production.

===France and the United States===
Between 1987 and 1989, IBM and Texas Instruments were thought to have been targeted by French DGSE with the intention of helping France&#x27;s Groupe Bull. In 1993, U.S. aerospace companies were also thought to have been targeted by French interests. During the early 1990s, France was described as one of the most aggressive pursuers of espionage to garner foreign industrial and technological secrets. France accused the U.S. of attempting to sabotage its high tech industrial base. The government of France allegedly continues to conduct ongoing industrial espionage against American aerodynamics and satellite companies.

===Volkswagen===
In 1993, car manufacturer Opel, the German division of General Motors, accused Volkswagen of industrial espionage after Opel&#x27;s chief of production, Jose Ignacio Lopez, and seven other executives moved to Volkswagen. Volkswagen subsequently threatened to sue for defamation, resulting in a four-year legal battle. The case, which was finally settled in 1997, resulted in one of the largest settlements in the history of industrial espionage, with Volkswagen agreeing to pay General Motors $100 million and to buy at least $1 billion of car parts from the company over 7 years, although it did not explicitly apologize for Lopez&#x27;s behavior.

===Hilton and Starwood===
In April 2009, Starwood accused its rival Hilton Worldwide of a &quot;massive&quot; case of industrial espionage. After being acquired by The Blackstone Group, Hilton employed 10 managers and executives from Starwood. Starwood accused Hilton of stealing corporate information relating to its luxury brand concepts, used in setting up its Denizen hotels. Specifically, former head of its luxury brands group, Ron Klein, was accused of downloading &quot;truckloads of documents&quot; from a laptop to his personal email account.

===Google and Operation Aurora===
On 13 January 2010, Google announced that operators, from within China, had hacked into their Google China operation, stealing intellectual property and, in particular, accessing the email accounts of human rights activists. The attack was thought to have been part of a more widespread cyber attack on companies within China which has become known as Operation Aurora. Intruders were thought to have launched a zero-day attack, exploiting a weakness in the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, the malware used being a modification of the trojan &quot;Hydraq&quot;. Concerned about the possibility of hackers taking advantage of this previously unknown weakness in Internet Explorer, the governments of Germany and, subsequently France, issued warnings not to use the browser.

There was speculation that &quot;insiders&quot; had been involved in the attack, with some Google China employees being denied access to the company&#x27;s internal networks after the company&#x27;s announcement. In February 2010, computer experts from the U.S. National Security Agency claimed that the attacks on Google probably originated from two Chinese universities associated with expertise in computer science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Shandong Lanxiang Vocational School, the latter having close links to the Chinese military.

Google claimed at least 20 other companies had also been targeted in the cyber attack, said by the &quot;London Times&quot;, to have been part of an &quot;ambitious and sophisticated attempt to steal secrets from unwitting corporate victims&quot; including &quot;defence contractors, finance and technology companies&quot;. Rather than being the work of individuals or organised criminals, the level of sophistication of the attack was thought to have been &quot;more typical of a nation state&quot;. Some commentators speculated as to whether the attack was part of what is thought to be a concerted Chinese industrial espionage operation aimed at getting &quot;high-tech information to jump-start China&#x27;s economy&quot;. Critics pointed to what was alleged to be a lax attitude to the intellectual property of foreign businesses in China, letting them operate but then seeking to copy or reverse engineer their technology for the benefit of Chinese &quot;national champions&quot;. In Google&#x27;s case, they may have (also) been concerned about the possible misappropriation of source code or other technology for the benefit of Chinese rival Baidu. In March 2010 Google subsequently decided to cease offering censored results in China, leading to the closing of its Chinese operation.

===&quot;USA v. Lan Lee, et al.&quot;===
The United States charged two former NetLogic Inc. engineers, Lan Lee and Yuefei Ge, of committing economic espionage against TSMC and NetLogic, Inc. A jury acquitted the defendants of the charges with regard to TSMC and deadlocked on the charges with regard to NetLogic. In May 2010, a federal judge dismissed all the espionage charges against the two defendants. The judge ruled that the U.S. government presented no evidence of espionage.

===Dongxiao Yue and Chordiant Software, Inc.===
In May 2010, the federal jury convicted Chordiant Software, Inc., a U.S. corporation, of stealing Dongxiao Yue&#x27;s JRPC technologies and used them in a product called Chordiant Marketing Director. Yue previously filed lawsuits against Symantec Corporation for a similar theft.

==Concerns of national governments==
===Brazil===
Revelations from the Snowden documents have provided information to the effect that the United States, notably vis-à-vis the NSA, has been conducting aggressive economic espionage against Brazil. Canadian intelligence has apparently supported U.S. economic espionage efforts.

===China===
The Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 accused the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States of an 11-year-long hacking campaign that targeted several industries including aviation organizations, scientific research institutions, petroleum firms, internet companies, and government agencies.

===United States===
A 2009 report to the US government, by aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman, describes Chinese economic espionage as comprising &quot;the single greatest threat to U.S. technology&quot;. Blogging on the 2009 cyber attack on Google, Joe Stewart of SecureWorks referred to a &quot;persistent campaign of &#x27;espionage-by-malware&#x27; emanating from the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC)&quot; with both corporate and state secrets being &quot;Shanghaied&quot;. The Northrop Grumman report states that the collection of US defense engineering data stolen through cyberattacks is regarded as having &quot;saved the recipient of the information years of R&amp;D and significant amounts of funding&quot;. Concerns about the extent of cyberattacks has led to the situation being described as the dawn of a &quot;new cold cyberwar&quot;.

According to Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency spies on foreign companies. In June 2015 Wikileaks published documents about the National Security Agency spying on French companies.

===United Kingdom===
During December 2007, this was suddenly revealed that Jonathan Evans, head of the United Kingdom&#x27;s MI5, had sent out confidential letters to 300 chief executives and security chiefs at the country&#x27;s banks, accountants and legal firms warning of attacks from Chinese &#x27;state organisations&#x27;. A summary was also posted on the secure website of the Centre for the Protection of the National Infrastructure, accessed by some of the nation&#x27;s &#x27;critical infrastructure&#x27; companies, including &#x27;telecoms firms, banks and water and electricity companies&#x27;. One security expert warned about the use of &#x27;custom trojans,&#x27; software specifically designed to hack into a particular firm and feed back data. Whilst China was identified as the country most active in the use of internet spying, up to 120 other countries were said to be using similar techniques. The Chinese government responded to UK accusations of economic espionage by saying that the report of such activities was &#x27;slanderous&#x27; and that the government opposed hacking which is prohibited by law.

===Germany===
German counter-intelligence experts have maintained the German economy is losing around €53 billion or the equivalent of 30,000 jobs to economic espionage yearly.

In Operation Eikonal, German BND agents received &quot;selector lists&quot; from the NSA – search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets. These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the Eurocopter project as well as French administration, which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005. After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden, the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.

The BND&#x27;s project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans&#x27; noses. The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA&#x27;s selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany&#x27;s top court. Instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, , as a &quot;person of trust&quot; who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters. In his almost 300-paged report Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany&#x27;s Basic Law (Grundgesetz) − including numerous enterprises based in Germany – were featured in the NSA&#x27;s wishlist in a surprising plenitude.

==Competitive intelligence and economic or industrial espionage==
&quot;Competitive intelligence&quot; involves the legal and ethical activity of systematically gathering, analyzing and managing information on industrial competitors. It may include activities such as examining newspaper articles, corporate publications, websites, patent filings, specialised databases, information at trade shows and the like to determine information on a corporation. The compilation of these crucial elements is sometimes termed CIS or CRS, a &quot;Competitive Intelligence Solution&quot; or &quot;Competitive Response Solution&quot;, with its roots in market research. Douglas Bernhardt has characterised &quot;competitive intelligence&quot; as involving &quot;the application of principles and practices from military and national intelligence to the domain of global business&quot;; it is the commercial equivalent of open-source intelligence.

The difference between competitive intelligence and economic or industrial espionage is not clear; one needs to understand the legal basics to recognize how to draw the line between the two.

<text>Isaac Bashevis Singer (; 1903 – July 24, 1991) was a Polish-born Jewish-American novelist, short-story writer, memoirist, essayist, and translator. Some of his works were adapted for the theater. He wrote and published first in Yiddish and later translated his own works into English with the help of editors and collaborators. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1978. A leading figure in the Yiddish literary movement, he was awarded two U.S. National Book Awards, one in Children&#x27;s Literature for his memoir &quot;A Day of Pleasure: Stories of a Boy Growing Up in Warsaw&quot; (1970) and one in Fiction for his collection &quot;A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories&quot; (1974).

==Life==


Isaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1903 to a Jewish family in Leoncin village near Warsaw, Poland. The Polish form of his birth name was Icek Hersz Zynger. The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most sources say it was probably November 11, a date similar to the one that Singer gave to his official biographer Paul Kresh, his secretary Dvorah Telushkin, and Rabbi William Berkowitz. The year 1903 is consistent with the historical events that his brother refers to in their childhood memoirs, including the death of Theodor Herzl. The often-quoted birth date, July 14, 1904, was made up by the author in his youth, possibly to make himself younger to avoid the draft.

His father Pinchus-Mendel Zinger (1868–?) was a Hasidic rabbi from Tomaszów Lubelski (Lublin Governorate), and his mother, Szewa (nee Zilberman, 1871–?) was from (Vladimir-Volynsky Uyezd, Volhynia Governorate); parents registered their marriage on June 2 (14) 1889 in Biłgoraj. Singer later used her first name in an initial literary pseudonym, &quot;Izaak Baszewis&quot;, which he later expanded. Both his older siblings, sister Esther Kreitman (1891–1954) and brother Israel Joshua Singer (1893–1944), became writers as well. Esther was the first of the family to write stories.

The family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva. After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to Warsaw, a flat at Krochmalna Street 10. In the spring of 1914, the Singers moved to No. 12.

The street where Singer grew up was located in the impoverished, Yiddish-speaking Jewish quarter of Warsaw. There his father served as a rabbi, and was called on to be a judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader in the Jewish community. The unique atmosphere of pre-war Krochmalna Street can be found both in the collection of &quot;Varshavsky-stories&quot;, which tell stories from Singer&#x27;s childhood, as well as in those novels and stories which take place in pre-war Warsaw.

===World War I===
In 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up. Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to Biłgoraj, a traditional &quot;shtetl,&quot; where his mother&#x27;s brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis. When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer returned to Warsaw. He entered the Tachkemoni Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him. He returned to Biłgoraj, where he tried to support himself by giving Hebrew lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure. In 1923, his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Jewish magazine &quot;Literarishe Bleter&quot;, of which the brother was an editor.

===United States===
In 1935, four years before the Nazi invasion, Singer emigrated from Poland to the United States. He was fearful of the growing threat in neighboring Germany. The move separated the author from his common-law first wife Runia Pontsch and son Israel Zamir (1929–2014); they emigrated to Moscow and then Palestine. The three met again in 1955.

Singer settled in New York City, where he took up work as a journalist and columnist for &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; (), a Yiddish-language newspaper. (When he arrived in the US, he only knew three words of English: &quot;Take a chair&quot;.) After a promising start, he became despondent and for some years felt &quot;Lost in America&quot; (title of his 1974 memoir published in Yiddish; published in English in 1981).

In 1938, he met Alma Wassermann (née Haimann) (1907–1996), a German-Jewish refugee from Munich. They married in 1940, and their union seemed to release energy in him; he returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the &quot;Forward&quot;. In addition to his pen name of &quot;Bashevis&quot;, he published under the pen names of &quot;Warszawski&quot; (pron. Varshavsky) during World War II, and &quot;D. Segal&quot;. They lived for many years in the Belnord apartment building on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. He became a US citizen in 1943.

In 1981, Singer delivered a commencement address at the University at Albany and was presented with an honorary doctorate.

Singer died on July 24, 1991, in Surfside, Florida, after suffering a series of strokes. He was buried in Cedar Park Cemetery, Paramus, New Jersey. A street in Surfside, Florida, is named Isaac Singer Boulevard in his honor.

==Literary career==
Singer&#x27;s first published story &quot;Oyf der elter&quot; (&quot;In Old Age&quot;, 1925) won the literary competition of the &quot;Literarishe Bleter&quot;, where he worked as a proofreader. A reflection of his formative years in &quot;the kitchen of literature&quot; can be found in many of his later works. Singer published his first novel, &quot;Satan in Goray&quot;, in installments in the literary magazine &quot;Globus&quot;, which he had co-founded with his lifelong friend, the Yiddish poet Aaron Zeitlin in 1935. It is set in the years following 1648, when the Chmielnicki massacres, considered one of the greatest Jewish catastrophes, occurred. The story describes the Jewish messianic cult that arose in the village of Goraj. It explores the effects of the faraway false messiah, Shabbatai Zvi, on the local population. Its last chapter imitates the style of a medieval Yiddish chronicle. With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger. In his later work &quot;The Slave&quot; (1962), Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648 in a love story between a Jewish man and a gentile woman. He portrays the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding.

===&quot;The Family Moskat&quot;===
Singer became a literary contributor to &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; only after his older brother Israel died in 1944. That year, Singer published &quot;The Family Moskat&quot; in his brother&#x27;s honor. His own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with double adultery during the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of Yom Kippur (despite being printed in a Jewish family newspaper in 1945). He was nearly forced to stop writing the novel by his editor-in-chief, Abraham Cahan, but was saved by readers who wanted the story to continue. After this, his stories—which he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before—were printed in the &quot;Forward&quot; as well. Throughout the 1940s, Singer&#x27;s reputation grew.

Singer believed in the power of his native language and thought that there was still a large audience, including in New York, who longed to read in Yiddish. In an interview in &quot;Encounter&quot; (February 1979), he said that although the Jews of Poland had died, &quot;something—call it spirit or whatever—is still somewhere in the universe. This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it.&quot;

Some of his colleagues and readers were shocked by his all-encompassing view of human nature. He wrote about female homosexuality (&quot;Zeitl and Rickel&quot;, &quot;Tseytl un Rikl&quot;), published in &quot;The Seance and Other Stories&quot;, transvestism (&quot;Yentl the Yeshiva Boy&quot; in &quot;Short Friday&quot;), and of rabbis corrupted by demons (&quot;Zeidlus the Pope&quot; in &quot;Short Friday&quot;). In those novels and stories which refer to events in his own life, he portrays himself unflatteringly (with some degree of accuracy) as an artist who is self-centered yet has a keen eye for the sufferings and tribulations of others.

===Literary influences===

Singer had many literary influences. Besides the religious texts he studied, he grew up with a rich array of Jewish folktales and worldly Yiddish detective-stories about Max Spitzkopf and his assistant Fuchs by Jonas Kreppel. He read Russian, including Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; at the age of fourteen. He wrote in memoirs about the importance of the Yiddish translations donated in book-crates from America, which he studied as a teenager in Bilgoraj: &quot;I read everything: Stories, novels, plays, essays... I read Rajsen, Strindberg, Don Kaplanowitsch, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Maupassant and Chekhov.&quot; He studied the philosophers Spinoza, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Otto Weininger. Among his Yiddish contemporaries, Singer considered his elder brother to be his greatest artistic example. He was also a life-long friend and admirer of the author and poet Aaron Zeitlin.

His short stories, which some critics feel contain his most lasting contributions, were influenced by Anton Chekhov and Guy de Maupassant. From Maupassant, Singer developed a finely grained sense of drama. Like those of the French master, Singer&#x27;s stories can pack enormous visceral excitement in the space of a few pages. From Chekhov, Singer developed his ability to draw characters of enormous complexity and dignity in the briefest of spaces. In the foreword to his personally selected volume of his finest short stories, Singer describes Chekhov, Maupassant, and &quot;the sublime scribe of the Joseph story in the Book of Genesis&quot; as the masters of the short story form.

Of his non-Yiddish-contemporaries, he was strongly influenced by the writings of Knut Hamsun, many of whose works he later translated, while he had a more critical attitude towards Thomas Mann, whose approach to writing he considered opposed to his own. Contrary to Hamsun&#x27;s approach, Singer shaped his world not only with the egos of his characters, but also from Jewish moral tradition embodied by his father in the stories about Singer&#x27;s youth. There was a dichotomy between the life his heroes lead and the life they feel they should lead—which gives his art a modernity his predecessors did not express. Singer&#x27;s stories often involve highly individualist and anti-conformist characters rebelling alone against society. In a 1974 interview, Singer stated that &quot;every human being, if he is a real, sensitive human being, feels quite isolated. It is only the people with very little individuality who always feel that they belong.&quot; He added that &quot;Since I believe that the purpose of literature is to stress individuality, I also, unwillingly, stress human lonesomeness&quot;.

Singer&#x27;s themes of witchcraft, mystery and legend draw on traditional sources, but they are contrasted with a modern and ironic consciousness. They are also concerned with the bizarre and the grotesque.

An important strand of his art is intra-familial strife, which he experienced when taking refuge with his mother and younger brother at his uncle&#x27;s home in Biłgoraj. This is the central theme in Singer&#x27;s family chronicles such as &quot;The Family Moskat&quot; (1950), &quot;The Manor&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Estate&quot; (1969). Some critics believe these show the influence of Thomas Mann&#x27;s novel &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;; Singer had translated Mann&#x27;s &quot;Der Zauberberg&quot; (&quot;The Magic Mountain&quot;) into Yiddish as a young writer.

===Language===
Singer always wrote and published in Yiddish. His novels were serialized in newspapers, which also published his short stories. He edited his novels and stories for publication in English, which was used as the basis for translation into other languages. Some of Singer&#x27;s stories and novels have not been translated.

===Illustrators===
The artists who have illustrated Singer&#x27;s novels, short stories, and children&#x27;s books, include Raphael Soyer, Maurice Sendak, Larry Rivers, and Irene Lieblich. Singer personally selected Lieblich to illustrate two of his books for children, &quot;A Tale of Three Wishes&quot; and &quot;The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah,&quot; after seeing her paintings at an Artists Equity exhibition in New York City. A Holocaust survivor, Lieblich was from Zamosc, Poland, a town adjacent to the area where Singer was raised. As their memories of &quot;shtetl&quot; life were so similar, Singer found Lieblich&#x27;s images ideally suited to illustrate his texts. Of her style, Singer wrote that &quot;her works are rooted in Jewish folklore and are faithful to Jewish life and the Jewish spirit.&quot;

===Summary===
Singer published at least 18 novels, 14 children&#x27;s books, a number of memoirs, essays and articles. He is best known as a writer of short stories, which have been published in more than a dozen collections. The first collection of Singer&#x27;s short stories in English, &quot;Gimpel the Fool&quot;, was published in 1957. The title story was translated by Saul Bellow and published in May 1953 in the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. Selections from Singer&#x27;s &quot;Varshavsky-stories&quot; in the &quot;Daily Forward&quot; were later published in anthologies such as &quot;My Father&#x27;s Court&quot; (1966). Later collections include &quot;A Crown of Feathers&quot; (1973), with notable masterpieces in between, such as &quot;The Spinoza of Market Street&quot; (1961) and &quot;A Friend of Kafka&quot; (1970). His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry in which he grew up. After his many years in America, his stories also portrayed the world of the immigrants and their pursuit of an elusive American dream, which seems always beyond reach.

Prior to Singer&#x27;s winning the Nobel Prize, English translations of dozens of his stories were published in popular magazines like &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot; that published literary works.

Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.

Between 1981 and 1989, Singer contributed articles to &quot;Moment&quot;, an independent magazine which focuses on the life of the American Jewish community.

===Film adaptations===
His novel &quot;Enemies, a Love Story&quot; was adapted as a film by the same name (1989) and was quite popular, bringing new readers to his work. It features a Holocaust survivor who deals with varying desires, complex family relationships, and a loss of faith.

Singer&#x27;s story, &quot;Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy&quot; was adapted into a stage version by Leah Napolin (with Singer), which was the basis for the film &quot;Yentl&quot; (1983) starring and directed by Barbra Streisand.

Alan Arkin starred as Yasha, the principal character in the film version of &quot;The Magician of Lublin&quot; (1979), which also featured Shelley Winters, Louise Fletcher, Valerie Perrine and Lou Jacobi. In the final scene, Yasha achieves his lifelong ambition of being able to fly, though not as the magic trick he had originally planned.

Perhaps the most fascinating Singer-inspired film is &quot;Mr. Singer&#x27;s Nightmare and Mrs. Pupkos Beard&quot; (1974) directed by Bruce Davidson, a renowned photographer who became Singer&#x27;s neighbor. This unique film is a half-hour mixture of documentary and fantasy for which Singer wrote the script and played the leading role.

The 2007 film &quot;Love Comes Lately&quot;, starring Otto Tausig, was adapted from several of Singer&#x27;s stories.

==Views and opinions==
===Judaism===
Singer&#x27;s relationship to Judaism was complex and unconventional. He identified as a skeptic and a loner, though he felt a connection to his Orthodox roots. Ultimately, he developed a view of religion and philosophy which he called &quot;private mysticism&quot;. As he put it, &quot;Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, He could be endowed with whatever traits one elected to hang upon Him.&quot;

Singer was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew and learned Torah and Talmud. As he recounted in the autobiographical short story &quot;In My Father&#x27;s Court&quot;, he broke away from his parents in his early twenties. Influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, he began spending time with non-religious Bohemian artists in Warsaw. Although Singer believed in a God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holy Days. He struggled throughout his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the Holocaust deaths of so many of the Polish Jews from his childhood. In one interview with the photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, &quot;I am angry at God because of what happened to my brothers&quot;: Singer&#x27;s older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a thrombosis; his younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with his mother and wife to Southern Kazakhstan in Stalin&#x27;s purges.

Despite the complexities of his religious outlook, Singer lived in the midst of the Jewish community throughout his life. He did not seem to be comfortable unless he was surrounded by Jews; particularly Jews born in Europe. Although he spoke English, Hebrew, and Polish fluently, he always considered Yiddish his natural tongue. He always wrote in Yiddish and he was the last notable American author to be writing in this language. After he had achieved success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending time during the winters in Miami with its Jewish community, many of them New Yorkers.

Eventually, as senior citizens, they moved to Miami. They identified closely with the Ashkenazi Jewish community. After his death, Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony in a Jewish cemetery in Paramus, New Jersey.

===Vegetarianism===
Singer was a prominent Jewish vegetarian for the last 35 years of his life and often included vegetarian themes in his works. In his short story &quot;The Slaughterer&quot;, he described the anguish of an appointed slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his job of killing them. He felt that the ingestion of meat was a denial of all ideals and all religions: &quot;How can we speak of right and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?&quot; When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: &quot;I did it for the health of the chickens.&quot;

Vegetarianism is a recurrent theme in Singer&#x27;s novel &quot;Enemies, a Love Story&quot;. One character, a Holocaust survivor, declares that &quot;God himself eats meat—human flesh. There are no vegetarians—none. If you had seen what I have seen, you would know that God approves of slaughter,&quot; and another character points out &quot;that what the Nazis had done to the Jews, man was doing to animals.&quot; In &quot;The Letter Writer&quot;, Singer wrote &quot;In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka,&quot; which became a classic reference in the comparison of animal exploitation with the Holocaust.

In the preface to Steven Rosen&#x27;s &quot;Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions&quot; (1986), Singer wrote, &quot;When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice. Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others. Why should man then expect mercy from God? It&#x27;s unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give. It is inconsistent. I can never accept inconsistency or injustice. Even if it comes from God. If there would come a voice from God saying, &#x27;I&#x27;m against vegetarianism!&#x27; I would say, &#x27;Well, I am for it!&#x27; This is how strongly I feel in this regard.&quot;

===Politics===
Singer described himself as &quot;conservative,&quot; adding that &quot;I don&#x27;t believe by flattering the masses all the time we really achieve much.&quot; His conservative side was most apparent in his Yiddish writing and journalism, where he was openly hostile to Marxist sociopolitical agendas. In &quot;Forverts&quot; he once wrote, &quot;It may seem like terrible &quot;apikorses&quot; [heresy], but conservative governments in America, England, France, have handled Jews no worse than liberal governments... The Jew&#x27;s worst enemies were always those elements that the modern Jew convinced himself (really hypnotized himself) were his friends.&quot;

===Zionism===
Issac Bashevis was ambivalent on the question of Zionism, and he viewed the immigration of Jews to Palestine critically. As a Polish Jew from Warsaw, he was historically confronted with the question of the Jewish fate during Nazi persecution. He exercised social responsibility towards the immigration of European and American Jewish groups to Israel after World War II. Strictly based on Jewish family doctrine rather than politics and socialism, his former partner Runya Pontsch and his son Israel Zamir emigrated to Palestine in 1938, in order to live a typical kibbutz life there. In his story &quot;The Certificate&quot; (1967), which has autobiographical character, he fictionalizes this question from a time in the mid-1920s when he was himself considering moving to the British Mandate Palestine. The protagonist of the story decides to leave Palestine, however, to move back into his shtetl. For Singer then, Zionism becomes the &quot;road not taken&quot;. However, through his journalistic assignments in late 1955, Singer made his first trip to Israel, accompanied by his wife Alma. Describing the trip to his Yiddish readers, he introduces the world for the first time to the young state of Israel. In a change of mind, he then describes the Land of Israel as a &quot;reality, and part of everyday life.&quot; Interestingly enough, he notes the cultural tensions between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish people during the boat trip from Naples to Haifa and during his stay in the new nation. With the description of Jewish immigration camps in the new land, he foresaw the difficulties and socio-economic tensions in Israel, and hence turned back to his critical views of Zionism. He scrutinized the ideology further, as he was advancing his thought of critical Zionism.

<doc id="15513" wikidata="Q1073559" url="?curid=15513" title="Islamic eschatology">
<text>Islamic eschatology (, ) is a field of study in Islam concerning future events that would happen in the end times. It is primarily based on sources from the Quran and Sunnah. Aspects from this field of study include the signs of the final age, the destruction of the universe and Judgement Day.

The general consensus among the Islamic authorities is that the end times will be preceded by a series of signs. However, Islamic texts from the Classical era, Middle Ages, and modern times have differed enormously as what those signs might include. Suggestions have included an era of trials and tribulations, immorality, mighty wars, unnatural phenomena, an invasion by Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) into Arab lands, and/or the return of justice to the world. Once all the events are completed, the universe shall be destroyed and every human being would be resurrected to be held accountable for their deeds.

Muhammad says: `Your appointed time compared with that of those who were before you is as from the Asr prayer to the setting of the sun&#x27;&quot;. Some &quot;weak&quot; hadith sources points out to a lifespan of 6 or 7 thousand years of the Earth, equated onset with the descent of Adam to the world, and its lifespan of 1400 or 1500 years after Muhammad. In addition to this information, which also expresses the belief of the &quot;first Muslim scholars&quot;, Michael Cook states that Ibn Ishaq calculated the period from Adam to the arrival of Muhammad as 5,432 years.

The primary characters in apocalyptic Islamic narratives are: the Mahdi (&quot;Guided One&quot;), Isa (aka Jesus) who descends from heaven in a Second Coming, the Dajjal (&quot;Deceiving Messiah&quot; aka False Messiah, viewed as similar to the Antichrist figure in Christianity), and the Beast. Characters can also be used by some religious groups with some shifts; Said Nursi with the concept and meaning modifications in adapting to the time he lived in, highlights the concept of Sufyani instead of Dajjal and applies numerologic methods to some Āyah/hadith fragments, making signs of his followers community as Mahdi (Collective ID; Sahs al-manawi”) and possible dates for apocalypse.

In the apocalyptic scenes, clues and descriptions are included regarding the nature, structure and dimensions of the celestial bodies as perceived in the Quran: While the stars are lamps illuminating the sky in ordinary cases, turns into stones (Al-Mulk 1-5) or (shahap; meteor, burning fire) (al-Jinn 9) thrown at demons that illegally ascend to the sky; When the time of judgment comes, they spill onto the earth, but this does not mean that life on earth ends; People run left and right in fear.(At-Takwir 1-7) Then a square is set up and the king or lord of the day;(&quot;māliki yawmi-d-dīn&quot;) comes and shows his shin; looks are fearful, are invited to prostration; but those invited in the past but stayed away, cannot do this.(Al-Qalam 42-43)

== The &quot;Dunyā/Ākhirah&quot; Divide ==
Islam, like Christianity, conceptualizes the relationship between &quot;Dunyā&quot; (world) and &quot;Ākhirah&quot; (hereafter) in a diachronic timeline. Humanities&#x27; history in the world begins with the Fall of Adam and ends with God&#x27;s Judgement. In contrast to Christianity, however, Adam&#x27;s fall does not result in an utter separation from the transcendent world. The two otherworldly abodes (paradise and hell) exist in proximity, both in a spatial as well as in a temporal sense, to the &quot;Dunyā&quot;. 

Since in Islamic beliefs, God does not reside in paradise, Islamic tradition was able to bridge the world and the hereafter without violating God&#x27;s transcendence. Islamic literature is filled with interactions between the world and the hereafter and the world is closely intertwined with both paradise and hell. Muhammad visited during his &quot;Miʿrāj&quot; (Night Journey) both paradise and hell. Same is said about the Islamic prophet ʾIdrīs. The palm-tree as well as the pomegranate are supposed to originate from paradise. A &quot;Walī&quot; (saint) grabs a pomegranate out of a vision from paradise. Muhammad reportedly states that fever flows from hell. The infernal tree Zaqqum manifests in this world. Some animals, scorpions and snakes in particular, are said to travel between the world and hell. People may interact with the souls of the deceased, receive blessings, or ease the dead&#x27;s abode in the otherworld. Māturīdi scholar Abu al-Layth al-Samarqandi (944–983) explains that the otherworldly abodes coexist in order to inspire hope and cause fear.

The overlap of the earthly and otherworldly domain is anchored in the Quran itself. Challenging the pre-Islamic Arabian conception of time (&quot;dahr&quot;) as a linear and irreversible process, time has become subject to God. In general, the Quran &quot;is lacking a notion of time as divided into past, present and future.&quot; Therefore, Quranic eschatology cannot be understood through a linear conceptualization of time. The difference between the earth and the otherworld is not that of time but rather that of space. Paradise and hell are spatially connected to earth. At Judgement Day, paradise and hell do not perish, nor are they created anew, rather paradise and hell are &quot;brought near&quot; (26:90-91) Before that event, paradise is suggested to be somewhere in the high regions of the world and hell located in the depths.

The coexistence of the &quot;dunyā&quot; with the otherworld was contested by the Mu&#x27;tazila. They argued that since before the Day of Resurrection all except God will be destroyed by the trumpet, paradise and hell have no function until after the annihilation of the world. However, God creates only with a purpose. By denying the stay of souls in either abode, paradise and hell have no function before the Day of Judgement and thus, must be created afterwards. Māturīdism objects by asserting that paradise and hell do fulfill the before mentioned functions. Ash&#x27;ariya argued that although the trumpet&#x27;s sounding will precede all being destroyed, creation was a &quot;constant process&quot;. 

Muslim theologians (&quot;mutakallimun&quot;) referred to multiple verses of the Quran for evidence that paradise and hell coexist with the current world. It is implied someone has gone to the Garden or the hell (3:169, 36:13-26, 66:10, 3:10-11, 6:93). In the Story of Adam and Eve, they once resided in Garden of Eden, which is often considered to be Jannah. This identification, however, is not universal. Al-Balluti (887 – 966) reasoned that the Garden of Eden lacked the perfection and eternal character of a final paradise: Adam and Eve lost the primordial paradise, while the paradisiacal afterlife lasts forever; if Adam and Eve were in the otherworldly paradise, the devil (&quot;Shaiṭān&quot;) could not have entered and deceived them, since there is no evil or idle talk in paradise; Adam slept in his garden, but there is no sleep in paradise.

The discussion may have been incited by Jahm bin Ṣafwān who claimed that paradise and hell will end, but coexist with the world. Insisting on the impermanence of everything but God, he asserts that &quot;eternity&quot; is used hyperbolically and means that people abide in paradise and hell only as long as both worlds last. Most Sunnis, however, hold the opinion that paradise and hell are eternal.

== Apocalyptic Literature ==

There is no universally accepted apocalyptic tradition among either Sunnis or Shias. The Quran is primarily an eschatological work, not an apocalyptic one. The Quran, concerned about the impending Day of Judgement, leaves no room for apocalyptic events in the far future. Apocalyptic narratives are only composed 150-200 years later from different religious elements. The first known complete Islamic apocalyptic work is the &quot;Kitāb al-Fitan&quot; (Book of Tribulations) by Naim ibn Hammad.

The extensive usage of Hebrew and Syriac vocabulary in Islamic apocalyptic writings suggests that apocalyptic narratives formed from vivid exchange between different religious traditions. These exchanges most likely did not happen among scholars, but orally among the uneducated masses. A lot of apocalyptic material is attributed to Ka&#x27;b al-Ahbar and former Jewish converts to Islam, while other transmitters indicate a Christian background. Christian apocalyptic literature was known at latest since the 9th century in Arabic.

Although apocalyptic literature barely cites the Quran, the narratives refer and paraphrase Islamic sacred scripture. In contrast to the method of usage of &quot;ḥadīth&quot;, apocalyptic literature dictates the Quran rather than explaining the text. Thus, David Cook suggested that at a certain point, the Quran was rather competing with apocalyptic literature than they were complementary. 

Islamic apocalyptic narratives were later expanded and developed by Islamic authors notably Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, al-Ghazali, Ibn Arabi, Al-Qurtubi, Ibn Kathir, and as-Suyuti). The authors list various signs as meanings of the arrivals of the apocalypse. Some references to the Quran were frequently understood in apocalyptic terms, such as &quot;fitna&quot;, &quot;Dabba&quot;, and Gog and Magog. At the time of the Mongol conquests, ibn Kathir identified the latter with the historical Turks and Mongols. The apocalyptic writings frequently feature extra-Quranic figures such as the &quot;Dajjāl&quot; (corresponding to Armilos and Anti-Christ) and the &quot;Mahdīy&quot;. The &quot;Dajjāl&quot; is supposed to become a cause of misguidance and causes havoc on earth, but is ultimately stopped by either the &quot;Mahdīy&quot; or Jesus, who returns from heaven.

==Resurrection and final judgement==
In Islam, &quot;the promise and threat&quot; (&quot;waʿd wa-waʿīd&quot;) of Judgement Day ( or ), 
has been called &quot;the dominant message&quot; of the Quran,
and is considered a fundamental tenet of faith by all Muslims, and one of the six articles of Islamic faith.

The two themes &quot;central to the understanding of Islamic eschatology&quot; are:
# the resurrection of bodies joined with spirits in a &quot;reunion of whole, cognizant, and responsible persons&quot;, and 
# a final judgement of the quality of each persons life &quot;lived on earth and a subsequent recompense carried out with absolute justice through the prerogative of God&#x27;s merciful will&quot;.

=== Resurrection theories ===
Although Islamic philosophers and scholars were in general agreement on a bodily resurrection after death, interpretations differ in regard to the specifications of bodily resurrection. Some of the theories are the following:

* The return to the same material body, someone had during lifetime, that will be restored.
* Conjunction of the soul with a Mithali body, which is congenial to the worlds of Barzakh and the Akhirah.
* Resurrection with a Hurqaliyati body, accordingly a second invisible body, that survives death.

The trials, tribulations and details associated with it are detailed in the Quran and the hadith (sayings of Muhammad); these have been elaborated on in creeds, Quranic commentaries (tafsịrs), theological writing, eschatological manuals to provide more details and a sequence of events on the Day. Islamic expositors and scholarly authorities who have explained the subject in detail include al-Ghazali, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Majah, Muhammad al-Bukhari, and Ibn Khuzaymah.

=== Lesser Resurrection ===
Small Resurrection (&quot;al-qiyamah al-sughra&quot;) happens, when the soul is separated from the body. The soul then turns to the afterlife (&quot;akhira&quot; or &quot;malakut&quot;), where it is interrogated by two angels, Munkar and Nakir.

This grave period is known as the Barzakh, similar to the intermediate state in Christianity.

=== Greater Resurrection ===
At divine judgement, the resurrected will stand in a grand assembly, each person&#x27;s &quot;Book of Deeds&quot; – where &quot;every small and great thing is recorded&quot; – will be read, and ultimate judgement made. The resurrected will then walk over the bridge of As-Sirāt, those judged worthy for the Garden continuing to their heavenly abode, those damned to The Fire, falling off the bridge into the pit of Jahannam. There will also be a punishment of the grave (for those who disbelieved) between death and the resurrection.

Not everyone consigned to hell will remain there, as it is believed by both scholars and lay Muslims that &quot;all but the &quot;mushrikun&quot;, those who have committed the worst sin of impugning the &quot;tawḥīd&quot; of God, have the possibility of being saved;&quot; and God&#x27;s intercession to save sinners from hellfire is a &quot;major theme&quot; in popular Islamic stories about Judgement Day.

== Eschatological theological questions==
Scholars did not always agree on questions of who might go to hell; whether the creation of heaven and hell would wait until Judgement Day; whether there was a state between heaven and hell; whether those consigned to hell would be there for eternity.

===Basis of belief===
&quot;Fear, hope, and finally ... faith&quot;, have been given (by Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Y. Haddad) as motivations offered by the Quran for the belief of Muslims in an Afterlife, although some (Abū Aʿla al-Mawdūdī) have asserted it is simply a matter of reason:
The fact is that whatever Muhammad (peace be upon him) has told us about life after death is clearly borne out by reason. Although our belief in that Day is based upon our implicit trust in the Messenger of God, rational reflection not only confirms this belief but it also reveals that Muhammad&#x27;s (peace be upon him) teachings in this respect are much more reasonable and understandable than all other view-points about life after death.

=== Early Muslim thought on damnation===
One of the primary beliefs pertaining to Islamic eschatology during the Early Muslim Period was that all humans could receive God&#x27;s mercy and were worthy of salvation. These early depictions even show how small, insignificant deeds were enough to warrant mercy. Most early depictions of the end of days depict only those who reject &quot;Tawhid&quot;, (the concept of monotheism), are subject to eternal punishment. However, everybody is held responsible for their actions. Concepts of reward and punishment were seen as beyond this world, a view that is also held today.

===Literal or allegorical===
According to scholars Jane I. Smith, Yvonne Y. Haddad, &quot;the vast majority of believers&quot;, understand verses of the Quran on Jannah (and hellfire) &quot;to be real and specific, anticipating them&quot; with joy or terror.
Besides the material notion of the paradise, descriptions of it are also interpreted as allegories, whose meaning is the state of joy believers will experience in the afterlife. For some theologians, seeing God is not a question of sight, but of awareness of God&#x27;s presence. Although early Sufis, such as Hallaj, took the descriptions of paradise literal, later Sufi traditions usually stressed out the allegorical meaning.

On the issue of Judgement Day, early Muslims debated whether scripture should be interpreted literally or figuratively, and the school of thought that prevailed (Ashʿarī) &quot;affirmed that such things as&quot; connected with Judgement day as &quot;the individual records of deeds (including the paper, pen, and ink with which they are inscribed), the bridge, the balance, and the pond&quot; are &quot;realities&quot;, and &quot;to be understood in a concrete and literal sense.&quot;

===Modernist, postmodernist thought===

According to Smith and Haddad, &quot;The great majority of contemporary Muslim writers, ... choose not to discuss the afterlife at all&quot;. Islamic Modernists, according to Smith and Haddad, express a &quot;kind of embarrassment with the elaborate traditional detail concerning life in the grave and in the abodes of recompense, called into question by modern rationalists&quot;. Consequently, most of &quot;modern Muslim Theologians&quot; either &quot;silence the issue&quot; or reaffirm &quot;the traditional position that the reality of the afterlife must not be denied but that its exact nature remains unfathomable&quot;.

The beliefs of Pakistani modernist Muhammad Iqbal (died 1938), were similar to the Sufi &quot;spiritual and internalized interpretations of hell&quot; of ibn ʿArabī, and Rumi, seeing paradise and hell &quot;primarily as metaphors for inner psychic&quot; developments. Thus &quot;hellfire is actually a state of realization of one&#x27;s failures as a human being&quot;, and not a supernatural subterranean realm. Egyptian modernist Muhammad ʿAbduh, thought it was sufficient to believe in the existence of an afterlife with rewards and punishment to be a true believer, even if you ignored &quot;clear&quot; (&quot;ẓāhir&quot;) hadith about hell.

====Gender equity====
Amina Wadud notes that the Qur&#x27;an does not mention any specific gender when talking about hell, Q., for example, states that &quot;the guilty are immortal in hell&#x27;s torment&quot;; and when discussing paradise, includes women, Q., for example, states that &quot;Beautiful of mankind is love of the joys (that come) from women and offspring...&quot;

=== &quot;Limbo&quot; or &quot;al-aʿrāf&quot; in Islam ===

In terms of classical Islam, &quot;the only options&quot; afforded by the Qur&#x27;an for the resurrected are an eternity of horrible punishments of The Fire or the delightful rewards of The Garden. Islamic tradition has raised the question of whether or not consignment to the Fire is eternal, or eternal for all, but &quot;has found no reason to amend&quot; the limit of two options in the afterlife. But one verse in the Quran has &quot;led to a great deal of speculation concerning the possibility of a third place&quot;.
*There will be a barrier [&quot;ḥijāb&quot;] between paradise and hell. And on the heights [&quot;al-aʿrāf&quot;] of that barrier˺ will be people who will recognize ˹the residents of˺ both by their appearance. They will call out to the residents of paradise, &quot;Peace be upon you!&quot; They will have not yet entered paradise, but eagerly hope to (Q.). 
&quot;What some have called&quot; the &quot;Limbo&quot; Theory of Islam, as described by Jane Smith and Yvonne Haddad, implies that some individuals are not immediately sent to The Fire or The Garden, but are held in a state of limbo. Smith and Haddad believe it is &quot;very doubtful&quot; that the Qur&#x27;anic meant for &quot;al-aʿrāf&quot; to be understood as &quot;an abode for those ... in an intermediate category, but this has come to be the most commonly held interpretation&quot;.

As for who the inhabitants of the inhabits &quot;al-aʿrāf&quot; are, the &quot;majority of exegetes&quot; support the theory that they are persons whose actions balance in terms of merit and demerit – whose good deeds keep them from the Fire and whose evil deeds keep them from the Garden. They will be the last to enter the Garden, at the mercy of their Lord.

=== The Concept of Eternity ===
In Classical Islam, there was a consensus among the theological community regarding the finality of Jannah (also called Heaven, paradise, the Gardens); after Judgement Day, faithful servants of God would find themselves here for eternity. However, some practitioners in the early Muslim community held that the other abode of the hereafter (hell/Jahannam), or at least part of that abode, might not be eternal. This belief was based upon an interpretations of scripture that since the upper, less tortuous levels of hell were reserved for Muslims who were only in hell for as long as God deemed necessary. Once Muslims had their sins purged and were allowed into heaven, these levels would be empty and the need for their existence gone. These interpretations are centered on verses 11:106–107 in the Quran, stating, 
:&quot;As for those who are wretched, they shall be in the Fire, wherein there shall be for them groaning and wailing, abiding therein for so long as the heavens and the earth endure, save as thy Lord wills. Surely thy Lord does whatsoever He wills&quot;. 
This possibility that God may yet commute a sentence to hell, interprets (parts of) hell as being similar in function to purgatory in Christianity, with the exception to this comparison being that hell in this context is for the punishment of the sinner&#x27;s complete body, as opposed to only the soul being punished in purgatory. Arguments questioning the permanence of hell take the view that hell is not necessarily solely there to punish the evil, but to purify their souls, whereas the purpose of the Garden is simply to reward the righteous.
Evidence against the concept of hell being in part temporary, is the Quran verse stating that hell will endure as long as Heaven will, which has been established as eternal.

===Predestination===

Orthodox Islam teaches the doctrine of &quot;Qadar&quot; (, aka Predestination, or divine destiny in Islam), whereby everything that has happened and will happen in the universe—including sinful human behavior—is commanded by God. At the same time, we human beings are responsible for our actions and rewarded or punished for them in the Afterlife.

&quot;Qadar&quot;/predestination/divine destiny, is one of Sunni Islam&#x27;s six articles of faith and is mentioned in the Quran. 
*&quot;Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has destined for us&quot; (Q.).
*&quot;Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills.&quot; (Q.).
Of course, the fate of human beings in the Afterlife is especially crucial. It is reflected in Quranic verses such as 
* Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together. (Q.).

Muhammad also talked about the doctrine of predestination multiple times during his mission. Thus the consensus of the Sunni Muslim community has been that scripture indicates predestination. 
Nonetheless, some Muslim theologians have argued against predestination, (including at least some Shia Muslims, whose article of faith includes &quot;Adalah&quot; (justice), but not &quot;Qadar&quot;. At least some Shia – such as Naser Makarem Shirazi – denounce predestination).

Opponents of predestination in early Islam, (&quot;al-Qadariyah&quot;, &quot;Muʿtazila&quot;) argued that if God has already determined everything that will happen, God&#x27;s human creation cannot really have free will over decisions to do good or evil, or control of whether they suffer eternal torment in Jahannam—which is something that (the opponents believe) a just God would never allow to happen. 
While &quot;Qadar&quot; is the consensus of Muslims, it is also an issue scholars discourage debate and discussion about. Hadith narrate Muhammad warning his followers to &quot;refrain from speaking about &quot;qadar&quot;&quot;; and according to the creed of Al-Tahawi, &quot;the principle of providence&quot; is such a secret that God did not let even angels, prophets and messengers in on the mystery.

=== Who will enter heaven or hell===
Scholars do not all agree on who will end up in Jannah and who in Jahannam, and the criteria for deciding. Issues include whether all Muslims, even those who&#x27;ve committed major sins, will end up in Jannah; whether any non-Muslims will be saved or all will go to Jahannam. 
According to the Quran, the basic criterion for salvation in the afterlife is the belief in the oneness of God (), angels, revealed books, messengers, as well as repentance to God, and doing good deeds (&quot;amal salih&quot;). This is qualified by the doctrine that ultimately salvation can only be attained through God&#x27;s judgement.

Muslim scholars mostly agree that ultimately all Muslims will be saved (though many may need to be purified by a spell in hellfire but disagree about the possibility for salvation of non-Muslims.

The idea that jinn as well as humans could find salvation was widely accepted, Like humans, their destiny in the hereafter depends on whether they accept God&#x27;s guidance. The surah Al-Jinn says:
:And among us are those who have submitted ˹to Allah˺ and those who are deviant. So ˹as for˺ those who submitted, it is they who have attained Right Guidance. And as for the deviant, they will be fuel for Hell.’&quot; (Q.)
Angels, who are not subject to desire and do not commit sin, are found in paradise. The devils cannot return to paradise, because Islamic scripture states that their father, the fallen angel Iblis, was banished, but never suggests that he or his offspring were forgiven or promised to return.

====Scholars====
Muslim scholars arguing in favor of non-Muslims&#x27; being able to enter paradise cite the verse: 
*&quot;Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabians—those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness—will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve,&quot; (Q.). 
Those arguing against non-Muslim salvation regard this verse to have applied only until the arrival of Muhammad, after which it was abrogated by another verse: 
* &quot;And whoever desires other than Islam as religion—never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers. (Q.). 
Although the Quran acknowledges the Bible as gospel, rejecting Muhammad and his message is seen as a rejection of salvation by them.

According to Mohammad Hassan Khalil, on the subject of whether self-proclaimed non-Muslims might be allowed into Jannah, Islamic theologians can be classified as 
*&#x27;Exclusivists&#x27; – who maintain that only Muslims will be saved and that adherents of all other beliefs will burn in hell. 
*&#x27;Inclusivists&#x27; – who also affirm that Islam is the path to heaven, but that some others are actually on the same path (and will go to Jannah) though they call themselves non-Muslims and call their path by a different name.
* &#x27;Pluralists&#x27; – assert that there are several religious traditions or interpretations that are equally effective saving their adherents from damnation, regardless of the circumstances. 
* &#x27;Universalists&#x27; – &#x27;believe that all of hell&#x27;s inhabitants will be admitted into heaven following a significant period of time&#x27; suffering in hell. 
(In addition there are those who could be described as &#x27;interim inclusivists&#x27; or &#x27;ultimate universalists&#x27;.)

Based on these categories, four &quot;well-known and particularly influential Muslim thinkers&quot; can be sorted as: 
* al-Ghazālī – &quot;optimistic&quot; or &quot;liberal inclusivist&quot;,
* Ibn al-ʿArabī – &quot;liberal inclusivist&quot; to &quot;quasi-universalist&quot;, 
* Ibn Taymiyya and 
* Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya – both universalists, (despite their status as &quot;darlings&quot; of &quot;many who call themselves Salafīs&quot;),
* Rashīd Riḍā – was a lenient inclusivist to cautious universalist.
* Ibn Hazm – &quot;proclaimed that even the most upright and flawless moral-ethical monotheist is damned to hell if he knows anything about a person named Muḥammad or a religion called Islam and does not join, while even the most brutal and immoral person who converts sincerely to Islam the moment before he dies, is saved&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;any Muslim who does not agree is not a Muslim himself.&quot;

==== Ash&#x27;arism ====

Ashʿarism (/æʃəˈriː/; Arabic: أشعرية: al-ʾAshʿarīyah), one of the main Sunni schools of Islamic theology, founded by the Islamic scholar, Shāfiʿī jurist, Abū al-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī in the 10th century, is known for an optimistic perspective on salvation for Muslims, repeatedly addressing God&#x27;s mercy over God&#x27;s wrath. However, according to Ash&#x27;arism, God is neither obligated to punish disobedience nor to reward obedience.

Ash&#x27;aris hold revelation necessary to understand good and evil, as well as religious truths. Accordingly, revelation is necessary to reach moral and religious truths and thus, people who hear from a prophet or messenger are obligated to follow the revealed religion. However, those who have not received revelation are not obligated, and can hope for salvation. 

Ash&#x27;arite scholar al-Ghazali divided non-Muslims into three categories for purposes of the Afterlife according to Mohammad Hassan Khalil:

#Those who never heard the message of Islam, who live in far away lands, such as the Byzantines (&quot;Romans&quot;). These will be forgiven.
#Those who were only exposed to a distorted understanding of Islam and had no opportunity to hear the correct version. These too will be forgiven.
#People who heard of Islam because they lived in neighboring lands and/or mixed with Muslims. These have no hope of salvation.
Of these three, only the last group would be punished.
Ghazali distinguished between the &quot;saved&quot; and &quot;those who will attain success&quot;. Therefore, righteous non-Muslims will neither enter hell nor Jannah, but will stay in al-Araf (a realm between Jannah and Jahannam inhabited by those who are neither entirely evil nor entirely good).

==== Maturidism ====

Māturīdism (: &quot;al-Māturīdiyyah&quot;) is also one of the main Sunni schools of Islamic theology developed and formalized by the Islamic scholar, Ḥanafī jurist Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī in the 10th century. Māturīdi scholars are thought to have been less optimistic about the chances of sinners entering paradise than Ash&#x27;aris, but more optimistic than Muʿtazila. They agree that Muslims who have committed grave sins will be punished but generally acknowledge that even these people will eventually enter paradise. Regarding the fate of non-Muslims, scholars have different opinions. Māturīdism holds people responsible for believing in a creator due to their intellectual capacities, even if they haven&#x27;t heard about any prophetic mission. While some (like Rifat Atay) regard Māturīdism to be exclusivistic, only allowing people who are Muslims to enter paradise, others argue that Māturīdi understood that &quot;to believe in Islam&quot; meant having a subjective conceptualization of God and his laws by reason alone. This fits the doctrine, upheld by Māturīdism, that human reason suffices to grasp good and evil, and arrive at religious truths. Accordingly, people are judged by their degree of understanding God&#x27;s universal law, not by their adherence to a particular belief system. In modern times, Yohei Matsuyama largely agrees with this interpretation. According to Abu&#x27;l-Qasim Ishaq, children cannot be considered unbelievers, thus all of them go to paradise.

==== Muʿtazila ====

Muʿtazila ( &quot;&quot;) emphasized God&#x27;s justice, free will, and the responsibility of each human being for their actions. They have been called the &quot;best known exponents&quot; of &quot;Qadariyah&quot;, the idea that human free will was necessary &quot;as a guarantee of divine justice&quot;. Compared to Maturidi and Ashʿarī, Muʿtazila had the least amount of &quot;salvific optimism&quot;.
The &quot;divine threat&quot; (&quot;al-wa&#x27;id&quot;) and &quot;divine promise&quot; (&quot;al wa&#x27;d&quot;) became key tenets of the Mu&#x27;tazilites, who stressed that they applied to both Muslims and non-Muslims. This meant that those who committed grave or heinous sins (Kabirah), even Muslims, might denied entry to paradise forever. The only way for a grave sinner to be forgiven, many theologians believed, is by repentance (&quot;tawba&quot;). Mu&#x27;tazilites believed God&#x27;s justice obligated Him to forgive those who had repented (other schools believed He was not so constrained). The Mu&#x27;tazilites stress on individual accountability meant a rejection of intercession (&quot;Shafa&#x27;a&quot;) on behalf of Muhammad. Another controversial belief of many (but not all) Mu&#x27;tazilites was that paradise and hell would be created only after Judgement Day. This meant rejection of the commonly accepted idea that paradise and hell coexist with the contemporary world. Their reasoning was that since God does everything for a purpose, and since paradise and hell are created to reward or punish people, they will only be created after judegement has been passed on people and they are assigned to these abodes.

====Twelver Shia====

Like most Sunni, Shia Islam hold that all Muslims will eventually go to Jannah.

On the fate of non-Muslims in the hereafter, Shia Islam (or at least cleric Ayatullah Mahdi Hadavi Tehrani of Al-Islam.org), takes a view similar to Ash&#x27;arism. Tehrani divides non-Muslims into two groups: the heedless and stubborn who will go to hell and the ignorant who will not &quot;if they are truthful to their own religion&quot;: 
#Those who are termed &#x27;Jahil-e-Muqassir&#x27; (lit. &#x27;culpable ignorant&#x27; – &quot;jahil&quot; suggesting unbelief rather than literal ignorance). These are non-believers to whom the message of Islam has reached and who have understood its truthfulness. However, they are not prepared to accept the truth due to their obstinacy and stubbornness. This group deserves to be punished in hell.
#Those who are termed &#x27;Jahil-e-Qasir&#x27; (lit. &#x27;inculpable ignorant&#x27;). These are non-believers to whom the message of Islam has not reached, or it has been presented to them in a very incomplete and untruthful manner. Such people will attain salvation if they are truthful to their own religion.

(At least one Twelver Shia scholar &#x27;Allama al-Hilli, insists that not only will non-Muslims be damned but suggests Sunni Muslim will be as well, as it is not possible for any Muslim to be ignorant of &quot;the imamate and of the Return&quot;, and thus &quot;whoever is ignorant of any of them is outside the circle of believers and worthy of eternal punishment.&quot; This statement is not indicative of all Shia eschatological thought.)

Also like mainstream schools, and unlike Muʿtazila, Twelver Shia hold that Jannah and hellfire &quot;exist at present ... according to the Qur`an and ahadith&quot;. However, they will not &quot;become fully apparent and represented&quot; until Judgement Day. As for three other issues in Islamic eschatology: 
*the differences between Adam and Eve&#x27;s Garden of Eden, 
*&quot;the heaven or hell of one&#x27;s actions which envelopes a person&quot;; and 
*the &quot;Barzakh&quot; state of &quot;purgatory&quot; in Islam after death and before Resurrection; in Shia Islam, 
these three &quot;types&quot; of jannah (or Jahannam) are &quot;all simply manifestations of the ultimate, eternal heaven and hell&quot;.

==== Islamic Modernism and Salafism ====
Modernist scholars Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida rejected the notion that the People of the Book would be excluded from Jannah, based on Q. (see above). The Fate of the unlearned is also a matter of dispute within Islamic theology. Like many modern scholars advocated, including Mawlana Ali, Ismail Hakki Izmirli, and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida asserted the doctrine of a finite hell &quot;fanāʾ al-nār&quot; (&quot;demise of hell&quot;).

Turkish theologian Süleyman Ateş cites the Quran to argue that there are good and bad people in any religion, and that some Muslims may not enter paradise, but those who believe without doubt in the hereafter and a God without partners, and who do good and useful deeds may enter paradise, whatever their religions.

Neo-Salafi trends commonly reject inclusive salvation theories. Umar Sulaiman Al-Ashqar, an eminent Salafi scholar, can serve to illustrate the core points of Salafi beliefs. Like proto-Salafi ibn Qayyim, he rejects the doctrine of &quot;fanāʾ al-nār&quot;. He interpretes a hadith that there are 73 three Islamic sects from which only one is saved in accordance with his own sectarian beliefs. Only those who stick close to the Quran and the Sunnah go to paradise, while those he consider slightly deviant, such as Mu&#x27;tzilites and Kharijites go to hell temporarily, while &quot;extreme&quot; groups such as Isma&#x27;ilis, Alevites, and Druze, go to hell forever. Al-Ashqar elaborates on a hadith that &quot;most inhabitants of hell are women&quot; that women are more likely to go to hell due to intellectual deficiencies. He adds, despite their flaws, there are also many good and pious women. Similar, most Salafi authors reiterate works produced in the premodern period, but add personal preferences adjusting them to comply to their moral and sectarian convictions.

==== The fate of Jews ====
While &quot;some traditional and contemporary commentators&quot; have interpreted the Quran as condemning all Jews, Farid Esack argues this condemnation is neither &quot;universal&quot; nor &quot;eternal&quot;, and asks, &#x27;if the Qur&#x27;an is to consign the Jews to eternal damnation, then what becomes of the sacred text as a means of guidance for all humankind? Would that vision too be damned?&#x27;

An example of a line criticizing the Jews can be found in Surah 5: 
*&quot;The Jews say, &#x27;God&#x27;s Hand is shackled.&#x27; Shackled are their hands, and they are cursed for what they say. Nay, but His two Hands are outstretched, He bestows as He wills. Surely that which has been sent down unto thee from thy Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief. And we cast enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. As often they ignite a flame for war, God extinguishes it. They endeavor to work corruption upon the earth. And God loves not thee workers of corruption.&quot; (Q.)

A Sahih hadith concerning Jews and one of the signs of the coming of Judgement Day has been quoted many times, (it became a part of the charter of Hamas).
* The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (the Boxthorn tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews. 
However, some scripture praises the dedication of Jews to monotheism, and this verse of the Qur&#x27;an in surah 3, can be interpreted as taking a more reconciliatory tone: 
*&quot;They are not all alike. Among the People of the Book is an upright community who recite God&#x27;s signs in the watches of the night, while they prostrate. They believe in God and the Last Day, enjoin right and forbid wrong, and hasten unto good deeds. And they are among the righteous. Whatsoever good they do, they will not be denied it. And God knows the reverent&quot;. (Q.) 
After reconciling the different descriptions, one can conclude that the transgressions of the &quot;apes and pigs&quot; are not indicative of the entire community, and that while some Jews are on their way to damnation, others are not.

==Islamic Apocalyptic among Muslims in 20th and 21st centuries==
Prior to the 20th century, Islam had &quot;strongly emphasized the hereafter&quot; (&quot;ākhira&quot;). Desire to counter colonialism and &quot;achieve material and technological parity with the West&quot; turned modern thinkers to stress this world (&quot;dunyā&quot;), without suggesting &quot;ākhira&quot; was less important. 
The focus on end times/Eschatology in Islam has tended to occur among those less exposed to scholarly learning. In the 1980s however, it again became much more popular generally. Islamic leaders and scholars have always urged Muslim to be prepared for Judgement Day, but &quot;the particulars of the end of the world are not a mainstream concern in Islam,&quot; according to Graeme Wood.

However, in 2012 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 50% or more respondents in several Muslim-majority countries (Lebanon, Turkey, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco) expected the Mahdi (the final redeemer according to Islam) to return during their lifetime. The expectation is most common in Afghanistan (83%), followed by Iraq (72%), Turkey (68%), Tunisia (67%), Malaysia (62%), Pakistan (60%), Lebanon (56%), and Muslims in southern Thailand (57%).

Stories of end times and doomsday tend to be passed on as bedtime stories or informal talk among the lay Muslims, rather than in the Imam&#x27;s Friday &quot;khutbah&quot;. &quot;Even Muslims with low levels of knowledge have heard parts of parts of it&quot;, according to scholar Jean Pierre Filiu. In Islamic bookstores, their &quot;dramatic and sensational stories of final battles between good and evil, supernatural powers, the ultimate rise of a Muslim elite,&quot; are naturally more attention getting than more orthodox/studious works on prayer, purity or the lives of exemplary Muslims. More official Muslim sources have often either kept quiet about apocalyptic hadith or outright denied their existence—an example being Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations who stated &quot;There is no apocalyptic bloodbath in Islam.&quot;

Popular Islamic pamphlets and tracts on the End Times have always been in circulation, but until around 2010 their &quot;impact on political and theological thinking was practically nil&quot; among Sunnis. Interest in the End Times is particularly strong among jihadis and &quot;since the mid-2000s, the apocalyptic currents in jihadism have surged.&quot; As of 2011, the belief that the end of the world is at hand and will be precipitated by an apocalyptic Great Battle has been noted as a &quot;fast-growing belief in Muslim countries&quot; though still a minority belief.

=== Shiʿi Islam ===
According to J.-P. Filiu, the uprising of the (Shiʿi) Mahdi Army in Iraq and July 2006 war between Israel and (Shiʿi) Hizbullah are &quot;at least in part&quot; a consequence of &quot;mounting eschatological expectations&quot; coming from copious literature preaching that the return of the Hidden Imam was imminent; literature emanating from the Shiʿi seminaries and scholars of holy city of Najaf, Iraq, from Lebanon, and from Iran during the administration of its president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. One Shiʿi Ayatollah, Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, revered as &quot;the fifth martyr&quot; of Shiʿi Islam (killed by Saddam Hussein), went to the trouble of trying to explain how the Hidden Imam could be over 1000 years old, and why the present is a propitious time for the reappearance of him. Muqtada al-Sadr&#x27;s Mahdi army waged a violent struggle against the American military through 2004, and its ranks swelled with thousands of recruits. Muqtada&#x27;s political faction won seats in parliament. During Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s presidency (2005-2013), he shared with Iranians his &quot;avowed conviction&quot; that believers must actively work for the Mahdi&#x27;s reappearance, despite this bringing him &quot;into conflict with the highest authorities of Shiism&quot;.

===Popular apocalyptic literature===
&quot;Dramatic and sensational stories&quot; of the apocalypse first made an impact in the mid-1980s when Said Ayyub&#x27;s &quot;Al-Masīh al-Dajjāl&quot; (The AntiChrist) started a whole new genre of Islamic &quot;apocalyptic fiction&quot; or &quot;millenarian speculation&quot; throughout the Arab world. The book was so successful Ayyub went on to write a half-dozen other spinoff books, inspired imitators who enjoyed even greater success (Muhammad Izzat Arif, Muhammad Isa Dawud, and Mansur AbdelHakim).

The book (and the genre) was noteworthy for rupturing the &quot;organic link between Islamic tradition and the last days of the world&quot;, using Western sources (such as Gustave Le Bon and William Guy Carr) that previously would have been ignored; and lack of Sahih Bukhari (i.e. top quality) hadith (he does quote Ibn Kathir and some hadith &quot;repeated at second hand&quot;); and for an obsessively anti-Jewish point of view (&quot;in all great transformations of thought, there is a Jewish factor, avowed and plain, or else hidden and secret&quot;, &quot;the Jews are planning the Third World War in order to eliminate the Islamic world and all opposition to Israel&quot;, and cover art featuring a grotesque cartoon figure with a Star of David and large hooked nose).

Unlike traditional popular works of Islamic eschatology that kept close to scripture and classical manuals of eschatology in describing &quot;al-Dajjāl&quot;, Said Ayyub portrayed the Dajjāl as 1) the true Jewish messiah, that Jews had been waiting for, 2) a figure who will appear or reappear not only in end times, but one who has been working throughout the history of humanity to create havoc with such diabolical success that human history is really &quot;only a succession of nefarious maneuvers&quot; by him. Intermediaries of al-dajjal (according to Ayyub) include St. Paul the Apostle, who (Ayyub maintains) created Christianity by distorting the true story of Jesus, the Emperor Constantine who made possible &quot;the Crusader state in service to the Jews&quot;, the Freemasons, Napoleon, the United States of America, Communists, Israel, etc. He concludes that the dajjal is hiding in Palestine (but will also &quot;appear in Khurasan as the head of an expansionist state&quot;) and the Great Battle between Muslims and his forces will be World War III fought in the Middle East.

Later books, &quot;The Hidden Link between the AntiChrist, the Secrets of the Bermuda Triangle, and Flying Saucers&quot; (1994), by Muhammad Isa Dawud, for example, move even farther away from traditional themes, disclosing that the Anti-Christ journeyed from the Middle East to the archipelago of Bermuda in the 8th century CE to make it his home base and from whence he fomented the French Revolution and other mischief, and now sends flying saucers to patrol Egypt and prepare for his eventual triumphal return to Jerusalem.

The success of the genre provoked a &quot;counteroffensive&quot; by pious conservatives (Abdellatif Ashur, Muhammad Bayyumi Magdi, and Muhammad Shahawi) disturbed by the liberties Said Ayyub and others had taken with Islamic doctrine.

===Jihadist references===

In the early 1980s, when Abdullah Azzam, called on Muslims around the world to join the jihad in Afghanistan, he considered the fight &quot;to be a sign that the end times were imminent&quot;. Also around that time, popular Islamic writers, such as Said Ayyub, started blaming Islamic decline in the face of the Western world, not on lack of technology and development, but on the forces of the Dajjal.

Al-Qaeda used &quot;apocalyptic predictions in both its internal and external messaging&quot; according to Jessica Stern, and its use of &quot;the name Khorasan, a region that includes part of Iran, Central Asia, and Afghanistan, and from which, it is prophesied, the Mahdi will emerge alongside an army bearing black flags&quot;, was thought to be a symbol of end times. But these claims were &quot;mostly symbolic&quot;, and according to Wood, Bin Laden &quot;rarely mentioned&quot; the Apocalypse and when he did, &quot;he implied he would be long dead when it arrived&quot; (a reflection of his more &quot;elite&quot; background according to Will McCants). According to J.-P. Filiu, out of the mass of Al-Qaeda documents seized after the fall of the Taliban, only one letter made any reference to the apocalypse.

A prominent jihadist, Abu Musʿab al-Sūri, (called a &quot;sophisticated strategist&quot; and &quot;articulate exponent of the modern jihad&quot;), somewhat independent and critical of Al-Qaeda, was also much more interested in end times. He wrote, &quot;I have no doubt that we have entered into the age of battles and tribulations [&quot;zāman al-malāhim wal-fitan&quot;]&quot; He devoted the last 100 pages of his magnum opus on jihad (&quot;A Call to Global Islamic Resistance&quot;, made available online around 2005) to matters such as the proper chronology and location of related battles and other activities of the Mahdi, the Antichrist, the mountain of gold to be found in the Euphrates river, the Sufyani, Gog and Magog, etc.

Abu Musʿab al Zarqawi, the founder of what would become the Islamic State &quot;injected&quot; the apocalyptic message into jihad. ISIS has evoked &quot;the apocalyptic tradition much more explicitly&quot; than earlier jihadis. Dabiq, Syria – a town understood &quot;in some versions&quot; of the eschatological &quot;narrative to be a possible location for the final apocalyptic battle&quot; – was captured by ISIS and made its capital. ISIS also declared its &quot;intent to conquer Constantinople&quot; – Muslims conquering Constantinople being another end times prophesy. Interviews by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and Jurgen Todenhöfer with many dozens of Muslims who had traveled to fight with Islamic State, and by Graeme Wood with Islamic State supporters elsewhere, found &quot;messianic expectation&quot; a strong motivator to join Islamic State.
;Shiʿi Islam
While Al-Qaeda and Islamic State are Sunni, Shia insurgents/militants have also been &quot;drawn to the battlefield&quot; by &quot;apocalyptic belief&quot;, according to William McCants, who quotes a Shia fighter in Iraq saying, &quot;&#x27;I was waiting for the day when I will fight in Syria. Thank God he chose me to be one of the Imam&#x27;s soldiers.&#x27;&quot;

Some dissident Shiʿa in Iraq, oppose not only Sunni, US and Iraqi government forces, but the Shiʿi religious hierarchy as well. In Najaf, in late January 2007, at least 200 were killed in the Battle of Najaf,
 when several hundred members of an armed Iraqi Shi&#x27;a messianic sect known as the Soldiers of Heaven or &quot;Jund As-Samāʾ&quot;(), allegedly attempted to start a &quot;messianic insurrection&quot; during the holy day of Ashura in the holy city of Najaf; planning to disguise themselves as pilgrims and kill leading Shi&#x27;a clerics. The group allegedly believed that spreading chaos would hasten the return of the 12th Imam/Mahdi, or alternately, that their leader, Dia Abdul Zahra Kadim, was the awaited Mahdi. The next year during Ashura a reported 18 officers and 53 militia members were killed in clashes between &quot;millenarian rebels&quot; and police, the violence blamed on followers of one Ahmad al-Hassan, a man claiming the Hidden Iman had designated him as his (the Hidden Imam&#x27;s) representative (&quot;wassi&quot;), and who accused Ayatollahs/Shia clerics of being guilty of &quot;aberration and treason, of occupation and tyranny&quot;.

===Islamic State claims of prophecy fulfilment===
Jihadis of the Islamic State see the fulfillment of many of the &quot;lesser signs&quot; of the coming of Judgement Day in current events. 
Its generally agreed that Israel Arab wars have been wars between Muslims and Jews (which were prophesied), and that moral standards have declined leading to rampant fornication, alcohol consumption, and music listening. &quot;A slave giving birth to her master&quot; can happen when the child of a slave woman and the slave&#x27;s owner inherits the slave after the owner&#x27;s death—slavery being practiced in the Islamic State (until its defeat). An embargo of Iraq is alleged to be foretold in the hadith &quot;Iraq would withhold its dirhams and qafiz&quot;. That Muslim states are being led by those who do not deserve to lead them, is an article of faith among jihadis and many other Muslims. ISIS alleges that worship of the pre-Islamic deity &quot;al-Lat&quot; is being practiced by its Shia enemy Hezbollah. The naked shepherds who will build tall buildings is interpreted to refer to Gulf State builders of skyscrapers are &quot;only a generation or two out of desert poverty&quot;.

But the Islamic State is also attempting to fulfill prophecies itself to hasten end times.
Zarqawi published &quot;communiqués detailing the fulfillment of specific predictions&quot; found in a famous book on jihad and end times called, &quot;A Call to a Global Islamic Resistance&quot; by Abu Musab al Suri. His successor, Al-Baghdadi, took &quot;the fulfillment of apocalyptic portents even more seriously&quot;. 
According to Hassan Abbas, at least part of ISIS&#x27;s motivation in killing and otherwise provoking Shia is to &quot;deliberately ... instigate a war between Sunnis and Shi&#x27;a, in the belief that a sectarian war would be a sign that the final times has arrived&quot;; and also explains the ISIS Siege of Kobanî: &quot;In the eschatological literature, there is reference to crisis in Syria and massacre of Kurds—this is why Kobane is important.&quot;(The town of 45,000 was under siege by ISIS from September 2014 to January 2015.)

Thus, &quot;ISIS&#x27;s obsession with the end of the world&quot; helps explain its lack of interest in the &quot;ordinary moral rules&quot; of the temporal world, according to Jessica Stern.
If you are &quot;participating in a cosmic war between good and evil&quot;, (and if everyone will be dead and then resurrected relatively soon anyway), pedestrian concerns about saving the lives of the innocent are of little concern.

=== Questions and criticism ===
Among the problems critics see with some of the concepts of, and attention given to, the eschatology of Islam, are its effect on the socio-economic health of the Muslim world, the basis of the scripture (particularly the hadith) dealing with end times, and the rational implausibility of some of the theological concepts such as resurrection of the dead.

Mustafa Akyol criticizes the current focus of the Muslim community on apocalypticism and the use of the forces of the Dajjal to explain stagnation in the Muslim world in the past two centuries vis-à-vis the West (and now East Asia). He argues that if supernatural evil is believed to be the cause of the problems of Muslims, then practical solutions such as &quot;science, economic development and liberal democracy&quot; will be ignored in favor of divine intervention. (On the other hand, a sahih hadith reports Muhammad saying that &quot;If the Final Hour comes while you have a shoot of a plant in your hands and it is possible to plant it before the Hour comes, you should plant it.&quot;)

Western scholars (William McCants, Jane Smith, Yvonne Haddad, Jean-Pierre Filiu) agree that the apocalyptic narratives are strongly connected to the early jihad wars against the Byzantine Empire and civil wars against other Muslims. McCants, writes that the &quot;fitan&quot; (&quot;tribulations&quot;) of the minor and lesser signs come from the &quot;fitan&quot; of the early Islamic civil wars (First Fitna (656–661 CE), Second Fitna (c. 680/683–c. 685/692 CE), Third Fitna (744–750/752 CE)), where Muhammad&#x27;s companions (Sahabah) and successor generations (Tabi&#x27;un and Taba Tabi&#x27;in) fought each other for political supremacy. &quot;Before and after each tribulation, partisans on both sides circulated prophecies in the name of the Prophet to support their champion. With time, the context was forgotten but the prophecies remained.&quot; Smith and Haddad also write that &quot;the political implications of the whole millennial idea in Islam, especially as related to the understanding of the &quot;mahdi&quot; and the rise of the &#x27;Abbasids in the second Islamic century, are very difficult to separate from the eschatological ones.&quot; They also argue that it&#x27;s &quot;difficult to determine whether&quot; Muḥammad &quot;actually anticipated the arrival&quot; the &quot;Mahdi&quot; as &quot;an eschatological figure&quot; – despite the fact that &quot;most of the traditions about the &quot;Mahdi&quot; are credited to Muḥammad.&quot; Filiu has also stated that &quot;the apocalyptic narrative was decisively influenced by the conflicts that filled Islam&#x27;s early years, campaigns and jihad against the Byzantine Empire and recurrent civil wars among Muslims.&quot; Consequently, the reliability of hadith on end times has been questioned.

Skepticism of the concept of the resurrection of the dead has been part of both &quot;the compatriots&quot; of Muhammad and the &quot;rational and scientifically-infused&quot; inhabitants of the contemporary world.
The fact of the resurrection of the body has been of continuing importance to Muslims and has raised very particular questions in certain circles of Islamic thought, such as those reflected in the later disputations between philosophy and theology. It was not really a point of issue for early Islam, however, and bodily resurrection has never been seriously denied by orthodoxy. It is, as many have observed, basic to the message of God as proclaimed by Muhammad and articulated clearly by the Qur&#x27;an, especially in those passages in which the contemporaries of Muhammad are presented as having scoffed or raised doubts. It continues to be, ... a point of conviction for many of the contemporary interpreters of Islam to a world in which a rational and scientifically-infused populace continues to raise the same eyebrows of skepticism as did the compatriots of the Prophet.

Early skeptics being quoted in the Quran as saying: &quot;Are we to be returned to our former state when we have become decayed bones? They say, that would be a detrimental return!&quot; (Q79: 10–12).

<text>Iblis (), alternatively known as Eblīs, is the leader of the devils () in Islam. According to the Quran, Iblis was thrown out of heaven after refusing to prostrate himself before Adam. He is often compared to the Christian Satan, since both figures were cast out of heaven according to their respective religious narratives. In his role as the master of cosmic illusion in Sufi cosmology, he functions similar to the Buddhist concept of Mara. As such, Iblis embodies the cosmic veil supposedly separating the immanent aspect of God&#x27;s love from the transcendent aspect of God&#x27;s wrath. He entangles the unworthy in the material web hiding the underlying all-pervading spiritual reality.

Islamic theology (&quot;kalām&quot;) regards Iblis as an example of attributes and actions which God punishes with hell (&quot;Nār&quot;). Regarding the origin and nature of Iblis, there are two different viewpoints. According to one, Iblis is an angel, and according to the other, he is the father of the jinn. Quranic exegesis (&quot;tafsīr&quot;) and the Stories of the Prophets (&quot;Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ&quot;) elaborate on Iblis&#x27; origin story in greater detail. In Islamic tradition, Iblis is identified with (&quot;the Devil&quot;), often followed by the epithet (). is usually applied to Iblis in order to denote his role as the tempter, while is his proper name.

Some Muslim scholars uphold a more ambivalent role for Iblis, considering him not simply a devil but also &quot;the truest monotheist&quot; (&quot;Tawḥīd-i Iblīs&quot;), because he would only bow before the Creator and not his creations, while preserving the term exclusively for evil forces. The idea that Iblis is not evil but a necessity for the world is also used in Muslim literature. Others have strongly rejected sympathies with Iblis, considering it a form of Iblis&#x27; deception to lead people astray.

== Naming, etymology, and origin ==
In Islamic traditions, &quot;Iblīs&quot; is known by many alternative names or titles, such as &quot;Abū Murrah&quot; (Arabic: أَبُو مُرَّة, &quot;Father of Bitterness&quot;) as the name stems from the word &quot;murr&quot; – meaning &quot;bitter&quot;, ‘&quot;aduww Allāh&quot; or ‘&quot;aduwallah&quot; (Arabic: عُدُوّ الله, &quot;enemy or foe&quot; of God) and &quot;Abū Al-Harith&quot; (Arabic: أَبُو الْحَارِث, &quot;the father of the plowmen&quot;).

The designation &quot;Iblīs&quot; () may be an epithet referencing an attribute, deriving from the Arabic verbal root (with the broad meaning of &quot;remain in grief&quot;). According to Ibn Manzur this is the major opinion among Arab scholars, who maintain the tradition that the personal name of this being was &quot;ʿAzāzīl&quot;.

Some Muslim teachers, such as al-Jili, relate this name to &quot;talbis&quot; meaning confusion, because God&#x27;s command confused him. 

Another possibility is that the name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;()&quot; (which is also the source of the English word &#x27;devil&#x27;) via a Syriac intermediary. The name itself is not found in Arab literature before the Quran, suggesting it is not of pre-Islamic Arabian origin.

The Quranic story of Iblis parallels extrabiblical sources, such as &quot;Life of Adam and Eve&quot;, about Satan&#x27;s fall from heaven, preponderant in Eastern Christian circles. On a conceptual perspective, Iblis&#x27; theological function as a divinely appointed tempter parallels the evil angel Mastema from the Book of Jubilees.

== Theology (&quot;Kalam&quot;) ==
=== Quran ===
Iblis is mentioned 11 times in the Quran by name, nine times related to his refusal against God&#x27;s Command to prostrate himself before Adam. The term &quot;šayṭān&quot; is more prevalent, although Iblis is sometimes referred to as &quot;šayṭān&quot;; the terms are not interchangeable. The different fragments of Iblis&#x27;s story are scattered across the Quran. In the aggregate, the story can be summarised as follows: 

When God created Adam, He ordered the angels to bow before the new creation. All of the angels bowed down, but Iblis refused to do so. He argued that since he was created from fire, he is superior to humans, who were made from clay-mud, and that he should not prostrate himself before Adam. As punishment for his haughtiness, God banished Iblis from heaven and condemned him to hell. Later, Iblis requested the ability to attempt to mislead Adam and his descendants, whereupon God grants the request, thus depicting God as the power behind both the angels and devils.

Surah al-Kahf states in reference to Iblis:

[...] except Iblis, he was one of the &quot;jinni&quot; [...] (Arabic: إِلَّاۤ إِبۡلِیسَ كَانَ مِنَ ٱلۡجِنِّ &quot;illā iblīsa kāna mina l-jinni&quot;) (18:50)

This led to a dispute among the &quot;mufassirūn&quot; (exegetes), who disagree on whether the term is meant to be a &quot;nisba&quot; to designate Iblis&#x27;s heavenly origin (i.e. an angel) in contrast to the earthly Adam (and the jinn preceding him), or if the term is meant to set Iblis apart from the angels and that he is the progenitor of the jinn dwelling in paradise until his fall (comparable to how Adam fell when he sinned in the Garden). This dispute goes back to the formative stage of Islam. These two conflicting opinions are based on the interpretations of ibn Abbas and Hasan al-Basri respectively. Muslim scholars then followed one of these two interpretations.

Iblis is arguably implicitly mentioned in Surah 21:29 (&quot;al-’anbiyā)&quot;, claiming divinity for himself by inviting to follow egoistic desires (&quot;nafs&quot;), a position shared by Tabari, Suyuti, al-Nasafi, and al-Māturīdī among others:

Whoever of them were to say, &quot;I am a god besides Him&quot;, they would be rewarded with Hell by Us [...]

&quot;Sijjin&quot;, mentioned in Surah 83:7, is described as a prison in hell by Quranic exegetes (for example by, Tabari, Tha&#x27;labi, Nasafi). Iblis is chained at the bottom and sends his demons to the surface.

=== Affiliation and predestination===

There are different opinions regarding the origin of Iblis. This dispute is closely related to doctrinal differences regarding free will. Like humans, jinn are created on earth to &quot;worship&quot; (&quot;&#x27;abada&quot;) God (51:56), and are capable of righteous and evil acts (11:119).

If angels can sin or not is disputed in Islam. Those who say that Iblis was not an angel, but a jinni, argue that only jinn (and humans), but not angels are capable of disobedience. This is the generally opinion among the Qadariyah and most Mu&#x27;tazilites. This view is also found to be prominent among many Salafis. The Sunni school holds on to the doctrine of predestination, al-Razi being an exception, and asserts that Iblis acts in obedience to his inner nature and God&#x27;s plan, but in disobedience to God&#x27;s command.

The term for celestial beings in early Islam is usually &quot;malāk&quot; (angel). Tabarsi says that if Iblis were a jinni, he could not have been one of the custodians of paradise.
Many of those who say that Iblis was an angel read Surah 18:50 as a &quot;nisba&quot; for the term &quot;jannāt&quot;, thus referring to Iblis&#x27; heavenly origin (this reading is preferred by – among others – Ash&#x27;ari, Suyuti, and Al-Tha&#x27;labi).
The Hanābila and Ash&#x27;arites argue that Iblis was ignorant (&quot;jahl&quot;) and did not understand God&#x27;s will (&quot;irāda&quot;). However, Iblis&#x27; unbelief (&quot;kufr&quot;) would be ultimately caused by God. Al-Maghrībī states that, when the angels questioned the creation of Adam, God opened the angels&#x27; eyes for the characteristics of Adam, but closed the eyes of Iblis, so he would remain in resistance (&quot;iḥtijāj&quot;). Therefore, Iblis would have been created as a disobedient angel and function as God&#x27;s tempter. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, the eponymous founder of Māturīdī theology, argues that humans and jinn are tested on earth, but angels in heaven. If angels were not tested, the Quran would not compliment angels for obedience.

The Mu&#x27;tazilites, absolving God from all negative associations, reject the notion that Iblis&#x27; function as a tempter was initiated by God. Al-Zamakhshari blames the &quot;Ahl al-Sunnah&quot; for ascribing negative attributes to God. According to the Mu&#x27;tazilites, when Iblis blames God for leading him astray in Surah 15:39, these words belong to Iblis alone and cannot serve as a confirmation of God being the cause of Iblis&#x27; fall.

Islamist writer Sayyid Qutb denies that angels could sin and thus, rejects readings which depict Iblis as an angelic being.

=== Function ===

Within Muslim thought, Iblis is generally not considered to be the originator of evil. However, there are a few exceptions among Muslim scholars. The &quot;Qadariyya&quot; asserted that evil was introduced by disobedience to God, and Iblis was the first who disobeyed. This view is sometimes attributed to Hasan al-Basri. An extreme position among the &quot;Qadariyya&quot; asserts that Iblis was not even created by God, but this view is generally rejected as beliefs of the Manichaeans (&quot;majūs&quot;). Al-Māturīdī argued that such dualistic worldviews are irreconcilable with the Islamic doctrine of &quot;tawḥīd&quot;. Some extreme positions went as far as to consider belief that actions are uncaused by God to be a form of &quot;širk&quot; (association), as it implies a second power independent from God.

Iblis&#x27; disobedience is seen as an example and warning for the &quot;thaqalān&quot; (the two who are accountable for their deeds; i.e. humans and jinn). Those who say that Iblis was predestined to fall, say that he was created in such a way that God can demonstrate his entire spectrum of attributes (for example; &quot;jalal&quot; (majesty)) in his eternal speech (i.e. the Quran), and teaching the consequences of sin. Three things to avoid are marked by the fall of Iblis: Transgression (&quot;ma&#x27;siyah&quot;), arrogance (&quot;istikbār&quot;), and comparison (&quot;qiyās&quot;) to another creature of God.

Although not the cause of evil, Iblis is known as the progenitor of tempters, known as the &quot;father of the devils&quot; (&quot;Abū ash-Shayāṭīn&quot;). &quot;Ḥādīth&quot; literature emphasizes their evil influences over humans rather than treating them as proper personalities. Muslims are advised to &quot;seek refuge&quot; from such influences and are recommended to recite &quot;duʿāʾ&quot; (prayers) for protection.

== Sufism ==
Sufi formulations of mystical union derive from careful and sustained dedication to the conflicts arising from the intricacies of the conflicts addressed in the school of &quot;kalam&quot;. In sum, there are two distinct interpretations of the role of Iblis within the Sufi tradition.

The first interpretation holds that Iblis refused to bow before Adam because he would not prostrate himself before anyone but his creator, considering Iblis to be a &quot;true monotheist&quot; only bested by Muhammed, an idea known as &quot;Satan&#x27;s monotheism&quot; (&quot;tawḥīd-i Iblīs&quot;). Oblivious to rewards and punishment, Iblis acts out of pure love and loyalty and disobeys the explicit command and obeys the hidden will of God. In a &quot;unio oppositorum&quot;, Iblis finds in his banishment proximity to God. 

The second interpretation disapproves of Iblis&#x27; refusal to prostrate himself before Adam. Adam, as a reflection of God&#x27;s names, is more complete than the angels. Iblis, being blind to the hidden reality of Adam, refuses to bow due to his own spiritual ignorance.

=== &quot;Satan&#x27;s Monotheism&quot; (&quot;Tawḥīd-i Iblīs&quot;) ===
&quot;Satan&#x27;s Monotheism&quot; is illustrated in a story attributed to Wahb ibn Munabbih. Accordingly, Moses met Iblis on the slopes of Sinai. When Moses asks Iblis for the reason behind his disobedience, Iblis replies that the command was a test. This story is mentioned in the &quot;Kitāb al-Tawāsīn&quot; by the Persian poet al-Hallaj, who also became known as one of Iblis&#x27; greatest defenders. The idea also inspired later famous theologians and Sufis, including Ahmad Ghazali and Attar of Nishapur.

Ahmad Ghazali depicted Iblis as a paragon of self-sacrifice and devotion, stating: &quot;Whoever doesn&#x27;t learn monotheism from Satan is a heretic (&quot;zindīq&quot;).&quot; His student Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir asserted that Iblis&#x27; disobedience was wanted by God, or God would be powerless and a powerless being cannot be attributed to God.

Despite the positive receptions of the story, other theologians and Sufis disapproved of &quot;Satan&#x27;s Monotheism&quot;. Ibn Ghanim argues that Iblis is referring to God&#x27;s predetermined judgement as an excuse to cover his unbelief. Furthermore, similar to Ruzbihan Baqli, he argues that &quot;Satan&#x27;s Monotheism&quot; is a subtle deception by Iblis, in order to evoke sympathies and doubt about God&#x27;s message.

Jalāl al-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī (1207–1273) argues that God&#x27;s determinism can not be an excuse for one&#x27;s own demise and failure. He invokes the analogy between Adam and Iblis to highlight the difference between a believer and an unbeliever: While both Adam and Iblis were destined to fall, Iblis and his offspring blamed God, while Adam pleaded for forgiveness, nonetheless. He advises humans to do the same. In this context, Rumi declares that love is more important than intelligence and states: &quot;(Cunning) intelligence is from Iblis, and love from Adam.&quot; In his story of Mu&#x27;awiya, in his &quot;Masnavi&quot; (Book 2), Mu&#x27;awiya realizes that he cannot outsmart Iblis&#x27; excuses, thus seeking refuge in God&#x27;s protection. Whereupon, Iblis confesses that he only attempts to trick people. Rumi reminds the reader that the Quran emphasizes that Iblis is the enemy of humanity and thus, there is no reason to have sympathies for him.

=== Cosmic veil ===

Within the context of Sufi cosmology, the &quot;al-Insān al-Kāmil&quot; is a manifestation of God&#x27;s attributes, not in the sense of incarnation but as a mirror reflecting the divine attributes. God ordered the angels to bow down to acknowledge this special status given to Adam. Due to his defective spiritual insights, Iblis cannot comprehend the immanent aspect of God&#x27;s attributes within Adam, and refuses to bow down. By his attempt to avoid idolatry, he becomes the supreme idolater, because he cannot see through idols (the exterior). Since he cannot perceive God&#x27;s immanent aspect (love), he can only understand (and reflect) God&#x27;s transcendent aspects (wrath).

According to ibn Arabi and Jami, those who cannot comprehend the unity of God, and separate God from his Creation, are the disciples of Iblis, caught in the labyrinth of images and unable to discern the underlying, all-pervading divine principle. In his ignorance and damnation, Iblis hovers over the mere surface of visible things, and those he leads astray suffer the same fate. Other Sufi authors, including Sana&#x27;i, &#x27;Ayn al-Quzat, Ruzbihan, Attar, and Rumi, independently conceptualized a similar image of Iblis&#x27; function in the cosmos.

Iblis is part of God&#x27;s universe and does not form an exterior reality independent of God. He is God&#x27;s veil, the visible universe itself, which hides the Godhead from the unworthy. &#x27;Ayn al-Quzat links the cosmic structure to the &quot;Shahada&quot;: &quot;&quot;Lā&quot; is the circle of negation. One must place his first step within this circle, but he should not stop here nor dwell here. (...)&quot;. Those who remain at the circle of &quot;lā&quot;, they worship the &quot;nafs&quot; (carnal desires) instead of God. Only those who proceed to &quot;ʾillā &#x27;llāh&quot; surpass Iblis, the divine chamberlain. As such, Iblis unknowingly symbolizes, suffers, and reflects the dark and wrathful aspect of God, uttering God&#x27;s anger and executes God&#x27;s justice.

Due to the similarities in function between Iblis&#x27;s web and the Hindu concept of &quot;māyā&quot;, the seventeenth-century Mughal prince Dara Shikoh sought to reconcile the Upanishads with Sufi cosmology.

== Narrative exegesis (&quot;Qiṣaṣ&quot;) ==

&quot;Qiṣaṣ&quot; is a form of exegesis by Muslim scholars focusing on establishing a coherent story from material of Islamic scripture (Quran, &quot;ḥadīṯ&quot;). According to many of them, before Adam was created, the jinn, offspring of &quot;al-Jānn&quot; (الجان), lived on earth. First they were obedient but over time, immorality increased and, when they became infidels, God sent an army of angels, headed by Iblis, called &quot;al-Jinn&quot; (named after paradise, not the genus) to defeat them. These angels were created from &quot;nār as-samūm&quot;, while the rest of the angels from light, and the genus of jinn from &quot;mārijin min nār&quot; (smokeless fire). 

In reference to the interpretation of the events in Surah 2:30-34, when the angels complain over mankinds&#x27; potential to shed blood and cause injustice, Islamic hagiographic narratives relate this to the previous story. Tabari and al-Thaʿlabi explain that the angels feared that humanity will become as corrupt as the jinn.

Some later traditions place Iblis among the genus of the jinn instead. In one narration of the &quot;Tarikh Khamis&quot;, among the masses of infidel jinn only Iblis dedicated his life to worship of God, withdrawing to a high mountain. The angels soon notice him and elevate him to the heavens, where he becomes one like them in worship.

With reference to Surah 76:1, Islamic narrative tradition considers Adam to be created step by step, beginning as an inanimate body. The story is mentioned by various scholars of the Sunni tradition, including Muqatil, Tabari, Mas&#x27;udi, Kisa&#x27;i, and Tha&#x27;labi. The angels passing by him were scared. Most afraid was Iblis. To overcome his anxiety, he enters Adam and moves through the body. He concludes that &quot;this is hollow clay&quot;, whereas Iblis is &quot;fire&quot;. Since fire overcomes clay, he vows to destroy Adam like fire destroys clay:

You are nothing – because of his ringing – and you were made for nothing! If I am to rule over you, I will kill you, and if you are to rule over me, I will rebel against you.

Some scholars (among them Thala&#x27;bi, Tabarsi, Diyarbakri) explain, with slightly variations, Iblis&#x27; entry to the Garden of Eden by the aid of a serpent and a peacock. Some traditions have the Garden of Eden being warded by an angelic guardian. Thus, Iblis persuades a peacock to get help, by promising him that, if he enters the Garden, the beauty of the peacock will never decay thanks to the fruit of immortality. The peacock, unable to carry Iblis, persuades the serpent, who decides to slip Iblis by carrying him in his mouth. From the mouth of the serpent, Iblis speaks to Adam and Ḥawwāʾ.

== In culture ==
=== In arts ===


Iblis is perhaps one of the most well-known individual supernatural entities in Islamic tradition and was depicted in multiple visual representations like the Quran and Manuscripts of Bal‘ami&#x27;s &quot;‘Tarjamah-i Tarikh-i Tabari&quot;. Iblis was a unique individual, described as both a pious jinni and an angel before he fell from God&#x27;s grace when he refused to bow before the prophet Adam. After this incident, Iblis turned into a &quot;shaytan&quot;. In visual appearance, Iblis&#x27; depiction was described in &quot;On the Monstrous in the Islamic Visual Tradition&quot; by Francesca Leoni as a being with a human-like body with flaming eyes, a tail, claws, and large horns on a grossly disproportionate large head.

Illustrations of Iblis in Islamic paintings often depict him black-faced, a feature which would later symbolize any satanic figure or heretic, and with a black body, to symbolize his corrupted nature. Another common depiction of Iblis shows him in human form wearing a special head covering, clearly different from the traditional Islamic turban and long sleeves, signifying long lasting devotion to God. Only in one, he wears traditional Islamic head covering.

Most pictures show and describe Iblis at the moment, when the angels prostrate themselves before Adam. In the manuscripts of Bal‘ami&#x27;s ‘&quot;Tarjamah-i Tarikh-i Tabari&quot; he is usually seen beyond the outcrop, his face transformed with his wings burned, to the envious countenance of a devil. In his demonic form, Iblis is portrayed similar to his cohorts (&quot;shayāṭīn&quot;) in Turko-Persian art as Asian demons (&quot;Dīv&quot;). They are bangled creatures with flaming eyes, only covered by a short skirt. Similar to European arts depicting devils by traits of pagan deities, Islamic arts portray the devils with features often similar to that of Hindu deities.

=== In literature and film ===

The complexity of Iblis&#x27; character from the Quranic story had lasting influence on Islamic literature. It elaborates on the necessity of evil and Iblis&#x27; disobedience in creative retelling of the exegetical tradition.

Iblis and the angels feature in Hafez&#x27;s poetry (1325–1390), collected in &quot;The Divān of Hafez&quot;. Hafez iterates that angels are incapable of love. They can merely praise the creator but without the passion of a human-being. When Iblis protests, either because he considers Adam&#x27;s offspring unworthy or himself devoted to God alone, he is described as an imposter (&quot;mudda&#x27;ī&quot;). He claims to act for the sake of God&#x27;s love, but is actually envious of mankind&#x27;s exalted position. Hafez advises his audience not to reveal the secrets of love towards God to the imposter.

Muhammad Iqbal&#x27;s Javid Nama deal in length with the question of Good and Evil. As such, it is little surprising that Iblis plays a significant role in his works. Similar to Goethe’s Mephistopheles, Iblis is a necessary obstacle for man to overcome. Only when man eventually resists and overcomes Iblis, he can finally prostrate himself and find salvation.

Egyptian novelist Tawfiq al-Hakim&#x27;s &quot;ash-Shahid&quot; (1953) describes the necessity of Iblis&#x27; evil for the world. One day, Iblis regrets his rebellion and consults religious authorities (the Pope, a Rabbi, and the head of the al-Azhar) in order to seek forgiveness. After Iblis&#x27; requests were rejected by all of them, he turns to the angel Gabriel, but is rejected again. Then Iblis realizes the necessity of his nature in order for good to exist and exclaims: &quot;I am a martyr!&quot;.

A demon called &quot;Semum&quot;, from the eponymous 2008 Turkish Horror Movie &quot;Semum&quot;, embodies qualities attributed to both Iblis and his offspring. Alluding to the Quran, Semum blames God for abandoning demon-kind after creating humanity and vows to destroy God&#x27;s newest creatures. Referring to the Quranic cycle of God creating and then destroying his creatures, the &quot;Semum&quot; argues that humanity will be eventually abandoned by God, and should worship Iblis instead.

Iblis himself does not appear, but his presence is implied throughout the movie. Described by his devilish followers, he is the master of the &quot;World of Fire&quot;. On the other hand, the exorcist (representing God) describes Iblis imprisoned in the lowest pit of hell. The movie implies Sufistic metaphysics by asserting that &quot;God is everywhere&quot;. The demon denies God&#x27;s omnipresence by asserting that hell belongs to Iblis. His dualistic beliefs are disproven when God intervenes on behalf of the exorcist in hell. Iblis creates merely the illusion of God&#x27;s absence.

The fifth season of the American TV show &quot;Supernatural&quot; features &quot;Lucifer&quot; as the main antagonist. Despite its Christian roots, the antagonist of the season bears resemblance to the Quranic Iblis. Lucifer reveals his backstory in the fourth episode, declaring:
&quot;You know why God cast me down? Because I loved Him, more than anything, and then God created you, the little hairless apes; and then He asked all of us to bow down before you, to love you more than Him. And I said: ‘Father, I can’t.’

<text>Intelsat S.A. (formerly Intel-Sat, Intelsat) is a multinational satellite services provider with corporate headquarters in Luxembourg and administrative headquarters in Tysons, Virginia, United States. Originally formed as International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (&quot;ITSO&quot;, or Intelsat), from 1964 to 2001, it was an intergovernmental consortium owning and managing a constellation of communications satellites providing international telecommunications and broadcast services.

In March 2023, rival satellite operator SES confirmed that it was in talks about a merger with Intelsat but in June 2023, it was announced that these discussions had ended. On 30 April 2024, SES announced that an agreement had been reached to acquire Intelsat for USD$3.1 billion, with the transaction expected to close in the second half of 2025.

As of June 2022, Intelsat operated a fleet of 52 communications satellites which was then one of the world&#x27;s largest fleets. In 2020, the company announced plans to procure, build and launch seven C-band satellites over the next several years. These C-band satellites will contribute to the acceleration of America&#x27;s 5G buildout. In early 2022, the company announced contracts for four GEO software defined satellites (SDS), two in partnership with Airbus and two in partnership with Thales Alenia Space, that are scheduled to launch in 2023. These contracts point to the pursuit of a multi-year network transformation plan with investments designed to deliver higher speeds, more flexibility, redundancy, and backwards compatibility.  

As of 2022, the company served approximately 1,800 customers and employed a staff of approximately 1,790 people.

== History ==
John F. Kennedy instigated the creation of Intelsat with his speech to the United Nations on 25 September 1961. Less than a year later, John F. Kennedy signed the Communications Satellite Act of 1962. Intelsat was originally formed as International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO) and operated from 1964 to 2001 as an intergovernmental consortium owning and managing a constellation of communications satellites providing international broadcast services. In 2001, the international satellite market was fully commercialized, and Intelsat was privatized after 2001 as Intelsat was formed up as a private Luxembourg corporation.

=== International Governmental Organization (1964–2001) ===
The International Governmental Organization (IGO) began on (), with 7 participating countries. The 1964 agreement was an interim arrangement on a path to a more permanent agreement. The permanent international organization was established in 1973, following inter-nation negotiations from 1969 to 1971. The most difficult issue to &quot;resolve concerned the shift from management of the system by a national entity to management by the international organization itself&quot;.

On 6 April 1965, Intelsat&#x27;s first satellite, the Intelsat I (nicknamed &quot;Early Bird&quot;), was placed in geostationary orbit above the Atlantic Ocean by a Delta D rocket.

In 1973, the name was changed and there were 81 signatories. Intelsat was &quot;governed initially by two international agreements: The Agreement setting forth the basic provisions and principles and structure of the organization, signed by the governments through their foreign ministries, and an Operating Agreement setting forth more detailed financial and technical provisions and signed by the governments or their designated telecommunications entities&quot;, — in most cases, the latter are the ministries of communications of the party countries, but in the case of the United States, was the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), a private corporation established by federal legislation to represent the U.S. in international governance for the global communication satellite system. Intelsat at that time directly owned and managed a global communications satellite system, and structurally consisted of three parts:

* the Assembly of Parties – meeting every two years and concerned with aspects &quot;primarily of interest to the Parties as sovereign States&quot;—with each country having one vote.
* the Meeting of Signatories – meeting annually and composed of all the signatories to the Operating Agreement—primarily working on financial, technical and program matters, with each countries&#x27; signatory having one vote.
* a Board of Governors, meeting at least four times each year, making decisions on design, development, establishment, operation and maintenance of the in-space assets, appointed by signatories, but weighted to each signatory&#x27;s &quot;investment share&quot; in the space assets.

The 1973 Agreement called for a seven-year transition from national to international management, but continued until 1976 to carve out &quot;technical and operational management of the system [to the U.S. signatory] the Communications Satellite Corporation [which had also] served as the Manager of the global system under the interim arrangements in force from 1964 to 1973&quot;. Later phases of the transition resulted in full international governance by 1980. Financial contribution to the organization, its so-called &quot;investment share&quot;, was strictly proportional to each member&#x27;s use of the system, determined annually; and this corresponded to the weighted vote each would have on the Board of Governors.

 Intelsat provides service to over 600 Earth stations in more than 149 countries, territories and dependencies. By 2001, Intelsat had over 100 members. It was also this year that Intelsat privatized and changed its name to Intelsat.

Since its inception, Intelsat has used several versions (blocks) of its dedicated Intelsat satellites. Intelsat completes each block of spacecraft independently, leading to a variety of satellite manufacturing contractors over the years. Intelsat&#x27;s largest spacecraft supplier by 2012 was Space Systems/Loral, having built 47 spacecraft (Intelsat 20) by that time.

The network in its early years was not as robust as it is now. A failure of the Atlantic satellite in the spring of 1969 threatened to stop the &quot;Apollo 11&quot; mission; a replacement satellite went into a bad orbit and could not be recovered in time; NASA used undersea cable telephone circuits as an alternative to route Apollo&#x27;s communications to NASA during the mission. During the Apollo 11 moonwalk, the Moon was over the Pacific Ocean, and so other antennas were used, as well as Intelsat III, which was in geostationary orbit over the Pacific.

=== Commercialization ===
By the 1990s, building and launching satellites was no longer exclusively a government domain and as country-specific telecommunications systems were privatized, several private satellite operators arose to meet the growing demand. In the U.S., satellite operators such as PanAmSat, Orion Communications, Columbia Communications, Iridium, Globalstar, TRW and others formed under the umbrella of the Alliance for Competitive International Satellite Services (ACISS) to press for an end to the exclusively-intergovernmental organizations operating communication satellites and the monopoly position of COMSAT the U.S. signatory to Intelsat and Inmarsat. In March 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications (ORBIT) Act to privatize COMSAT. In April 1998, to address U.S. government concerns about market power, Intelsat&#x27;s senior management spun off five of its older satellites to a private Dutch entity, New Skies Satellites, which became a direct competitor to Intelsat.

=== Privatization ===
On 18 July 2001, Intelsat became a private company, 37 years after formation. Prior to Intelsat&#x27;s privatization in 2001, ownership and investment in Intelsat (measured in shares) was distributed among Intelsat members according to their use of services. Investment shares determined each member&#x27;s percentage of the total contribution needed to finance capital expenditures. The organization&#x27;s primary source of revenue was satellite usage fees which, after deduction of operating costs, was redistributed to Intelsat members in proportion to their shares as repayment of capital and compensation for use of capital. Satellite services were available to any organization (both Intelsat members and non-members), and all users paid the same rates.

Intelsat Americas-7 (known formerly as Telstar 7 and known as Galaxy 27 since on 1 February 2007) experienced a several-day power failure on 29 November 2004. The satellite returned to service with reduced capacity.

Intelsat was sold for US$3.1 billion in January 2005 to four private equity firms: Madison Dearborn Partners, Apax Partners, Permira and Apollo Global Management. The company acquired PanAmSat on 3 July 2006, and was then the world&#x27;s largest provider of fixed satellite services, operating a fleet of 52 satellites in prime orbital locations.

In June 2007, BC Partners announced they had acquired 76% of Intelsat for about 3.75 billion euros.

=== Intelsat S.A. (Luxembourg) ===
In April 2013, the renamed Intelsat S.A. undertook an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, raising a net US$550 million, of which US$492 million was paid immediately to reduce outstanding company debts of US$15.9 billion. In May 2013, the company announced it would be purchasing four new high-performance Boeing EpicNG 702 MP satellites.

In 2015, Intelsat reincorporated in Delaware and became Intelsat Corporation.

There were negotiations in 2017 that Intelsat could potentially merge with Softbank-backed OneWeb. However, on 1 June 2017, it was announced that the bondholders would not accept the offer and that the potential merger would be terminated as of 2 June 2017.

=== Operations ===
After 2014, Intelsat maintained its corporate administrative headquarters in Tysons, Virginia, where a majority of its employees worked at the time. Intelsat maintains constantly staffed global network operations centers in its Tysons Corner location and in Ellenwood, Georgia. A highly international business, Intelsat sources the majority of its revenue from non-U.S. located customers. In addition to its satellite fleet, Intelsat owns and operates eight teleports around the world.
=== Bankruptcy ===
Intelsat filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. courts on 13 May 2020, just before the new 5G spectrum auctions, with over US$15 billion in total debt.

Public reporting showed that the company had been considering bankruptcy protection as early as February 2020,

as Intelsat formally withdrew from the C-Band Alliance. The C-Band Alliance was an industry consortium of the major satellite operators. The consortium had been formed to lobby U.S. regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding the reassignment and payment for the legacy 5G spectrum of its members.

According to company statements, the company was hoping to restructure so that it could raise requisite capital to launch new satellite technology in 2022/2023, at a cost of some US$1.6 billion. The technology could compress existing licensed C-band spectrum customers into just forty per cent of the spectrum used in 2019. The release of spectrum would enable the company to receive up to US$4.86 billion in &quot;spectrum clearing payments&quot; from the FCC for clearing the spectrum by December 2023, two years ahead of the FCC baseline plan.

=== Emergence from bankruptcy as a private company ===
On 24 February 2022, Intelsat emerged from Chapter 11 as a private company with a strengthened capital structure which reduced debt by more than half, from approximately $16 billion to $7 billion. The company’s plan of reorganization was supported by all creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on 16 December 2021. In connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, Intelsat also obtained $6.7 billion in new financing including a revolving credit facility, term loan, and secured notes.

According to then company CEO, Stephen Spengler, post bankruptcy, the company plans to pursue aggressive network innovation plans, and strategic growth initiatives, including building a software-defined 5G network. The company also announced a new board of directors, led by Lisa Hammitt, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Davidson Technologies.

=== Acquisition of Gogo Commercial Aviation ===
In December 2020, Intelsat completed its acquisition of Gogo’s Commercial Aviation (CA) business. The vertical integration combined Intelsat’s next-generation global telecommunications network with Gogo CA’s customer-facing capabilities offering airlines and passengers an enhanced inflight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) experience.

=== Acquisition by SES ===
On 30 April 2024, satellite operator, SES announced that an agreement had been reached to acquire Intelsat for €2.8 billion (US$3.1 billion) cash, with the transaction expected to complete regulatory clearance in the second half of 2025. With over 100 GEO satellites, 26 MEO satellites, and 13 satellites on order, the combined company&#x27;s multi-orbit capability will improve competitiveness against rival LEO satellite networks, and has an expected 2024 revenue of €3.8 billion.

== In-space refueling demonstration project ==
 Intelsat has agreed to purchase one-half of the propellant payload that an MDA Corporation spacecraft satellite-servicing demonstration project would take to geostationary orbit. Catching up in orbit with four or five Intelsat communication satellites, a load of of fuel delivered to each satellite would add somewhere between two and four years of additional service life. A near-end-of-life Intelsat satellite will be moved to a graveyard orbit above the geostationary belt where the refueling will be done, &quot;without consequence&quot; to the Intelsat business.

 the business model was still evolving. MDA &quot;could ask customers to pay per kilogram of fuel successfully added to [each] satellite, with the per-kilogram price being a function of the additional revenue the operator can expect to generate from the spacecraft&#x27;s extended operational life&quot;.

The plan is that the fuel-depot vehicle would maneuver to several satellites, dock at the target satellite&#x27;s apogee kick motor, remove a small part of the target spacecraft&#x27;s thermal protection blanket, connect to a fuel-pressure line and deliver the propellant. &quot;MDA officials estimate the docking maneuver would take the communications satellite out of service for about 20 minutes&quot;.

On 25 February 2020, a Northrop Grumman robotic servicing spacecraft, Mission Extension Vehicle 1 (MEV 1) docked with the Intelsat 901 satellite. The MEV 1 spacecraft will provide propulsion capabilities to Intelsat 901 to extend its usable life for five years.

== Satellites ==
=== Renaming ===
On 1 February 2007, Intelsat changed the names of 16 of its satellites formerly known under the Intelsat Americas and PanAmSat brands to Galaxy and Intelsat, respectively.

=== Launch vehicles ===
Over time, Intelsat has worked with most of the commercial launch services providers worldwide. Their satellites are often among the most massive of their generation, requiring the most powerful and reliable rockets on the market at a given time. In the 21st century, most Intelsat missions were conducted by Arianespace with the European Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launchers, and by International Launch Services (ILS) with Proton-K and Proton-M rockets manufactured by Khrunichev in Russia. Intelsat also took advantage of the equatorial Sea Launch offering with Zenit-3SL rockets launched from the Ocean Odyssey floating platform in Pacific Ocean, until they suspended operations in 2014. On 30 May 2012, Intelsat signed a contract with SpaceX for one of the first Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, marking the return of Intelsat to American launchers after many flights on Atlas II in the 1990s and a single Atlas V launch in 2009.

<text>Ian Terence Botham, Baron Botham (born 24 November 1955) is an English cricket commentator, member of the House of Lords, a former cricketer who has been chairman of Durham County Cricket Club since 2017 and charity fundraiser. Hailed as one of the greatest all-rounders in the history of the game, Botham represented England in both Test and One-Day International cricket. He was a part of the English squads which finished as runners-up at the 1979 Cricket World Cup and as runners-up at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

He played most of his first-class cricket for Somerset, at other times competing for Worcestershire, Durham and Queensland. He was an aggressive right-handed batsman and, as a right-arm fast-medium bowler, was noted for his swing bowling. He generally fielded close to the wicket, predominantly in the slips. In Test cricket, Botham scored 14 centuries with a highest score of 208, and from 1986 to 1988 held the world record for the most Test wickets until overtaken by fellow all-rounder Sir Richard Hadlee. He took five wickets in an innings 27 times, and 10 wickets in a match four times. In 1980, he became the second player in Test history to complete the &quot;match double&quot; of scoring 100 runs and taking 10 wickets in the same match. On the occasion of England&#x27;s 1000th Test in August 2018, he was named in the country&#x27;s greatest Test XI by the ECB.

Botham has at times been involved in controversies, including a highly publicised court case involving rival all-rounder Imran Khan and an ongoing dispute with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). These incidents, allied to his on-field success, have attracted media attention, especially from the tabloid press. Botham has used his fame to raise money for research into childhood leukaemia. These efforts have realised millions of pounds for Bloodwise, of which he became president. On 8 August 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. In July 2020, it was announced that Botham would be elevated to the House of Lords and that he would sit as a crossbench peer.

Botham has a wide range of sporting interests outside cricket. He was a talented footballer at school and had to choose between cricket and football as a career. He chose cricket but, even so, he played professional football for a few seasons and made eleven appearances in the Football League for Scunthorpe United, becoming the club&#x27;s president in 2017. He is a keen golfer, and his other pastimes include angling and shooting. He has been awarded both a knighthood and a life peerage.

==Early life and development as a cricketer (1955–1973)==
Ian Botham was born in Heswall, Cheshire, to Herbert Leslie (&quot;Les&quot;) Botham and Violet Marie, née Collett. His father had been in the Fleet Air Arm for twenty years spanning the Second World War; his mother was a nurse. The family moved to Yeovil before Botham&#x27;s third birthday after his father got a job as a test engineer at Westland Helicopters. Both his parents played cricket: his father for Westland Sports Club while his mother captained a nursing services team at Sherborne. Botham developed an eagerness for the game before he had started school: he would climb through the fence of the Yeovil Boys&#x27; Grammar School to watch the pupils play cricket. At the age of around four, he came home with a cricket ball and asked his mother &quot;Do you know how to hold a ball when you&#x27;re going to bowl a daisy-cutter?&quot; He subsequently demonstrated the grip and went away to practise bowling it.

Botham attended Milford Junior School in the town, and his &quot;love affair&quot; with sport began there. He played both cricket and football for the school&#x27;s teams at the age of nine, two years earlier than most of his contemporaries. Playing against the older boys forced Botham to learn to hit the ball hard, and improve to their standard. At the same age he went to matches with his father, who played for Westland Sports Club, and if one of the teams was short, he would try to get a match. His father recalled that though he never got to bowl, and rarely got to bat, he received praise for the standard of his fielding. He joined the Boys&#x27; Brigade where more sporting opportunities were available. By the time he was nine, he had begun to &quot;haunt&quot; local recreation grounds with his kit always ready, looking to play for any team that was short of players. By the age of twelve he was playing occasional matches for Yeovil Cricket Club&#x27;s second team.

Botham went on to Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School in Yeovil, where he continued to do well in sport and played for the school&#x27;s cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of Somerset County Cricket Club&#x27;s youth coach Bill Andrews. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset&#x27;s under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer. When informed that he wanted to be a sportsman, Botham&#x27;s careers teacher said to him: &quot;Fine, everyone wants to play sport, but what are you really going to do?&quot;
In 1972, at the age of 16, Botham left school intent on playing cricket for Somerset, who retained his contract but felt he was too young to justify a full professional deal. So, Botham joined the ground staff at Lord&#x27;s. As a ground boy, he had numerous tasks such as &quot;cleaning the pavilion windows, pushing the roller on matchdays, selling scorecards, pressing electronic buttons on the scoreboards and rushing bowling analyses to the dressing-room&quot;. He also received coaching and plenty of time in the practice nets, and was often the first to arrive and the last to leave practice. Despite his time in the nets, Botham was only considered by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) coach Harry Sharp to have the potential to become a &quot;good, average county cricketer.&quot; Botham travelled to play for Somerset under-25s a number of times during the season, but failed to excel in any of the matches. His appearances for the MCC were of a similar vein: he rarely scored more than 50 runs, and was used sparingly as a bowler. In one such match against &quot;Scotland A&quot;, the MCC Young Cricketers used eight bowlers in their second innings, but Botham was not among them.

The following year, still a ground boy at Lord&#x27;s, Botham was asked to return to play for Somerset&#x27;s under-25s more often. Against Glamorgan U-25, he scored 91 runs and took three tail-end wickets, while just under a month later he claimed a further three wickets against Hampshire. He advanced to play for the county&#x27;s second team in the Minor Counties Championship, and although he was still used sparingly as a bowler, he made some good scores with the bat, most significantly against Cornwall, against whom he aggregated 194 runs in four innings. During winter nets prior to the season, Botham had caught the eye of the former England Test cricketer Tom Cartwright, who coached at Millfield School in addition to playing for Somerset. Cartwright was impressed with Botham&#x27;s foot-work and physical co-ordination, and helped him learn the basics of swing bowling, something Botham picked up &quot;astonishingly quickly&quot; according to Cartwright.

==Cricket career (1973–1993)==
===Somerset (1973–1975)===
Botham had done well for the Second XI and he later acknowledged the help and advice he received from Somerset players Peter Robinson, Graham Burgess and Ken Palmer. Botham made his senior debut, aged 17, for Somerset on Sunday, 2 September 1973 when he played in a List A John Player League (JPL) match (38 overs each) against Sussex at the County Ground, Hove. The match was in the same week that his time on the Lord&#x27;s ground staff was completed. Somerset batted first, and Botham, number seven in the batting order, scored two runs before he was dismissed leg before wicket (lbw) by Mike Buss. Somerset totalled 139 for 9. Sussex won comfortably by six wickets, reaching 141 for four with fifteen deliveries remaining. Botham bowled three overs without success, conceding 22 runs. He did impress, however, by taking a diving catch to dismiss his future England colleague Tony Greig off the bowling of his captain Brian Close.

A week later, Botham made a second appearance in the JPL against Surrey at The Oval in the final match of the season. Somerset were well beaten by 68 runs. Botham had his first bowling success when he dismissed Geoff Howarth lbw. He bowled four overs and took one for 14. As in his first match, he scored two batting at number seven, this time being caught and bowled by Intikhab Alam. These were his only two senior appearances in 1973, Somerset finishing 11th in the JPL. In summary, Botham scored four runs, took one wicket for 14 and held one catch.

Aged 18, Botham was a regular in the Somerset team from the beginning of the 1974 season and made his first-class début 8–10 May in a County Championship match against Lancashire at the County Ground, Taunton. Viv Richards, from Antigua and Barbuda, made his County Championship début for Somerset in the same match and Lancashire&#x27;s team included Clive Lloyd, two players who would loom large in Botham&#x27;s future Test career. Brian Close won the toss and decided to bat first. On day one, Somerset were all out for 285 and Lancashire reached 41 for none. Botham batted at number seven and scored 13 before being caught. Day two was rain-affected and Lancashire advanced to 200 for none. Their innings closed on the final day at 381 for eight. Botham bowled only three overs and his figures were none for 15; he held one catch to dismiss Jack Simmons. Somerset played for the draw and were 104 for two at the end. Botham did not bat again.

On 12 June 1974, he played against Hampshire at Taunton in a Benson &amp; Hedges Cup (B&amp;H Cup) quarter-final. Hampshire won the toss and decided to bat. They scored 182 all out with Botham taking two for 33 including the prize wicket of Barry Richards, bowled for 13. Botham was number nine in Somerset&#x27;s batting order and came in with his team struggling at 113 for 7. Almost immediately, that became 113 for 8 and he had only the tailenders Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp to support him. He was facing the West Indian fast bowler Andy Roberts who delivered a bouncer which hit him in the mouth. Despite heavy bleeding and the eventual loss of four teeth, Botham refused to leave the field and carried on batting. He hit two sixes and made 45*, enabling Somerset to win by one wicket. He won the Gold Award. Later, he said he should have left the field but was full of praise for Moseley and Clapp.

In a County Championship match on 13 July 1974, Botham scored his first half-century in first-class cricket. He made 59 in Somerset&#x27;s first innings against Middlesex at Taunton, the highest individual score in a low-scoring match which Somerset won by 73 runs. Middlesex&#x27;s captain was Mike Brearley, who would become a very influential figure in Botham&#x27;s career. A month later, in a match against Leicestershire at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare, Botham achieved his first-ever five wickets in an innings (5wI) with five for 59. He took seven in the match which Somerset won by 179 runs, largely thanks to Close who scored 59 and 114*.

Botham showed great promise in 1974, his first full season in which Somerset finished fifth in the County Championship and a close second to Leicestershire in the JPL. They also reached the semi-finals in both the Gillette Cup and the B&amp;H Cup. In 18 first-class appearances, Botham scored 441 runs with a highest of 59, took 30 first-class wickets with a best of five for 59 and held 15 catches. He played in 18 List A matches too, scoring 222 runs with a highest of 45* (his Gold Award innings against Hampshire), took 12 wickets with a best of two for 16 and held four catches.

Botham continued to make progress in 1975. Somerset struggled in the County Championship, winning only four of their twenty matches and finished joint 12th. In the JPL, they slumped badly from second to 14th. They reached the quarter-final of the B&amp;H Cup but only the second round of the Gillette Cup. Botham played in 22 first-class and 23 List A matches so it was a busy season for him. In first-class, he scored 584 runs with a highest of 65, one of two half-centuries, and held 18 catches. He took 62 wickets, doubling his 1974 tally, with a best of five for 69, his only 5wI that season. In List A, he scored 232 runs with a highest of 38* and held seven catches. He took 32 wickets with a best of three for 34.

===Somerset and England (1976)===
1976 was a significant season for Botham as he scored over 1,000 runs for the first time, completed his first century and earned international selection by England in two Limited Overs Internationals. Somerset improved in the County Championship to finish seventh, winning seven matches. They were one of five teams tied for first place in the JPL but their run rate was less than that of Kent, who were declared the champions. Somerset lost their opening match in the Gillette Cup and were eliminated at the group stage of the B&amp;H Cup. Botham, though, came on in leaps and bounds. He totalled 1,022 first-class runs in 20 matches with a highest of 167*, his first-ever century and he also scored six half-centuries. With the ball, he took 66 wickets with a best of six for 16. He had four 5wI and, for the first time, ten wickets in a match (10wM). He played in a total of 22 List A matches, including the two for England, scoring 395 runs with a highest of 46. He took 33 wickets with a best of four for 41.

In the County Championship match against Sussex at Hove in May, Botham came very close to his maiden century but was dismissed for 97, his highest score to date. The match was drawn. At the end of the month, Somerset played Gloucestershire in a remarkable match at Taunton. Batting first, Somerset scored 333 for seven (innings closed) and then, thanks to six for 25 by Botham, bowled out Gloucestershire for only 79. The follow-on was enforced but Gloucestershire proved a much tougher nut to crack second time around. With Zaheer Abbas scoring 141, they made 372 and left Somerset needing 118 to win. Botham took five for 125 in the second innings for a match analysis of 11 for 150, his maiden 10wM. This match ended the same way as the famous Test at Headingley in 1981 but the boot was on the other foot for Botham here because he was on the team that enforced the follow-on – and lost. Mike Procter and Tony Brown did the damage and bowled Somerset out for 110 in 42 overs, Gloucestershire winning by just eight runs.

Botham scored his maiden first-class century at Trent Bridge on Tuesday 3 August 1976 in the County Championship game against Nottinghamshire (Notts) who won the toss and decided to bat first. Derek Randall scored 204* and the Notts innings closed at 364 for 4 (Botham one for 59). Somerset were 52 for one at close of play. On day two, Somerset scored 304 for 8 (innings closed) and Botham, batting at number six, scored 80. At close of play, Notts in their second innings were 107 for four, thus extending their lead to 167 with six wickets standing. On day three, Notts advanced to 240 for nine declared (Botham one for 16), leaving Somerset with a difficult target of 301. At 40 for two and with both their openers gone, Brian Close changed his batting order and summoned Botham to come in at number four. Close himself had gone in at three but he was out soon afterwards for 35. With support from Graham Burgess (78), Botham laid into the Notts bowling and scored an impressive 167 not out. Somerset reached 302 for four in only 65 overs and won by six wickets.

Botham&#x27;s international début for England was on 26 August 1976 in a Limited Overs International (LOI) against the West Indies at the North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough. The series was called the Prudential Trophy and the teams had 55 overs each per innings. Botham, still only 20, was the youngest player. At Scarborough, England captain Alan Knott lost the toss and Clive Lloyd, captaining the West Indies, elected to field first. Botham was number seven in the batting order and came in at 136 for five to join Graham Barlow. He scored only one before he was caught by Roy Fredericks off the bowling of his future &quot;Sky Sports&quot; colleague Michael Holding. England&#x27;s innings closed at 202 for eight with Barlow 80 not out. West Indies lost Fredericks almost immediately but that brought Viv Richards to the crease and he hit 119 not out, winning the man of the match award, and leading West Indies to victory in only 41 overs by six wickets. Botham had the consolation of taking his first international wicket when he had Lawrence Rowe caught by Mike Hendrick for 10. He bowled only three overs and took some punishment from Richards, his return being one for 26.

In the second match at Lord&#x27;s, Botham was replaced by returning England captain Tony Greig. England lost by 36 runs as Richards, this time with 97, was again the difference between the teams. Having lost the series, England recalled Botham for the final match at Edgbaston on 30–31 August. The match was extended to two days and overs reduced to 32 per side. Tony Greig won the toss and decided to field. England began well and dismissed Fredericks and Richards, for a duck, in only the second over. West Indies were then seven for one but a powerful innings by Clive Lloyd pulled them out of trouble and they reached 223 for nine, innings closed. Botham bowled three very expensive overs, conceding 31 runs, but he did manage to bowl out Michael Holding for his second international wicket. England were never in the hunt and were bowled out for 173, West Indies winning by 50 runs and claiming the series 3–0. Botham again batted at number seven and made a good start, scoring 20 at a run a ball, but he was then caught by Bernard Julien off Fredericks and England were 151 for seven with only Knott and the tailenders left.

===District cricket in Australia (1976–77)===
In the winter of 1976–77, after he had made his first two international appearances, Botham played District Cricket in Melbourne, Australia for the University of Melbourne Cricket Club. He was joined by Yorkshire&#x27;s Graham Stevenson. They were signed for the second half of the season on a sponsorship arranged through the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) by Whitbread&#x27;s Brewery. Five of the competition&#x27;s 15 rounds were abandoned because of adverse weather. It was apparently on this trip that Botham originally fell out with the former Australian captain Ian Chappell. The cause seems to have been a cricket-related argument in a bar, which may have resulted in Chappell being pushed off his stool (the story is widely sourced but accounts differ). This became a long-running feud and, as late as the 2010–11 Ashes series, there was an altercation between Botham and Chappell in a car park at the Adelaide Oval.

===Somerset and England (1977)===
Botham produced a number of good batting and bowling performances for Somerset in 1977 and these impressed the Test selectors who included him in the team for the third Test against Australia at Trent Bridge, starting on 28 July. Having captured 36 first-class wickets through May and June, Botham had something of a purple patch in July which earned him his Test call-up. In the match against Sussex at Hove, which Somerset won by an innings and 37 runs, he took four for 111 and six for 50 for his second 10wM. In Somerset&#x27;s innings of 448 for eight, he shared a 4th wicket partnership of 174 with Viv Richards. Botham scored 62, Richards 204. He took 22 more wickets, including two 5wI, in the next three County Championship games before his Test debut. In the whole season, playing 17 first-class matches, he took 88 wickets with six 5wI and one 10wM, his second innings return at Hove being his best. His batting was not quite as good as in 1976 as his average was down but he scored 738 runs with a highest of 114, which was his sole century, and five half-centuries. He scored the century in July against Hampshire at Taunton, 114 in Somerset&#x27;s first innings of 284, and followed it with bowling returns of four for 69 and four for 43, another impressive all-round effort which earned Somerset a win by 152 runs. Somerset had a good season in the County Championship, finishing fourth. They reached the semi-final of the Gillette Cup but, without the injured Botham, were well beaten by eventual winners Middlesex. They were a poor tenth in the JPL and were eliminated from the B&amp;H Cup at the group stage.

Botham made his Test début at Trent Bridge on 28 July 1977 in the third Test against Australia. His début was somewhat overshadowed by the return from self-imposed Test exile of Geoffrey Boycott. England went into the match with a 1–0 series lead having won the second Test after the first had been drawn. The series was played against the background of the so-called &quot;Packer Affair&quot; which resulted in the establishment of World Series Cricket in the next Australian season. Because of Tony Greig&#x27;s involvement, he had been stripped of the England captaincy but remained in the team under new captain Mike Brearley. England had three all-rounders at Trent Bridge with Greig, Geoff Miller and Botham all playing. Australian captain Greg Chappell won the toss and decided to bat first. Australia scored 243 and were all out shortly before the close on day one. Botham, aged 21, made an immediate impact and took five for 74, the highlight being the wicket of Chappell, bowled for just 19. England batted all through day two and into day three as Boycott, in his first Test innings since 1974, and Knott both made centuries. Botham came in at number eight on day three and scored 25 before he was bowled by Max Walker. England were all out not long afterwards for 364, a first innings lead of 121. Botham had no joy in Australia&#x27;s second innings with none for 60. A century by Rick McCosker enabled Australia to score 309 before they were all out in the evening session on day four. Bob Willis took five for 88. England needed 189 to win and completed the job, by seven wickets, well into the final day with Brearley scoring 81 and Boycott, who batted on all five days, 80 not out. Botham didn&#x27;t get a second innings.

Botham&#x27;s impressive bowling at Trent Bridge meant he was an automatic choice for the fourth Test at Headingley two weeks later. England won the toss, decided to bat first and went on to win by an innings and 85 runs to secure a winning 3–0 lead in the series and regain The Ashes, which they had lost in 1974–75. The match is famous for Boycott&#x27;s one hundredth career century, scored on his home county ground and in his second Test since his return to the England fold. Botham was bowled third ball by Ray Bright without scoring. He made amends with the ball by taking five for 21 in only eleven overs, Australia being bowled out for only 103. The follow-on was enforced and Australia this time made 248, but Botham (none for 47) did not take a wicket. He was injured during the second innings when he accidentally trod on the ball and broke a bone in his foot. He was unable to play again in the 1977 season.

His promising start as Test player resulted in two awards. He was named Young Cricketer of the Year for 1977 by the Cricket Writers&#x27; Club; and was selected as one of the &quot;Wisden Cricketers of the Year&quot; (i.e., for 1977 but announced in the 1978 edition). &quot;Wisden&quot; commented that his 1977 season &quot;was marred only by a week&#x27;s cricket idleness carrying the drinks at the Prudential matches, and a foot injury which ruined for him the end of the season and probably robbed him of a rare double. He finished with 88 wickets and 738 runs&quot;. Importantly, the foot injury was a broken toe sustained when he trod on the ball at Headingley and Botham subsequently needed treatment for it at his local hospital in Taunton. It was while going to one of his appointments that he took a wrong turn and ended up on a children&#x27;s ward where he learned that some of the children were dying of leukaemia. This incident sparked his charitable crusade on behalf of leukaemia research.

===Somerset and England (1977–78 to 1979–80)===
England were in Pakistan from November 1977 to January 1978, playing three Tests and three LOIs. Botham was almost fully recovered from his foot injury but did not play in any of the Tests. He took part in all three LOIs and in some of the first-class matches against club teams. From January to March, England were in New Zealand for a three-match Test series under the captaincy of Geoff Boycott. Botham impressed in a first-class match against Canterbury at Lancaster Park, scoring 126 not out in the second innings against an attack including Richard Hadlee and was selected for the first Test at Basin Reserve. Botham had an indifferent game there and England, twice bowled out by Hadlee, lost by 72 runs. In the next match at Carisbrook against Otago, Botham achieved a 10wM with seven for 58 (his career best return to date) in the second innings, enabling the England XI to win by six wickets. 

England won the second Test at Lancaster Park by 174 runs after an outstanding all-round performance by Botham who scored 103 and 30 not out and took five for 73 and three for 38. He also held three catches. In the second innings, promoted up the order to get quick runs before an overnight declaration, he was responsible for calling for a risky run that led to the run-out dismissal of acting-captain Geoff Boycott: Botham&#x27;s own published autobiography alleges that this was deliberately done, on the orders of acting vice-captain Bob Willis, because Boycott was scoring too slowly. The final Test was played at Eden Park and was drawn, the series ending 1–1. New Zealand batted first and totalled 315 with Geoff Howarth scoring 122. Botham took five for 109 in 34 overs. England replied with 429 all out (Clive Radley 158, Botham 53). New Zealand then chose to bat out time and Howarth scored his second century of the match (Botham none for 51). Botham&#x27;s form in New Zealand cemented his place in the England team.

In the 1978 English season, Pakistan and New Zealand both visited to play three Tests each and Botham featured in all six matches. Having scored exactly 100 in the first Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston, England winning by an innings and 57 runs, Botham in the second at Lord&#x27;s scored 108 and then, after none for 17 in the first innings, achieved his Test and first-class career best return of eight for 34 in the second, England winning by an innings and 120 runs. The third Test was ruined by the weather and England won the series 2–0. Against New Zealand, Botham did little with the bat but his bowling was outstanding. In the second Test he took nine wickets in the match as England won by an innings and then a 10wM in the final match at Lord&#x27;s with six for 101 and five for 39. England won the series 3–0.

Due to his England commitments, Botham appeared infrequently for Somerset in 1978. His best performances for them were a return of seven for 61 against Glamorgan and an innings of 80 against Sussex in the Gillette Cup final at Lord&#x27;s. This was Somerset&#x27;s first limited overs final and they lost by five wickets despite Botham&#x27;s effort. They were involved in a tight contest for the JPL title and were placed second on run rate after tying with Hampshire and Leicestershire on 48 points each. Somerset did quite well in the County Championship, finishing fifth after winning nine matches, and reached the semi-final of the B&amp;H Cup.

Botham&#x27;s first tour of Australia was in 1978–79. England, defending the Ashes they had regained in 1977, played six Tests under Mike Brearley&#x27;s leadership. Australia had what was effectively &quot;a reserve team&quot; because their leading players were contracted to World Series Cricket for the season. The difference in standard was evident on the first day of the first Test at the Gabba as Botham, Chris Old and Bob Willis bowled them out for only 116 in just 38 overs, England going on to win easily enough by seven wickets. Apart from a surprise defeat in the third Test, England were never troubled and won the series 5–1. Botham&#x27;s performance in the series was satisfactory but there were no headlines and only modest averages. He took 23 wickets at 24.65 with a best return of four for 42. He scored 291 runs with a highest of 74 at 29.10. He held 11 catches.

Botham played for England in the 1979 Cricket World Cup and was a member of their losing team in the final. He was again an infrequent member of the Somerset team because of the World Cup and the Test series against India. It became a memorable season for Somerset as they built on their form in 1978 to win both the Gillette Cup and the JPL, their first-ever senior trophies. Botham played in the Gillette Cup final at Lord&#x27;s, in which they defeated Northamptonshire by 45 runs, thanks to a century by Viv Richards. They slipped to eighth in the County Championship. In the B&amp;H Cup, however, they were expelled from the competition for bringing the game into disrepute after an unsporting declaration, designed to protect the team&#x27;s run rate, by team captain Brian Rose.

The England v India series in 1979 took place after the World Cup ended and four Tests were played. England won the first at Edgbaston by an innings and 83 runs after opening with a massive total of 633 for five declared. Botham scored 33 and then took two for 86 and five for 70. On the first day of the second Test at Lord&#x27;s, Botham swept through the Indian batting with five for 35 and a catch off Mike Hendrick to dismiss them for only 96 in 56 overs. Surprisingly, however, India recovered to salvage a draw. In the third Test at Headingley, it was Botham the batsman who did the business, scoring 137 from 152 balls in England&#x27;s first innings total of 270 (the next highest innings was 31 by Geoff Boycott). The match was ruined by the weather and was drawn. In the final Test at The Oval, England opened with 305 (Botham 38); India replied with 202 (Botham four for 65); and England with 334 for eight declared (Botham run out for a duck) extended their lead to 437 with four sessions remaining. Thanks to a brilliant 221 by Sunil Gavaskar, India came agonisingly close to pulling off a remarkable last day victory but ran out of time on 429 for eight (Botham three for 97), just nine runs short, and so England won the series 1–0 with three draws.

The shambolic state of international cricket at the end of the 1970s was illustrated by the panic resulting from a hastily convened settlement between World Series Cricket and the Australian Board of Control. Although they had visited Australia only twelve months earlier to play for the Ashes, England were persuaded to go there again and play another three Tests, but with the Ashes not at stake. As &quot;Wisden&quot; put it, the programme did not have the best interests of cricket at heart, particularly Australian cricket below Test level, which had been &quot;swamped by the accent on Test and one-day internationals, neatly parcelled to present a cricketing package suitable for maximum exploitation on television&quot;. 

The matches were widely perceived to be semi-official only and received &quot;a definite thumbs down&quot;. Botham was a member of the England team and played in all three matches which nevertheless count towards his Test statistics. England were largely faithful to the players who had toured Australia the previous winter and Derek Underwood was the only World Series player they recalled; they did not recall Alan Knott, for example, while Tony Greig was beyond the pale. Australia recalled Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh and Jeff Thomson, fielding a team that was a mixture of old and new. In the first match, played at the WACA Ground, Botham had match figures of eleven for 176 but to no avail as Australia won by 138 runs. Having excelled with the ball in that match, Botham did so with his bat in the third one, scoring an unbeaten 119 in the second innings of the third. Australia won all three matches of a series best forgotten for all its attendant politics, but Botham had enhanced his reputation as a world-class all-rounder.

===Jubilee Test, India, February 1980===
Botham&#x27;s third overseas tour was to India in February 1980. It was the fiftieth anniversary of India&#x27;s entry into Test cricket and so England played a single commemorative Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Bombay. It turned into a personal triumph for Botham who became the first player in Test history to score a century and take ten wickets in the same match. England&#x27;s wicketkeeper Bob Taylor held ten catches in the match, eight of them off Botham&#x27;s bowling.

India won the toss and decided to bat first but, with Botham taking six for 58, they were all out on day one for 242. England replied with 296, the highlight being Botham&#x27;s 114 from just 144 balls; he began his innings with England in trouble at 57 for four. This quickly became 58 for five and Botham was joined by England&#x27;s other match hero Taylor. England&#x27;s first five batsmen had contributed just 51 to the total. Botham was often unfairly labelled a &quot;big hitter&quot; but in fact his style was very orthodox (i.e., he &quot;played straight&quot;) and in this innings he scored 17 fours but, significantly, no sixes. Taylor provided dogged support and their sixth wicket partnership realised 171 runs. When Botham was out near the end of day two, the score was 229 for six and England reached 232 for six at close of play, still ten runs behind. On the third morning, Taylor led England past India&#x27;s total and, with useful batting performances by the specialist bowlers, England totalled 296 to gain a first innings lead of 54.

India&#x27;s second innings was a disaster, and they lost eight wickets by the close of play on the third day with only Kapil Dev offering any resistance. They were all out early on the fourth day for 149. Botham was the outstanding performer again, taking seven for 48 which gave him match figures of thirteen for 106. Geoffrey Boycott and Graham Gooch scored the necessary runs for England to win by ten wickets with a day to spare.

===Somerset and England (1980 to 1980–81)===

Mike Brearley announced his retirement from Test cricket after the Jubilee Test in Bombay and, somewhat surprisingly given his lack of captaincy experience, Botham was appointed to replace him as England&#x27;s captain for the forthcoming home series against West Indies, who were at the time the world&#x27;s outstanding team. Botham led England in twelve Tests in 1980 and 1981 but he was unsuccessful, the team achieving no wins, eight draws and four defeats under his leadership. In addition, his form suffered and was eventually dismissed from the post, although he did actually resign just before the selectors were about to fire him. In Botham&#x27;s defence, nine of his matches as captain were against West Indies, who afterwards won twelve of their next thirteen Tests against England. The other three were all against Australia.

In 1980, which was a wet summer, West Indies arguably had the better of all five Test matches, although, with the rain constantly intervening, they were able to win only one of them. West Indies won the first Test by only two wickets, and being at one stage 180/7 chasing a tricky 208. Rain saved England from a probable heavy defeat in the 2nd and 5th Tests: they fared better in between. In the 3rd, England conceded a first-innings lead of 110, but replied strongly in the second innings with a painstakingly slow and defensive 391/7, which would have resulted in a difficult target for the Windies had there been another day to chase it – but the third day had been rained off, and time ran out. In the Fourth Test, England picked up their only first-innings lead of the series – of 105 runs – but collapsed catastrophically in the second, before being saved by a century partnership for the last wicket between Willey (100*) and Willis (24*) to reach a total 201/9, and again the loss of a day and a half to rain left no time for the Windies to chase a potentially tough target above 300. 

Botham had a poor season as a bowler and, in all first-class cricket, took just 40 wickets at the high average of 34.67 with a best return of only four for 38. He did better as a batsman, scoring 1,149 runs (the second time, after 1976, that he topped a thousand in a season) at 42.55: but this did not translate to form in the Tests. He completed two centuries and six other half-centuries for his county. His highest score in the season was ultimately the highest of his career: 228 for Somerset against Gloucestershire at Taunton in May. He batted for just over three hours, hitting 27 fours and ten sixes. With Gloucestershire batting out time for a draw on the final day, Somerset used all eleven players as bowlers. Apart from an innings of 57 in the first Test, Botham contributed little to England in the series and that innings was the only time he reached 50 in all his twelve Tests as England captain. 

Somerset came close to retaining their JPL title in 1980 but had to be content with second place, only two points behind Warwickshire. They finished a credible fifth in the County Championship but were eliminated from both the Gillette and B&amp;H Cups in the opening phase.

Botham led England on the controversial tour of the West Indies from January to April 1981. The second Test, scheduled to be played at Bourda, was cancelled after the Guyanese government revoking the visa of Robin Jackman because of his playing and coaching links with South Africa. The other four Tests were played and West Indies won the series 2–0 but England were helped by rain in the two drawn matches. Botham took the most wickets for England, but &quot;Wisden&quot; said &quot;his bowling never recovered the full rhythm of a year before&quot;. His batting, however, apart from one good LOI performance in the first one-day international &quot;was found wanting in technique, concentration and eventually in confidence&quot;. In &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; view, Botham&#x27;s loss of form &quot;could be cited as eloquent evidence of the undesirability of saddling a fast bowler and vital all-rounder with the extra burden of captaincy&quot;. The closest England came to a victory was in the first ODI, in which England bowled the West Indies out for 127 but, thanks to six wickets from Colin Croft, failed by two runs in the chase which was anchored by Botham&#x27;s 60: this was, at the time, the lowest ODI total batting first to be successfully defended.

===Somerset and England (1981)===
The England captaincy had affected Botham&#x27;s form as a player and in his last Test as captain, against Australia at Lord&#x27;s in 1981, he was dismissed for a pair. According to &quot;Wisden&quot; editor Matthew Engel, writing in &quot;ESPNcricinfo&quot;, Botham &quot;resigned (a minute before being sacked), his form shot to pieces&quot; after that match. Australia were then leading the series 1–0 after two Tests with four more to be played. Botham was replaced by the returning Mike Brearley, who had been his predecessor until retiring from Test cricket in 1980.

Botham continued to play for England under Brearley and achieved the highpoint of his career in the next three Tests as England recovered to win The Ashes. In the third Test at Headingley, Australia opened with 401 for 9 declared, despite good bowling by Botham who took 6 for 95. England responded poorly and were dismissed for 174. Botham was the only batsman to perform at all well and scored 50, which was his first Test half-century since he had been awarded the captaincy thirteen Tests earlier. Having been forced to follow-on, England collapsed again and at 135 for 7 on the afternoon of the fourth day, an innings defeat looked certain. Bookmakers had reportedly been offering odds of 500/1 against an England win after the follow-on was enforced. Botham, himself not long at the wicket, was the sole remaining recognised batsman as he was joined by the fast bowler Graham Dilley, number nine in the batting order, with only Chris Old and Bob Willis to come. With able support from Dilley (56) and Old (29), Botham hit out and by the close of play was 145 not out with Willis hanging on at the other end on 1 not out. England&#x27;s lead was just 124 but there remained a glimmer of hope. On the final day&#x27;s play, Botham reached 149 not out before Willis&#x27;s wicket fell. Australia, with plenty of time remaining, needed 130 to win and were generally expected to get them; but after Botham took the first wicket, Willis took 8 for 43 to dismiss Australia for only 111. England had won by 18 runs; it was only the second time in history that a team following on had won a Test match.

Botham&#x27;s outstanding form continued through the next two Tests. In the fourth at Edgbaston, a low-scoring match left Australia batting last and needing 151 to win. They reached 105 for 5 and were still favourites at that point but, in an inspired spell of bowling, Botham then took five wickets for only one run in 28 balls to give England victory by 29 runs. In the fifth Test at Old Trafford, Botham scored 118 in a partnership of 149 with Chris Tavaré before he was dismissed. He hit six sixes in that innings. England won that match to take a winning 3–1 series lead. The last Test at The Oval was drawn, Botham achieving a 10wM by taking six for 125 and four for 128. He was named Man of the Series after scoring 399 runs, taking 34 wickets and holding 12 catches.

Somerset won the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup for the first time in 1981 and did well in the County Championship too, finishing third. They were again runners-up in the JPL, but a long way behind the winners Essex. In the renamed NatWest Trophy (formerly Gillette Cup), Somerset were knocked out in the second round. Botham played in the B&amp;H final at Lord&#x27;s, in which Somerset defeated Surrey by seven wickets. He took no wickets but provided Viv Richards (132 not out) with good support in the run chase. Botham ended the season with 67 wickets at 25.55, a best return of six for 90 (for Somerset v Sussex) and one 10wM (sixth Test). He scored 925 runs with a highest of 149* (third Test) at 42.04; and held 19 catches.

===Somerset and England (1981–82 to 1983–84)===
During this period, Botham played in 25 Tests. There were home series against both India and Pakistan in 1982; and New Zealand in 1983. His overseas tours were to India and Sri Lanka in 1981–82 (he took part in the inaugural Test played by Sri Lanka); to Australia in 1982–83; and to New Zealand and Pakistan in 1983–84. He played for England in the 1983 Cricket World Cup and was a member of their losing team in the semi-final.

Botham&#x27;s return to India was less than triumphant and &quot;Wisden&quot; took him to task for his &quot;ineffectiveness with the ball&quot;. Having achieved a match analysis of nine for 133 at Bombay, where England were beaten on a poor pitch, Botham took only eight more wickets, at 65 each, in the last five Tests and &quot;Wisden&quot; said this &quot;was a telling blow to England&#x27;s chance of levelling the series&quot;.

1982 was a good all-round season for Botham, especially as Somerset retained the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. In 17 first-class matches, he scored 1,241 runs with a highest of 208 against India (this was ultimately his career highest in Test cricket) at a good average of 44.32. He took 66 wickets at the low average of 22.98 with a best return of five for 46. England won their Test series against Pakistan by 2–1 and the one against India 1–0. Botham scored two centuries against India: 128 at Old Trafford and his career high 208 at The Oval. Somerset finished sixth and ninth in the County Championship and the JPL respectively. They reached the quarter-final of the NatWest Trophy and their season highlight was retaining the B&amp;H Cup they won in 1981. In the final at Lord&#x27;s, Somerset dismissed Nottinghamshire for only 130 (Botham two for 19) and won easily by nine wickets.

Botham toured Australia again in 1982–83 with England seeking to retain the Ashes, but Australia won the series 2–1 despite England winning, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), a Test described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;one of the most exciting Test matches ever played&quot;. Botham had a poor series and tour. He played in nine first-class matches and scored only 434 runs at the low average of 24.11 with a highest of 65. He was no better with the ball, taking just 29 wickets for a too-high 35.62 with a best return of four for 43. He did, however, field well and held 17 catches, nearly two a match. 

Incidentally, it was during the subsequent ODI tournament - the annual Australian Tri-Series, at the time called the &quot;World Series&quot; - that Botham opened the batting for the first time in one-day cricket. Thanks to the fielding restrictions in force in that tournament (and for ODIs in Australia generally since 1980), only two fielders were permitted outside the 30 yard circle during the first ten overs (now called a Powerplay): and it was in the 9th match of the tournament, against Australia, that Botham opened the batting for the first time, with the idea that he was the batsman best equipped to hit the ball over the top. However, the tactic did not go as planned, Botham only scoring 19 and England losing the match. The tactic was more successful, two matches later against New Zealand with Botham scoring 65, but he was expensive with the ball as NZ chased the target successfully for the highest successful run-chase in ODIs at the time. England finished the tournament in third and last place and did not qualify for the finals.
In the 1983 English season, Somerset won the NatWest Trophy for the first time, defeating Kent in the Lord&#x27;s final by 24 runs with Botham as their captain. They were very close to taking the JPL title too but, having tied with Yorkshire on 46 points, they were placed second on run rate. In the County Championship, they won only three matches and finished tenth. They were knocked out of the B&amp;H Cup early. Botham had a good season with the bat, scoring 852 runs in his 14 first-class matches at 40.57 with a highest score of 152 among three centuries. He did less well with the ball: only 22 wickets at the high average of 33.09. New Zealand played a four-match Test series against England after the World Cup and, at the 29th attempt, finally defeated England for the first time in a Test match in England. England won the other three matches convincingly, however, to take the series 3–1. Botham did little with the ball, the same story as in his whole season, but he did score a century (103) in the final Test at Trent Bridge (see photo).

In the winter of 1983–84, England toured New Zealand from January to February and Pakistan in March. Apart from one innings at Basin Reserve in the first Test against New Zealand, Botham was a disappointment on this tour, especially as a bowler. He scored 138 in the first Test, sharing in a sixth wicket partnership of 232 with Derek Randall (164), but the match was drawn. It was a poor tour for England, all told, and described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;ranking among the unhappiest they have ever undertaken&quot;. England lost both series 1–0. Botham left Pakistan after the first Test there, the one England lost, to have a knee problem investigated at home.

===Somerset and England (1984 to 1986–87)===
After ten seasons as a first-team regular, Botham was appointed Somerset club captain in 1984 and 1985. In the County Championship, they finished seventh in 1984 and then dropped to 17th (bottom of the table) in 1985. In the JPL, they were 15th in 1984 and eleventh in 1985. They made little impression in either of the B&amp;H Cup or the NatWest Trophy so, all in all, Botham&#x27;s captaincy period was a lean time for the club who had enjoyed its most successful period ever in the preceding seasons.

Botham played in 18 Tests from 1984 to 1986, ten of them (five home, five away) against West Indies. Throughout Botham&#x27;s Test career, the highest international standards were set by West Indies and Botham was generally unsuccessful against them. In both of these series, 1984 and 1985–86, West Indies beat England 5–0 in whitewashes that were dubbed &quot;blackwash&quot;.

His highest score and both his best and worst bowling performances against West Indies occurred in the same match at Lord&#x27;s in 1984. Clive Lloyd won the toss and, perhaps mistakenly, elected to field. The first day was rain-affected and England, 167 for two overnight, scored 286 thanks to a century by Graeme Fowler; Botham scored a useful 30. West Indies lost three quick wickets, all of them to Botham who was a &quot;reminder of his old self&quot; in the words of &quot;Wisden&quot;, but recovered to reach 119 for three at the close of play on day two. 

In the third morning, Viv Richards was dismissed by Botham under dubious circumstances but Botham was inspired by the capture of his great friend&#x27;s wicket and went on to take eight for 103, dismissing West Indies for 245 and for once giving England a chance of victory against the world&#x27;s best team, with a first innings lead of 41. This was Botham&#x27;s best-ever bowling performance against West Indies by some distance. England began their second innings and had been reduced to 88 for four when Botham joined Allan Lamb. They reached 114 for four at day three close. There was no Sunday play and England resumed on the Monday 155 runs ahead with six wickets standing. Botham and Lamb added 128 for the fifth wicket before Botham was out for 81, including nine fours and one six, easily his highest score and best innings against West Indies. Lamb made a century and England were all out on the Tuesday morning (final day) for exactly 300. West Indies needed 342 to win in five and a half hours. They lost Desmond Haynes to a run out at 57 for 0, whereupon Larry Gomes (92 not out) joined Gordon Greenidge (214 not out) and West Indies went on to win by nine wickets with 11.5 of the last twenty overs to spare. 

Although &quot;Wisden&quot; does not name Botham except as an &quot;inattentive&quot; fielder who dropped a catch, it describes the England bowlers &quot;looking second-rate and nobody but Willis bowling the right line or setting the right field to the powerful and phlegmatic Greenidge&quot;. Botham bowled the most overs, 20, and with nought for 117 he conceded almost a run a ball (Willis had nought for 48 from 15 overs). In mitigation, &quot;Wisden&quot; conceded that Greenidge played &quot;the innings of his life, and his ruthless batting probably made the bowling look worse that it was&quot;.

Botham also played in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka: not bowling particularly well in the first innings although he took the first wicket (1/114 out of 491), and being dismissed for 6 as England batted (370). Toward the end of Sri Lanka&#x27;s second innings as the match meandered to a draw, in absolutely ferocious heat Botham dispensed with his usual fast bowler&#x27;s long run-up and switched to bowling off-spin off a few paces, surprising everybody (himself included) by taking several wickets with it, out of an analysis of 6/90. He decided to take a rest over the winter, and sit out of the 1984–85 tour of India.

In 1985, Botham played in all six Tests against a poor Australian team as England, themselves a second-rate team based on their recent performances, comfortably regained the Ashes and he was the leading wicket-taker, but the series was dominated by England&#x27;s specialist batsmen, especially Mike Gatting and David Gower. Botham, who by this time had adopted a dyed blonde mullet haircut as a trademark, contributed relatively little with the bat, compared with the massive totals amassed by Gower, Gatting, Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson. He scored 250 runs at 31.25 with a highest of 85. He did take the most wickets (31 at 27.58 with a best of five for 109) but he was rarely impressive and he was bowling to a weak batting side, Allan Border apart. England&#x27;s best bowler was Richard Ellison who played only twice and took 17 wickets at only 10.88 with a best of six for 77 and one 10wM.

Botham was suspended for 63 days by the Test and County Cricket Board in 1986 after he admitted in an interview that he had smoked cannabis. Due to the ban, Botham played in only one Test which was the final one of the series against New Zealand. He made his mark on that Test though: beginning it by taking the wicket of Bruce Edgar with his very first delivery, to go level with Dennis Lillee on 355 as holder of the world record for Test wickets. The next delivery was edged through the slip cordon by Jeff Crowe. Botham went past the mark in his second over to hold the record outright, by trapping Crowe leg-before. Then on the fourth day of the match, coming in after centuries from Gatting and Gower, he bashed a quickfire half-century in just 32 balls, including 24 off one over from Derek Stirling – equalling the record at the time, for most runs off an over in Tests... a record which he was responsible for, but from the other side, having conceded 24 runs to Andy Roberts back in the 1980/81 tour of the West Indies. England declared with a massive first-innings lead, but rain came after lunch on the fourth day and only one further over was bowled.

Botham was succeeded by Peter Roebuck as Somerset captain for 1986 but, during the season, tensions arose in the Somerset dressing room which eventually exploded into a full-scale row and resulted in the sacking by the club of Botham&#x27;s friends Viv Richards and Joel Garner. Botham, who supported Richards and Garner, decided to resign at the end of the season. 1986 was not a season for Botham to remember except for one brilliant List A innings when he made his career highest score in the limited overs form of 175 not out for Somerset against Northamptonshire in a 39-over JPL match at the Wellingborough School ground. It was to no avail, however, as the weather intervened and the game ended in no result. His innings remains a ground record.

Botham&#x27;s final tour of Australia was in 1986/87 under Mike Gatting&#x27;s captaincy. He played in four Tests and England won the Ashes for the last time until 2005. In many ways, the series was also Botham&#x27;s last hurrah because he scored his final Test century (138 in the first Test at Brisbane which England won by seven wickets) and took his final Test 5wI (five for 41 in the fourth Test at the MCG which England won by an innings and 14 runs). &quot;Wisden&quot; pointed out that although Botham had a modest series statistically, &quot;he was an asset to the side&quot; because of his enthusiasm and &quot;going out of his way to encourage younger players, especially Phil DeFreitas&quot;. 

Botham suffered a severe rib injury in the Second Test in Perth, which kept him out of the 3rd Test entirely and reduced the pace of his bowling for the remainder of the tour as he tried to manage it: as a result, with reasonable success, he changed his bowling style to a defensive, miserly military-medium pace. England also won the two one-day tournaments, the one-off Benson &amp; Hedges Perth Challenge (against Australia, West Indies and Pakistan) and the World Series (against Australia and Windies): Botham produced several match-winning performances with both bat and ball despite being not fully fit, and was Man of the Match in both matches of the best-of-three final of the World Series – with the bat in the first, opening the batting for 71 (scored out of 91 while he was at the crease), and with the ball in the second, for a particularly miserly spell which also took three wickets as England defended a low total by nine runs, to win the finals 2–0. Once again, thanks to the fielding restrictions in place for the World Series tournament, Botham opened the batting - a tactic that had been trialled in the 1982-3 tour: the tactic met with mixed success in the group stages, but it came good in the final.

===Worcestershire and England (1987 to 1991)===
After his resignation from Somerset, Botham joined Worcestershire for the 1987 season and spent five seasons with them. In 1987, he scored 126* against his old county but otherwise he was more successful as a limited overs batsman, scoring two centuries and averaging 40.94. His bowling too was much better in the shorter form, wherein he averaged 21.29 against 42.04 in first-class. His limited overs efforts helped Worcestershire to win the Sunday League. They finished ninth in the County Championship and were unsuccessful in the two knockout trophies. Worcestershire, taking a leaf from England&#x27;s winter tactic, sometimes used Botham to open the batting in one-day matches, in partnership with regular opener Tim Curtis.

Botham played in the five 1987 Tests against Pakistan, the last time he represented England in a full series. He scored 232 runs in the series with one half-century (51*) at 33.14; and took only seven wickets which were enormously expensive. Pakistan won by an innings at Headingley with the other four Tests drawn, although England were in superior positions in the First and Fourth tests which lost much time to rain, and only narrowly failed to level the series in the Fourth, running out of overs chasing a small target. When Pakistan totalled 708 at The Oval, the 217 runs conceded by Botham, from 52 overs, were the most by an England bowler, passing the 204 by Ian Peebles, from 71 overs, against Australia at The Oval in 1930, although he took three wickets and also ran out Imran Khan. The half-century, his final and by far his slowest Test fifty, was a dogged, defensive effort occupying most of the last day in a drawn match, in an unbroken partnership with Gatting (150*) to save the 5th test and keep England&#x27;s margin of defeat at 1–0. He declined to go on tour with England the following winter, either for the 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan (in which England reached the final) or for the subsequent tours of Pakistan (lost 1–0) and New Zealand (a rain-ruined 0–0 drawn series).

Botham spent the 1987–88 Australian season with Queensland, playing for them in the Sheffield Shield. Queensland were one of the better state teams in the 1980s and were always in the Shield&#x27;s top three from the 1983–84 season through to the 1990–91 season, but didn&#x27;t win it. In Botham&#x27;s season there, his teammates including Allan Border (captain), wicketkeeper Ian Healy and pace bowler Craig McDermott, they finished second to Western Australia. Botham scored several half-centuries and took a reasonable number of wickets and helped Queensland make the Sheffield Shield final. Botham and Dennis Lillee were fined for damaging the Queensland dressing room in Launceston, Tasmania during a one-day match. When the Queensland team flew to Perth for the Shield final, Botham was involved in an altercation where he allegedly assaulted a fellow airline passenger who had intervened in an argument between the Queensland players. Queensland lost the final. Botham was fined $800 by a magistrate and $5,000 by the Australian Cricket Board. He was consequently sacked by Queensland.

Botham was unfit for most of the 1988 season and played in only four first-class and seven limited overs matches during April and May. He did not play for England. Nevertheless, Worcestershire won both the County Championship and the Sunday League. Botham was out of action for eleven months, having had an operation to fuse vertebrae in his spine in response to a long-standing back problem.

He returned in May 1989 and, bowling well in the County Championship, helped Worcestershire to a second successive title. With England struggling against Allan Border&#x27;s rebuilt Australian team which featured the likes of Healy, McDermott, Steve Waugh, Merv Hughes and Mark Taylor, Botham was recalled for the third, fourth and fifth Tests of the pivotal Ashes 1989 series. He could do little to stem a tide which had now turned completely in Australia&#x27;s favour and looked completely out of his depth. He scored only 62 runs at the very low average of 15.50 – two-thirds of them in one innings – and took just three wickets at an enormously expensive 80.33. The summer of 1989 saw more controversy for England with the organisation of a rebel tour to South Africa, all participants being banned for three years: Botham declined the rebel tour, hoping to be selected for the winter tour of the West Indies, only to be dropped for his poor form.

Another two-year absence from international cricket ensued until he was recalled again to play against West Indies in 1991, on the strength of belting 161* for Worcestershire against them in their early-season tour match against the county – it was to be his only century ever against the West Indies. He was selected for the early-season ODI series at first: he took a wicket in his first over, and four in his ten-over spell, but later tore a hamstring, going for a quick single while batting. He could have retired hurt, but opted to continue with a runner, only to be dismissed by the next delivery. The injury put him out of the remaining ODIs (both won by England) and the first couple of Tests (which England won and drew to lead 1–0): then, on his comeback in a county match, another injury caused him to be unavailable for the 3rd and 4th Tests (both lost by England). 

He was recalled for the 5th Test with England needing a victory to tie the series: batting in the first innings, he scored a respectable 31 before attempting to hook Curtly Ambrose and being dismissed &quot;hit wicket&quot;, in circumstances which caused an infamous giggling fit in the BBC &quot;Test Match Special&quot; radio commentary box. Used sparingly with the ball, he took 1/27 and 2/40 as West Indies were bowled out, forced to follow on and bowled out again, by Tufnell (6/25) and Lawrence (5/106) in the first and second innings respectively. His only Test victory against the Windies was completed when he himself hit the winning runs – a boundary off his first delivery – as England chased a target of 143 with five wickets to spare, and tied the series. Two weeks later, he played against Sri Lanka at Lord&#x27;s, achieving little of note. He helped Worcestershire to win the B&amp;H Cup for the only time in 1991.

===Durham and England (1991–92 to 1993)===
Botham&#x27;s final tour was to Australia and New Zealand in 1991–92. In the tour of NZ, he played in only the last Test, and the one-day series: his most notable contribution was his highest ODI score of 79, opening the batting, in which he seemed to be set fair to finally reach a century in an ODI, but NZ managed to keep him away from the strike for several overs, he ran out of patience, slogged a delivery straight up in the air and was caught. After this came the World Cup in Australia. Botham had not previously won any man of the match awards in the World Cup, but in this competition he won two. Against India at the WACA Ground, he bowled tightly and restricted India, needing 237, to only 27 runs from his ten overs, an economy rate of 2.70 which was significantly lower than anyone else&#x27;s. He captured two wickets and one of them was Sachin Tendulkar. England won by nine runs. 

Against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground later in the competition, Botham won the award for the sort of all-round performance which had made his reputation. Australia won the toss and decided to bat first. They scored 171 all out in 49 overs and Botham took four for 31 in his ten. He then opened the England innings with Graham Gooch – the tactic England had trialled in Australia five years before, and again in the ODIs against NZ at the end of the tour before the World Cup – and scored 53 from only 77 balls in a partnership with Gooch of 107. England went on to win by eight wickets with nine overs to spare. He was less successful in the final, where previously economical bowling figures were ruined by a late assault from the Pakistani batting line-up, and then he was given out caught-behind for a duck (perhaps unfortunately, since he appeared not to have touched the ball according to the camera replays) in Wasim Akram&#x27;s first over, England losing the match.

In 1992, Botham joined County Championship newcomers Durham, scoring a century in the second innings in their inaugural first-class match against Leicestershire: and he played in the first two Tests against Pakistan, the second one at Lord&#x27;s being his final Test appearance. Botham scored 2 and 6, cheaply dismissed each time by the pace of Waqar Younis. As a bowler, he was used for only five overs in the first innings, his final Test return being none for nine: he did not bowl in Pakistan&#x27;s second innings, due to a foot injury sustained while batting, although he fielded at slip. England lost the match by two wickets and Pakistan went on to win the series 2–1. 

Botham did however play in the ODI series, in all five matches, which England won 4–1: these were his last international matches. England&#x27;s batting was so dominant in all but one of the matches, that Botham only came in right at the end of the innings, or not at all, reverting to his old place in the middle order, and he had little to do: except in the 4th match, where he opened the batting again (in Gooch&#x27;s absence) and scored a respectable and workmanlike 40, but saw England lose their last four wickets for ten runs and the match by three runs. His bowling was similarly unremarkable, usually capturing one or two wickets at about four an over: he neither scored a run (did not bat) nor took a wicket (0–43) in his final match.

In 1992 Botham was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to cricket and for his charity work in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

Botham retired from cricket midway through the 1993 season, his last match being for Durham against the visiting Australians at The Racecourse 17–19 July 1993. Durham batted first and scored 385 for eight declared (Wayne Larkins 151). In his final first-class innings, Botham scored 32. In reply, Australia could only make 221, due to Simon Brown who took seven for 70 (Botham none for 21). Being 164 behind, Australia had to follow on and a victory for Durham was possible but centuries by Matthew Hayden and David Boon saved Australia and the match was drawn. Botham&#x27;s final bowling return was none for 45 from eleven overs. In the final over of the game, Botham also kept wicket, without wearing gloves or pads.

==Records in international cricket==
Botham&#x27;s Test career spanned 16 seasons and he played in 102 matches. He scored 5,200 runs at an average of 33.54 with a highest score of 208 in his 14 centuries. He took 383 wickets at an average of 28.40 with a best return of eight for 34 and achieved ten wickets in a match four times. He held 120 catches.

In 116 LOIs from 1976 to 1992, he scored 2,113 runs with a highest score of 79; took 145 wickets with a best return of four for 31; and held 36 catches. A straight comparison of these totals with those of his Test career reveal that he was less effective in the limited overs form of the game. He did have some outstanding LOI matches, however, winning six man of the match awards. Botham took part in three editions of the Cricket World Cup: 1979, 1983 and 1992. He played in 22 World Cup matches including the finals in 1979 and 1992, both of which England lost, and he was in England&#x27;s losing team in the 1983 semi-final.

Botham was the 21st player to achieve the &quot;double&quot; of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket and he went on to score 5,200 runs and take 383 wickets, as well as holding 120 catches.

He held the world record for the greatest number of Test wickets from 21 August 1986 to 12 November 1988. His predecessor was Dennis Lillee who had retired with 355 wickets in 70 matches. Botham extended the record to 373 in 94 matches before he was overtaken by Richard Hadlee. Botham ended with 383 wickets in 102 matches while Hadlee extended the record to 431 in 86 matches. See List of Test cricket records#Career.

As described above, Botham in 1980 became the second player to achieve the &quot;match double&quot; of 100 runs and ten wickets in Test cricket, following Alan Davidson in 1960–61. Botham was, however, the first to score a century and take ten wickets in a Test match (Davidson scored 44 and 80). The century and ten double has since been achieved by Imran Khan who scored 117 and took six for 98 and five for 82 against India at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad in January 1983., and again by Shakib Al Hasan for Bangladesh against Zimbabwe at Khulna in 2014.

==List of Test centuries and five-wicket innings==

Compared with many of cricket&#x27;s greatest players, most of whom were specialists, Botham&#x27;s averages seem fairly ordinary but this overlooks the fact that he was a genuine all-rounder and it is rare for this type of player to achieve world-class status. Since the Second World War, Botham is one of perhaps a dozen or so world-class all-rounders whereas there have been numerous world-class specialists. Some of the great all-rounders, such as Garfield Sobers and Jacques Kallis as batsmen or Alan Davidson and Richard Hadlee as bowlers, could justifiably be described as world-class specialists in their main discipline who were effective practitioners of the other. The genuine all-rounders to achieve world-class status during the era, besides Botham himself, have included Keith Miller, Richie Benaud, Mike Procter, Clive Rice, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Andrew Flintoff.

Of note, Botham&#x27;s first 202 wickets came at 21.20 per wicket, while his final 181 cost on average 36.43 apiece; the first average is one that would make Botham one of the greatest bowlers of the modern era, ranking alongside the West Indian greats Curtly Ambrose (career average 20.99), Malcolm Marshall (career average 20.94), and Joel Garner (career average 20.97), but the second average depicts a player who, as a specialist bowler, would be unable to sustain a place in many Test teams. This difference can be largely attributed to the longer term effects of a back injury he sustained in 1980; this limited his bowling pace and his ability to swing the ball.

Botham&#x27;s batting – although never the equal of his bowling abilities – declined as well, with a batting average of 38.80 for his first 51 Tests substantially higher than the 28.87 he managed in his last 51 Tests, again a number that would be considered unsatisfactory for a specialist batsman in most Test sides. In the first 5 years of Botham&#x27;s Test career, when not playing as captain, he scored 2,557 runs at an average of 49.17 including 11 centuries and a highest score of 208, took 196 wickets at an average of 21.28 including nineteen 5 wicket hauls and held 50 catches. Such figures denote a player who would easily maintain a place in any Test side as a specialist batsman or bowler alone. During this period his reputation as one of the leading Test all-rounders was firmly established.

==Style and technique==
Botham had an affinity with Brian Close, his first county captain who became a mentor to him, as they shared a determination to do well and win matches. &quot;Wisden&quot; has commented on another shared characteristic: &quot;outstanding courage&quot;, mainly because Botham would readily field anywhere, generally in the slips but also in dangerous positions near the batsman and he was a brilliant fielder. As a batsman, Botham was often wrongly labelled by the tabloid press as a &quot;big hitter&quot; (effectively implying that he was a &quot;slogger&quot;) but, while it is true that his strength enabled him to drive a ball for six and his courage to hook one for six, Botham actually had a very correct batting style as he stood side-on and played straight: &quot;Wisden&quot; praised his &quot;straight hitting and square cutting&quot;. 

Botham might not have been good enough to retain a regular England place as a specialist batsman (his Test career batting average was a fairly modest 33.54) but as a bowler who was capable of taking 383 Test wickets, he certainly would. &quot;Wisden&quot; praised Tom Cartwright for helping to develop Botham&#x27;s technique as a swing bowler and, by the time he made his Test debut in 1977, Botham had mastered change of pace, the outswinger and the fast inswinging yorker, all formidable parts of his repertoire which eventually enabled him to break the world Test wicket record.

Writing in &quot;Barclays World of Cricket&quot; (1986), former England captain Tony Lewis commented on Botham&#x27;s strength, enthusiasm and aggression &quot;which he took into every game&quot;. Lewis, however, pointed out that Botham&#x27;s exuberance often reduced the efficiency of his play, in that he would take too many risks or refuse to give up on a bowling tactic despite ongoing heavy cost. He summarised Botham as an exciting cricketer who lacked self-discipline. Botham was in the middle of his career when the book was published, but Lewis emphasised the speed at which Botham had achieved certain milestones such as 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. At that time there seemed no reason why Botham should not go on reaching milestones, but he had already peaked and, in retrospect, his career had a meteoric aspect. His rival Imran Khan said: &quot;Botham was someone who I don&#x27;t think ever did justice to his talent. When he started he could have done anything, but he declined very quickly. In a way our careers were the opposite of each other. I started quite slowly but got better, maximised my talent. He went the other way, I think&quot;.

==Legacy==
Botham&#x27;s career and ability level has been oft-debated. For example, when naming him as a Cricketer of the Year in its 1978 edition, &quot;Wisden&quot; described Botham as &quot;a determined character who knows where he is aiming, and who will, quite naturally and fiercely, address himself to the interesting view that he is overrated&quot;. Denis Compton would dismiss Botham as &quot;overrated&quot; and said he &quot;only did well because all the best players had joined Packer&quot;: i.e., for World Series Cricket (WSC).

Botham would readily give praise to his colleagues, for instance, his batting partners Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp after the 1974 Benson and Hedges quarter-final against Hampshire; and to Bob Willis, the man whose bowling spell won the test match at Headingley in 1981.

The Richards–Botham Trophy, set to replace the Wisden Trophy for winners of West Indies–England Test series, is named in honour of Botham and Viv Richards.

==Libel cases brought against Imran Khan (1994–1996)==
In 1994, the year after he retired, Botham became embroiled in a legal dispute with Imran Khan who, in an article for &quot;India Today&quot;, had accused Botham and Allan Lamb of bringing cricket into disrepute. Botham and Lamb instigated a libel action in response. The case was heard at the High Court in 1996 with the court choosing to hear on the second day a separate action brought solely by Botham against Khan, who had suggested in a newspaper article that Botham had been involved in ball-tampering. This would become the subject of a court case later on, one that Khan would go on to win. Botham was liable for all expenses in the court case in the ruling, including those incurred by Khan.

==Football career==
Botham was a talented footballer but, believing he was better at cricket, he chose the latter for his full-time career. Even so, he played football as a centre-half from 1978 to 1985 for Yeovil Town and Scunthorpe United. He made eleven appearances in the Football League for Scunthorpe. While with Yeovil, Botham made an appearance for the Football Association XI (a representative side for non-League footballers) against the Northern Football League at Croft Park during the 1984–85 season.

==Charity fundraising==

Botham has been a prodigious fundraiser for charitable causes, undertaking a total of 12 long-distance charity walks. His first, in 1985, was a 900-mile trek from John o&#x27; Groats to Land&#x27;s End. His efforts were inspired after a visit to Taunton&#x27;s Musgrove Park Hospital in 1977 whilst receiving treatment for a broken toe. When he took a wrong turn into a children&#x27;s ward, he was devastated to learn that some of the children had only weeks to live, and why. At the time he was an expectant father. Since then his efforts have raised more than £12 million for charity, with leukaemia research the main cause to benefit. In recognition of this work, Botham in 2003 became the first-ever President of Bloodwise, the UK&#x27;s leading blood cancer charity. In November 2014, Botham designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty created by various celebrities which were located around London prior to the release of the film &quot;Paddington&quot;, with the statues auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

On 10 October 2007, Botham was invested a Knight Bachelor by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, having been appointed in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours &quot;for services to Charity and to Cricket&quot;.

==Media career==
After retiring from cricket, Botham became involved in the media and has worked as an analyst and commentator for Sky Sports for many years. Unlike Fred Trueman and others, he does not hark back to &quot;in my day&quot;. &quot;Wisden&quot; editor Matthew Engel remarked on Botham&#x27;s calmness, wit and sagacity as a TV commentator, though admitting he was surprised by it.

On 9 August 2009, while commentating on the fourth Ashes Test at Headingley that season, Botham was invited to take part in an on-field ceremony to induct him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame along with former Yorkshire players Geoffrey Boycott, Wilfred Rhodes and Fred Trueman. Boycott was also in attendance, along with Fred Trueman&#x27;s widow Veronica and Colin Graves who, as Yorkshire County Cricket Club chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Wilfred Rhodes. Botham said: &quot;To be named amongst 55 of the most prolific players in cricketing history is a great honour for me. To have my cricketing career recognised in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame is not something I would have thought when I began playing cricket but to be receiving this award today is something I&#x27;m extremely grateful for&quot;. Colin Graves included Botham in his tribute to Rhodes when he said: &quot;It is a great honour to accept the cap on behalf of a Yorkshire legend. Wilfred Rhodes was an exceedingly gifted player and is rightly regarded as one of England&#x27;s greatest all-rounders. I am also delighted to see two other great Yorkshiremen and another great all-rounder inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame today&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews during a meeting at Lord&#x27;s.

On 12 August 1995, Botham was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil on his one-on-one interview show &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot; for Channel 4.

In 2008 he received a Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bath.

==Peerage==
He was nominated by Boris Johnson for a life peerage in the 2020 Political Honours, it being widely reported that the honour was a reward for his support for Brexit. He was created &quot;Baron Botham, of Ravensworth in the County of North Yorkshire&quot; on 10 September and took the oath and his seat on 5 October 2020. Botham made his maiden speech on 3 November 2020, and since then has made one further spoken contribution on 25 November 2020 regarding funding in sport, but as of November 2024, no further spoken contributions have been made since. Whilst Botham made 61 attendances in 2020, this dropped to two attendances in 2022. As of November 2024, the parliamentary record shows his last vote in the House of Lords was in July 2021.

On 23 August 2021, Boris Johnson appointed him the UK&#x27;s Trade Envoy to Australia.

==Personal life==
Botham is colour blind. In 1976, in Doncaster, Botham married Kathryn (&quot;Kathy&quot;) Waller (now Lady Botham) whom he first met in June 1974. After their marriage, they lived until the late 1980s in Epworth, near Scunthorpe. They have one son, Liam (born August 1977), and two daughters. The family now live in Ravensworth in North Yorkshire, and also own property in Almería, where Botham frequently plays golf.

Botham is an avid trout and salmon fisherman. As a result, he was invited to present a TV series called &quot;Botham on the Fly&quot;. He has also been a team captain on the BBC series &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;.

Besides angling and golf, Botham enjoys game shooting and owns a grouse moor. This has resulted in a high-profile dispute with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In August 2016, he called for Chris Packham to be sacked by the BBC as part of a campaign funded by the grouse shooting industry, after Packham had highlighted the industry&#x27;s involvement in the illegal killing of endangered species of birds of prey.

According to the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 2015, &quot;Botham is an old-fashioned Englishman [...] he is conservative with a small and upper-case C&quot; and &quot;a robust monarchist&quot;. Botham was a staunch supporter of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. He was quoted: &quot;Personally, I think that England is an island. I think that England should be England. And I think that we should keep that.&quot; He appeared at a number of pro-Leave campaign events in the run-up to the UK&#x27;s EU membership referendum in 2016.

Botham&#x27;s private life has also made occasional dramatic appearances in Britain&#x27;s tabloid newspapers, with at least one extra-marital affair prompting a public apology to his wife Kathy. He also fell out publicly with other players, including fellow England player Geoff Boycott, Somerset captain Peter Roebuck, and Australian batsman Ian Chappell, with whom he had an altercation in an Adelaide Oval car park during the 2010–11 Ashes series. Although Botham hoped to resolve his long-running feud with Chappell during a Channel 9 documentary on 27 June 2023, Chappell refused.

<text>id Software LLC () is an American video game developer based in Richardson, Texas. It was founded on February 1, 1991, by four members of the computer company Softdisk: programmers John Carmack and John Romero, game designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack.

id Software made important technological developments in video game technologies for the PC (running MS-DOS and Windows), including work done for the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, and &quot;Quake&quot; franchises at the time. id&#x27;s work was particularly important in 3D computer graphics technology and in game engines that are used throughout the video game industry. The company was involved in the creation of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre: &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; is often considered to be the first true FPS; &quot;Doom&quot; is a game that popularized the genre and PC gaming in general; and &quot;Quake&quot; was id&#x27;s first true 3D FPS.

On June 24, 2009, ZeniMax Media acquired the company. In 2015, they opened a second studio in Frankfurt, Germany.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The founders of id Software – John Carmack, John Romero, and Tom Hall – met in the offices of Softdisk based in Shreveport, Louisiana, developing multiple games for Softdisk&#x27;s monthly publishing, including &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot;. Along with another Softdisk employee, Lane Roathe, they had formed a small group they called Ideas from the Deep (IFD), a name that Romero and Roathe had come up with. In September 1990, Carmack developed an efficient way to rapidly side-scroll graphics on the PC. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and Hall stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 NES game &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, inserting stock graphics of Romero&#x27;s Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the demo, entitled &quot;Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement&quot;, he realized that Carmack&#x27;s breakthrough could have potential. The IFD team moonlighted over a week and over two weekends to create a larger demo of their PC version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. They sent their work to Nintendo. According to Romero, Nintendo had told them that the demo was impressive, but &quot;they didn&#x27;t want their intellectual property on anything but their own hardware, so they told us Good Job and You Can&#x27;t Do This&quot;. While the pair had not readily shared the demo though acknowledged its existence in the years since, a working copy of the demo was discovered in July 2021 and preserved at the Museum of Play.

Around the same time in 1990, Scott Miller of Apogee Software learned of the group and their exceptional talent, having played one of Romero&#x27;s Softdisk games, &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot;, and contacted Romero under the guise of multiple fan letters that Romero came to realize all originated from the same address. When he confronted Miller, Miller explained that the deception was necessary since Softdisk screened letters it received. Although disappointed by not actually having received mail from multiple fans, Romero and other Softdisk developers began proposing ideas to Miller. One of these was &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, a side-scrolling game that incorporated the previous work they had done on the &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; demonstration. The first &quot;Commander Keen&quot; game, &quot;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons&quot;, was released through Apogee in December 1990, which became a very successful shareware game. After their first royalty check, Romero, Carmack, and Adrian Carmack (no relation) decided to start their own company. After hiring Hall, the group finished the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; series, then hired Jay Wilbur and Kevin Cloud and began working on &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. id Software was officially founded by Romero, John and Adrian Carmack and Hall on February 1, 1991. The name &quot;id&quot; came out of their previous IFD; Roathe had left the group, and they opted to drop the &quot;F&quot; to leave &quot;id&quot;. They initially used &quot;id&quot; as an initialism for &quot;In Demand&quot;, but by the time of the fourth &quot;Commander Keen&quot; game, they opted to let &quot;id&quot; stand out &quot;as a cool word&quot;, according to Romero. In September 1991, they relocated to Madison, Wisconsin. Later on April 1, 1992, they relocated to an office in Mesquite, Texas.

The shareware distribution method was initially employed by id Software through Apogee Software to sell their products, such as the &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; games. They would release the first part of their trilogy as shareware, then sell the other two installments by mail order. Only later (about the time of the release of &quot;Doom II&quot;) did id Software release their games via more traditional shrink-wrapped boxes in stores (through other game publishers).

After &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;″s great success, id began working on &quot;Doom&quot;. After Hall left the company, Sandy Petersen and Dave Taylor were hired before the release of &quot;Doom&quot; in December 1993.

=== The end of the classic lineup ===
&quot;Quake&quot; was released on June 22, 1996 and was considered a difficult game to develop due to creative differences. Animosity grew within the company and it caused a conflict between Carmack and Romero, which led the latter to leave id after the game&#x27;s release. Soon after, other staff left the company as well such as Michael Abrash, Shawn Green, Jay Wilbur, Petersen and Mike Wilson. Petersen claimed in July 2021 that the lack of a team leader was the cause of it all. In fact, he volunteered to take lead as he had five years of experience as project manager in MicroProse but he was turned down by Carmack.

=== ZeniMax Media and Microsoft ===
On June 24, 2009, it was announced that id Software had been acquired by ZeniMax Media (owner of Bethesda Softworks). The deal would eventually affect publishing deals id Software had before the acquisition, namely &quot;Rage&quot;, which was being published through Electronic Arts. ZeniMax received in July a $105 million investment from StrongMail Systems for the id acquisition, it&#x27;s unknown if that was the exact price of the deal. id Software moved from the &quot;cube-shaped&quot; Mesquite office to a location in Richardson, Texas during the spring of 2011. 

On June 26, 2013, id Software president Todd Hollenshead quit after 17 years of service.

On November 22, 2013, it was announced id Software co-founder and Technical Director John Carmack had fully resigned from the company to work full-time at Oculus VR which he joined as CTO in August 2013. He was the last of the original founders to leave the company.

Tim Willits left the company in 2019. ZeniMax Media was acquired by Microsoft for in March 2021 and became part of Xbox Game Studios.

=== Company name ===
The company writes its name with a lowercase &quot;id&quot;, which is pronounced as in &quot;did&quot; or &quot;kid&quot;, and, according to the book &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, the group identified itself as &quot;Ideas from the Deep&quot; in the early days of Softdisk but that, in the end, the name &#x27;id&#x27; came from the phrase &quot;in demand&quot;. Disliking &quot;in demand&quot; as &quot;lame&quot;, someone suggested a connection with Sigmund Freud&#x27;s psychological concept of id, which the others accepted. Evidence of the reference can be found as early as &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; with the statement &quot;that&#x27;s id, as in the id, ego, and superego in the psyche&quot; appearing in the game&#x27;s documentation. Prior to an update to the website, id&#x27;s History page made a direct reference to Freud.

=== Timeline ===
== Game development ==

=== Technology ===

Starting with their first shareware game series, &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, id Software has licensed the core source code for the game, or what is more commonly known as the engine. Brainstormed by John Romero, id Software held a weekend session titled &quot;The id Summer Seminar&quot; in the summer of 1991 with prospective buyers including Scott Miller, George Broussard, Ken Rogoway, Jim Norwood and Todd Replogle. One of the nights, id Software put together an impromptu game known as &quot;Wac-Man&quot; to demonstrate not only the technical prowess of the &quot;Keen&quot; engine, but also how it worked internally.

id Software has developed their own game engine for each of their titles when moving to the next technological milestone, including &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;ShadowCaster&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot;, and &quot;Quake III&quot;, as well as the technology used in making &quot;Doom 3&quot;. After being used first for id Software&#x27;s in-house game, the engines are licensed out to other developers. According to &quot;Eurogamer.net&quot;, &quot;id Software has been synonymous with PC game engines since the concept of a detached game engine was first popularized&quot;. During the mid to late 1990s, &quot;the launch of each successive round of technology it&#x27;s been expected to occupy a headlining position&quot;, with the &quot;Quake III&quot; engine being most widely adopted of their engines. However id Tech 4 had far fewer licensees than the Unreal Engine from Epic Games, due to the long development time that went into &quot;Doom 3&quot; which id Software had to release before licensing out that engine to others.

Despite his enthusiasm for open source code, Carmack revealed in 2011 that he had no interest in licensing the technology to the mass market. Beginning with &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, he felt bothered when third-party companies started &quot;pestering&quot; him to license the id tech engine, adding that he wanted to focus on new technology instead of providing support to existing ones. He felt very strongly that this was not why he signed up to be a game programmer for; to be &quot;holding the hands&quot; of other game developers. Carmack commended Epic Games for pursuing the licensing to the market beginning with Unreal Engine 3. Even though the said company has gained more success with its game engine than id Software over the years, Carmack had no regrets by his decision and continued to focus on open source until his departure from the company in 2013.

In conjunction with his self-professed affinity for sharing source code, John Carmack has open-sourced most of the major id Software engines under the GNU General Public License. Historically, the source code for each engine has been released once the code base is 5 years old. Consequently, many home grown projects have sprung up porting the code to different platforms, cleaning up the source code, or providing major modifications to the core engine. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot; engine ports are ubiquitous to nearly all platforms capable of running games, such as hand-held PCs, iPods, the PSP, the Nintendo DS and more. Impressive core modifications include GZDoom, which adds to the Doom engine modern hardware accelerared renderers and a scripting system called ZScript, and was also utilized in the creation of ECWolf for &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and Raze for the Build engine. Meanwhile DarkPlaces adds stencil shadow volumes into the original &quot;Quake&quot; engine along with a more efficient network protocol. Other projects include Yamagi Quake II, ioquake3, and dhewm3, which maintain the goal of cleaning up the source code, adding features and fixing bugs. Even earlier id Software code, namely for &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot; and &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot;, was released in June 2014 by Flat Rock Software.

The GPL release of the &quot;Quake III&quot; engine&#x27;s source code was moved from the end of 2004 to August 2005 as the engine was still being licensed to commercial customers who would otherwise be concerned over the sudden loss in value of their recent investment.

On August 4, 2011, John Carmack revealed during his QuakeCon 2011 keynote that they will be releasing the source code of the &quot;Doom 3&quot; engine (id Tech 4) during the year.

id Software publicly stated they would not support the Wii console (possibly due to technical limitations), although they have since indicated that they may release titles on that platform (although it would be limited to their games released during the 1990s). They continued this policy with the Wii U but for Nintendo Switch, they collaborated with Panic Button starting with 2016&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot;.

Since id Software revealed their engine id Tech 5, they call their engines &quot;id Tech&quot;, followed by a version number. Older engines have retroactively been renamed to fit this scheme, with the &quot;Doom&quot; engine as id Tech 1.

==== IMF Music File Format ====
IMF (&quot;id music file&quot; or &quot;id&#x27;s music format&quot;) is an audio file format created by id Software for the AdLib sound card for use in their video games. The format is similar to MIDI, in that it defines musical notes, and does not support sampled digital audio for sound effects. IMF files store the actual bytes sent to the AdLib&#x27;s OPL2 chip, which uses FM synthesis to produce audio output. The format is based on the AdLib command syntax, with a few modifications. Due to the limited features and relatively low sound quality, modern games no longer use IMF music.

A large number of songs in id Software&#x27;s early games (such as &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;) were composed by Bobby Prince in IMF format. Other game developers like Apogee Software also used this format in their games (such as &quot;Cosmo&#x27;s Cosmic Adventure&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem II&quot;, and &quot;Monster Bash&quot;).

=== Linux gaming ===

id Software was an early pioneer in the Linux gaming market, and id Software&#x27;s Linux games have been some of the most popular of the platform. Many id Software games won the Readers&#x27; and Editors&#x27; Choice awards of Linux Journal. Some id Software titles ported to Linux are &quot;Doom&quot; (the first id Software game to be ported), &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Doom 3&quot;, &quot;Quake 4&quot;, and &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot;. Since id Software and some of its licensees released the source code for some of their previous games, several games which were not ported (such as &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot;, &quot;Catacomb Abyss&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold&quot;, &quot;Blake Stone: Planet Strike&quot;, &quot;Super 3D Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, &quot;Doom 64&quot;, &quot;Strife&quot;, &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hexen II&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force Holomatch&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot;) can run on Linux and other operating systems natively through the use of source ports. &quot;Quake Live&quot; also launched with Linux support, although this, alongside OS X support, was later removed when changed to a standalone title.

The tradition of porting to Linux was first started by Dave D. Taylor, with Zoid Kirsch doing some later porting. Since &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, Linux porting had been handled by Timothee Besset. The majority of all id Tech 4 games, including those made by other developers, have a Linux client available, the only current exceptions being &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; and &quot;Brink&quot;. Similarly, almost all of the games utilizing the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine have Linux ports, the only exceptions being those created by Ion Storm (&quot;Daikatana&quot; later received a community port). Despite fears by the Linux gaming community that id Tech 5 would not be ported to that platform, Timothee Besset in his blog stated &quot;I&#x27;ll be damned if we don&#x27;t find the time to get Linux builds done&quot;. Besset explained that id Software&#x27;s primary justification for releasing Linux builds was better code quality, along with a technical interest in the platform. However, on January 26, 2012, Besset announced that he had left id.

John Carmack has expressed his stance with regard to Linux builds in the past. In December 2000 Todd Hollenshead expressed support for Linux: &quot;All said, we will continue to be a leading supporter of the Linux platform because we believe it is a technically sound OS and is the OS of choice for many server ops.&quot; However, on April 25, 2012, Carmack revealed that &quot;there are no plans for a native Linux client&quot; of id&#x27;s most recent game, &quot;Rage&quot;. In February 2013, Carmack argued for improving emulation as the &quot;proper technical direction for gaming on Linux&quot;, though this was also due to ZeniMax&#x27;s refusal to support &quot;unofficial binaries&quot;, given all prior ports (except for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, via Loki Software, and earlier versions of &quot;Quake Live&quot;) having only ever been unofficial. Carmack didn&#x27;t mention official games &quot;&quot; and &quot;Quake II: Colossus&quot; ported by id Software to Linux and published by Macmillan Computer Publishing USA.

Despite no longer releasing native binaries, id was an early adopter of Stadia, a cloud gaming service powered by Debian Linux servers, and the cross-platform Vulkan API. A Linux version of &quot;Doom&quot; from 2016 was tested internally, while it and its sequel &quot;Doom Eternal&quot; can be run using Wine and Proton.

== Games ==
=== &quot;Commander Keen&quot; ===
&quot;Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons&quot;, a platform game in the style of those for the Nintendo Entertainment System, was one of the first MS-DOS games with smooth horizontal-scrolling. Published by Apogee Software, the title and follow-ups brought id Software success as a shareware developer. It is the series of id Software that designer Tom Hall is most affiliated with. The first &quot;Commander Keen&quot; trilogy was released on December 14, 1990.

=== &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; ===

The company&#x27;s breakout product was released on May 5, 1992: &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, a first-person shooter (FPS) with smooth 3D graphics that were unprecedented in computer games, and with violent gameplay that many gamers found engaging. After essentially founding an entire genre with this game, id Software created &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, &quot;Doom 3 and Quake 4.&quot; Each of these first-person shooters featured progressively higher levels of graphical technology. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; spawned a prequel and a sequel: the prequel called &quot;Spear of Destiny&quot;, and the second, &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, using the id Tech 3 engine. A third &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; sequel, simply titled &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, was released by Raven Software, using the id Tech 4 engine. Another sequel, named &quot;&quot;; was developed by MachineGames using the id Tech 5 engine and released in 2014, with it getting a prequel by the name of &quot;&quot; a year later; followed by a direct sequel titled &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot; in 2017.

=== &quot;Doom&quot; ===

Eighteen months after their release of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, on December 10, 1993, id Software released &quot;Doom&quot; which would again set new standards for graphic quality and graphic violence in computer gaming. &quot;Doom&quot; featured a sci-fi/horror setting with graphic quality that had never been seen on personal computers or even video game consoles. &quot;Doom&quot; became a cultural phenomenon and its violent theme would eventually launch a new wave of criticism decrying the dangers of violence in video games. &quot;Doom&quot; was ported to numerous platforms, inspired many knock-offs, and was eventually followed by the technically similar &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;. id Software made its mark in video game history with the shareware release of &quot;Doom&quot;, and eventually revisited the theme of this game in 2004 with their release of &quot;Doom 3&quot;. John Carmack said in an interview at QuakeCon 2007 that there would be a &quot;Doom 4&quot;. It began development on May 7, 2008. &quot;Doom 2016&quot;, the fourth installation of the &quot;Doom&quot; series, was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on May 13, 2016, and was later released on Nintendo Switch on November 10, 2017. In June 2018, the sequel to the 2016 &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom Eternal&quot; was officially announced at E3 2018 with a teaser trailer, followed by a gameplay reveal at QuakeCon in August 2018.

=== &quot;Quake&quot; ===

On June 22, 1996, the release of &quot;Quake&quot; marked the third milestone in id Software history. &quot;Quake&quot; combined a cutting edge fully 3D engine, the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, with a distinctive art style to create critically acclaimed graphics for its time. Audio was not neglected either, having recruited Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor to facilitate unique sound effects and ambient music for the game. (A small homage was paid to Nine Inch Nails in the form of the band&#x27;s logo appearing on the ammunition boxes for the nailgun weapon.) It also included the work of Michael Abrash. Furthermore, &quot;Quake&quot;&#x27;s main innovation, the capability to play a deathmatch (competitive gameplay between living opponents instead of against computer-controlled characters) over the Internet (especially through the add-on &quot;QuakeWorld&quot;), seared the title into the minds of gamers as another smash hit.

In 2008, id Software was honored at the 59th Annual Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards for the pioneering work &quot;Quake&quot; represented in user modifiable games. id Software is the only game development company ever honored twice by the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, having been given an Emmy Award in 2007 for creation of the 3D technology that underlies modern shooter video games.

The &quot;Quake&quot; series continued with &quot;Quake II&quot; in 1997. Activision purchased a 49% stake in id Software, making it a second party which took publishing duties until 2009. However, the game is not a storyline sequel, and instead focuses on an assault on an alien planet, Stroggos, in retaliation for Strogg attacks on Earth. Most of the subsequent entries in the &quot;Quake&quot; franchise follow this storyline. &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; (1999), the next title in the series, has minimal plot, but centers around the &quot;Arena Eternal&quot;, a gladiatorial setting created by an alien race known as the Vadrigar and populated by combatants plucked from various points in time and space. Among these combatants are some characters either drawn from or based on those in &quot;Doom&quot; (&quot;Doomguy&quot;), &quot;Quake&quot; (Ranger, Wrack), and &quot;Quake II&quot; (Bitterman, Tank Jr., Grunt, Stripe). &quot;Quake IV&quot; (2005) picks up where &quot;Quake II&quot; left off – finishing the war between the humans and Strogg. The spin-off &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot; acts as a prequel to &quot;Quake II&quot;, when the Strogg first invade Earth. &quot;Quake IV&quot; and &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot; were made by outside developers and not id.

There have also been other spin-offs such as Quake Mobile in 2005 and &quot;Quake Live&quot;, a web browser based modification of &quot;Quake III&quot;. A game called &quot;Quake Arena DS&quot; was planned and canceled for the Nintendo DS. John Carmack stated, at QuakeCon 2007, that the &quot;id Tech 5&quot; engine would be used for a new &quot;Quake&quot; game.

=== &quot;Rage&quot; ===

Todd Hollenshead announced in May 2007 that id Software had begun working on an all new series that would be using a new engine. Hollenshead also mentioned that the title would be completely developed in-house, marking the first game since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Doom 3&quot; to be done so. At 2007&#x27;s WWDC, John Carmack showed the new engine called id Tech 5. Later that year, at QuakeCon 2007, the title of the new game was revealed as &quot;Rage&quot;.

On July 14, 2008, id Software announced at the 2008 E3 event that they would be publishing &quot;Rage&quot; through Electronic Arts, and not id&#x27;s longtime publisher Activision. However, since then ZeniMax has also announced that they are publishing &quot;Rage&quot; through Bethesda Softworks.

On August 12, 2010, during Quakecon 2010, id Software announced &quot;Rage&quot; US ship date of September 13, 2011, and a European ship date of September 15, 2011. During the keynote, id Software also demonstrated a &quot;Rage&quot; spin-off title running on the iPhone. This technology demo later became &quot;Rage HD&quot;. The game was ultimately released in October 2011.

On May 14, 2018, Bethesda Softworks announced &quot;Rage 2&quot;, a co-development between id Software and Avalanche Studios.

=== Other games ===
During its early days, id Software produced much more varied games; these include the early 3D first-person shooter experiments that led to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; – &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot; and &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot;. There was also the &quot;Rescue Rover&quot; series, which had two games – &quot;Rescue Rover&quot; and &quot;Rescue Rover 2&quot;. Also there was John Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Dave&quot; series, which included such notables as the tech demo (&quot;In Copyright Infringement&quot;) which led to the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; engine, and the decently popular &quot;Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion&quot;. &quot;In the Haunted Mansion&quot; was powered by the same engine as the earlier id Software game &quot;Shadow Knights&quot;, which was one of the several games written by id Software to fulfill their contractual obligation to produce games for Softdisk, where the id Software founders had been employed. id Software has also overseen several games using its technology that were not made in one of their IPs such as &quot;ShadowCaster&quot;, (early-id Tech 1), &quot;Heretic&quot;, &quot;&quot; (id Tech 1), &quot;Hexen II&quot; (&quot;Quake&quot; engine), and &quot;Orcs and Elves&quot; (&quot;Doom RPG&quot; engine).

== Other media ==
id Software has also published novels based on the &quot;Doom&quot; series &quot;Doom&quot; novels. After a brief hiatus from publishing, id resumed and re-launched the novel series in 2008 with Matthew J. Costello&#x27;s (a story consultant for &quot;Doom 3&quot; and now &quot;Rage&quot;) new &quot;Doom 3&quot; novels: &quot;Worlds on Fire&quot; and &quot;Maelstrom&quot;.

id Software became involved in film development when they oversaw the film adaption of their &quot;Doom&quot; franchise in 2005. In August 2007, Todd Hollenshead stated at QuakeCon 2007 that a &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; movie is in development which re-teams the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; writer/producer team, Roger Avary as writer and director and Samuel Hadida as producer. A new &quot;Doom&quot; film, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in 2019, although id itself stressed its lack of involvement.

== Controversy ==
id Software was the target of controversy over two of their most popular games, &quot;Doom&quot; and the earlier &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. More recently in 2022, id Software found themselves mired in a controversy concerning libel against Doom Eternal&#x27;s composer.

=== &quot;Doom&quot; ===
&quot;Doom&quot; was notorious for its high levels of gore and occultism along with satanic imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. Yahoo! Games listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.

The game again sparked controversy throughout a period of school shootings in the United States when it was found that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said that the killing would be &quot;like playing &quot;Doom&quot;&quot;, and &quot;it&#x27;ll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, World War II, Vietnam, &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; all mixed together&quot;, and that his shotgun was &quot;straight out of the game&quot;. A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a &quot;Doom&quot; level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris&#x27;s classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design &quot;Doom&quot; levels, none of them were based on Columbine High School.

While &quot;Doom&quot; and other violent video games have been blamed for nationally covered school shootings, 2008 research featured by Greater Good Science Center shows that the two are not closely related. Harvard Medical School researchers Cheryl Olson and Lawrence Kutner found that violent video games did not correlate to school shootings. The United States Secret Service and United States Department of Education analyzed 37 incidents of school violence and sought to develop a profile of school shooters; they discovered that the most common traits among shooters were that they were male and had histories of depression and attempted suicide. While many of the killers—like the vast majority of young teenage boys—did play video games, this study did not find a relationship between gameplay and school shootings. In fact, only one-eighth of the shooters showed any special interest in violent video games, far less than the number of shooters who seemed attracted to books and movies with violent content.

=== &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; ===
As for &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, due to its use of Nazi symbols such as the swastika and the anthem of the Nazi Party, &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;, as theme music, the PC version of the game was withdrawn from circulation in Germany in 1994, following a verdict by the Amtsgericht München on January 25, 1994. Despite the fact that Nazis are portrayed as the enemy in &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, the use of those symbols is a federal offense in Germany unless certain circumstances apply. Similarly, the Atari Jaguar version was confiscated following a verdict by the Amtsgericht Berlin Tiergarten on December 7, 1994. The Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle lifted the outright ban in 2018 in favor of analysing depictions on a case-by-case basis, and the international version of the game was removed from the list of banned titles in 2019.

Due to concerns from Nintendo of America, the Super NES version was modified to not include any swastikas or Nazi references; furthermore, blood was replaced with sweat to make the game seem less violent, and the attack dogs in the game were replaced by giant mutant rats. Employees of id Software are quoted in &quot;The Official DOOM Player Guide&quot; about the reaction to &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, claiming it to be ironic that it was morally acceptable to shoot people and rats, but not dogs. Two new weapons were added as well. The Super NES version was not as successful as the PC version. 

=== Soundtrack dispute ===
In May 2020, after the Doom Eternal Original Soundtrack was released, there was a serious backlash to the Doom Eternal OST and accusations of low quality work that did not match composer Mick Gordon&#x27;s usual standards. On April 19, Gordon confirmed on Twitter that it was not his work, and Marty Stratton subsequently posted on May 20 a 2,500-word open letter on Reddit blaming Gordon for everything that went wrong with the process of creating music for the soundtrack. Following this, public outcry against Gordon reached a level where he received explicit death threats and graphic messages of intent to harm him and his family. Gordon&#x27;s message accounts, servers, and phones were allegedly inundated with abuse to extreme levels, seriously impacting his mental health.

On November 9, 2022, Mick published a 14,000-word article on Medium explaining his side of the story as a defensive rebuttal of the nine outlined accusations in Stratton&#x27;s post (described as &quot;an extensive series of lies&quot;), substantiated with various forms of evidence including photographs of emails, receipts, and file metadata to verify his claims. It included claims that Gordon had yet to receive over half of his payment for his work and awards from the soundtrack&#x27;s nominations at The Game Awards 2020 Stratton had reportedly claimed to deliver on Gordon&#x27;s behalf; that his name had been listed on the OST&#x27;s pre-order for weeks before Bethesda had contracted him to work on it just 48 hours before the game&#x27;s release; Mossholder had been composing an alternate version of the OST as early as August 2019, and in response to request from Gordon&#x27;s lawyers for Stratton&#x27;s Reddit post to be removed, Gordon was offered six figures in exchange for a lifetime gag order, but never the possibility of Stratton&#x27;s defamatory post being removed.

On November 16, 2022, Bethesda released a statement backing Marty Stratton, Chad Mossholder, and everyone in the id software team. Their statement further claimed that they had evidence to rebut Gordon&#x27;s claims, without releasing mentioned evidence, and expressed concern that his statement enticed harassment and violence towards the team.

== People ==
In 2003, the book &quot;Masters of Doom&quot; chronicled the development of id Software, concentrating on the personalities and interaction of John Carmack and John Romero. Below are the key people involved with id&#x27;s success.

=== John Carmack ===

Carmack&#x27;s skill at 3D programming is widely recognized in the software industry and from its inception, he was id&#x27;s lead programmer. On August 7, 2013, he joined Oculus VR, a company developing virtual reality headsets, and left id Software on November 22, 2013.

=== John Romero ===

John Romero saw the horizontal scrolling demo &quot;Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement&quot; and immediately had the idea to form id Software on September 20, 1990. Romero pioneered the game engine licensing business with his &quot;id Summer Seminar&quot; in 1991 where the Keen4 engine was licensed to Apogee for Biomenace. John also worked closely with the DOOM community and was the face of id to its fans. One success of this engagement was the fan-made game &quot;Final DOOM&quot;, published in 1996. John also created the control scheme for the FPS, and the abstract level design style of DOOM that influenced many 3D games that came after it. John added par times to Wolfenstein 3D, and then DOOM, which started the phenomenon of Speedrunning. Romero wrote almost all the tools that enabled id Software and many others to develop games with id Software&#x27;s technology. Romero was forced to resign in 1996 after the release of &quot;Quake&quot;, then later formed the company Ion Storm. There, he became infamous through the development of &quot;Daikatana&quot;, which was received negatively from reviewers and gamers alike upon release. Afterward, Romero co-founded The Guildhall in Dallas, Texas, served as chairman of the CPL eSports league, created an MMORPG publisher and developer named Gazillion Entertainment, created a hit Facebook game named Ravenwood Fair that garnered 25 million monthly players in 2011, and started Romero Games in Galway, Ireland in 2015.

Both Tom Hall and John Romero have reputations as designers and idea men who have helped shape some of the key PC gaming titles of the 1990s.

=== Tom Hall ===

Tom Hall was forced to resign by id Software during the early days of &quot;Doom&quot; development, but not before he had some impact; for example, he was responsible for the inclusion of teleporters in the game. He was let go before the shareware release of &quot;Doom&quot; and then went to work for Apogee, developing &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; with the &quot;Developers of Incredible Power&quot;. When he finished work on that game, he found he was not compatible with the &quot;Prey&quot; development team at Apogee, and therefore left to join his ex-id Software compatriot John Romero at Ion Storm. Hall has frequently commented that if he could obtain the rights to &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, he would immediately develop another Keen title.

=== Sandy Petersen ===

Sandy Petersen was a level designer for 19 of the 27 levels in the original &quot;Doom&quot; title as well as 17 of the 32 levels of &quot;Doom II&quot;. As a fan of H.P. Lovecraft, his influence is apparent in the Lovecraftian feel of the monsters for &quot;Quake&quot;, and he created &quot;Inferno&quot;, the third &quot;episode&quot; of the first &quot;Doom&quot;. He was forced to resign from id Software during the production of &quot;Quake II&quot; and most of his work was scrapped before the title was released.

=== American McGee ===

American McGee was a level designer for &quot;Doom II&quot;, &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, and &quot;Quake II&quot;. He was asked to resign after the release of &quot;Quake II&quot;, and he then moved to Electronic Arts where he gained industry notoriety with the development of his own game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;. After leaving Electronic Arts, he became an independent entrepreneur and game developer. McGee headed the independent game development studio Spicy Horse in Shanghai, China from 2007 to 2016.

<text>Isaac Stern (July 21, 1920 – September 22, 2001) was an American violinist.

Born in Ukraine, Stern moved to the United States when he was 14 months old. Stern performed both nationally and internationally, notably touring the Soviet Union and China, and performing extensively in Israel, a country to which he had close ties since shortly after its founding.

Stern received extensive recognition for his work, including winning the Presidential Medal of Freedom and six Grammy Awards, and being named to the French Legion of Honour. The Isaac Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall bears his name, due to his role in saving the venue from demolition in the 1960s.

==Biography==

The son of Solomon and Clara Stern, Isaac Stern was born in Kremenets, Poland (now Ukraine), into a Jewish family. He was 14 months old when his family moved to San Francisco in 1921. Both his parents were musical and his mother, who had studied at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, began teaching him the piano when he was six before switching her son to the violin when he was eight. In 1928, Stern’s parents enrolled him at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, where he studied until 1931 before going on to study briefly in New York with Louis Persinger. He returned to the San Francisco Conservatory to study for five years with Naoum Blinder, the concertmaster of the San Francisco Symphony, to whom he said he owed the most. At his public début on February 18, 1936, aged 15, he played Saint-Saëns&#x27; Violin Concerto No. 3 in B minor with the San Francisco Symphony under the direction of Pierre Monteux. Reflecting on his background, Stern once memorably quipped that cultural exchanges between the U.S. and Soviet Russia drew from the same city:

:: &quot;They send us their Jews from Odessa, and we send them our Jews from Odessa.&quot;

During World War II, Stern was rejected from military service due to flat feet. He then joined the United Service Organizations and performed for US troops. During one such performance on Guadalcanal, a Japanese soldier, mesmerized by his playing, sneaked into the audience of US personnel listening to his performance before sneaking back out.

Stern toured the Soviet Union in 1951, the first American violinist to do so. In 1967, Stern stated his refusal to return to the USSR until the Soviet regime allowed artists to enter and leave the country freely. His only visit to Germany was in 1999, for a series of master classes, but he never performed publicly in Germany.

Stern was married three times. His first marriage, in 1948 to ballerina Nora Kaye, ended in divorce after 18 months, but the two of them remained friends. On August 17, 1951, he married Vera Lindenblit (1927–2015). They had three children together, including conductors Michael and David Stern and also Rabbi Shira Stern, one of the first female rabbis in the USA. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1994 after 43 years. In 1996, Stern married his third wife, Linda Reynolds. His third wife, his three children, and his five grandchildren survived him.

Stern died September 22, 2001, of heart failure in a Manhattan, New York, hospital after an extended stay.

==Music career==
In 1940, Stern began performing with Russian-born pianist Alexander Zakin, collaborating until 1977. Within musical circles, Stern became renowned both for his recordings and for championing certain younger players. Among his discoveries were cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Jian Wang, and violinists Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman.

In the 1960s, he played a major role in saving New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall from demolition, by organizing the Citizens&#x27; Committee to Save Carnegie Hall. Following the purchase of Carnegie Hall by New York City, the Carnegie Hall Corporation was formed, and Stern was chosen as its first president, a title he held until his death. Carnegie Hall later named its main auditorium in his honor.

Among Stern&#x27;s many recordings are concertos by Brahms, Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Vivaldi and modern works by Barber, Bartók, Stravinsky, Bernstein, Rochberg, and Dutilleux. The Dutilleux concerto, entitled &quot;L&#x27;arbre des songes&quot; [&quot;The Tree of Dreams&quot;] was a 1985 commission by Stern himself. He also dubbed actors&#x27; violin-playing in several films, such as the 1971 film adaptation of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

Stern served as musical advisor for the 1946 film &quot;Humoresque&quot;, about a rising violin star and his patron, played respectively by John Garfield and Joan Crawford. He was also the featured violin soloist on the soundtrack for the film adaptation of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. In 1999, he appeared in the film &quot;Music of the Heart&quot;, along with Itzhak Perlman and several other famed violinists, with a youth orchestra led by Meryl Streep (the film was based on the true story of a gifted violin teacher in Harlem who eventually took her musicians to play a concert in Carnegie Hall).
In his autobiography, co-authored with Chaim Potok, &quot;My First 79 Years&quot;, Stern cited Nathan Milstein and Arthur Grumiaux as major influences on his style of playing.

He won Grammys for his work with Eugene Istomin and Leonard Rose in their famous chamber music trio in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, while also continuing his duo work with Alexander Zakin during this time. Stern recorded a series of piano quartets in the 1980s and 1990s with Emanuel Ax, Jaime Laredo and Yo-Yo Ma, including those of Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann and Fauré, winning another Grammy in 1992 for the Brahms quartets Opp. 25 and 26.

In 1979, seven years after Richard Nixon made the first official visit by a US president to the country, the People&#x27;s Republic of China offered Stern and pianist David Golub an unprecedented invitation to tour the country. While there, he collaborated with the China Central Symphony Society (now China National Symphony) under the direction of conductor Li Delun. Their visit was filmed and resulted in the Oscar-winning documentary, &quot;From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China&quot;.

==Ties to Israel==
Stern maintained close ties with Israel. Stern began performing in the country in 1949. In 1973, he performed for wounded Israeli soldiers during the Yom Kippur War. During the 1991 Gulf War and Iraq&#x27;s Scud missile attacks on Israel, he had been playing in the Jerusalem Theater. During his performance, an air raid siren sounded, causing the audience to panic. Stern then stepped onto the stage and began playing a movement of Bach. The audience then calmed down, donned gas masks, and sat throughout the rest of his performance. Stern was a supporter of several educational projects in Israel, among them the America-Israel Foundation and the Jerusalem Music Center.

==Instruments==

Stern&#x27;s favorite instrument was the Ysaÿe Guarnerius, one of the violins produced by the Cremonese luthier Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù. It had previously been played by the violin virtuoso and composer Eugène Ysaÿe.

Among other instruments, Stern played the &quot;Kruse-Vormbaum&quot; Stradivarius (1728), the &quot;ex-Stern&quot; Bergonzi (1733), the &quot;Panette&quot; Guarneri del Gesù (1737), a Michele Angelo Bergonzi (1739–1757), the &quot;Arma Senkrah&quot; Guadagnini (1750), a Giovanni Guadagnini (1754), a J. B. Vuillaume copy of the &quot;Panette&quot; Guarneri del Gesu of 1737 (c.1850), and the &quot;ex-Nicolas I&quot; J.B. Vuillaume (1840). He also owned two contemporary instruments by Samuel Zygmuntowicz and modern Italian Jago Peternella Violins.

In May 2003, Stern&#x27;s collection of instruments, bows and musical ephemera was sold through Tarisio Auctions. The auction set a number of world records and was at the time the second highest grossing violin auction of all time, with total sales of over $3.3M.

<text>In mathematics, an integral is the continuous analog of a sum, which is used to calculate areas, volumes, and their generalizations. Integration, the process of computing an integral, is one of the two fundamental operations of calculus, the other being differentiation. Integration was initially used to solve problems in mathematics and physics, such as finding the area under a curve, or determining displacement from velocity. Usage of integration expanded to a wide variety of scientific fields thereafter.

A definite integral computes the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an &quot;antiderivative&quot;, a function whose derivative is the given function; in this case, they are also called &quot;indefinite integrals&quot;. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integration to differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known; differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical slabs. In the early 20th century, Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann&#x27;s formulation by introducing what is now referred to as the Lebesgue integral; it is more general than Riemann&#x27;s in the sense that a wider class of functions are Lebesgue-integrable.

Integrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the domain over which the integration is performed. For example, a line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting two points in space. In a surface integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a surface in three-dimensional space.

== History ==
=== Pre-calculus integration ===
The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the method of exhaustion of the ancient Greek astronomer Eudoxus and philosopher Democritus (&quot;ca.&quot; 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known. This method was further developed and employed by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.

A similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by Liu Hui, who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians Zu Chongzhi and Zu Geng to find the volume of a sphere.

In the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as Alhazen ( AD) derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers. Alhazen determined the equations to calculate the area enclosed by the curve represented by formula_1 (which translates to the integral formula_2 in contemporary notation), for any given non-negative integer value of formula_3. He used the results to carry out what would now be called an integration of this function, where the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.

The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of Cavalieri with his method of indivisibles, and work by Fermat, began to lay the foundations of modern calculus, with Cavalieri computing the integrals of up to degree in Cavalieri&#x27;s quadrature formula. The case &quot;n&quot; = −1 required the invention of a function, the hyperbolic logarithm, achieved by quadrature of the hyperbola in 1647.

Further steps were made in the early 17th century by Barrow and Torricelli, who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and differentiation. Barrow provided the first proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Wallis generalized Cavalieri&#x27;s method, computing integrals of to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.

=== Leibniz and Newton ===
The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the fundamental theorem of calculus by Leibniz and Newton. The theorem demonstrates a connection between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive mathematical framework that both Leibniz and Newton developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus, it allowed for precise analysis of functions with continuous domains. This framework eventually became modern calculus, whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.

=== Formalization ===
While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of rigour. Bishop Berkeley memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them &quot;ghosts of departed quantities&quot;. Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of limits. Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by Riemann. Although all bounded piecewise continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions were considered—particularly in the context of Fourier analysis—to which Riemann&#x27;s definition does not apply, and Lebesgue formulated a different definition of integral, founded in measure theory (a subfield of real analysis). Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann&#x27;s and Lebesgue&#x27;s approaches, were proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the standard part of an infinite Riemann sum, based on the hyperreal number system.

=== Historical notation ===
The notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675. He adapted the integral symbol, ∫, from the letter &quot;ſ&quot; (long s), standing for &quot;summa&quot; (written as &quot;ſumma&quot;; Latin for &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;total&quot;). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral sign, was first used by Joseph Fourier in &quot;Mémoires&quot; of the French Academy around 1819–1820, reprinted in his book of 1822.

Isaac Newton used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with or , which are used to indicate differentiation, and the box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.

=== First use of the term ===
The term was first printed in Latin by Jacob Bernoulli in 1690: &quot;Ergo et horum Integralia aequantur&quot;.

== Terminology and notation ==
In general, the integral of a real-valued function with respect to a real variable on an interval is written as
:formula_4
The integral sign represents integration. The symbol , called the differential of the variable , indicates that the variable of integration is . The function is called the &quot;integrand&quot;, the points and are called the limits (or bounds) of integration, and the integral is said to be over the interval , called the interval of integration. 
A function is said to be if its integral over its domain is finite. If limits are specified, the integral is called a definite integral.

When the limits are omitted, as in

: formula_5

the integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the antiderivative) whose derivative is the integrand. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates the evaluation of definite integrals to indefinite integrals. There are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article).

In advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out when only the simple Riemann integral is being used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write formula_6 to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof.

==Interpretations==

Integrals appear in many practical situations. For instance, from the length, width and depth of a swimming pool which is rectangular with a flat bottom, one can determine the volume of water it can contain, the area of its surface, and the length of its edge. But if it is oval with a rounded bottom, integrals are required to find exact and rigorous values for these quantities. In each case, one may divide the sought quantity into infinitely many infinitesimal pieces, then sum the pieces to achieve an accurate approximation.

As another example, to find the area of the region bounded by the graph of the function formula_7 between and , one can divide the interval into five pieces (), then construct rectangles using the right end height of each piece (thus ) and sum their areas to get the approximation

:formula_8
which is larger than the exact value. Alternatively, when replacing these subintervals by ones with the left end height of each piece, the approximation one gets is too low: with twelve such subintervals the approximated area is only 0.6203. However, when the number of pieces increases to infinity, it will reach a limit which is the exact value of the area sought (in this case, ). One writes

:formula_9
which means is the result of a weighted sum of function values, , multiplied by the infinitesimal step widths, denoted by , on the interval .

==Formal definitions==
There are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but are also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.

=== Riemann integral ===

The Riemann integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums of functions with respect to &quot;tagged partitions&quot; of an interval. A tagged partition of a closed interval on the real line is a finite sequence

: formula_10

This partitions the interval into sub-intervals indexed by , each of which is &quot;tagged&quot; with a specific point . A &quot;Riemann sum&quot; of a function with respect to such a tagged partition is defined as

: formula_11

thus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the chosen point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the width of sub-interval, . The &quot;mesh&quot; of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the partition, . The &quot;Riemann integral&quot; of a function over the interval is equal to if:

: For all formula_12 there exists formula_13 such that, for any tagged partition formula_14 with mesh less than formula_15,

: formula_16

When the chosen tags are the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of the function in each interval, the Riemann sum becomes an upper (respectively, lower) Darboux sum, suggesting the close connection between the Riemann integral and the Darboux integral.

=== Lebesgue integral ===
It is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated.

Such an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the integral of a function should remain the same. Thus Henri Lebesgue introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining this integral thus in a letter to Paul Montel:

As Folland puts it, &quot;To compute the Riemann integral of , one partitions the domain into subintervals&quot;, while in the Lebesgue integral, &quot;one is in effect partitioning the range of &quot;. The definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a measure, μ. In the simplest case, the Lebesgue measure of an interval is its width, , so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the (proper) Riemann integral when both exist. In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.

Using the &quot;partitioning the range of &quot; philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function should be the sum over of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between and . This area is just . Let . The Lebesgue integral of is then defined by

: formula_17

where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral ( is a strictly decreasing positive function, and therefore has a well-defined improper Riemann integral). For a suitable class of functions (the measurable functions) this defines the Lebesgue integral.

A general measurable function is Lebesgue-integrable if the sum of the absolute values of the areas of the regions between the graph of and the -axis is finite:

: formula_18

In that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the -axis and the area below the -axis:

: formula_19

where

: formula_20

=== Other integrals ===
Although the Riemann and Lebesgue integrals are the most widely used definitions of the integral, a number of others exist, including:

* The Darboux integral, which is defined by Darboux sums (restricted Riemann sums) yet is equivalent to the Riemann integral. A function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable. Darboux integrals have the advantage of being easier to define than Riemann integrals.
* The Riemann–Stieltjes integral, an extension of the Riemann integral which integrates with respect to a function as opposed to a variable.
* The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral, further developed by Johann Radon, which generalizes both the Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue integrals.
* The Daniell integral, which subsumes the Lebesgue integral and Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral without depending on measures.
* The Haar integral, used for integration on locally compact topological groups, introduced by Alfréd Haar in 1933.
* The Henstock–Kurzweil integral, variously defined by Arnaud Denjoy, Oskar Perron, and (most elegantly, as the gauge integral) Jaroslav Kurzweil, and developed by Ralph Henstock.
* The Khinchin integral, named after Aleksandr Khinchin.
* The Itô integral and Stratonovich integral, which define integration with respect to semimartingales such as Brownian motion.
* The Young integral, which is a kind of Riemann–Stieltjes integral with respect to certain functions of unbounded variation.
* The rough path integral, which is defined for functions equipped with some additional &quot;rough path&quot; structure and generalizes stochastic integration against both semimartingales and processes such as the fractional Brownian motion.
* The Choquet integral, a subadditive or superadditive integral created by the French mathematician Gustave Choquet in 1953.
* The Bochner integral, a generalization of the Lebesgue integral to functions that take values in a Banach space.

==Properties==

===Linearity===
The collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval forms a vector space under the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration

: formula_21

is a linear functional on this vector space. Thus, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking linear combinations, and the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals:

: formula_22

Similarly, the set of real-valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given measure space with measure is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral

: formula_23

is a linear functional on this vector space, so that:

: formula_24

More generally, consider the vector space of all measurable functions on a measure space , taking values in a locally compact complete topological vector space over a locally compact topological field . Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function an element of or the symbol ,

: formula_25

that is compatible with linear combinations. In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of functions whose integral is an element of (i.e. &quot;finite&quot;). The most important special cases arise when is , , or a finite extension of the field of p-adic numbers, and is a finite-dimensional vector space over , and when and is a complex Hilbert space.

Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalization for a certain class of &quot;simple&quot; functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of Daniell for the case of real-valued functions on a set , generalized by Nicolas Bourbaki to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See for an axiomatic characterization of the integral.

=== Inequalities ===
A number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable functions defined on a closed and bounded interval and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).

* &quot;Upper and lower bounds.&quot; An integrable function on , is necessarily bounded on that interval. Thus there are real numbers and so that for all in . Since the lower and upper sums of over are therefore bounded by, respectively, and , it follows that formula_26
* &quot;Inequalities between functions.&quot; If for each in then each of the upper and lower sums of is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of . Thus formula_27 This is a generalization of the above inequalities, as is the integral of the constant function with value over . In addition, if the inequality between functions is strict, then the inequality between integrals is also strict. That is, if for each in , then formula_28
* &quot;Subintervals.&quot; If is a subinterval of and is non-negative for all , then formula_29
* &quot;Products and absolute values of functions.&quot; If and are two functions, then we may consider their pointwise products and powers, and absolute values: formula_30 If is Riemann-integrable on then the same is true for , and formula_31 Moreover, if and are both Riemann-integrable then is also Riemann-integrable, and formula_32 This inequality, known as the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, plays a prominent role in Hilbert space theory, where the left hand side is interpreted as the inner product of two square-integrable functions and on the interval .
* &quot;Hölder&#x27;s inequality&quot;. Suppose that and are two real numbers, with , and and are two Riemann-integrable functions. Then the functions and are also integrable and the following Hölder&#x27;s inequality holds: formula_33 For , Hölder&#x27;s inequality becomes the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
* &quot;Minkowski inequality&quot;. Suppose that is a real number and and are Riemann-integrable functions. Then and are also Riemann-integrable and the following Minkowski inequality holds: formula_34 An analogue of this inequality for Lebesgue integral is used in construction of Lp spaces.

=== Conventions ===
In this section, is a real-valued Riemann-integrable function. The integral

: formula_35

over an interval is defined if . This means that the upper and lower sums of the function are evaluated on a partition whose values are increasing. Geometrically, this signifies that integration takes place &quot;left to right&quot;, evaluating within intervals where an interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values and , the end-points of the interval, are called the limits of integration of . Integrals can also be defined if :&quot;&quot;

:formula_36

With , this implies:

:formula_37

The first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of ; the second says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a point, should be zero. One reason for the first convention is that the integrability of on an interval implies that is integrable on any subinterval , but in particular integrals have the property that if is any element of , then:&quot;&quot;

:formula_38

With the first convention, the resulting relation

: formula_39

is then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of , , and .

== Fundamental theorem of calculus ==
The &quot;fundamental theorem of calculus&quot; is the statement that differentiation and integration are inverse operations: if a continuous function is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is retrieved. An important consequence, sometimes called the &quot;second fundamental theorem of calculus&quot;, allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated.

=== First theorem ===
Let be a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed interval . Let be the function defined, for all in , by

: formula_40

Then, is continuous on , differentiable on the open interval , and

: formula_41

for all in .

=== Second theorem ===
Let be a real-valued function defined on a closed interval [] that admits an antiderivative on . That is, and are functions such that for all in ,

: formula_42

If is integrable on then

: formula_43

== Extensions ==

=== Improper integrals ===
A &quot;proper&quot; Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be defined by considering the limit of a sequence of proper Riemann integrals on progressively larger intervals.

If the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity:

: formula_44

If the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for instance , then again a limit may provide a finite result:

: formula_45

That is, the improper integral is the limit of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration approaches either a specified real number, or , or . In more complicated cases, limits are required at both endpoints, or at interior points.

=== Multiple integration ===
Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the area of the region between the graph of the function and the &quot;x&quot;-axis, the &quot;double integral&quot; of a positive function of two variables represents the volume of the region between the surface defined by the function and the plane that contains its domain. For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real variables, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, and the integral of a function &quot;f&quot; over the rectangle &quot;R&quot; given as the Cartesian product of two intervals formula_46 can be written

: formula_47

where the differential indicates that integration is taken with respect to area. This double integral can be defined using Riemann sums, and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of over the domain &quot;R&quot;. Under suitable conditions (e.g., if &quot;f&quot; is continuous), Fubini&#x27;s theorem states that this integral can be expressed as an equivalent iterated integral

: formula_48

This reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because of this, another notation for the integral over &quot;R&quot; uses a double integral sign:

: formula_49

Integration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function &quot;f&quot;, with respect to volume, over an &quot;n-&quot;dimensional region &quot;D&quot; of formula_50 is denoted by symbols such as:

: formula_51

=== Line integrals and surface integrals ===
The concept of an integral can be extended to more general domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces inside higher-dimensional spaces. Such integrals are known as line integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important applications in physics, as when dealing with vector fields.

A &quot;line integral&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;path integral&quot;) is an integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve. Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed curve it is also called a &quot;contour integral&quot;.

The function to be integrated may be a scalar field or a vector field. The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve (commonly arc length or, for a vector field, the scalar product of the vector field with a differential vector in the curve). This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on intervals. Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example, the fact that work is equal to force, , multiplied by displacement, , may be expressed (in terms of vector quantities) as:

: formula_52

For an object moving along a path in a vector field such as an electric field or gravitational field, the total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving from to . This gives the line integral

: formula_53

A &quot;surface integral&quot; generalizes double integrals to integration over a surface (which may be a curved set in space); it can be thought of as the double integral analog of the line integral. The function to be integrated may be a scalar field or a vector field. The value of the surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.

For an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a vector field on a surface ; that is, for each point in , is a vector. Imagine that a fluid flows through , such that determines the velocity of the fluid at . The flux is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through in unit amount of time. To find the flux, one need to take the dot product of with the unit surface normal to at each point, which will give a scalar field, which is integrated over the surface:

: formula_54

The fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism.

=== Contour integrals ===

In complex analysis, the integrand is a complex-valued function of a complex variable instead of a real function of a real variable . When a complex function is integrated along a curve formula_55 in the complex plane, the integral is denoted as follows

: formula_56

This is known as a contour integral.

=== Integrals of differential forms ===
A differential form is a mathematical concept in the fields of multivariable calculus, differential topology, and tensors. Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the differentials of the coordinates, such as:

: formula_57

where &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;G&quot; are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials &quot;dx&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;, &quot;dz&quot; measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes.

A differential two-form is a sum of the form

: formula_58

Here the basic two-forms formula_59 measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate two-planes. The symbol formula_60 denotes the wedge product, which is similar to the cross product in the sense that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral giving the flux of formula_61.

Unlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The exterior derivative plays the role of the gradient and curl of vector calculus, and Stokes&#x27; theorem simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the divergence theorem, Green&#x27;s theorem, and the Kelvin-Stokes theorem.

=== Summations ===

The discrete equivalent of integration is summation. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of Lebesgue integrals or time-scale calculus.

=== Functional integrals ===

An integration that is performed not over a variable (or, in physics, over a space or time dimension), but over a space of functions, is referred to as a functional integral.

== Applications ==
Integrals are used extensively in many areas. For example, in probability theory, integrals are used to determine the probability of some random variable falling within a certain range. Moreover, the integral under an entire probability density function must equal 1, which provides a test of whether a function with no negative values could be a density function or not.

Integrals can be used for computing the area of a two-dimensional region that has a curved boundary, as well as computing the volume of a three-dimensional object that has a curved boundary. The area of a two-dimensional region can be calculated using the aforementioned definite integral. The volume of a three-dimensional object such as a disc or washer can be computed by disc integration using the equation for the volume of a cylinder, formula_62, where formula_63 is the radius. In the case of a simple disc created by rotating a curve about the -axis, the radius is given by , and its height is the differential . Using an integral with bounds and , the volume of the disc is equal to:formula_64Integrals are also used in physics, in areas like kinematics to find quantities like displacement, time, and velocity. For example, in rectilinear motion, the displacement of an object over the time interval formula_65 is given by
: formula_66

where formula_67 is the velocity expressed as a function of time. The work done by a force formula_68 (given as a function of position) from an initial position formula_69 to a final position formula_70 is:

: formula_71

Integrals are also used in thermodynamics, where thermodynamic integration is used to calculate the difference in free energy between two given states.

==Computation==

===Analytical===
The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the fundamental theorem of calculus. Let be the function of to be integrated over a given interval . Then, find an antiderivative of ; that is, a function such that on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no singularities on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,

:formula_72

Sometimes it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include integration by substitution, integration by parts, integration by trigonometric substitution, and integration by partial fractions.

Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many nonelementary integrals can be expanded in a Taylor series and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using Meijer G-functions can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, Parseval&#x27;s identity can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see Gaussian integral.

Computations of volumes of solids of revolution can usually be done with disk integration or shell integration.

Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the list of integrals.

===Symbolic===
Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive tables of integrals have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to computer algebra systems that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like Macsyma and Maple.

A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a relatively simple function does not have integrals that can be expressed in closed form involving only elementary functions, include rational and exponential functions, logarithm, trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions, and the operations of multiplication and composition. The Risch algorithm provides a general criterion to determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary and to compute the integral if is elementary. However, functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception, and consequently, computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the &#x27;building blocks&#x27; for antiderivatives are fixed in advance, it may still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition and to find the symbolic answer whenever it exists. The Risch algorithm, implemented in Mathematica, Maple and other computer algebra systems, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions, radicals, logarithm, and exponential functions.

Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the special functions (like the Legendre functions, the hypergeometric function, the gamma function, the incomplete gamma function and so on). Extending Risch&#x27;s algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.

More recently a new approach has emerged, using &quot;D&quot;-finite functions, which are the solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are &quot;D&quot;-finite, and the integral of a &quot;D&quot;-finite function is also a &quot;D&quot;-finite function. This provides an algorithm to express the antiderivative of a &quot;D&quot;-finite function as the solution of a differential equation. This theory also allows one to compute the definite integral of a &quot;D&quot;-function as the sum of a series given by the first coefficients and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.

Rule-based integration systems facilitate integration. Rubi, a computer algebra system rule-based integrator, pattern matches an extensive system of symbolic integration rules to integrate a wide variety of integrands. This system uses over 6600 integration rules to compute integrals. The method of brackets is a generalization of Ramanujan&#x27;s master theorem that can be applied to a wide range of univariate and multivariate integrals. A set of rules are applied to the coefficients and exponential terms of the integrand&#x27;s power series expansion to determine the integral. The method is closely related to the Mellin transform.

===Numerical===
Definite integrals may be approximated using several methods of numerical integration. The rectangle method relies on dividing the region under the function into a series of rectangles corresponding to function values and multiplies by the step width to find the sum. A better approach, the trapezoidal rule, replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The trapezoidal rule weights the first and last values by one half, then multiplies by the step width to obtain a better approximation. The idea behind the trapezoidal rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further: Simpson&#x27;s rule approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function.

Riemann sums, the trapezoidal rule, and Simpson&#x27;s rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called the Newton–Cotes formulas. The degree Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on each subinterval by a degree &quot;&quot; polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the function on the interval. Higher degree Newton–Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they require more function evaluations, and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to Runge&#x27;s phenomenon. One solution to this problem is Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature, in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it in terms of Chebyshev polynomials.

Romberg&#x27;s method halves the step widths incrementally, giving trapezoid approximations denoted by , , and so on, where is half of . For each new step size, only half the new function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the previous size. It then interpolate a polynomial through the approximations, and extrapolate to . Gaussian quadrature evaluates the function at the roots of a set of orthogonal polynomials. An -point Gaussian method is exact for polynomials of degree up to .

The computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example, volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as Monte Carlo integration.

===Mechanical===
The area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called planimeter. The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid displaced as the object is submerged.

===Geometrical===

Area can sometimes be found via geometrical compass-and-straightedge constructions of an equivalent square.

===Integration by differentiation===
Kempf, Jackson and Morales demonstrated mathematical relations that allow an integral to be calculated by means of differentiation. Their calculus involves the Dirac delta function and the partial derivative operator formula_73. This can also be applied to functional integrals, allowing them to be computed by functional differentiation.

<doc id="15533" wikidata="Q2672709" url="?curid=15533" title="Zionist political violence">
<text>Zionist political violence refers to acts of political violence or terrorism committed by Zionists in support of establishing and maintaining a Jewish state in Palestine. These actions have been carried out by individuals, paramilitary groups, and the State of Israel and its military forces from the early 20th century to the present day, as part of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In the pre-state period (1920s–1940s), Zionist paramilitaries such as the Irgun, Lehi, Haganah and Palmach engaged in violent campaigns against British authorities, Palestinian Arabs, and more moderate Jews to advance their political goals. Targets included security personnel, government figures, civilians, and infrastructure. After Israel&#x27;s establishment in 1948, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and other state security forces continued to employ violence against Palestinian and neighboring Arab populations during the 1948 war (known by Palestinians as the Nakba, catastrophe), subsequent Arab-Israeli wars, and the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Later acts of Zionist violence have ranged from the government&#x27;s use of force to suppress Palestinian unrest (such as during the intifadas from 1987 to 1993 and 2000-2005), to attacks perpetrated by Israeli settlers and right-wing extremists against Palestinian civilians, property and holy sites. In an act of intra-Jewish political violence, former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by Yigal Amir who opposed Rabin&#x27;s peace initiatives and territorial concessions to the Palestinians. The Israeli military has also conducted large-scale assaults in the occupied territories and neighbouring states including Lebanon, resulting in widespread destruction and civilian casualties.

Human and Palestinian rights organisations have accused Israel of state terrorism, war crimes, and disproportionate use of force against Palestinians. Israel defends its actions as necessary to preserve the security of the Jewish state and its citizens in the face of Palestinian political violence and regional threats. 

==Impact==

Actions were carried out by individuals and Jewish paramilitary groups such as the Irgun, the Lehi, the Haganah and the Palmach as part of a conflict between Jews, British authorities, and Palestinian Arabs, regarding land, immigration, and control over Palestine.

British soldiers and officials, United Nations personnel, Palestinian Arab fighters and civilians, and Jewish fighters and civilians were targets or victims of these actions. Domestic, commercial, and government property, infrastructure, and material have also been attacked.

==Main occurrences==

During the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the 1921 Jaffa riots and the 1929 Palestine riots, Palestinian Arabs manifested hostility against Zionist immigration, which provoked the reaction of Jewish militias. In 1935, the Irgun, a Zionist underground military organization, split off from the Haganah. The Irgun were the armed expression of the nascent ideology of Revisionist Zionism founded by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky. He expressed this ideology as &quot;every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arab and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state&quot;.

During the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Palestinian Arabs fought for the end of the Mandate and the creation of an Arab state based on the whole of Palestine. They attacked both British and Jews as well as some Palestinian Arabs who supported a Pan-Arabism. Mainstream Zionists, represented by the Vaad Leumi and the Haganah, practiced the policy of Havlagah (restraint); Irgun militants did not follow this policy and called themselves &quot;Havlagah breakers.&quot; The Irgun began bombing Palestinian Arab civilian targets in 1938. While the Palestinian Arabs were &quot;carefully disarmed&quot; by the British Mandatory authorities by 1939, the Zionists were not. As a conciliation to the Arabs, the White Paper of 1939 was passed, imposing significant limits in Jewish immigration in the shadow of World War II.

After the British Declaration of War in September 1939, the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine David Ben-Gurion declared: &#x27;We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper.&#x27;; the Haganah and Irgun subsequently suspended their activity against the British in support of their war against Nazi Germany. However, the smaller Lehi continued anti-British attacks and direct action throughout the war. At that time, the British also supported the creation and the training of Palmach, as a unit that could withstand a German offensive in the area, with the consent of the Yishuv which saw an opportunity to get trained units and soldiers for the planned Jewish state and during 1944–1945, the most mainstream Jewish paramilitary organization, Haganah, cooperated with the British authorities against the Lehi and Etzel.

After World War II, between 1945 and the 29 November 1947 Partition vote, British soldiers and policemen were targeted by Irgun and Lehi. The Haganah and Palmach at first collaborated with the British against them, particularly during the Hunting Season, before actively joining them in the Jewish Resistance Movement, then finally choosing an official neutral position after 1946 while the Irgun and the Lehi continued their attacks against the British.

The Haganah, Irgun and Lehi also executed dozens of Jews for alleged treason or collaboration with Britain or Arabs, often after irregular drumhead courts-martial. 

The Haganah also carried out violent attacks in Palestine, such as the liberation of interned immigrants from the Atlit detainee camp, the bombing of the country&#x27;s railroad network, sabotage raids on radar installations and bases of the British Palestine police. It continued to organize illegal immigration throughout the entire war.

In February 1947, the British announced that they would end the mandate and withdraw from Palestine and they asked for the arbitration of the United Nations. After the vote of the Partition Plan for Palestine on 30 November 1947, civil war broke out in Palestine. Jewish and Arab communities fought each other violently in campaigns of attacks, retaliations, and counter-retaliations which provoked around 800 deaths after two months. Arab volunteers entered Palestine to fight alongside the Palestinian Arabs. In April, 6 weeks before the termination of the Mandate, the Jewish militias launched wide operations to control the territory dedicated to them by the Partition Plan. Many atrocities occurred during this time. The Arab population in the mixed cities of Tiberias, Safed, Haifa and Jaffa, as well as Beisan and Acre and in the neighbouring villages, fled or were expelled during this period. During the Battle for Jerusalem (1948) where the Jewish community of 100,000 people was besieged, most Arab villages of the Tel Aviv – Jerusalem corridor were captured by Jewish militias and leveled.

At the beginning of the civil war, the Jewish militias organized several bombing attacks against civilians and military Arab targets. On 12 December, Irgun placed a car bomb opposite the Damascus Gate, killing 20 people. On 4 January 1948, the Lehi detonated a lorry bomb against the headquarters of the paramilitary Najjada located in Jaffa&#x27;s Town Hall, killing 15 Arabs and injuring 80. During the night between 5 and 6 January, the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel in Jerusalem that had been reported to hide Arab militiamen, killing 24 people. The next day, Irgun members in a stolen police van rolled a barrel bomb into a large group of civilians who were waiting for a bus by the Jaffa Gate, killing around 16. Another Irgun bomb went off in the Ramla market on February 18, killing 7 residents and injuring 45. On 28 February, the Palmah organised a bombing attack against a garage in Haifa, killing 30 people.

In 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was the Prime Minister of Israel who was assassinated by Yigal Amir after a peace rally. Amir had been opposed to Rabin&#x27;s peace initiative, which included signing the Oslo Accords and withdrawing from the West Bank. He believed that Rabin was a rodef, meaning a &quot;pursuer&quot; who endangered Jewish lives, and that he was justified in removing Rabin as a threat to Jews in the territories according to the concept of din rodef (&quot;law of the pursuer&quot;), which is a part of traditional Jewish law.

==Condemnation as terrorism==

Irgun was described as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, British, and United States governments, and in media such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper, and by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In 1946, The World Zionist Congress strongly condemned terrorist activities in Palestine and &quot;the shedding of innocent blood as a means of political warfare&quot;. Irgun was specifically condemned.

Menachem Begin was called a terrorist and a fascist by Albert Einstein and 27 other prominent Jewish intellectuals in a letter to the New York Times which was published on December 4, 1948. Specifically condemned was the participation of the Irgun in the Deir Yassin massacre:

*&quot;terrorist bands attacked this peaceful village, which was not a military objective in the fighting, killed most of its inhabitants – 240 men, women and children – and kept a few of them alive to parade as captives through the streets of Jerusalem.&quot;

The letter warns American Jews against supporting Begin&#x27;s request for funding of his political party Herut, and ends with the warning:
*&quot;The discrepancies between the bold claims now being made by Begin and his party and their record of past performance in Palestine bear the imprint of no ordinary political party. This is the unmistakable stamp of a Fascist party for whom terrorism (against Jews, Arabs, and British alike), and misrepresentation are means, and a &quot;Leader State&quot; is the goal.&quot;

Lehi was described as a terrorist organization by the British authorities and United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche.

==Jewish public opinion==
During the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine before the war, the criterion of &quot;Purity of arms&quot; was used to distinguish between the respective attitudes of the Irgun and Haganah towards Arabs, with the latter priding itself on its adherence to principle. The Jewish society in the British Mandate Palestine generally disapproved and denounced violent attacks both on grounds of moral rejection and political disagreement, stressing that terrorism is counter-productive in the Zionist quest for Jewish self-determination. Generally speaking, this precept requires that &quot;weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people&quot;. But if it &quot;remained a central value in education&quot; it was &quot;rather vague and intentionally blurred&quot; at the practical level.

In 1946, at a meeting held between the heads of the Haganah, David Ben-Gurion predicted a confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. Concerning the &quot;principle of purity of arms&quot;, he stressed that: &quot;The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds&quot; and during the 1948 War, the Mapam, the political party affiliated to Palmach, asked &quot;a strict observance of the Jewish Purity of arms to secure the moral character of [the] war&quot;. When he was later criticized by Mapam members for his attitude concerning the Arab refugee problem, Ben-Gurion reminded them of the Palestinian expulsion from Lydda and Ramle and the fact Palmah officers had been responsible for the &quot;outrage that had encouraged the Arabs&#x27; flight made the party uncomfortable.&quot;

According to Avi Shlaim, this condemnation of the use of violence is one of the key features of &#x27;the conventional Zionist account or old history&#x27; whose &#x27;popular-heroic-moralistic version&#x27; is &#x27;taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad&#x27;. Benny Morris adds that &#x27;[t]he Israelis&#x27; collective memory of fighters characterized by &quot;purity of arms&quot; is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen cases] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.&#x27; According to him, &#x27;after the 1948 war, the Israelis tended to hail the &quot;purity of arms&quot; of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.&#x27; According to him, &#x27;this reinforced the Israelis&#x27; positive self-image and helped them &quot;sell&quot; the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy&#x27;.

Some Israelis justify acts of political violence. Sixty years after participating in the assassination of Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte, Geulah Cohen had no regrets. As a broadcaster on Lehi&#x27;s radio, she recalled the threats against Bernadotte in advance of the assassination. &quot;I told him if you are not going to leave Jerusalem and go to your Stockholm, you won&#x27;t be any more.&quot; Asked if it was right to assassinate Bernadotte, she replied, &quot;There is no question about it. We would not have Jerusalem any more.&quot; In July 2006, the Menachem Begin Heritage Center organized a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the King David Hotel bombing. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former members of Irgun. The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested that a plaque commemorating the bombing stated &quot;For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated.&quot; Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians since Irgun sent warnings to evacuate the building. He said &quot;Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, &#x27;We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.&#x27; They don&#x27;t do that. That is the difference.&quot; The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying &quot;We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated&quot;, and wrote to the Mayor of Jerusalem that such an &quot;act of terror&quot; could not be honored. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, pointing out that the statement on it accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and &quot;did not absolve those who planted the bomb.&quot; To prevent a diplomatic incident, changes were made in the plaque&#x27;s text. The final English version says &quot;Warning phone calls have been made to the hotel, The Palestine Post and the French Consulate, urging the hotel&#x27;s occupants to leave immediately. The hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded. To the Irgun&#x27;s regret, 92 persons were killed.&quot;

<text>An airport is an aerodrome with facilities for flights to take off and land. Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a control tower. An airport consists of a landing area, which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a runway for a plane to take off or a helipad, and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, hangars and terminals.

An airport with a helipad for rotorcraft but no runway is called a heliport. An airport for use by seaplanes and amphibious aircraft is called a seaplane base. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for takeoffs and landings, and seaplane docks for tying-up. An international airport has additional facilities for customs and immigration.
