<text>Jack Laurence Chalker (December 17, 1944 – February 11, 2005) was an American science fiction author. Chalker was also a Baltimore City Schools history teacher in Maryland for 12 years, retiring during 1978 to write full-time. He also was a member of the Washington Science Fiction Association and was involved in the founding of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society.

==Career and family life==

Chalker was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. Some of his books said that he was born in Norfolk, Virginia although he later claimed that was a mistake; he attended high school at the Baltimore City College. Chalker earned a BA degree in English from Towson University in Towson, Maryland, where he was a theater critic for the school newspaper, &quot;The Towerlight&quot;. During 2003, Towson University named Chalker their Liberal Arts Alumnus of the Year. He received a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Chalker intended to become a lawyer, but financial problems caused him to become a teacher instead. He taught history and geography in the Baltimore City Public Schools from 1966 to 1978, most notably at Baltimore City College and the now defunct Southwestern Senior High School. Chalker lectured on science fiction and technology at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and numerous universities.

Chalker was a member of the Maryland Air National Guard&#x27;s 135th Special Operations Group, where he was a member of the group information office. He was deployed into Baltimore during the Baltimore riot of 1968.

Chalker was married in 1978 and had two children, David, a game designer, and Samantha, a computer security consultant.

Chalker&#x27;s hobbies included esoteric audio, travel, and working on science-fiction convention committees. He also had a great interest in ferryboats; at his fiancée&#x27;s suggestion, their marriage was performed on the Roaring Bull boat, part of the Millersburg Ferry, in the middle of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.
==Science fiction==
Chalker joined the Washington Science Fiction Association during 1958, and during 1963 he and two friends founded the Baltimore Science Fiction Society. Chalker attended every World Science Fiction Convention, except one, from 1965 until 2004. He published an amateur SF journal, &quot;Mirage&quot;, from 1960 to 1971 (a finalist nominee for the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine), producing ten issues. Another journal, &quot;Interjection&quot;, was published 1968–1987 in association with the Fantasy Amateur Press Association. Chalker also initiated a publishing house, Mirage Press, Ltd., for releasing nonfiction and bibliographic works concerning science fiction and fantasy.

Chalker&#x27;s awards included the Daedalus Award (1983), The Gold Medal of the West Coast Review of Books (1984), Skylark Award (1980), and the Hamilton-Brackett Memorial Award (1979). He was twice a nominee for the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and for the Hugo Award twice. Chalker was posthumously awarded the Phoenix Award by the Southern Fandom Confederation on April 9, 2005.

Chalker was a three-term treasurer of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Chalker was also the co-author (with Mark Owings) of &quot;The Science Fantasy Publishers&quot; (third edition during 1991, updated annually), published by Mirage Press, Ltd, a bibliographic guide to genre small press publishers which was a Hugo Award nominee during 1992. The Maryland Young Writers Contest, sponsored by the Baltimore Science Fiction Society, was renamed &quot;&#x27;The Jack L. Chalker Young Writers Contest&quot; effective April 8, 2006.

===Novels===
Chalker is best known for his &quot;Well World&quot; series of novels, but he also wrote many other novels (most, but not all, part of a series, or large novels which were split into &#x27;series&#x27; by the publishers), and at least nine short stories.

Many of Chalker&#x27;s works involve some physical transformation of the main characters. For instance, in the &quot;Well World&quot; novels, immigrants to the Well World are transformed from their original form to become a member of one of the 1,560 sentient species that inhabit that artificial planet. Another example would be that the &quot;Wonderland Gambit&quot; series resembles traditional Buddhist jataka-type reincarnation stories set in a science fiction environment. Samantha Chalker announced that &quot;Wonderland Gambit&quot; might be made into a movie, but supposedly its close resemblance to &quot;The Matrix&quot; resulted in the project being canceled.

At the time of his death, Chalker left one unfinished novel, &quot;Chameleon&quot;. He was planning to write another novel, &quot;Ripsaw&quot;, after &quot;Chameleon&quot;.
==Illness and death==

On September 18, 2003, during Hurricane Isabel, Chalker passed out and was taken to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a coronary occlusion. He was later released, but was severely weakened. On December 6, 2004, he was again taken to hospital with breathing problems and disorientation, and was diagnosed with a skin infection. Chalker was hospitalized in critical condition, then upgraded to stable condition on December 9, although he did not regain consciousness until December 15. After several more weeks in deteriorating condition and in a persistent vegetative state, with several transfers to different hospitals, Chalker died on February 11, 2005, of kidney failure and sepsis at Bon Secours Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.

Some of Chalker&#x27;s remains are interred in the family plot at Loudon Park Cemetery in Baltimore. The remainder were distributed off the ferry between Hainan Island and the Chinese mainland, a ferry in Vietnam, White&#x27;s Ferry on the Potomac River in Virginia on Father&#x27;s Day 2007, and on author H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s grave in Providence, Rhode Island on December 17, 2005.

<text>James Benjamin Blish () was an American science fiction and fantasy writer. He is best known for his &quot;Cities in Flight&quot; novels and his series of &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelizations written with his wife, J. A. Lawrence. His novel &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot; won the Hugo Award. He is credited with creating the term &quot;gas giant&quot; to refer to large planetary bodies.

His first published stories appeared in &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; and &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

Blish wrote literary criticism of science fiction using the pen name William Atheling Jr. His other pen names included Donald Laverty, John MacDougal, and Arthur Lloyd Merlyn.
== Life ==
Blish was born on May 23, 1921, at East Orange, New Jersey. While in high school, Blish self-published a fanzine, called &quot;The Planeteer&quot;, using a hectograph. The fanzine ran for six issues. 

Blish was a member of the Futurians.

Blish attended meetings of the Futurian Science Fiction Society in New York City during this period.
Futurian members Damon Knight and Cyril M. Kornbluth became close friends. However, Blish&#x27;s relationships with other members were often bitter. A personal target was fellow member Judith Merril, with whom he would debate politics. Merril would frequently dismiss Blish&#x27;s self-description of being a &quot;paper fascist&quot;. She wrote in &quot;Better to Have Loved&quot; (2002), &quot;Of course [Blish] was not fascist, antisemitic, or any of those terrible things, but every time he used the phrase, I saw red.&quot;
Blish studied microbiology at Rutgers University, graduating in 1942. He was drafted into Army service, and he served briefly as a medical laboratory technician. The United States Army discharged him for refusing orders to clean a grease trap in 1944. Following discharge, Blish entered Columbia University as a masters student of zoology. He did not complete the program, opting to write fiction full-time.

In 1947, he married Virginia Kidd, a fellow Futurian. They divorced in 1963. Blish then married artist J. A. Lawrence in 1964, moving to England that same year.

From 1962 to 1968, Blish worked for the Tobacco Institute as a writer and critic. Much of his work for the institute went uncredited.

Blish died on July 30, 1975, from complications related to lung cancer. He was buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. The Bodleian Library at Oxford is the custodian of Blish&#x27;s papers. The library also has a complete catalog of Blish&#x27;s published works.

== Career ==
Throughout the 1940s, Blish published most of his stories in the few pulp magazines still in circulation. His first story was sold to fellow Futurian Frederik Pohl for &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; (1940), called &quot;Emergency Refueling&quot;. Other stories were published intermittently, but with little circulation. Blish&#x27;s &quot;Chaos, Co-Ordinated&quot;, co-written with Robert A. W. Lowndes, was sold to &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, appearing in the October 1946 issue, earning Blish national circulation for the first time.

=== Pantropy (1942–1956) ===
Blish was what Andrew Litpack called a &quot;practical writer&quot;. He would revisit, revise, and often expand on previously written stories. An example is &quot;Sunken Universe&quot; published in &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; in 1942. The story reappeared in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; as &quot;Surface Tension&quot;, in an altered form in 1952. The premise emphasized Blish&#x27;s understanding of microbiology, and featured microscopic humans engineered to live on a hostile planet&#x27;s shallow pools of water. The story proved to be among Blish&#x27;s more popular and was anthologized in the first volume of Robert Silverberg &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame&quot;. It was also anthologized in &quot;The Big Book of Science Fiction&quot; (2016), edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer.

The world of microscopic humans continued in &quot;The Thing in the Attic&quot; in 1954, and &quot;Watershed&quot; the following year. The fourth entry, &quot;A Time to Survive&quot;, was published by &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in 1957. The stories were collected, edited together, and published as the fix-up &quot;The Seedling Stars&quot; (1956), by Gnome Press. John Clute said all of Blish&#x27;s &quot;deeply felt work&quot; explored &quot;confronting the Faustian (or Frankensteinian) man&quot;.

=== &quot;Cities in Flight&quot; (1950–1958) ===

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; asserts that not until the 1950s, and the Okie sequence of stories beginning their run, &quot;did it become clear [Blish] would become a [science fiction] writer of unusual depth&quot;. The stories were loosely based on the Okie migration following the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and were influenced by Oswald Spengler&#x27;s two-part &quot;Der Untergang des Abendlandes&quot; (&quot;The Decline of the West&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

The stories detail the life of the Okies, humans who migrate throughout space looking for work in vast city-ships, powered by spindizzies, a type of anti-gravity engine. The premise and plot reflected Blish&#x27;s feelings on the state of western civilization, and his personal politics. The first two stories, &quot;Okie&quot;, and &quot;Bindlestiff&quot;, were published in 1950, by &quot;Astounding&quot;. &quot;Sargasso of Lost Cities&quot; appeared in &quot;Two Complete Science-Adventure Books&quot; in April 1953. &quot;Earthman, Come Home&quot; followed a few months later, published by &quot;Astounding&quot;. In 1955, Blish collected the four stories together into an omnibus titled &quot;Earthman, Come Home&quot;, published by Putnam.

More stories followed: In 1956, &quot;They Shall Have Stars&quot;, which edited together &quot;Bridge&quot; and &quot;At Death&#x27;s End&quot;, and in 1958, Blish published &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot;. Four years later, he published a new Okies novel, &quot;A Life for the Stars&quot;. The Okies sequence was edited together and published as &quot;Cities In Flight&quot; (1970).

Clute notes, &quot;the brilliance of &quot;Cities in Flight&quot; does not lie in the assemblage of its parts, but in the momentum of the ideas embodied in it (albeit sometimes obscurely).&quot;
=== &quot;After Such Knowledge&quot; (1958–1971) ===
Blish continued to rework older stories, and did so for one of his best known works, &quot;A Case of Conscience&quot; (1958). The novel originated as a novella, originally published in an issue of &quot;If&quot;, in 1953. The story follows a Jesuit priest, Ramon Ruiz-Sanchez, who visits the planet Lithia as a technical member of an expedition. While on the planet they discover a race of bipedal reptilians that have perfected morality in what Ruiz-Sanchez says is &quot;the absence of God&quot;, and theological complications ensue. The book is one of the first major works in the genre to explore religion and its implications. It was the first of a series including &quot;Doctor Mirabilis&quot; (1964) and the two-part story &quot;Black Easter&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Day After Judgment&quot; (1971). The latter two were collected as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Day&quot; (1980). An omnibus of all four entries in the series was published by Legend in 1991, titled &quot;After Such Knowledge&quot;.

&quot;A Case of Conscience&quot; won the 1959 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and was collected as part of Library of America&#x27;s omnibus &quot;American Science Fiction: Five Classic Novels 1956-1958&quot;.

=== &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1967–1977) ===

Bantam Books commissioned Blish to adapt episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The adapted short stories were generally based on draft scripts and contained different plot elements from the aired television episodes.

The stories were collected into twelve volumes and published as a title series of the same name from 1967 to 1977. The adaptations were largely written by Blish; however, his declining health during this period proved problematic. His wife, J. A. Lawrence, wrote a number of installments. Her work remained uncredited until the final volume, &quot;Star Trek 12&quot;, published in 1977, two years after Blish&#x27;s death.

The first original novel for adults based on the television series, &quot;Spock Must Die!&quot; (1970), was also written by Blish, and he planned to release more. According to Lawrence, two episodes featuring popular character Harry Mudd, &quot;I, Mudd&quot; and &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot;, were held back by Blish for adaptation to be included in the follow-up to &quot;Spock Must Die!&quot;. However, Blish died before a novel could be completed. Lawrence did eventually adapt the two episodes, as &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1978), which included an original novella &quot;The Business, as Usual, During Altercations&quot; by Lawrence. In her introduction to &quot;Star Trek 12&quot;, Lawrence states that Blish &quot;did indeed write&quot; adaptations of the two episodes. The introduction to &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Angels&quot; acknowledges this, stating that Blish left the two stories in various stages of completion and they were finished by Lawrence; Blish does not receive author credit on the book.

Blish credited his financial stability later in life to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; commission and the advance he received for &quot;Spock Must Die!&quot;.

== Literary criticism and legacy ==
Blish was among the first literary critics of science fiction, and he judged works in the genre by the standards applied to &quot;serious&quot; literature. He took to task his fellow authors for deficiencies, such as bad grammar and a misunderstanding of scientific concepts, and the magazine editors who accepted and published such material without editorial intervention. His criticism was published in &quot;fanzines&quot; in the 1950s under the pseudonym William Atheling Jr.

The essays were collected in &quot;The Issue at Hand&quot; (1964) and &quot;More Issues at Hand&quot; (1970). Reviewing &quot;The Issue at Hand&quot;, Algis Budrys said that Atheling had, along with Damon Knight, &quot;transformed the reviewer&#x27;s trade in this field&quot;. He described the persona of Atheling as &quot;acidulous, assertive, categorical, conscientious and occasionally idiosyncratic&quot;.

Blish was a fan of the works of James Branch Cabell, and for a time edited &quot;Kalki&quot;, the journal of the Cabell Society.

In his works of science fiction, Blish developed many ideas and terms which have influenced other writers and on occasion have been adopted more widely, such as faster than light communication via the Dirac communicator, introduced in the short story &quot;Beep&quot; (1954). The Dirac is comparable to Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s ansible.

Blish is also credited with coining the term gas giant, first used in the story &quot;Solar Plexus&quot;, collected in the anthology &quot;Beyond Human Ken&quot;, edited by Judith Merril. The story was originally published in 1941, but did not contain the term. Blish reworked the story, changing the description of a large magnetic field to &quot;a magnetic field of some strength nearby, one that didn&#x27;t belong to the invisible &quot;gas giant&quot; revolving half a million miles away&quot;.

== Honors, awards and recognition ==
The British Science Fiction Foundation inaugurated the James Blish Award for science fiction criticism in 1977, recognizing Brian W. Aldiss. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 2002.

== Bibliography ==
Blish&#x27;s work was published by a variety of publishers in the United Kingdom and the United States, often with variations between editions, and with different titles. Blish also expanded and re-published his older work on numerous occasions. His works continued to be re-published after his death.

<doc id="15950" wikidata="Q11813" url="?curid=15950" title="James Madison">
<text>James Madison (June 28, 1836) was an American statesman, diplomat, and Founding Father who served as the fourth president of the United States from 1809 to 1817. Madison was popularly acclaimed the &quot;Father of the Constitution&quot; for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.

Madison was born into a prominent slave-owning planter family in Virginia. In 1774, strongly opposed to British taxation, Madison joined with the Patriots. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress during and after the American Revolutionary War. Dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the Articles of Confederation, he helped organize the Constitutional Convention, which produced a new constitution designed to strengthen republican government against democratic assembly. Madison&#x27;s Virginia Plan was the basis for the convention&#x27;s deliberations. He became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution and joined Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in writing &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, a series of pro-ratification essays that remain prominent among works of political science in American history. Madison emerged as an important leader in the House of Representatives and was a close adviser to President George Washington. During the early 1790s, Madison opposed the economic program and the accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Alongside Thomas Jefferson, he organized the Democratic–Republican Party in opposition to Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist Party. Madison served as Jefferson&#x27;s Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809, during which time he helped convince Jefferson to submit the Louisiana Purchase Treaty for approval by the Senate.

Madison was elected president in 1808. Motivated by a desire to acquire land held by Britain, Spain, and Native Americans, and after diplomatic protests with a trade embargo failed to end British seizures of American-shipped goods, Madison led the United States into the War of 1812. Although the war ended inconclusively, many Americans viewed it as a successful &quot;second war of independence&quot; against Britain. Madison was re-elected in 1812. The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government. He presided over the creation of the Second Bank of the United States and the enactment of the protective Tariff of 1816. By treaty or through war, Native American tribes ceded of land to the United States during Madison&#x27;s presidency.

Retiring from public office at the end of his presidency in 1817, Madison returned to his plantation, Montpelier, where he died in 1836. Madison was a slave owner; he freed one slave in 1783 to prevent a slave rebellion at Montpelier but did not free any in his will. Historians regard Madison as one of the most significant Founding Fathers of the United States, and have generally ranked him as an above-average president, although they are critical of his endorsement of slavery and his leadership during the War of 1812. Madison&#x27;s name is commemorated in many landmarks across the nation, with prominent examples including Madison Square Garden, James Madison University, the James Madison Memorial Building, the capitol city of Wisconsin, and the .
==Early life and education==

James Madison Jr. was born on March 16, 1751 (March 5, 1750, Old Style), at Belle Grove Plantation near Port Conway in the Colony of Virginia, to James Madison Sr. and Eleanor Madison. His family had lived in Virginia since the mid-17th century. Madison&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Francis Conway, was a prominent planter and tobacco merchant. His father was a tobacco planter who grew up on a plantation, then called Mount Pleasant, which he inherited upon reaching adulthood. With an estimated 100 slaves and a plantation, Madison&#x27;s father was among the largest landowners in Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont.

In the early 1760s, the Madison family moved into a newly built house that they named Montpelier. Madison was the oldest of twelve children, with seven brothers and four sisters, though only six lived to adulthood: brothers Francis, Ambrose, and William, and sisters Nelly, Sarah, and Frances. Ambrose helped to manage Montpelier for his father and older brother until he died in 1793.
From ages 11 to 16, Madison studied under Donald Robertson, a tutor for several prominent Southern families. Madison learned mathematics, geography, and modern and classical languages, becoming exceptionally proficient in Latin. At age 16, Madison returned to Montpelier, where he studied under the Reverend Thomas Martin to prepare for college. Unlike most college-bound Virginians of his day, Madison did not attend the College of William and Mary, as the lowland Williamsburg climate—thought to be more likely to harbor infectious disease—might have impacted his health. Instead, in 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University).
His college studies included Latin, Greek, theology, and the works of the Enlightenment, and emphasized speech and debate. Madison was a leading member of the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, which competed on campus with a political counterpart, the Cliosophic Society. During his time at Princeton, Madison&#x27;s closest friend was future Attorney General William Bradford. Along with classmate Aaron Burr, Madison completed the college&#x27;s three-year Bachelor of Arts degree in two years, graduating in 1771. He had contemplated either entering the clergy or practicing law after graduation, but instead, he remained at Princeton to study Hebrew and political philosophy under the college&#x27;s president, John Witherspoon. He returned home to Montpelier in early 1772.

Madison&#x27;s ideas on philosophy and morality were profoundly shaped by Witherspoon, who converted him to the philosophy, values, and modes of thinking of the Age of Enlightenment. Biographer Terence Ball wrote that at Princeton, Madison was immersed in the liberalism of the Enlightenment, and converted to eighteenth-century political radicalism. From then on James Madison&#x27;s theories would advance the rights of happiness of man, and his most active efforts would serve devotedly the cause of civil and political liberty.

After returning to Montpelier, without a chosen career, Madison tutored his younger siblings. He began to study law books in 1773, asking his friend Bradford, a law apprentice, to send him a plan of study. Madison had acquired an understanding of legal publications by 1783. He saw himself as a law student but not as a lawyer. Madison did not apprentice himself to a lawyer and never joined the bar. Following the Revolutionary War, he spent time at Montpelier studying ancient democracies in preparation for the Constitutional Convention. Madison suffered from episodes of mental exhaustion and illness with associated nervousness, which often caused short-term incapacity after periods of stress. The descriptions of Madison&#x27;s sudden attacks fit today&#x27;s understanding of epilepsy. He enjoyed good physical health until his final years.

==American Revolution and Articles of Confederation==

In 1765, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which caused strong opposition by the colonists and initiated a conflict that would culminate in the American Revolution. The American Revolutionary War broke out on April 19, 1775. The colonists formed three prominent factions: Loyalists, who continued to support King George III of the United Kingdom; a significant neutral faction without firm commitments to either Loyalists or Patriots; and the Patriots, whom Madison joined, under the leadership of the Continental Congress. Madison believed that Parliament had overstepped its bounds by attempting to tax the American colonies, and he sympathized with those who resisted British rule. Historically, debate about the consecration of bishops was ongoing, and eventual legislation was passed in the British Parliament (subsequently called the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown. The new Anglican churches began incorporating more active forms of polity in their own self-government, collective decision-making, and self-supported financing; these measures would be consistent with the separation of religious and secular identities. Madison believed these measures to be insufficient, and favored disestablishing the Anglican Church in Virginia; he thought that tolerance of an established religion was detrimental not only to freedom of religion but also because it encouraged excessive deference to any authority that might be asserted by an established church.

After returning to Montpelier in 1774, Madison took a seat on the local Committee of Safety, a pro-revolution group that oversaw the local Patriot militia. In October 1775, he was commissioned as the colonel of the Orange County militia, serving as his father&#x27;s second-in-command until he was elected as a delegate to the Fifth Virginia Convention, which was tasked with producing Virginia&#x27;s first constitution. Although Madison never fought in the Revolutionary War, he rose to prominence in Virginia politics as a wartime leader. At the Virginia constitutional convention, he convinced delegates to alter the Virginia Declaration of Rights, originally drafted on May 20, 1776, to provide for &quot;equal entitlement&quot;, rather than mere &quot;tolerance&quot;, in the exercise of religion. With the enactment of the Virginia constitution, Madison became part of the Virginia House of Delegates, and he was subsequently elected to the Virginia governor&#x27;s Council of State, where he became a close ally of Governor Thomas Jefferson. On July 4, 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence was formally printed.

Madison participated in the debates concerning the Articles of Confederation in November 1777, contributing to the discussion of religious freedom that affected the drafting of the Articles, though his signature was not required for adopting the Articles of Confederation. Madison had proposed liberalizing the article on religious freedom, but the larger Virginia Convention stripped the proposed constitution of the more radical language of &quot;free expression&quot; of faith to the less controversial mention of highlighting &quot;tolerance&quot; within religion. Madison again served on the Council of State, from 1777 to 1779, when he was elected to the Second Continental Congress, the governing body of the United States.

During Madison&#x27;s term in Congress from 1780 to 1783, the U.S. faced a difficult war against Great Britain, along with runaway inflation, financial troubles, and a lack of cooperation between the different levels of government. According to historian J. C. A. Stagg, Madison worked to become an expert on financial issues, emerging as a legislative workhorse and a master of parliamentary coalition building. Frustrated by the failure of the states to supply needed requisitions, Madison proposed to amend the Articles of Confederation to grant Congress the power to independently raise revenue through tariffs on imports. Although General George Washington, Congressman Alexander Hamilton, and other leaders also favored the tariff amendment, it failed to win the ratification of all thirteen states. While a member of Congress, Madison was an ardent supporter of a close alliance between the United States and France. As an advocate of westward expansion, he insisted that the new nation must ensure its right to navigation on the Mississippi River and control of all lands east of it in the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War. Following his term in Congress, Madison won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.

==Ratification of the Constitution==

As a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Madison continued to advocate for religious freedom, and, along with Jefferson, drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. That amendment, which guaranteed freedom of religion and disestablished the Church of England, was passed in 1786. Madison also became a land speculator, purchasing land along the Mohawk River in partnership with another Jefferson protégé, James Monroe. Throughout the 1780s, Madison became increasingly concerned about the states&#x27; disunity and the central government&#x27;s weakness. He believed that direct democracy caused social decay and that a Republican government would be effective against partisanship and factionalism. He was particularly troubled by laws that legalized paper money and denied diplomatic immunity to ambassadors from other countries. Madison was also concerned about the lack of ability in Congress to capably create foreign policy, protect American trade, and foster the settlement of the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. As Madison wrote, &quot;a crisis had arrived which was to decide whether the American experiment was to be a blessing to the world, or to blast for ever the hopes which the republican cause had inspired.&quot; Madison committed to an intense study of law and political theory and also was influenced by Enlightenment texts sent by Jefferson from France. Madison especially sought out works on international law and the constitutions of &quot;ancient and modern confederacies&quot; such as the Dutch Republic, the Swiss Confederation, and the Achaean League. He came to believe that the United States could improve upon past republican experiments by its size which geographically combined 13 colonies; with so many competing interests, Madison hoped to minimize the abuses of majority rule. Additionally, navigation rights to the major trade routes accessed by the Mississippi River highly concerned Madison. He opposed the proposal by John Jay that the United States concede claims to the river for 25 years, and, according to historian Ralph Ketcham, Madison&#x27;s desire to fight the proposal was a major motivation in his return to Congress in 1787.


Leading up to the 1787 ratification debates for the Constitution, Madison worked with other members of the Virginia delegation, especially Edmund Randolph and George Mason, to create and present the Virginia Plan, an outline for a new federal constitution. It called for three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial), a bicameral Congress (consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives) apportioned by population, and a federal Council of Revision that would have the right to veto laws passed by Congress. The Virginia Plan did not explicitly lay out the structure of the executive branch, but Madison himself favored a strong single executive. Many delegates were surprised to learn that the plan called for the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of a new constitution, to be ratified by special conventions in each state, rather than by the state legislatures. With the assent of prominent attendees such as Washington and Benjamin Franklin, the delegates agreed in a secret session that the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of a new constitution was a plausible option and began scheduling the process of debating its ratification in the individual states. As a compromise between small and large states, large states got a proportional House, while the small states got equal representation in the Senate.

After the Philadelphia Convention ended in September 1787, Madison convinced his fellow congressmen to remain neutral in the ratification debate and allow each state to vote on the Constitution. Those who supported the Constitution were called Federalists; that included Madison. Opponents of the Constitution, known as Anti-Federalists, began a public campaign against ratification. In response, starting in October 1787, Hamilton and John Jay, both Federalists, began publishing a series of pro-ratification newspaper articles in New York. After Jay dropped out of the project, Hamilton approached Madison, who was in New York on congressional business, to write some of the essays. The essays were published under the pseudonym of Publius. The trio produced 85 essays known as &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;. The 85 essays were divided into two parts: 36 letters against the Articles of Confederation, and 49 letters that favored the new Constitution. The articles were also published in book form and used by the supporters of the Constitution in the ratifying conventions. Federalist No. 10, Madison&#x27;s first contribution to &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, became highly regarded in the 20th century for its advocacy of representative democracy. In it, Madison describes the dangers posed by the majority factions and argues that their effects can be limited through the formation of a large republic. He theorizes that in large republics the large number of factions that emerge will control their influence because no single faction can become a majority. In Federalist No. 51, he explains how the separation of powers between three branches of the federal government, as well as between state governments and the federal government, establishes a system of checks and balances that ensures that no one institution would become too powerful.

As the Virginia ratification convention began, Madison focused on winning the support of the relatively small number of undecided delegates. His long correspondence with Randolph paid off at the convention, as Randolph announced that he would support unconditional ratification of the Constitution, with amendments to be proposed after ratification. Though former Virginia governor Patrick Henry gave several persuasive speeches arguing against ratification, Madison&#x27;s expertise on the subject he had long argued for allowed him to respond with rational arguments to Henry&#x27;s anti-Federalist appeals. Madison was also a defender of federal veto rights and, according to historian Ron Chernow &quot;pleaded at the Constitutional Convention that the federal government should possess a veto over state laws&quot;. In his final speech to the ratifying convention, Madison implored his fellow delegates to ratify the Constitution as it had been written, arguing that failure to do so would lead to the collapse of the entire ratification effort, as each state would seek favorable amendments. On June 25, 1788, the convention voted 89–79 in favor of ratification. The vote came a week after New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, securing the Constitution&#x27;s adoption and a new form of government. The following January, Washington was elected the nation&#x27;s first president.

==Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)==
===Election to Congress===
After Virginia ratified the constitution, Madison returned to New York and resumed his duties in the Congress of the Confederation. Madison unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Virginia in 1788. After Madison was defeated in his bid for the Senate, and with concerns for both his political career and the possibility that Patrick Henry and his allies would arrange for a second constitutional convention, Madison ran for the House of Representatives. Henry and the Anti-Federalists were in firm control of the General Assembly in the autumn of 1788. At Henry&#x27;s behest, the Virginia legislature designed to deny Madison a seat by gerrymandering congressional districts. Henry and his supporters ensured Orange County was in a district heavily populated with Anti-Federalists, roughly three to one, to oppose Madison. Henry also recruited James Monroe, a strong challenger to Madison. Locked in a difficult race against Monroe, Madison promised to support a series of constitutional amendments to protect individual liberties. In an open letter, Madison wrote that, while he had opposed requiring alterations to the Constitution before ratification, he now believed that &quot;amendments, if pursued with a proper moderation and in a proper mode ... may serve the double purpose of satisfying the minds of well-meaning opponents, and of providing additional guards in favor of liberty.&quot; Madison&#x27;s promise paid off, as in Virginia&#x27;s 5th district election, he gained a seat in Congress with 57 percent of the vote.

Madison became a key adviser to Washington, who valued Madison&#x27;s understanding of the Constitution. Madison helped Washington write his first inaugural address and also prepared the official House response to Washington&#x27;s speech. He played a significant role in establishing and staffing the three Cabinet departments, and his influence helped Thomas Jefferson become the first Secretary of State. At the start of the first Congress, he introduced a tariff bill similar to the one he had advocated for under the Articles of the Confederation, and Congress established a federal tariff on imports by enacting the Tariff of 1789. The following year, Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton introduced an ambitious economic program that called for the federal assumption of state debts and the funding of that debt through the issuance of federal securities. Hamilton&#x27;s plan favored Northern speculators and was disadvantageous to states, such as Virginia, that had already paid off most of their debt; Madison emerged as one of the principal congressional opponents of the plan. After prolonged legislative deadlock, Madison, Jefferson, and Hamilton agreed to the Compromise of 1790, which provided for the enactment of Hamilton&#x27;s assumption plan, as part of the Funding Act of 1790. In return, Congress passed the Residence Act, which established the federal capital district of Washington, D.C.

===Bill of Rights===

During the first Congress, Madison took the lead in advocating for several constitutional amendments to the Bill of Rights. His primary goals were to fulfill his 1789 campaign pledge and to prevent the calling of a second constitutional convention, but he also hoped to safeguard the rights and liberties of the people against broad actions of Congress and individual states. He believed that the enumeration of specific rights would fix those rights in the public mind and encourage judges to protect them. After studying more than two hundred amendments that had been proposed at the state ratifying conventions, Madison introduced the Bill of Rights on June 8, 1789. His amendments contained numerous restrictions on the federal government and would protect, among other things, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the right to peaceful assembly. While most of his proposed amendments were drawn from the ratifying conventions, Madison was largely responsible for proposals to guarantee freedom of the press, protect property from government seizure, and ensure jury trials. He also proposed an amendment to prevent states from abridging &quot;equal rights of conscience, or freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases&quot;.

To prevent a permanent standing federal army, Madison proposed the Second Amendment, which gave state-regulated militia groups and private citizens, the &quot;right to bear arms.&quot; Madison and the Republicans desired a free government to be established by the consent of the governed, rather than by national military force.

Madison&#x27;s Bill of Rights faced little opposition; he had largely co-opted the Anti-Federalist goal of amending the Constitution but had avoided proposing amendments that would alienate supporters of the Constitution. His amendments were mostly adopted by the House of Representatives as proposed, but the Senate made several changes. Madison&#x27;s proposal to apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the states was eliminated, as was his change to the Constitution&#x27;s preamble which he thought would be enhanced by including a prefatory paragraph indicating that governmental power is vested by the people. He was disappointed that the Bill of Rights did not include protections against actions by state governments, but the passage of the document mollified some critics of the original constitution and shored up his support in Virginia. Ten amendments were finally ratified on December 15, 1791, becoming known in their final form as the Bill of Rights.

===Founding the Democratic–Republican Party===

After 1790, the Washington administration became polarized into two main factions. One faction, led by Jefferson and Madison, broadly represented Southern interests and sought close relations with France. This faction became the Democratic-Republican Party opposition to Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. The other faction, led by Hamilton and the Federalists, broadly represented Northern financial interests and favored close relations with Britain. In 1791, Hamilton introduced a plan that called for the establishment of a national bank to provide loans to emerging industries and oversee the money supply. Madison and the Democratic-Republican Party fought back against Hamilton&#x27;s attempt to expand the power of the Federal Government with the formation of a national bank; Madison argued that under the Constitution, Congress did not have the power to create a federally empowered national bank. Despite Madison&#x27;s opposition, Congress passed a bill to create the First Bank of the United States, which Washington signed into law in February 1791. As Hamilton implemented his economic program and Washington continued to enjoy immense prestige as president, Madison became increasingly concerned that Hamilton would seek to abolish the federal republic in favor of a centralized monarchy.

When Hamilton submitted his &quot;Report on Manufactures&quot;, which called for federal action to stimulate the development of a diversified economy, Madison once again challenged Hamilton&#x27;s proposal. Along with Jefferson, Madison helped Philip Freneau establish the &quot;National Gazette&quot;, a Philadelphia newspaper that attacked Hamilton&#x27;s proposals. In an essay in the newspaper in September 1792, Madison wrote that the country had divided into two factions: his faction, which believed &quot;that mankind are capable of governing themselves&quot;, and Hamilton&#x27;s faction, which allegedly sought the establishment of an aristocratic monarchy and was biased in favor of the wealthy. Those opposed to Hamilton&#x27;s economic policies, including many former Anti-Federalists, continued to strengthen the ranks of the Democratic–Republican Party, while those who supported the administration&#x27;s policies supported Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist Party. In the 1792 presidential election, both major parties supported Washington for re-election, but the Democratic–Republicans sought to unseat Vice President John Adams. Because the Constitution&#x27;s rules essentially precluded Jefferson from challenging Adams, the party backed New York Governor George Clinton for the vice presidency, but Adams still won.

With Jefferson out of office after 1793, Madison became the de facto leader of the Democratic–Republican Party. When Britain and France went to war in 1793, the U.S. needed to determine which side to support. While the differences between the Democratic–Republicans and the Federalists had previously centered on economic matters, foreign policy became an increasingly important issue, as Madison and Jefferson favored France and Hamilton favored Britain. War with Britain became imminent in 1794 after the British seized hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies. Madison believed that a trade war with Britain would probably succeed, and would allow Americans to assert their independence fully. The British West Indies, Madison maintained, could not live without American foodstuffs, but Americans could easily do without British manufacturers. Similarly, Madison argued that British industry was highly dependent on the demand of American consumers and would suffer heavily if this market was denied to the British. Washington secured friendly trade relations with Britain through the Jay Treaty of 1794. Madison and his Democratic–Republican allies were outraged by the treaty; the Democratic–Republican Robert R. Livingston wrote to Madison that the treaty &quot;sacrifices every essential interest and prostrates the honor of our country&quot;. Madison&#x27;s strong opposition to the treaty led to a permanent break with Washington, ending their friendship.

=== Marriage and family ===
On September 15, 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, the 26-year-old widow of John Todd, a Quaker farmer who died during a yellow fever epidemic. Earlier that year, Madison and Dolley Todd had been formally introduced at Madison&#x27;s request by Aaron Burr. Burr had become friends with her when staying at the same Philadelphia boardinghouse. The two quickly became romantically engaged and prepared for a wedding that summer, but Todd suffered recurring illnesses because of her exposure to yellow fever in Philadelphia. They eventually traveled to Harewood in Virginia for their wedding. Only a few close family members attended, and Winchester reverend Alexander Balmain presided. Dolley became a renowned figure in Washington, D.C., and excelled at hosting. She subsequently helped to establish the modern image of the first lady of the United States as an individual who has a leading role in the social affairs of the nation.

Throughout his life, Madison maintained a close relationship with his father, James Sr. At age 50, Madison inherited the large plantation of Montpelier and other possessions, including his father&#x27;s slaves. While Madison never had children with Dolley, he adopted her one surviving son, John Payne Todd (known as Payne), after the couple&#x27;s marriage. Some of his colleagues, such as Monroe and Burr, believed Madison&#x27;s lack of offspring weighed on his thoughts, though he never spoke of any distress. Oral history has suggested Madison may have fathered a child with his enslaved half-sister, a cook named Coreen, but researchers were unable to gather the DNA evidence needed to determine the validity of the accusation.

===Adams presidency===
Washington chose to retire after serving two terms and, in advance of the 1796 presidential election, Madison helped convince Jefferson to run for the presidency. Despite Madison&#x27;s efforts, Federalist candidate John Adams defeated Jefferson, taking a narrow majority of the electoral vote. Under the rules of the Electoral College then in place, Jefferson became vice president because he finished with the second-most electoral votes. Madison, meanwhile, had declined to seek re-election to the House, and he returned to Montpelier. On Jefferson&#x27;s advice, Adams considered appointing Madison to an American delegation charged with ending French attacks on American shipping, but Adams&#x27;s cabinet members strongly opposed the idea.

Though he was out of office, Madison remained a prominent Democratic–Republican leader in opposition to the Adams administration. Madison and Jefferson believed that the Federalists were using the Quasi-War with France to justify the violation of constitutional rights by passing the Alien and Sedition Acts, and they increasingly came to view Adams as a monarchist. Both Madison and Jefferson expressed the belief that natural rights were non-negotiable even in war. Madison believed that the Alien and Sedition Acts formed a dangerous precedent, by giving the government the power to look past the natural rights of its people in the name of national security. In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, Jefferson argued that the states had the power to nullify federal law on the basis of the Constitution being a compact among the states. Madison rejected this view of nullification and urged that states respond to unjust federal laws through interposition, a process by which a state legislature declared a law to be unconstitutional but did not take steps to actively prevent its enforcement. Jefferson&#x27;s doctrine of nullification was widely rejected, and the incident damaged the Democratic–Republican Party as attention was shifted from the Alien and Sedition Acts to the unpopular nullification doctrine.

In 1799, Madison was elected to the Virginia legislature. At the same time, Madison planned for Jefferson&#x27;s campaign in the 1800 presidential election. Madison issued the Report of 1800, which attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional. That report held that Congress was limited to legislating on its enumerated powers and that punishment for sedition violated freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Jefferson embraced the report, and it became the unofficial Democratic–Republican platform for the 1800 election. With the Federalists divided between supporters of Hamilton and Adams, and with news of the end of the Quasi-War not reaching the United States until after the election, Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr, defeated Adams.

==Secretary of State (1801–1809)==

Madison was one of two major influences in Jefferson&#x27;s cabinet, the other being Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin. Madison was appointed Secretary of State despite lacking foreign policy experience. An introspective individual, he received assistance from his wife, relying deeply on her in dealing with the social pressures of being a public figure both in his own Cabinet appointment as Secretary of State and afterward. As the ascent of Napoleon in France had dulled Democratic–Republican enthusiasm for the French cause, Madison sought a neutral position in the ongoing Coalition Wars between France and Britain. Domestically, the Jefferson administration and the Democratic–Republican Congress rolled back many Federalist policies; Congress quickly repealed the Alien and Sedition Act, abolished internal taxes, and reduced the size of the army and navy. Gallatin, however, convinced Jefferson to retain the First Bank of the United States. Though the Federalist political power was rapidly fading at the national level, Chief Justice John Marshall ensured that Federalist ideology retained an important presence in the judiciary. In the case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, Marshall simultaneously ruled that Madison had unjustly refused to deliver federal commissions to individuals who had been appointed by the previous administration, but that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over the case. Most importantly, Marshall&#x27;s opinion established the principle of judicial review.

Jefferson was sympathetic to the westward expansion of Americans who had settled as far west as the Mississippi River, supported by his concern for the sparse regional demographics in the far west compared to the more populated eastern states, the far west being inhabited almost exclusively by Native Americans. Jefferson promoted such western expansion and hoped to acquire the Spanish territory of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi River, for expansionist purposes. Early in Jefferson&#x27;s presidency, the administration learned that Spain planned to retrocede the Louisiana territory to France, raising fears of French encroachment on U.S. territory. In 1802, Jefferson and Madison sent Monroe to France to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans, which controlled access to the Mississippi River and thus was immensely important to the farmers of the American frontier. Rather than merely selling New Orleans, Napoleon&#x27;s government offered to sell the entire territory of Louisiana. Despite lacking explicit authorization from Jefferson, Monroe, along with Livingston, whom Jefferson had appointed as America&#x27;s minister to France, negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, in which France sold more than
 of land in exchange for $15 million ().

Despite the time-sensitive nature of negotiations with the French, Jefferson was concerned about the constitutionality of the Louisiana Purchase, and he privately favored introducing a constitutional amendment explicitly authorizing Congress to acquire new territories. Madison convinced Jefferson to refrain from proposing the amendment, and the administration ultimately submitted the Louisiana Purchase Treaty for approval by the Senate, without an accompanying constitutional amendment. Unlike Jefferson, Madison had no doubts of its constitutionality because agreements between nations (such as the Louisiana Purchase) are treaties, and treaties are specifically authorized by the Constitution. The President negotiated the treaty, the Senate quickly ratified it, and the House, with equal alacrity, passed enabling legislation, as specified in the Constitution.

Early in his tenure, Jefferson was able to maintain cordial relations with both France and Britain, but relations with Britain deteriorated after 1805. The British ended their policy of tolerance towards American shipping and began seizing American goods headed for French ports. They also impressed American sailors, some of whom had originally defected from the British navy, but some of whom had never been British subjects. In response to the attacks, Congress passed the Non-importation Act, which restricted many, but not all, British imports. Tensions with Britain were heightened due to the &quot;Chesapeake–Leopard&quot; affair, a June 1807 naval confrontation between American and British naval forces, while the French also began attacking American shipping. Madison believed that economic pressure could force the British to end their seizure of American shipped goods, and he and Jefferson convinced Congress to pass the Embargo Act of 1807, which banned all exports to foreign nations. The embargo proved ineffective, unpopular, and difficult to enforce, especially in New England. In March 1809, Congress replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with nations other than Britain and France.

===1808 presidential election===

Speculation regarding Madison&#x27;s potential succession to Jefferson commenced early in Jefferson&#x27;s first term. Madison&#x27;s status in the party was damaged by his association with the embargo, which was unpopular throughout the country and especially in the Northeast. With the Federalists collapsing as a national party after 1800, the chief opposition to Madison&#x27;s candidacy came from other members of the Democratic–Republican Party. Madison became the target of attacks from Congressman John Randolph, a leader of a faction of the party known as the tertium quids.

Randolph recruited Monroe, who had felt betrayed by the administration&#x27;s rejection of the proposed Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Britain, to challenge Madison for leadership of the party. Many Northerners, meanwhile, hoped that Vice President Clinton could unseat Madison as Jefferson&#x27;s successor. Despite this opposition, Madison won his party&#x27;s presidential nomination at the January 1808 congressional nominating caucus. The Federalist Party mustered little strength outside New England, and Madison easily defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney in the general election.

==Presidency (1809–1817)==
===Inauguration and cabinet===

Madison&#x27;s inauguration took place on March 4, 1809, in the House chamber of the U.S. Capitol. Chief Justice Marshall administered the presidential oath of office to Madison while outgoing President Jefferson watched. Vice President George Clinton was sworn in for a second term, making him the first U.S. vice president to serve under two presidents. Unlike Jefferson, who enjoyed relatively unified support, Madison encountered political opposition from former political allies such as Monroe and Clinton. Additionally, the Federalist Party was resurgent due to opposition to the embargo. Aside from his planned nomination of Gallatin for Secretary of State, the remaining members of Madison&#x27;s Cabinet were chosen merely to promote political harmony, and, according to historians Ketcham and Rutland, were largely unremarkable or incompetent. Due to the resistance of Monroe and Clinton, Madison immediately faced opposition to his planned nomination of Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin as Secretary of State. Madison eventually opted &quot;not&quot; to nominate Gallatin, keeping him in the Treasury Department.

Madison settled instead on Robert Smith to be the Secretary of State. However, for the next two years, Madison performed most of the duties of the Secretary of State due to Smith&#x27;s incompetence. After bitter intra-party contention, Madison finally replaced Smith with Monroe in April 1811. With a Cabinet full of those he distrusted, Madison rarely called Cabinet meetings and instead frequently consulted with Gallatin alone. Early in his presidency, Madison sought to continue Jefferson&#x27;s policies of low taxes and a reduction of the national debt. In 1811, Congress allowed the charter of the First Bank of the United States to lapse after Madison declined to take a strong stance on the issue.

===War of 1812===

==== Prelude to war ====
Congress had repealed the Embargo Act of 1807 shortly before Madison became president, but troubles with the British and French continued. Madison settled on a new strategy that was designed to pit the British and French against each other, offering to trade with whichever country would end their attacks against American shipping. The gambit almost succeeded, but negotiations with the British collapsed in mid-1809. Seeking to drive a wedge between the Americans and the British, Napoleon offered to end French attacks on American shipping so long as the United States punished any countries that did not similarly end restrictions on trade. Madison accepted Napoleon&#x27;s proposal in the hope that it would convince the British to finally end their policy of commercial warfare. Notwithstanding, the British refused to change their policies, and the French reneged on their promise and continued to attack American shipping.

With sanctions and other policies having failed, Madison determined that war with Britain was the only remaining option. Many Americans called for a &quot;second war of independence&quot; to restore honor and stature to their new nation, and an angry public elected a &quot;war hawk&quot; Congress, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. With Britain already engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, many Americans including Madison believed that the United States could easily capture Canada, using it as a bargaining chip for other disputes or simply retaining control of it. On June 1, 1812, Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war, stating that the United States could no longer tolerate Britain&#x27;s &quot;state of war against the United States&quot;. The declaration of war was passed along sectional and party lines, with opposition to the declaration coming from Federalists and from some Democratic–Republicans in the Northeast. In the years prior to the war, Jefferson and Madison had reduced the size of the military, leaving the country with a military force consisting mostly of poorly trained militia members. Madison asked Congress to quickly put the country &quot;into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis&quot;, specifically recommending expansion of the army and navy.

====Military actions====
Given the circumstances involving Napoleon in Europe, Madison initially believed the war would result in a swift American victory. Madison ordered three landed military spearhead incursions into Canada, beginning from Fort Detroit, aimed to loosening British control around American-held Fort Niagara and destroying the British supply lines from Montreal. These actions were intended to gain leverage for concessions to protect American shipping in the Atlantic. Without a standing army, Madison counted on regular state militias to rally to the flag and invade Canada; however, governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate. The British army was more organized, utilized professional soldiers, and fostered an alliance with Native American tribes led by Tecumseh. On August 16, during the British siege of Detroit, Major General William Hull panicked, after the British fired on the fort, killing two American officers. Terrified of a Native American attack, drinking heavily, Hull quickly ordered a white tablecloth out a window and unconditionally surrendered Fort Detroit and his entire army to British Major-General Sir Isaac Brock. Hull, later, was court-martialed for cowardice, but Madison intervened and saved him from execution. On October 13, a separate force from the United States was defeated at Queenston Heights, although Brock was killed. Commanding General Henry Dearborn, hampered by mutinous New England infantry, retreated to winter quarters near Albany, failing to destroy Montreal&#x27;s vulnerable British supply lines. Lacking adequate revenue to fund the war, the Madison administration was forced to rely on high-interest loans provided by bankers in New York City and Philadelphia.

In the 1812 presidential election, held during the early stages of the war, Madison was re-nominated without opposition. A dissident group of New York Democratic-Republicans nominated DeWitt Clinton, the lieutenant governor of New York and a nephew of the recently deceased Vice President George Clinton, to oppose Madison in the 1812 election. This faction of Democratic-Republicans hoped to unseat the president by forging a coalition among Democratic-Republicans opposed to the impending war, as well as those party faithful angry with Madison for not moving more decisively toward war, northerners weary of the Virginia dynasty and southern control of the White House, and many New Englanders wanted Madison replaced. Dismayed by their prospects of beating Madison, a group of top Federalists met with Clinton&#x27;s supporters to discuss a strategy for unification. Difficult as it was for them to join forces, they nominated Clinton for President and Jared Ingersoll, a Philadelphia lawyer, for vice president. Hoping to shore up his support in the Northeast, where the War of 1812 was unpopular, Madison selected Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts as his running mate, though Gerry would only survive two years after the election due to old age. Despite the maneuverings of Clinton and the Federalists, Madison won re-election, though by the narrowest margin of any election since that of 1800 in the popular vote, as later supported by the electoral vote as well. He received 128 electoral votes to 89 for Clinton. With Clinton winning most of the Northeast, Madison won Pennsylvania in addition to having swept the South and the West, which ensured his victory.

After the disastrous start to the war, Madison accepted Russia&#x27;s invitation to arbitrate and sent a delegation led by Gallatin and John Quincy Adams (the son of former President John Adams) to Europe to negotiate a peace treaty. While Madison worked to end the war, the United States experienced some impressive naval successes, by the and other warships, that boosted American morale. Victorious in the Battle of Lake Erie, the U.S. crippled the supply and reinforcement of British military forces in the western theater of the war. General William Henry Harrison defeated the forces of the British and of Tecumseh&#x27;s confederacy at the Battle of the Thames. The death of Tecumseh in that battle marked the permanent end of armed Native American resistance in the Old Northwest and any hope of a united Indian nation. In March 1814, Major General Andrew Jackson broke the resistance of the British-allied Muscogee Creek in the Old Southwest with his victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Despite these successes, the British continued to repel American attempts to invade Canada, and a British force captured Fort Niagara and burned the American city of Buffalo in late 1813.

On August 24, 1814, the British landed a large force on the shores of Chesapeake Bay and routed General William Winder&#x27;s army at the Battle of Bladensburg. Madison, who had earlier inspected Winder&#x27;s army, escaped British capture by fleeing to Virginia, though the British captured Washington and burned many of its buildings, including the White House. Dolley had abandoned the capital and fled to Virginia, but only after securing the portrait of George Washington. The charred remains of the capital signified a humiliating defeat for James Madison and America. On August 27, Madison returned to Washington to view the carnage of the city. Dolley returned the next day, and on September 8, the Madisons moved into the Octagon House, never to return to the White House while President. The British army next advanced on Baltimore, but the U.S. repelled the British attack in the Battle of Baltimore, and the British army departed from the Chesapeake region in September. That same month, U.S. forces repelled a British invasion from Canada with a victory at the Battle of Plattsburgh. The British public began to turn against the war in North America, and British leaders started to look for a quick exit from the conflict.

In January 1815, Jackson&#x27;s troops defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans. Just over a month later, Madison learned that his negotiators had finalized the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814, which ended the war. Madison promptly sent the treaty to the Senate, which ratified it on February 16, 1815. Although the overall outcome of the war resulted in a standoff, the rapid succession of events at the war&#x27;s conclusion, including the burning of the capital, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Treaty of Ghent, made it seem as though American bravery at New Orleans had compelled the British to surrender. This perspective, although inaccurate, significantly contributed to enhancing Madison&#x27;s reputation as president. Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the June 1815 Battle of Waterloo marked a definitive end to the Napoleonic Wars and thus concluded the hostile seizure of American shipping by British and French forces.

===Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition===

The postwar period of Madison&#x27;s second term saw the transition into the &quot;Era of Good Feelings&quot; between mid-1815 and 1817, with the Federalists experiencing a further decline in influence. During the war, delegates from the New England states held the Hartford Convention, where they asked for several amendments to the Constitution. Though the Hartford Convention did not explicitly call for the secession of New England, the Convention became an adverse political millstone around the Federalist Party as general American sentiment had moved towards a celebrated unity among the states in what they saw as a successful &quot;second war of independence&quot; from Britain.

Madison hastened the decline of the Federalists by adopting several programs he had previously opposed. Recognizing the difficulties of financing the war and the necessity of an institution to regulate American currency, Madison proposed the re-establishment of a national bank. He also called for a tariff designed to protect American goods from foreign competition, and a constitutional amendment authorizing the federal government to fund the construction of local internal improvements such as roads and canals. Madison&#x27;s initiatives to now act on behalf of a national bank appeared to reverse his earlier opposition to Hamilton and were opposed by strict constructionists such as John Randolph, who stated that Madison&#x27;s proposals now &quot;out-Hamiltons Alexander Hamilton&quot;. Responding to Madison&#x27;s proposals, the 14th Congress compiled one of the most productive legislative records up to that point in history. Congress granted the Second Bank of the United States a twenty-five-year charter and passed the Tariff of 1816, which set high import duties for all goods that were produced outside the United States. Madison approved federal spending on the Cumberland Road, which provided a link to the country&#x27;s western lands. Congress did not pass a constitutional amendment authorizing national expenditures for local purposes (as Madison proposed). As a reprimand to Congress, on his last act before leaving office, Madison vetoed the internal improvements Bonus Bill of 1817, arguing that it was not within the enumerated powers of the Constitution.

===Native American policy===
Upon becoming president, Madison said the federal government&#x27;s duty was to convert Native Americans by the &quot;participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state&quot;. In 1809, General Harrison began to push for a treaty to open more land for white American settlement. The Miami, Wea, and Kickapoo were vehemently opposed to selling any more land around the Wabash River. Harrison decided, against the wishes of Madison, to first conclude a treaty with the tribes who were willing to sell and use those treaties to help influence those who held out. In September 1809, Harrison invited the Potawatomie, Delaware, Eel Rivers, and Miami to a meeting in Fort Wayne. Harrison promised large subsidies and direct payments to the tribes if they would cede the other lands under discussion. On September 30, 1809, Madison agreed to the Treaty of Fort Wayne, negotiated and signed by Indiana Territory&#x27;s Governor Harrison. In the treaty, the Native American tribes were compensated $5,200 () in goods and $500 in cash (), with $250 in annual payments (), in return for the cession of 3 million acres of land (approximately 12,140 square kilometers) with incentivized subsidies paid to individual tribes for exerting their influence over less cooperative tribes. The treaty angered Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who said, &quot;Sell a country! Why not sell the air, the clouds and the great sea, as well as the earth?&quot;

Like Jefferson, Madison had a paternalistic attitude toward Native Americans, encouraging them to become farmers. Madison believed the adoption of European-style agriculture would help Native Americans assimilate the values of British–U.S. civilization. As pioneers and settlers moved West into large tracts of Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, and Chickasaw territory, Madison ordered the U.S. Army to protect Native American lands from intrusion by settlers. This was done to the chagrin of his military commander Andrew Jackson, who wanted Madison to ignore Native Americans pleas to stop the invasion of their lands. Tensions continued to mount between the United States and Tecumseh over the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, which ultimately led to Tecumseh&#x27;s alliance with the British and the Battle of Tippecanoe, on November 7, 1811, in the Northwest Territory. The divisions among the Native American leaders were bitter and before leaving the discussions, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the terms of the negotiated treaty were largely nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.

The situation continued to escalate, eventually leading to the outbreak of hostilities between Tecumseh&#x27;s followers and American settlers later that year. Tensions continued to rise, leading to the Battle of Tippecanoe during a period sometimes called Tecumseh&#x27;s War. Tecumseh was defeated and Native Americans were pushed off their tribal lands, replaced entirely by white settlers. In addition to the Battle of the Thames and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, other wars with Native Americans included the Peoria War, and the Creek War. Negotiated by Jackson, in the aftermath of the Creek War, the Treaty of Fort Jackson of August 9, 1814, added approximately 23 million acres of land (93,000 square kilometers) to Georgia and Alabama. Privately, Madison did not believe Native Americans could be fully assimilated to the values of Euro-American culture and may have been unwilling to make &quot;the transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman state, to the agriculture&quot;. Madison feared that Native Americans had too great an influence on the settlers they interacted with, who in his view was &quot;irresistibly attracted by that complete liberty, that freedom from bonds, obligations, duties, that absence of care and anxiety which characterize the savage state&quot;. In March 1816, Madison&#x27;s Secretary of War William Crawford advocated for the government to encourage intermarriages between Native Americans and Whites as a way of assimilating the former. This prompted public outrage and exacerbated anti-Indigenous bigotry among White Americans, as seen in hostile letters sent to Madison, who remained publicly silent on the issue.

===Election of 1816===

In the 1816 presidential election, Madison and Jefferson both favored the candidacy of Secretary of State James Monroe, who defeated Secretary of War William H. Crawford in the party&#x27;s congressional nominating caucus. As the Federalist Party continued to collapse, Monroe easily defeated Federalist candidate, New York Senator Rufus King, in the 1816 election. Madison left office as a popular president; former president Adams wrote that Madison had &quot;acquired more glory, and established more union, than all his three predecessors, Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, put together&quot;.

==Post-presidency (1817–1836)==
When Madison left office in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency poorer than when he came in. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to price declines in tobacco and his stepson&#x27;s mismanagement. In his retirement, Madison occasionally became involved in public affairs, advising Andrew Jackson and other presidents. He remained out of the public debate over the Missouri Compromise, though he privately complained about the North&#x27;s opposition to the extension of slavery. Madison had warm relations with all four of the major candidates in the 1824 presidential election, but, like Jefferson, largely stayed out of the race. During Jackson&#x27;s presidency, Madison publicly disavowed the Nullification movement and argued that no state had the right to secede. Madison also helped Jefferson establish the University of Virginia. In 1826, after the death of Jefferson, Madison was appointed as the second rector of the university. He retained the position as college chancellor for ten years until his death in 1836.

In 1829, at the age of 78, Madison was chosen as a representative to the Virginia Constitutional Convention for revision of the commonwealth&#x27;s constitution. It was his last appearance as a statesman. Apportionment of adequate representation was the central issue at the convention for the western districts of Virginia. The increased population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not proportionately represented in the legislature. Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men, in place of the prevailing property ownership requirement. Madison made modest gains but was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to extend suffrage to all white men.

In his later years, Madison became highly concerned about his historical legacy. He resorted to modifying letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, and adding and deleting words and sentences. By his late seventies, Madison&#x27;s self-editing of his own archived letters and older materials had become almost an obsession. As an example, he edited a letter written to Jefferson criticizing Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette; Madison not only inked out original passages but in other correspondence he even forged Jefferson&#x27;s handwriting. Historian Drew R. McCoy wrote: During the final six years of his life, amid a sea of personal [financial] troubles that were threatening to engulf him ... At times mental agitation issued in physical collapse. For the better part of a year in 1831 and 1832 he was bedridden, if not silenced ... Literally sick with anxiety, he began to despair of his ability to make himself understood by his fellow citizens.

=== Death ===

Madison&#x27;s health slowly deteriorated through the 1830s. He died of congestive heart failure at Montpelier on the morning of June 28, 1836, at the age of 85. According to one common account of his final moments, he was given his breakfast, which he tried eating but was unable to swallow. His favorite niece, Nellie Madison Willis, who sat by to keep him company, asked him, &quot;What is the matter, Uncle James?&quot; Madison died immediately after he replied, &quot;Nothing more than a change of mind, my dear.&quot; He was buried in the family cemetery at Montpelier. He was one of the last prominent members of the Revolutionary War generation to die. His last will and testament left significant sums to the American Colonization Society, Princeton, and the University of Virginia, as well as $30,000 ($897,000 in 2021) to his wife, Dolley. Left with a smaller sum than James had intended, Dolley suffered financial troubles until her death in 1849. In the 1840s Dolley sold Montpelier, its remaining slaves, and the furnishings to pay off outstanding debts. Paul Jennings, one of Madison&#x27;s younger slaves, later recalled in his memoir,

In the last days of her life, before Congress purchased her husband&#x27;s papers, she was in a state of absolute poverty, and I think sometimes suffered for the necessaries of life. While I was a servant to Mr. Webster, he often sent me to her with a market-basket full of provisions, and told me whenever I saw anything in the house that I thought she was in need of, to take it to her. I often did this, and occasionally gave her small sums from my own pocket, though I had years before bought my freedom of her.

==Political and religious views==
===Federalism===
During his first stint in Congress in the 1780s, Madison came to favor amending the Articles of Confederation to provide for a stronger central government. In the 1790s, he led the opposition to Hamilton&#x27;s centralizing policies and the Alien and Sedition Acts. Madison&#x27;s support of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions in the 1790s has been referred to as &quot;a breathtaking evolution for a man who had pleaded at the Constitutional Convention that the federal government should possess a veto over state laws&quot;.

Others historians disagree, and see Madison&#x27;s political philosophy as remarkably consistent. Perhaps more importantly, they point out that Madison&#x27;s loyalty was to the Constitution, not to his personal preferences. Madison had advocated in the debates of the Constitutional Convention that the proposed federal government have veto power over state laws, but he was willing to follow the Constitution as it was adopted and ratified, rather than what he might have wished that it said. Madison had written in Federalist #45 that the proposed federal government would have powers that were &quot;few and defined&quot; (as enumerated in Article I of the Constitution). He felt strongly that to interpret it otherwise would be a breach of faith with &quot;We the People&quot; who had ratified the Constitution based on that understanding.

Madison, who was the author of the Bill of Rights, was also faithfully following the 10th Amendment, which says that all &quot;powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot;

===Religion===

Although baptized as an Anglican and educated by Presbyterian clergymen, young Madison was an avid reader of English deist tracts. As an adult, Madison paid little attention to religious matters. Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college, some scholars suggest he leaned toward deism. Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets and formed his outlook on life with a Christian worldview. Regardless of his own religious beliefs, Madison believed in religious liberty, and he advocated for Virginia&#x27;s disestablishment of state-sponsored religious institutions. He also opposed the appointment of chaplains for Congress and the armed forces, arguing that such appointments produce religious exclusion as well as political disharmony.

==Slavery==
Throughout his life, Madison&#x27;s views on slavery were conflicted. He was born into a plantation society that relied on slave labor, and both sides of his family profited from tobacco farming. While he viewed slavery as essential to the Southern economy, he was troubled by the instability of a society that depended on a large slave population. Madison also believed slavery was incompatible with American Revolutionary principles, though he owned over one hundred African American slaves. According to historian Paris Spies-Gans, Madison&#x27;s anti-slavery thought was strongest &quot;at the height of Revolutionary politics. But by the early 1800s, when in a position to truly impact policy, he failed to follow through on these views.&quot; Spies-Gans concluded, &quot;[u]ltimately, Madison&#x27;s personal dependence on slavery led him to question his own, once enlightened, definition of liberty itself.&quot;

Madison grew up on Montpelier, which like other southern plantations depended on slave labor. When Madison left for college on August 10, 1769, he arrived at Princeton accompanied by Sawney, an enslaved man charged with handling Madison&#x27;s expenses and with relaying messages to his family back home. In 1783, fearing the possibility of a slave rebellion at Montpelier, Madison emancipated one slave, Billey, selling him into a seven-year apprentice contract. After his manumission, Billey changed his name to William Gardner and became a shipping agent, representing Madison in Philadelphia. Madison inherited Montpelier and its more than one hundred slaves after his father died in 1801. That same year, Madison moved to Washington D.C., running Montpelier from afar making no effort to free his slaves. After his election to the presidency in 1808, Madison brought his slaves to the White House. During the 1820s and 1830s, Madison sold some of his land and slaves to repay debt. In 1836, at the time of Madison&#x27;s death, he owned 36 taxable slaves. In his will, Madison gave his remaining slaves to his wife Dolley, and charged her not to sell the slaves without their permission. To pay off debts, Dolley later sold the slaves without their permission.

As was consistent with Virginia&#x27;s customs at the time, Madison was known from his farm papers for advocating the humane treatment of his slaves. He instructed an overseer to &quot;treat the Negroes with all the humanity and kindness consistent with their necessary subordination and work.&quot; Madison also ensured that his slaves had milk cows and meals for their daily food. By the 1790s, Sawney, while enslaved, was an overseer of part of the plantation. Some slaves at Montpelier could read. Paul Jennings was a slave of the Madisons for 48 years and worked as Madison&#x27;s footman at the White House. In his memoir, &quot;A Colored Man&#x27;s Reminiscences of James Madison&quot;, published in 1865, Jennings said that he &quot;never knew [Madison] to strike a slave, although he had over one hundred; neither would he allow an overseer to do it.&quot; Jennings condemned slavery but called James Madison &quot;one of the best men that ever lived&quot;, and Dolley Madison &quot;a remarkably fine woman.&quot;

Madison called slavery &quot;the most oppressive dominion&quot; that ever existed, and according to historian Ralph Ketcham he had a &quot;lifelong abhorrence&quot; for the institution. In 1785 Madison spoke in the Virginia Assembly favoring a bill that Thomas Jefferson had proposed for the gradual abolition of slavery, and he also helped defeat a bill designed to outlaw the manumission of individual slaves. As a slaveholder, Madison was aware that owning slaves was not consistent with revolutionary values, but, as a pragmatist, this sort of self-contradiction was a common feature in his political career. Historian Drew R. McCoy said that Madison&#x27;s antislavery principles were indeed &quot;impeccable.&quot; Ketcham wrote, &quot;[a]lthough Madison abhorred slavery, he nonetheless  ... depend[ed] all his life on a slave system that he could never square with his republican beliefs.&quot; There is no evidence Madison thought black people were inherently inferior. Madison believed blacks and whites were unlikely to co-exist peacefully due to &quot;the prejudices of the whites&quot; as well as feelings on both sides &quot;inspired by their former relation as oppressors and oppressed.&quot; As such, he became interested in the idea of freedmen establishing colonies in Africa and later served as the president of the American Colonization Society, which relocated former slaves to Liberia. Madison believed that this solution offered a gradual, long-term, but potentially feasible means of eradicating slavery in the United States, but that peaceful co-existence between the two racial groups could eventually be achieved in the long run.

Madison initially opposed the Constitution&#x27;s 20-year protection of the foreign slave trade, but he eventually accepted it as a necessary compromise to get the South to ratify the document. He also proposed that apportionment in the House of Representatives be according to each state&#x27;s free and enslaved population, eventually leading to the adoption of the Three-fifths Compromise. Madison supported the extension of slavery into the West during the Missouri crisis of 1819–1821, asserting that the spread of slavery would not lead to more slaves, but rather diminish their generative increase through dispersing them, thus substantially improving their condition, accelerating emancipation, easing racial tensions, and increasing &quot;partial manumissions.&quot; Madison thought of slaves as &quot;wayward (but still educable) students in need of regular guidance.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Regarded as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Madison had a wide influence on the founding of the nation and upon the early development of American constitutional government and foreign policy. Historian J.C.A. Stagg writes that &quot;in some ways—because he was on the winning side of every important issue facing the young nation from 1776 to 1816—Madison was the most successful and possibly the most influential of all the Founding Fathers.&quot; Though he helped found a major political party and served as the fourth president, his legacy has largely been defined by his contributions to the Constitution; even in his own life he was hailed as the &quot;Father of the Constitution&quot;. Law professor Noah Feldman writes that Madison &quot;invented and theorized the modern ideal of an expanded, federal constitution that combines local self-government with an overarching national order&quot;. Feldman adds that Madison&#x27;s &quot;model of liberty-protecting constitutional government&quot; is &quot;the most influential American idea in global political history&quot;. Various rankings of historians and political scientists tend to rank Madison as an above average president with a 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association&#x27;s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranking Madison as the twelfth best president.

Various historians have criticized Madison&#x27;s tenure as president. In 1968, Henry Steele Commager and Richard B. Morris said the conventional view of Madison was of an &quot;incapable President&quot; who &quot;mismanaged an unnecessary war&quot;. A 2006 poll of historians ranked Madison&#x27;s failure to prevent the War of 1812 as the sixth-worst mistake made by a sitting president. Regarding Madison&#x27;s consistency and adaptability of policy-making during his many years of political activity, historian Gordon S. Wood says that Lance Banning, as in his &quot;Sacred Fire of Liberty&quot; (1995), is the &quot;only present-day scholar to maintain that Madison did not change his views in the 1790s&quot;. During and after the War of 1812, Madison came to support several of the policies that he opposed in the 1790s, including the national bank, a strong navy, and direct taxes. Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison, but Wood looks at him in the terms of Madison&#x27;s times—as a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism from that of the Federalists. Gary Rosen uses other approaches to suggest Madison&#x27;s consistency. Historian Garry Wills wrote, &quot;Madison&#x27;s claim on our admiration does not rest on a perfect consistency, any more than it rests on his presidency. He has other virtues.  ... As a framer and defender of the Constitution he had no peer.  ... No man could do everything for the country—not even Washington. Madison did more than most, and did some things better than any. That was quite enough.&quot;

Montpelier, the Madison family&#x27;s plantation, has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The James Madison Memorial Building is part of the United States Library of Congress and serves as the official memorial to Madison. In 1986, Congress created the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation as part of the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution. Other memorials include Madison, Wisconsin and Madison County, Alabama which were both named for Madison, as were Madison Square Garden, James Madison University, and the USS &quot;James Madison&quot;. In 2021, the Madison Metropolitan School District renamed James Madison Memorial High School following community opposition to commemorating someone who used slave labor. Madison has appeared on United States currency, including the five thousand dollar bill (no longer in production since 1969). In 2023, an example of the $5,000 Federal Reserve Madison Note sold at Heritage Auctions for $300,000.

== In popular culture ==

Madison, portrayed by Burgess Meredith, is a key protagonist in the 1946 film &quot;Magnificent Doll&quot;, a fictionalized account of Dolley Madison&#x27;s romantic life. 

Madison is also portrayed in the Broadway musical &quot;Hamilton&quot;, played by Joshua Henry in the original 2013 Vassar version and then revised by Okieriete Onaodowan for the 2015 Broadway opening. Onaodowan won a Grammy Award for his portrayal of Madison. On July 3, 2020, Disney+ released the film &quot;Hamilton&quot;, a professional recording of the Broadway stage production performed by the original cast.

<text>Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society is a role-playing game magazine devoted to Traveller, commonly abbreviated JTAS.

==History==
Loren K. Wiseman created a magazine in 1979 to support &quot;Traveller&quot;, with Game Designers&#x27; Workshop publishing &quot;The Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society&quot; (JTAS), which Wiseman would continue to develop as its editor. J. Andrew Keith wrote so much material for &quot;JTAS&quot; that he used the pseudonyms John Marshal and Keith Douglass (although a reader performed a word-use analysis of these articles and realized that the same person wrote them all). Marc Miller decided that, rather than using modern dates for the magazine, each issue would instead be based on the in-game calendar of the Imperium, which advanced roughly 90 days for each quarterly issue. &quot;JTAS&quot; #2 (1979) began to include in-universe excerpts from the fictional &#x27;Traveller News Service&#x27;, which talked about &#x27;current&#x27; events going on in the Imperium; that issue was dated 274–1105, and included two news excerpts from Regina sector, which were dated 097-1105 and 101–1105 on the Imperium calendar. &quot;JTAS&quot; #9 (1981) contributed to the development of the &quot;Traveller&quot; metaplot by detailing the beginning of a war with the alien Zhodani species. The original run of the magazine ended with &quot;The Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society&quot; #24 (1984), but GDW replaced it with the magazine &quot;Challenge&quot;, continuing the numbering from &quot;JTAS&quot; with issue #25 (1986) but included material for all games published by GDW rather than just &quot;Traveller&quot;.

Imperium Games published &quot;Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society&quot; #25 in 1996, and published just the next issue of the &quot;Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society&quot; as their final issue in 1997.

Steve Jackson Games obtained a license for the &quot;Traveller&quot; setting, so they brought back &quot;Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society&quot; as an online magazine in 2000.

Mongoose Publishing produced six volumes of &quot;Journal of the Travellers&#x27; Aid Society&quot; in 2020 as part of their &quot;Traveller&quot; licence. &quot;Journal of the Traveller’s Aid Society, Volume I&quot; is 128 pages long and contains two adventures.

==Name==
The Journal of the Travellers Aid Society takes its name from the fictional Travellers&#x27; Aid Society (TAS) that was first mentioned in the original incarnation of the Traveller game published by Game Designers Workshop [GDW]. In the original Traveller game, it was not too uncommon for characters to obtain membership in the TAS during character creation. The idea of the TAS is that it is an organization that exists to support what are basically &#x27;transients,&#x27; or &#x27;wanderers&#x27; [&#x27;Travellers&#x27; in the game&#x27;s terminology] around the galaxy. It does so by maintaining low-cost hostels at many of the large starports, and, most importantly, by maintaining its &#x27;rating system,&#x27; which warns of the dangers inherent in visiting certain worlds. Under this system, a world which should be approached with caution is denoted an &#x27;Amber Zone,&#x27; and a world that should not be approached at all is denoted a &#x27;Red Zone.&#x27;

William A. Barton reviewed the &quot;Merchant Prince&quot; supplement from &quot;Journal of the Travellers Aid Society&quot; #12 in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 53. Barton commented that &quot;Although it probably won&#x27;t totally supplant &quot;Merchants &amp; Merchandise&quot; as &quot;the&quot; book for generating merchant characters, &quot;Merchant Prince&quot; is a well-conceived and viable alternative to M&amp;M. Its inclusion in the &quot;Journal&quot; makes it a special bargain. I recommend it to every &quot;Traveller&quot; player, especially those who find the merchant life the most appealing.&quot;

<text>The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) is the highest court of appeal for the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories, some Commonwealth countries and a few institutions in the United Kingdom. Established on 14 August 1833 to hear appeals formerly heard by the King-in-Council, the Privy Council formerly acted as the court of last resort for the entire British Empire, other than for the United Kingdom itself.

Formally a statutory committee of His Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council, the Judicial Committee consists of senior judges who are Privy Councillors; they are predominantly justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth of Nations. Although it is often simply referred to as the &quot;Privy Council&quot;, the Judicial Committee is only one constituent part of the Council. In Commonwealth realms, appeals are nominally made to &quot;His Majesty in Council&quot; (i.e. the British monarch as formally advised by his privy counsellors), who then refers the case to the Judicial Committee for &quot;advice&quot;, while in republics in the Commonwealth of Nations retaining the JCPC as their final court of appeal, appeals are made directly to the Judicial Committee itself. The panel of judges (typically five in number) hearing a particular case is known as &quot;the Board&quot;. The report of the Board is, by convention, always accepted by the King-in-Council as judgment.

== History ==

The origins of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council can be traced back to the , or royal council. In theory, the King was the fount of justice, and petitions for redress of wrongs arising from his courts were addressed to him. That power was gradually taken over by Parliament (which evolved out of the ) within England, but the King-in-Council (which also evolved out of the &quot;&quot;) retained jurisdiction to hear petitions from the King&#x27;s non-English possessions, such as the Channel Islands and, later on, from England&#x27;s colonies.

The task of hearing appeals was given to a series of short-lived committees of the Privy Council. In 1679, appellate jurisdiction was given to the Board of Trade, before being transferred to a standing Appeals Committee of the Privy Council in 1696. The Appeals Committee of the Privy Council was one of the earliest judicial bodies which exercised the power of judicial review, in a series of cases from the American colonies which raised questions about the constitutionality of colonial statutes, measured against the royal charters which set out the powers of the colonial governments.

By the early nineteenth century, the growth of the British Empire, which had greatly expanded the appellate jurisdiction of the Privy Council (despite the loss of appeals from the American colonies), had put great strains on the existing arrangements. In particular, the Appeals Committee had to hear cases arising from a variety of different legal systems in the colonies, such as Hindu law, with which its members were unfamiliar. Another serious problem was that the Appeals Committee was technically a committee of the whole of the entire Privy Council, of which a minimum of three were required for a quorum. Since many members of the Privy Council were not lawyers, all members of the Appeals Committee had equal votes, and there was no requirement that any of the Privy Counsellors actually hearing a particular appeal had to be a lawyer, it became possible for certain parties to appeal to secure desired judgments by persuading nonlawyer Privy Counsellors to attend the hearings on their appeals. For these reasons, the Appeals Committee fell into disrepute among better-informed lawyers and judges in the colonies.

In 1833, at the instigation of Lord Brougham, the Lord Chancellor, Parliament passed the Judicial Committee Act 1833. The Act established the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, a statutory committee of the Privy Council that would hear appeals to the King-in-Council. In addition to colonial appeals, later legislation gave the Judicial Committee appellate jurisdiction over a range of miscellaneous matters, such as patents, ecclesiastical matters, and prize suits. At its height, the Judicial Committee was said to be the court of final appeal for over a quarter of the world.

In the twentieth century, the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council shrank considerably, as British dominions established their own courts of final appeal and as British colonies became independent, although many retained appeals to the Privy Council post-independence. Canada abolished Privy Council appeals in 1949, India and South Africa in 1950, Australia in 1986, and New Zealand in 2003. Currently, eleven Commonwealth countries outside of the United Kingdom retain Privy Council appeals, in addition to various British and New Zealand territories. The Judicial Committee also retains jurisdiction over a small number of domestic matters in the United Kingdom, reduced by the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009.

== Jurisdiction ==

===Domestic jurisdiction===

The United Kingdom does not have a single highest national court; the Judicial Committee is the highest court of appeal in some cases, while in most others the highest court of appeal is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. (In Scotland the highest court in criminal cases is the High Court of Justiciary; the Supreme Court is the highest court in civil cases and matters arising from Scottish devolution, the latter previously having been dealt with by the Judicial Committee.)

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has jurisdiction in the following domestic matters:
*Appeals against schemes of the Church Commissioners (who control the estate of the Church of England).
*Appeals from the ecclesiastical courts (the Arches Court of Canterbury and the Chancery Court of York) in non-doctrinal faculty cases.
*Appeals from the High Court of Chivalry.
*Appeals from the Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports.
*Appeals from prize courts.
*Appeals from the Disciplinary Committee of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.
*Disputes under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975.

Additionally, the government may (through the King) refer any issue to the committee for &quot;consideration and report&quot; under section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833.

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the court of final appeal for the Church of England. It hears appeals from the Arches Court of Canterbury and the Chancery Court of York, except on matters of doctrine, ritual or ceremony, which go to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved. By the Church Discipline Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 86) and the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 all archbishops and bishops of the Church of England became eligible to be members of the Judicial Committee.

Prior to the coming into force of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the Privy Council was the court of last resort for devolution issues. On 1 October 2009 this jurisdiction was transferred to the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.

==== Authority of Privy Council decisions in domestic British courts ====

Judgments of the Judicial Committee are not generally binding on courts within the United Kingdom, having only persuasive authority, but are binding on all courts within any other Commonwealth country which still allows for appeals to the Judicial Committee. Where a binding precedent of the UK Supreme Court, or of the House of Lords, or of the Court of Appeal conflicts with that of a decision of the Judicial Committee on English law, English courts are required to follow the domestic decision over that of the Judicial Committee except when the Judicial Committee has in its decision expressly directed the domestic court to follow its new decision. However, given the overlap between the membership of the Judicial Committee and of the Supreme Court, the decisions of the former are extremely persuasive and usually followed.

===Overseas jurisdiction===

The Judicial Committee holds jurisdiction in appeals from the following 32 jurisdictions (including eleven independent nations):

===Jurisdiction removed===

Judicial appeal of final resort has been assumed by other bodies in some current and former Commonwealth countries:


The following countries or territories did not retain the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee at the time of independence or of the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom: Burma (1948), Israel (1948), Somaliland (1960), Cyprus (1960), Zanzibar (1963), Zambia (1964), Rhodesia (1965), South Yemen (1967), Swaziland (1968), Papua New Guinea (1975), Seychelles (1976), Solomon Islands (1978), Vanuatu (1980), Hong Kong (1997).

==Composition==

===Members===

The following are members of the Judicial Committee:

*Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (before the establishment of that court in 2009, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary)
*Other Lords of Appeal (senior judges) from within the United Kingdom
*Privy Counsellors who are (or have been) judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the Inner House of the Court of Session in Scotland, or of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland
*Judges of certain superior courts in Commonwealth nations, who are appointed Privy Counsellors for the purpose of sitting in the JCPC

The bulk of the Committee&#x27;s work is done by the Supreme Court Justices, who are paid to work full-time in both the Supreme Court and the Privy Council. Overseas judges may not sit when certain UK domestic matters are being heard, but will often sit when appeals from their own countries are being heard.

Until 1904 the Registrar of the Admiralty court was also Registrar to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in ecclesiastical and maritime causes.

== Procedure ==

Most appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are formally appeals to &quot;His Majesty in Council&quot;. Appeals from Brunei are formally to the Sultan and Yang di-Pertuan, while appeals from republics within the Commonwealth are directly to the Judicial Committee. Appeals are generally by leave of the local Court of Appeal, although the Judicial Committee retains discretionary power to grant leave to appeal as well.

After hearing an appeal, the panel of judges which heard the case (known as &quot;the Board&quot;) issues its decision in writing. For appeals to His Majesty in Council, the Board submits its decision to the King as advice for his consideration. By convention, the advice is always accepted by the King and given effect via an Order in Council.

Historically, the Judicial Committee could only give a unanimous report, but since the Judicial Committee (Dissenting Opinions) Order 1966, dissenting opinions have been allowed.

The Judicial Committee is not bound by its own previous decisions, but may depart from them in exceptional circumstances if following its previous decisions would be unjust or contrary to public policy.

== Location ==

The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is based in London. From its establishment to 2009, it mainly met in the Privy Council Chamber in Downing Street, although increase in the Judicial Committee&#x27;s business in the twentieth century required it to sit simultaneously in several panels, which met elsewhere. The Chamber, designed by John Soane, was often criticised for its interior design, and was extensively remodelled in 1845 by Sir Charles Barry. On 1 October 2009, the Judicial Committee moved to the former Middlesex Guildhall building, which had been refurbished in 2007 to provide a home for both the JCPC and the newly created Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. In this renovated building, Court 3 is used for Privy Council sittings.

In recent years, the Judicial Committee has occasionally sat outside of London. Between 2005 and 2010 it sat twice in Mauritius and three times in the Bahamas.

==Decline in Commonwealth appeals==

Initially, all Commonwealth realms and their territories maintained a right of appeal to the Privy Council. Many of those Commonwealth countries that became republics, or which had indigenous monarchies, preserved the Judicial Committee&#x27;s jurisdiction by agreement with the United Kingdom. However, retention of a right of appeal to a court located overseas, made up mostly of British judges who may be out of tune with local values, has often come to be seen as incompatible with notions of an independent nation&#x27;s sovereign status, and so a number of Commonwealth members have ended the right of appeal from their jurisdiction. The Balfour Declaration of 1926, while not considered to be &quot;lex scripta&quot;, severely limited the conditions under which the Judicial Committee might hear cases:

===Australia===

In 1901, the Constitution of Australia limited appeals from the new federal High Court of Australia to the Privy Council, by prohibiting appeals on constitutional matters unless leave is granted by the High Court on &quot;inter se&quot; questions. Appeals on non-constitutional matters were not prohibited, but the federal Parliament of Australia had the power to legislate to limit them. The right of appeal from federal courts (including territory supreme courts) was abolished through the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968. Appeals from state courts, a continuation of the right to appeal decisions of colonial courts before 1901, continued, until they were also abolished by the Australia Act 1986, which was enacted by both the UK and Australian parliaments, on the request of all the state governments. The Australian Constitution retains the provision allowing the High Court of Australia to permit appeals to the Privy Council on &quot;inter se&quot; questions. However, the only time such permission was given was in 1912 and the High Court has stated that it will not grant it again, since the jurisdiction to do so &quot;has long since been spent&quot;, and it is obsolete.

===Canada===

Canada created its own Supreme Court in 1875 and abolished appeals to the Privy Council in criminal cases in 1933. Despite this, some decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada went on to appeal in the JCPC, including notably the Persons Case (&quot;Edwards v Canada (AG)&quot;), which affirmed that women had always been &quot;qualified persons&quot; under the British North America Act, 1867 (Canada&#x27;s Constitution) eligible to sit in the Senate of Canada. In this case, it also used a metaphor in the &quot;obiter dicta&quot;, later reinterpreted and employed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1980s to establish what came to be known as the &quot;living tree doctrine&quot; in Canadian Constitutional law, which says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and liberal manner so as to adapt it to changing times.

In 1949, all appeals to the Privy Council were abolished, but prior to this, there were several factors that served to limit the effectiveness of measures to reduce appeals:

*Appeals of rulings from the various provincial courts of appeal could still be made directly to the Privy Council, without first going to the Supreme Court of Canada.
*In &quot;Cushing v. Dupuy&quot; (1885), the Privy Council held that the ability to grant special leave to appeal to the Privy Council was unaffected, as the prerogative of the Crown cannot be taken away except by express words.
*In &quot;Nadan v The King&quot; (1926), the Privy Council ruled that the provision of the Criminal Code barring appeals to the Privy Council was &quot;ultra vires&quot; of the Parliament of Canada as it was contrary to s. 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865.

&quot;Nadan&quot;, together with the King–Byng Affair, was a major irritant for Canada and provoked the discussion at the 1926 Imperial Conference which led to the Balfour Declaration, which declared the United Kingdom and the dominions to be
With that Declaration and its statutory confirmation in the Statute of Westminster 1931 (Imp, 22–23 Geo 5, c.4) the impediment to abolishing appeals to the Privy Council, whether or not it had been legitimate, was comprehensively removed. Criminal appeals to the Privy Council were ended in 1933. Moves to extend the abolition to civil matters were shelved during the growing international crisis of the 1930s but re-tabled after the Second World War, and civil appeals ended in 1949, with an amendment of the Supreme Court Act. Cases begun before 1949 were still allowed to appeal after 1949, and the final case to make it to the Council was not until 1959 with the case of &quot;Ponoka-Calmar Oils v Wakefield&quot;.

The JCPC played a controversial role in the evolution of Canadian federalism in that, whereas some Fathers of Confederation in negotiating the union of the British North American colonies against the backdrop of the American Civil War wished to ensure a strong central government vis-à-vis relatively weak provinces, appeals to the JCPC in constitutional matters progressively shifted the balance in favour of the provinces. While a few commentators have suggested that Canadian First Nations retain the right to appeal to the Privy Council because their treaties predate their relationship to Canada, the JCPC has not entertained any such appeal since 1867 and the dominant view is that no such appeal right exists.

===Caribbean Community===

The nations of the Caribbean Community voted in 2001 to abolish the right of appeal to the Privy Council in favour of a Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ). Some debate between member countries and also the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had repeatedly delayed the court&#x27;s date of inauguration. As of 2005, Barbados replaced the process of appeals to Her Majesty in Council with the CCJ, which had then come into operation. The Co-operative Republic of Guyana also enacted local legislation allowing the CCJ to have jurisdiction over their sovereign final court of appeals system. Belize acceded to the Appellate Jurisdiction of the CCJ on 1 June 2010. As it stands, a few other CARICOM states appear to be ready for the abolition of appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the immediate future. The government of Jamaica in particular had come close and attempted to abolish appeals to the Judicial Committee without the support of the opposition in Parliament; however, it was ruled by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that the procedure used in Jamaica to bypass the opposition was incorrect and unconstitutional. Another attempt will also be forthcoming.

Caribbean governments have been coming under increased pressure from their electorates to devise ways to override previous rulings by the JCPC such as &quot;Pratt v A-G&quot; (Jamaica, 1993), &quot;R v Hughes&quot; (Saint Lucia, 2002), &quot;Fox v R&quot; (Saint Kitts and Nevis, 2002), &quot;Reyes v R&quot; (2002, Belize), &quot;Boyce v R&quot; (Barbados, 2004), and &quot;Matthew v S&quot; (Trinidad and Tobago, 2004), all of which are Privy Council judgments concerning the death penalty in the Caribbean region.

The then President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, has voiced displeasure with Caribbean and other Commonwealth countries continuing to rely on the British JCPC. During an interview Lord Phillips was quoted by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as saying that in an ideal world&#x27; Commonwealth countries—including those in the Caribbean—would stop using the Privy Council and set up their own final courts of appeal instead&quot;.

On 18 December 2006, the Judicial Committee made history when for the first time in more than 170 years it ventured outside London, holding a five-day sitting in the Bahamas. Lords Bingham, Brown, Carswell, and Scott, and Baroness Hale of Richmond, travelled to the Bahamas for the special sitting at the invitation of Dame Joan Sawyer, then the President of the Court of Appeal of the Bahamas; the Committee returned to the Bahamas in December 2007 for a second sitting. On the latter occasion, Lords Hope, Rodger, Walker, and Mance, and Sir Christopher Rose, heard several cases. At the end of the sitting, Lord Hope indicated that there may be future sittings of the Committee in the Bahamas, and the Committee has indeed sat in the Bahamas again, in 2009.

The 2018 Antiguan constitutional referendum saw the proposal to replace the JCPC with the CCJ rejected by a 52.04% majority.

On 28 February 2023, the parliament of Saint Lucia approved the Constitution of St Lucia Amendment Bill 2023, which would replace the JCPC with the CCJ.

An injunction against Saint Lucia&#x27;s accession to the CCJ was filed on 3 March 2023 against the bill in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in the High Court of Justice of Saint Lucia, and is currently pending.

===Sri Lanka (Ceylon)===

Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon, abolished appeals to the Privy Council under the Court of Appeal Act, 1971, which came into effect on 15 November 1971. Previously, the Privy Council had ruled in &quot;Ibralebbe v The Queen&quot; that it remained the highest court of appeal in Ceylon notwithstanding the country&#x27;s independence as a dominion in 1948.

===The Gambia===

The Gambia retained the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council under the Gambia Independence Act 1964, even after The Gambia became a republic in the Commonwealth of Nations in April 1970 under Sir Dawda Jawara. Appeals were still taken to the JCPC from 1994 to 1998, when Yahya Jammeh, the then dictator and President of the Gambia decided to restructure the Gambian judiciary under the 1997 Constitution of the Gambia to replace the JCPC with the Supreme Court of the Gambia.

The last case from The Gambia to the JCPC was &quot;West Coast Air Limited v. Gambia Civil Aviation Authority and Others&quot; UKPC 39 (15 September 1998).

===Grenada===

Grenadian appeals to the Privy Council were temporarily abolished from 1979 until 1991, as a result of the Grenadian Revolution, which brought Prime Minister Maurice Bishop to power. People&#x27;s Law 84 was enacted to this effect. In 1985, &quot;Mitchell v DPP&quot; affirmed Grenada&#x27;s right to unilaterally abolish appeals to the Privy Council. In 1991, Grenada restored the JCPC&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In 2016, there was a proposal in the 2016 Grenadian constitutional referendum to terminate appeals from Grenada to the JCPC and to replace the JCPC with the Caribbean Court of Justice. This was rejected by a 56.73% majority, which means the JCPC remains Grenada&#x27;s highest court.

Another referendum, the 2018 Grenadian constitutional referendum also rejected terminating appeals to the JCPC by a 55.2% majority.

===Guyana===

Guyana retained the right of appeal to the Privy Council until the government of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham passed the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (Termination of Appeals) Act 1970 and the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1973.

===Hong Kong===

Hong Kong&#x27;s court system changed following the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China on 1 July 1997, with the Court of Final Appeal serving as the highest judicial authority of the Special Administrative Region (SAR), and (pursuant to Article 158 of the Basic Law, the constitutional instrument of the SAR) the power of final interpretation vested not in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong but in the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, a legislative body.

Decisions of the Privy Council on Hong Kong appeals before 1 July 1997 remain binding on the courts of Hong Kong. This accords with the principle of continuity of the legal system enshrined in Article 8 of the Basic Law. Decisions of the Privy Council on non-Hong Kong appeals are of persuasive authority only. Such decisions were not binding on the courts in Hong Kong under the doctrine of precedent before 1 July 1997 and are not binding today. Decisions of the House of Lords before 1 July 1997 stand in a similar position. It is of the greatest importance that the courts of Hong Kong should derive assistance from overseas jurisprudence, particularly from the final appellate courts of other common law jurisdictions. This is recognised by Article 84 of the Basic Law.

Pursuant to Article 158 of the Basic Law, the power of final interpretation of the Basic Law is vested not in the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong but in the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of China, which, unlike the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, is a political body rather than an independent and impartial tribunal of last resort.

===India===

India retained the right of appeal from the Federal Court of India to the Privy Council after the establishment of the Dominion of India. Following the replacement of the Federal Court with the Supreme Court of India in January 1950, the Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act 1949 came into effect, ending the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

===Irish Free State===

The right of appeal to the Privy Council was provided for in the Constitution of the Irish Free State until its abolition in 1933 by an Act of the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State, amending said constitution.

In &quot;Moore v Attorney-General of the Irish Free State&quot; the right of the Oireachtas to abolish appeals to the Privy Council was challenged as a violation of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. The then Attorney General for England and Wales (Sir Thomas Inskip) is reported to have warned the then Attorney-General of the Irish Free State (Conor Maguire) that the Irish Free State had no right to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council itself ruled that the Irish Free State Government had that right under the Statute of Westminster 1931 (Imp.).

===Jamaica===

In May 2015, the Jamaican House of Representatives approved, with the necessary two-thirds majority, bills to end legal appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and make the Caribbean Court of Justice Jamaica&#x27;s final court of appeal. The reform will be debated by the Jamaican Senate; however, the government needed the support of at least one opposition Senator for the measures to be approved by the required two-thirds majority. The 2016 general election was called before the reforms could be brought to the Senate for a final vote. The Jamaican Labour Party, which opposed the changes, won the election and has promised to hold a referendum on the issue.

===Malaysia===

Malaysia abolished appeals to the Privy Council in criminal and constitutional matters in 1978, and in civil matters in 1984.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand was the last of the original dominions to remove appeals to the Privy Council from its legal system. Proposals to abolish appeals to the Privy Council in New Zealand were first put forward in the early 1980s.

The Privy Council&#x27;s respect for local decisions was noted by Lord Brightman in 1985 in regard to the possible adoption of a New Zealand decision, in the case of &quot;Archer v. Cutler&quot; (1980), as a precedent, where he stated that:

In October 2003, with respect to all cases heard by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, New Zealand law was changed to abolish appeals to the Privy Council, after the end of 2003. The old system was replaced by the Supreme Court of New Zealand. In 2008, Prime Minister John Key ruled out any abolition of the Supreme Court and return to the Privy Council.

However, judgment on the last appeal from New Zealand to be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was not delivered until 3 March 2015.

===Newfoundland===
Newfoundland was one of the original Dominions, recognised in the Balfour Declaration and the Statute of Westminster 1931. Like the other Dominions, an appeal lay from the Newfoundland courts to the Judicial Committee.

In 1949, Newfoundland joined Canada as the tenth province. Like other provinces, an appeal continued to lie from the Newfoundland courts to the Judicial Committee. In late 1949, the federal Parliament abolished appeals to the Judicial Committee from courts in Canada, making the Supreme Court of Canada the final court of appeal. Cases started prior to the abolition could still be appealed to the Judicial Committee, but it does not appear that there were any cases from Newfoundland to the Judicial Committee after 1949.

===Pakistan===

The Dominion of Pakistan retained the right of appeal to the Privy Council from the Federal Court of Pakistan until the Privy Council (Abolition of Jurisdiction) Act, 1950 was passed. The Federal Court of Pakistan remained the highest court until 1956, when the Supreme Court of Pakistan was established.

===Rhodesia===

Despite the Rhodesian Constitution of 1965 coming into effect as a result of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, appeals continued to be accepted by the Privy Council as late as 1969 due to the fact that under international law, Rhodesia remained a British colony until gaining its independence as Zimbabwe in April 1980.

===Singapore===

Singapore abolished Privy Council appeals in all cases save those involving the death penalty, or in civil cases where the parties had agreed to such a right of appeal, in 1989. The remaining rights of appeal were abolished in April 1994.

One notable case in Singapore where an appeal against the death sentence was allowed by the Privy Council was a murder case that occurred in Pulau Ubin between 22 and 23 April 1972. In this case, Mohamed Yasin bin Hussein, who was 19 at the time of the murder, was sentenced to death by the High Court for murdering and raping a 58-year-old woman named Poon Sai Imm, while his 25-year-old accomplice Harun bin Ripin went to ransack the elderly woman&#x27;s house for items to rob (Harun, who also stood trial for murder together with Yasin, was instead sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment and received 12 strokes of the cane for a lesser charge of robbery at night). The Privy Council found that there was no evidence to show that Yasin had intended to cause death or any fatal bodily injury when he caused the fatal rib fractures on Poon while raping the struggling victim. As such, they found him guilty of committing a rash/negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide and sentenced him to two years&#x27; imprisonment. Following this appeal, Yasin was brought back to court to be charged with rape, and he was eventually jailed for another eight years for attempted rape of the victim.

Another notable case heard by the Privy Council was the case of Haw Tua Tau, a hawker who was sentenced to death in 1978 for the double murder of two hawkers Phoon Ah Leong and his mother Hu Yuen Keng. After his appeal was dismissed, Haw was granted special leave to appeal to the Privy Council against his sentence and conviction, but his appeal was dismissed by the Privy Council, which issued a landmark ruling that decreed the prosecution shall be allowed to present its case against an accused in court, as long as there is sufficient evidence to back a charge against the accused and hence present a case for the accused to answer. After losing his final appeal, Haw was eventually hanged in 1982 for the hawker killings.

===South Africa===

South Africa abolished the right of appeal to the Privy Council from the Appellate Division of the then Supreme Court of South Africa in 1950 under the terms of the Privy Council Appeals Act, 1950.

<text>The terms Jötunheimr (in Old Norse orthography: Jǫtunheimr ; often anglicised as Jotunheim) or Jötunheimar refer to either a land or multiple lands respectively in Nordic mythology inhabited by the jötnar (relatives of the gods, in English sometimes inaccurately called &quot;giants&quot;). 

 are typically, but not exclusively, presented in Eddic sources as prosperous lands located to the north and are commonly separated from the lands inhabited by gods and humans by barriers that cannot be traversed by usual means.

==Etymology==
 is a compound word formed from and , meaning a &#x27;home&#x27; or &#x27;world&#x27;. When attested in Eddic sources, the word is typically found in its plural form, (&#x27;-lands&#x27;).

==Attestations==
===Poetic Edda===

 are mentioned in three poems of the Poetic Edda. In the beginning of Völuspá, the coming of three women out of marks the end of the Age of Gold for the gods. Towards the end of the poem, in the section describing the onset of Ragnarök, they are mentioned as follows:

In the prose prologue Skírnismál, while sitting on Hliðskjálf, Freyr sees Gerðr, the daughter of Gymir, in and falls in love with her. A further prose section then describes that he gives his servant Skírnir his horse and sends him to her home at Gymisgarðar in , which he reaches after travelling through wet mountains, a flickering flame and darkness. After his journey, Skírnir meets Gerðr and her family living in a hall and tending to animals in the daylight, protected by a fence and dogs. Upon his return, Freyr asks in a stanza of the tidings from , to which his servant replies that she will meet him in nine nights at Barri.

In Þrymskviða, Loki uses Freyja&#x27;s fjaðrhamr to fly to Þrymr&#x27;s home in to find Thor&#x27;s hammer. The tells the god that he will only return the hammer in exchange for Freyja&#x27;s hand in marriage. When she refuses to go to , Thor goes in her place, disguised in a wedding veil, with Loki as his handmaid. In this account, Þrymr&#x27;s estate is presented as wealthy, with him holding dogs on golden leashes and telling that has cattle with golden horns in his stables and many jewels, with Freyja being the only thing he lacked.

===Gylfaginning===

 are referenced throughout Gylfaginning such as when Gefjun takes four oxen, who were her sons with a , out of the to the north and uses them to plough land out of Sweden, forming Zealand. and are also described as living in such as the father of Night, Narfi and Angrboða, the mother of Fenrir. Beings may also come out from to interact with others, such as the wright who, with the help of his horse Svaðilfari, builds fortifications for the gods to protect them from .

===Skáldskaparmál===
Skáldskaparmál tells of how Loki was once coerced into helping the Þjazi abduct Iðunn who carried her northwards, back to his home in named Þrymheimr. Using Freyja&#x27;s fjaðrhamr, Loki became a hawk and flew to Þjazi&#x27;s home while the was away, having rowed out to sea. Upon reaching Iðunn, Loki turned her into a nut and flew away with her in his talons. Þjazi later finds out that Iðunn is gone and he chases after them as an eagle, but is killed as he reached Asgard when he flies into a fire that the gods made.

Later in Skáldskaparmál, Odin rides to on Sleipnir where he meets the made of stone Hrungnir and wagers that no horse there was as good as his. Angered, Hrungnir chases Odin back to Asgard on his horse Gullfaxi whereupon the gods invite him to drink with them. Becoming drunk, he boasts that he will perform a number of acts including carrying Valhall to and abduct both Sif and Freyja. When the gods tired of his bragging, they called for Thor. Hrungnir claimed that as he was unarmed, Thor would gain no honour from killing him and so challenged him to a fight in , at his home Grjótúnagarðar. Thor later meets him there and kills him with Mjölnir, which on its way to Hrungnir, hits the hone that the was fighting with, shattering it. One of the pieces flies into Thor&#x27;s head, becoming stuck. To remove it, he went to the völva Gróa, who began a to loosen it. While she was singing, Thor told her that he had carried her husband Aurvandil as he travelled southwards out of and that he would soon be with her. In her excitement, she forgot the and the shard remained lodged in Thor&#x27;s head.

==Position in cosmology==
, along with other lands such as Hel, constitute &quot;the otherworld&quot; in Eddic sources that is either journeyed to or from, often leading to a confrontation that forms the basis for the narrative. There is no single location that are found in Nordic cosmology however, instead being travelled to by a number of different directions and often separated from the lands of humans and gods by a barrier that is difficult to cross such as bodies of water, fells, fire or forests. 

 are typically found in the North and East, with explicit references to locating them in the North, however in Gylfaginning, Snorri Sturluson writes that after the killing of Ymir, the gods gave the shores around the world to the to settle, suggesting a worldview in which Midgard is located centrally and that the dwell in the periphery, likely in contrast with how contemporary Icelanders would have viewed wilderness. Later in Gylfaginning, Thor journeys with Loki, Thjálfi and Röskva to which is located to the east and over the deep sea. They then travel through a great forest before eventually reaching the hall of Útgarða-Loki. Sometimes are positioned in specific geographical locations such as Ægir on the island of Læsø. 

It has been proposed that rather than being conceived of as a physical land that can be located geographically relative to the regions of the world inhabited by humans, should be seen as connected to other realms by a number of passageways that cannot be traversed by ordinary means, and may seem contradictory from a naturalistic viewpoint in that a single location could be reached from a start point in a number of distinct directions. In this model, the would not be located in these opposing directions, only the passageways by which they are reached. It has been further noted that in Eddic sources, it seems that are located to some extent in all directions and that they can be reached if one travels sufficiently far away from the area inhabited by people. From this, it has been suggested that it may be an intrinsic quality of as the &quot;other&quot; that they cannot be restricted to a single location, however, not all these lands inhabited by are explicitly described as being .

<text>Johann Friedrich Agricola (4 January 1720 – 2 December 1774) was a German composer, organist, singer, pedagogue, and writer on music. He sometimes wrote under the pseudonym Flavio Anicio Olibrio.

==Biography==
Agricola was born in Dobitschen, Thuringia.

===Leipzig===
While a student of law at Leipzig (1738–41) he studied music under Johann Sebastian Bach.

===Berlin===
In 1741 Agricola went to Berlin, where he studied musical composition under Johann Joachim Quantz. He was soon generally recognized as one of the most skillful organists of his time. The success of his comic opera, &quot;Il filosofo convinto in amore&quot;, performed at Potsdam in 1750, led to an appointment as court composer to Frederick the Great. In 1759, on the death of Carl Heinrich Graun, he was appointed conductor of the royal orchestra. He married the noted court operatic soprano Benedetta Emilia Molteni, despite the king&#x27;s prohibition of court employees marrying each other. Because of this trespass, the king reduced Molteni&#x27;s and Agricola&#x27;s combined salaries to a single annual salary of 1,000 &quot;Thalers&quot; (Agricola&#x27;s annual salary alone had been 1,500 &quot;Thalers&quot;). Agricola died in Berlin at age 54.

==Legacy==
Agricola wrote a number of Italian operas, as well as &quot;Lieder,&quot; chorale preludes, various other keyboard pieces and church music, especially oratorios and cantatas. His reputation chiefly rests, however, on his theoretical and critical writings on musical subjects.

===Author===
In 1754 he co-authored, with Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, J. S. Bach&#x27;s obituary. His 1757 &quot;Anleitung zur Singekunst&quot; (&quot;Introduction to the Art of Singing&quot;) is a translation of Pier Francesco Tosi&#x27;s 1723 treatise &quot;Opinioni de&#x27; cantori antichi e moderni&quot; with Agricola&#x27;s own extensive comments. He edited and added extensive commentary to the 1768 (posthumous) edition of Jakob Adlung&#x27;s &quot;Musica mechanica organoedi&quot; (English translation). His annotations are considered an important source of information on J. S. Bach&#x27;s views on the fortepiano designs of Gottfried Silbermann, on the lute-harpsichord, and on organ building.

===Copyist===
Agricola is also noted in Bach studies as one of the copyists for both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the St. Matthew Passion.

<doc id="15965" wikidata="Q192927" url="?curid=15965" title="James Hutton">
<text>James Hutton (; 3 June O.S. 1726 – 26 March 1797) was a Scottish geologist, agriculturalist, chemical manufacturer, naturalist and physician. Often referred to as the &quot;Father of Modern Geology,&quot; he played a key role in establishing geology as a modern science.

Hutton advanced the idea that the physical world&#x27;s remote history can be inferred from evidence in present-day rocks. Through his study of features in the landscape and coastlines of his native Scottish lowlands, such as Salisbury Crags or Siccar Point, he developed the theory that geological features could not be static but underwent continuing transformation over indefinitely long periods of time. From this he argued, in agreement with many other early geologists, that the Earth could not be young. He was one of the earliest proponents of what in the 1830s became known as uniformitarianism, the science which explains features of the Earth&#x27;s crust as the outcome of continuing natural processes over the long geologic time scale. Hutton also put forward a thesis for a &#x27;system of the habitable Earth&#x27; proposed as a deistic mechanism designed to keep the world eternally suitable for humans, an early attempt to formulate what today might be called one kind of anthropic principle.

Some reflections similar to those of Hutton can be found in publications of his contemporaries, such as the French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, but it is chiefly Hutton&#x27;s pioneering work that established the field.

==Early life and career==
Hutton was born in Edinburgh on 3 June O.S. 1726, as one of five children of Sarah Balfour and William Hutton, a merchant who was Edinburgh City Treasurer. Hutton&#x27;s father died in 1729, when he was three.

He was educated at the High School of Edinburgh where he was particularly interested in mathematics and chemistry, then when he was 14 he attended the University of Edinburgh as a &quot;student of humanity&quot;, studying the classics. He was apprenticed to the lawyer George Chalmers WS when he was 17, but took more interest in chemical experiments than legal work. At the age of 18, he became a physician&#x27;s assistant, and attended lectures in medicine at the University of Edinburgh.

After a two-year stay in Paris, James Hutton arrived in Leiden in 1749, where he enrolled at the University of Leiden on 14 August 1749, at the home of the then rector magnificus Joachim Schwartz to obtain a doctorate in medicine. He stayed with the widow Van der Tas (née Judith Bouvat) at the Langebrug, which corresponds to the current address Langebrug 101 in Leiden. His supervisor was Professor Frederik Winter, who was not only a professor at Leiden University, but also court physician to the Stadholder. The Latin manuscript of Hutton&#x27;s dissertation also contained 92 theses, two of which were successfully defended in public by James Hutton on 3 September 1749. On 12 September 1749, James Hutton obtained his doctorate in medicine from Leiden University with a physico-medical thesis entitled &quot;Sanguine et Circulatione Microcosmi.&quot; The thesis was printed by Wilhelmus Boot, book printer in Leiden. It is believed that James Hutton returned to Britain shortly after his promotion.

After his degree Hutton went to London, then in mid-1750 returned to Edinburgh and resumed chemical experiments with close friend, John Davie. Their work on production of sal ammoniac from soot led to their partnership in a profitable chemical works, manufacturing the crystalline salt which was used for dyeing, metalworking and as smelling salts and had been available only from natural sources and had to be imported from Egypt. Hutton owned and rented out properties in Edinburgh, employing a factor to manage this business.

===Farming and geology===
Hutton inherited from his father the Berwickshire farms of &quot;Slighhouses&quot;, a lowland farm which had been in the family since 1713, and the hill farm of &quot;Nether Monynut&quot;. In the early 1750s he moved to &quot;Slighhouses&quot; and set about making improvements, introducing farming practices from other parts of Britain and experimenting with plant and animal husbandry. He recorded his ideas and innovations in an unpublished treatise on &quot;The Elements of Agriculture&quot;.
This developed his interest in meteorology and geology. In a 1753 letter he wrote that he had &quot;become very fond of studying the surface of the earth, and was looking with anxious curiosity into every pit or ditch or bed of a river that fell in his way&quot;. Clearing and draining his farm provided ample opportunities. The mathematician John Playfair described Hutton as having noticed that &quot;a vast proportion of the present rocks are composed of materials afforded by the destruction of bodies, animal, vegetable and mineral, of more ancient formation&quot;. His theoretical ideas began to come together in 1760. While his farming activities continued, in 1764 he went on a geological tour of the north of Scotland with George Maxwell-Clerk, ancestor of the famous James Clerk Maxwell.

===Edinburgh and canal building===
In 1768, Hutton returned to Edinburgh, letting his farms to tenants but continuing to take an interest in farm improvements and research which included experiments carried out at &quot;Slighhouses&quot;. He developed a red dye made from the roots of the madder plant.

He had a house built in 1770 at St John&#x27;s Hill, Edinburgh, overlooking Salisbury Crags. This later became the Balfour family home and, in 1840, the birthplace of the psychiatrist James Crichton-Browne. Hutton was one of the most influential participants in the Scottish Enlightenment, and fell in with numerous first-class minds in the sciences including mathematician John Playfair, philosopher David Hume and economist Adam Smith. Hutton held no position in the University of Edinburgh and communicated his scientific findings through the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was particularly friendly with physician and chemist Joseph Black, and together with Adam Smith they founded the &quot;Oyster Club&quot; for weekly meetings.

Between 1767 and 1774 Hutton had close involvement with the construction of the Forth and Clyde canal, making full use of his geological knowledge, both as a shareholder and as a member of the committee of management, and attended meetings including extended site inspections of all the works. At this time he is listed as living on Bernard Street in Leith. In 1777 he published a pamphlet on &quot;Considerations on the Nature, Quality and Distinctions of Coal and Culm&quot; which successfully helped to obtain relief from excise duty on carrying small coal.

In 1783, he was a joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

==Later life and death==

From 1791 Hutton suffered extreme pain from stones in the bladder and gave up field work to concentrate on finishing his books. A dangerous and painful operation failed to resolve his illness. He died in Edinburgh and was buried in the vault of Andrew Balfour, opposite the vault of his friend Joseph Black, in the now sealed south-west section of Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh, commonly known as the Covenanter&#x27;s Prison.

Hutton did not marry and had no legitimate children. Around 1747, he had a son by a Miss Edington, and though he gave his child, James Smeaton Hutton, financial assistance, he had little to do with the boy, who went on to become a post-office clerk in London.

==Theory of rock formations==
Hutton developed several hypotheses to explain the rock formations he saw around him, but according to Playfair he &quot;was in no haste to publish his theory; for he was one of those who are much more delighted with the contemplation of truth, than with the praise of having discovered it&quot;. After some 25 years of work, his &quot;Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe&quot; was read to meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in two parts, the first by his friend Joseph Black on 7 March 1785, and the second by himself on 4 April 1785. Hutton subsequently read an abstract of his dissertation &quot;Concerning the System of the Earth, its Duration and Stability&quot; to Society meeting on 4 July 1785, which he had printed and circulated privately. In it, he outlined his theory as follows;

===Search for evidence===


In the summer of 1785 at Glen Tilt and other sites in the Cairngorm mountains in the Scottish Highlands, Hutton found granite penetrating metamorphic schists, in a way which indicated that the granite had been molten at the time. This was Hutton&#x27;s first geological field trip and he was invited by the Duke of Atholl to his hunting lodge, Forest Lodge. The exposures at the Dail-an-eas Bridge demonstrated to him that granite formed from the cooling of molten rock rather than it precipitating out of water as others at the time believed, and therefore the granite must be younger than the schists. Hutton presented his theory of the earth on 4 March and 7 April 1785, at the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

He went on to find a similar penetration of volcanic rock through sedimentary rock in Edinburgh, at Salisbury Crags, adjoining Arthur&#x27;s Seat – this area of the Crags is now known as Hutton&#x27;s Section. He found other examples in Galloway in 1786, and on the Isle of Arran in 1787.

The existence of angular unconformities had been noted by Nicolas Steno and by French geologists including Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, who interpreted them in terms of Neptunism as &quot;primary formations&quot;. Hutton wanted to examine such formations himself to see &quot;particular marks&quot; of the relationship between the rock layers. On the 1787 trip to the Isle of Arran he found his first example of Hutton&#x27;s Unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza, but the limited view meant that the condition of the underlying strata was not clear enough for him, and he incorrectly thought that the strata were conformable at a depth below the exposed outcrop.

Later in 1787 Hutton noted what is now known as the Hutton or &quot;Great&quot; Unconformity at Inchbonny, Jedburgh, in layers of sedimentary rock. As shown in the illustrations to the right, layers of greywacke in the lower layers of the cliff face are tilted almost vertically, and above an intervening layer of conglomerate lie horizontal layers of Old Red Sandstone. He later wrote of how he &quot;rejoiced at my good fortune in stumbling upon an object so interesting in the natural history of the earth, and which I had been long looking for in vain.&quot; That year, he found the same sequence in Teviotdale.
In the Spring of 1788 he set off with John Playfair to the Berwickshire coast and found more examples of this sequence in the valleys of the Tour and Pease Burns near Cockburnspath. They then took a boat trip from Dunglass Burn east along the coast with the geologist Sir James Hall of Dunglass. They found the sequence in the cliff below St. Helens, then just to the east at Siccar Point found what Hutton called &quot;a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea&quot;. Playfair later commented about the experience, &quot;the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time&quot;. Continuing along the coast, they made more discoveries including sections of the vertical beds showing strong ripple marks which gave Hutton &quot;great satisfaction&quot; as a confirmation of his supposition that these beds had been laid horizontally in water. He also found conglomerate at altitudes that demonstrated the extent of erosion of the strata, and said of this that &quot;we never should have dreamed of meeting with what we now perceived&quot;.

Hutton reasoned that there must have been innumerable cycles, each involving deposition on the seabed, uplift with tilting and erosion then undersea again for further layers to be deposited. On the belief that this was due to the same geological forces operating in the past as the very slow geological forces seen operating at the present day, the thicknesses of exposed rock layers implied to him enormous stretches of time.

==Publication==
Though Hutton circulated privately a printed version of the abstract of his Theory (&quot;Concerning the System of the Earth, its Duration, and Stability&quot;) which he read at a meeting of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 4 July 1785; the full account of his theory as read at 7 March 1785 and 4 April 1785 meetings did not appear in print until 1788. It was titled &quot;Theory of the Earth; or an Investigation of the Laws observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land upon the Globe&quot; and appeared in &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot;, vol. I, Part II, pp. 209–304, plates I and II, published 1788. He put forward the view that &quot;from what has actually been, we have data for concluding with regard to that which is to happen thereafter.&quot; This restated the Scottish Enlightenment concept which David Hume had put in 1777 as &quot;all inferences from experience suppose ... that the future will resemble the past&quot;, and Charles Lyell memorably rephrased in the 1830s as &quot;the present is the key to the past&quot;. Hutton&#x27;s 1788 paper concludes; &quot;The result, therefore, of our present enquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning,–no prospect of an end.&quot; His memorably phrased closing statement has long been celebrated. (It was quoted in the 1989 song &quot;No Control&quot; by songwriter and professor Greg Graffin.)

Following criticism, especially the arguments from Richard Kirwan who thought Hutton&#x27;s ideas were atheistic and not logical, Hutton published a two volume version of his theory in 1795, consisting of the 1788 version of his theory (with slight additions) along with a lot of material drawn from shorter papers Hutton already had to hand on various subjects such as the origin of granite. It included a review of alternative theories, such as those of Thomas Burnet and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon.

The whole was entitled &quot;An Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge and of the Progress of Reason, from Sense to Science and Philosophy&quot; when the third volume was completed in 1794. Its 2,138 pages prompted Playfair to remark that &quot;The great size of the book, and the obscurity which may justly be objected to many parts of it, have probably prevented it from being received as it deserves.&quot;

==Opposing theories==
His new theories placed him into opposition with the then-popular Neptunist theories of the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner, that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. Hutton proposed that the interior of the Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock: land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory was dubbed &quot;Plutonist&quot; in contrast to the flood-oriented theory.

As well as combating the Neptunists, he also accepted the growing consensus on the concept of deep time for scientific purposes. Rather than accepting that the earth was no more than a few thousand years old, he maintained that the Earth must be much older, with a history extending indefinitely into the distant past. His main line of argument was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen in a short period of time by means of catastrophe, but that processes still happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, to allow time for the changes. Contemporary investigations had shown that the geologic record required vast time, but no good way of assigning actual years was found for over a century (Rudwick, &quot;Bursting the Limits of Time&quot;). Hutton&#x27;s idea of infinite cycles with humans present throughout is quite different from modern geology, with a definite time of formation and directional change through time, but his supporting evidence for the long-term effects of geological processes was valuable in the development of historical geology.

==Acceptance of geological theories==
It has been claimed that the prose of &quot;Principles of Knowledge&quot; was so obscure that it also impeded the acceptance of Hutton&#x27;s geological theories. Restatements of his geological ideas (though not his thoughts on evolution) by John Playfair in 1802 and then Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the concept of an infinitely repeating cycle, though Lyell tended to dismiss Hutton&#x27;s views as giving too much credence to catastrophic changes.
==Other contributions==

===Meteorology===
It was not merely the earth to which Hutton directed his attention. He had long studied the changes of the atmosphere. The same volume in which his &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot; appeared contained also a &quot;Theory of Rain&quot;. He contended that the amount of moisture which the air can retain in solution increases with temperature, and, therefore, that on the mixture of two masses of air of different temperatures a portion of the moisture must be condensed and appear in visible form. He investigated the available data regarding rainfall and climate in different regions of the globe, and came to the conclusion that the rainfall is regulated by the humidity of the air on the one hand, and mixing of different air currents in the higher atmosphere on the other.

===Earth as a living entity===
Hutton taught that biological and geological processes are interlinked. James Lovelock, who developed the Gaia hypothesis in the 1970s, cites Hutton as saying that the Earth was a superorganism and that its proper study should be physiology. Lovelock writes that Hutton&#x27;s view of the Earth was rejected because of the intense reductionism among 19th-century scientists.

===Evolution===
Hutton also advocated uniformitarianism for living creatures evolution, in a senseand even suggested natural selection as a possible mechanism affecting them:

:...if an organised body is not in the situation and circumstances best adapted to its sustenance and propagation, then, in conceiving an indefinite variety among the individuals of that species, we must be assured, that, on the one hand, those which depart most from the best adapted constitution, will be the most liable to perish, while, on the other hand, those organised bodies, which most approach to the best constitution for the present circumstances, will be best adapted to continue, in preserving themselves and multiplying the individuals of their race.&quot;Investigation of the Principles of Knowledge&quot;, volume 2.

Hutton gave the example that where dogs survived through &quot;swiftness of foot and quickness of sight... the most defective in respect of those necessary qualities, would be the most subject to perish, and that those who employed them in greatest perfection... would be those who would remain, to preserve themselves, and to continue the race&quot;. Equally, if an acute sense of smell became &quot;more necessary to the sustenance of the animal... the same principle [would] change the qualities of the animal, and.. produce a race of well scented hounds, instead of those who catch their prey by swiftness&quot;. The same &quot;principle of variation&quot; would influence &quot;every species of plant, whether growing in a forest or a meadow&quot;. He came to his ideas as the result of experiments in plant and animal breeding, some of which he outlined in an unpublished manuscript, the &quot;Elements of Agriculture&quot;. He distinguished between heritable variation as the result of breeding, and non-heritable variations caused by environmental differences such as soil and climate.

Though he saw his &quot;principle of variation&quot; as explaining the development of varieties, Hutton rejected the idea that evolution might originate species as a &quot;romantic fantasy&quot;, according to palaeoclimatologist Paul Pearson. Influenced by deism, Hutton thought the mechanism allowed species to form varieties better adapted to particular conditions and provided evidence of benevolent design in nature. Studies of Charles Darwin&#x27;s notebooks have shown that Darwin arrived separately at the idea of natural selection which he set out in his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, but it has been speculated that he had some half-forgotten memory from his time as a student in Edinburgh of ideas of selection in nature as set out by Hutton, and by William Charles Wells and Patrick Matthew who had both been associated with the city before publishing their ideas on the topic early in the 19th century.

<text>Jakob Abbadie (; 25 September 1727), also known as Jacques or James Abbadie, was a French Protestant minister and writer. He became Dean of Killaloe, in Ireland.

==Life==
Jacques Abbadie was born at Nay, Béarn, probably in 1654, although 1657 and 1658 have been given; he is &quot;most probably the Jacques Abbadie who was the third child of Violente de Fortaner and Pierre Abbadie, baptized on 27 April 1654.&quot; Samuel Smiles stated that he was &quot;the scion of a distinguished Béarnese family&quot;; although it is probable that the poverty of his parents would have excluded him from a learned career if some of the leading Protestants of the district had not charged themselves with the expenses of his education, which was begun under M. Jean de la Placette, the minister of Nay, He studied at Puylaurens, the Academy of Saumur, and the Academy of Sedan, receiving the degree of doctor in theology, it is said, at the age of seventeen. An obituary notice, however, which appeared in the &quot;Daily Courant&quot; for 5 October 1727, says: &quot;He was not above twenty-two when he undertook of himself his admirable treatise on the &quot;Truth of the Christian Religion&quot;&quot;.

About the same time he was sent for by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, to be minister of the French church at Berlin; the electoral summons found Abbadie at Paris, and it was conveyed through the Count d&#x27;Espense, who had been commissioned by his master to make the selection. The congregation of refugees, small enough at first to be accommodated in an apartment of the Count d&#x27;Espense&#x27;s residence, grew gradually from increased emigration to Brandenburg, caused by the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. The elector ordered the ancient chapel of his palace to be prepared for the congregation, and the services were frequently attended by the younger members of his family. Abbadie&#x27;s arrival in Berlin has been variously assigned to the years 1680 and 1681. During seven or eight years he used his increasing favour with the elector to relieve the distress of the refugees from France, and especially from his native province of Béarn. Abbadie continued to occupy his pastorate at Berlin until the death of the great elector, which took place 29 April 1688.

He then accompanied Marshal Schomberg to England in 1688, and the following year became minister of the French Church of the Savoy, London. In the autumn of 1689 he went to Ireland with the marshal.

After the Battle of the Boyne, Abbadie returned to London. He subsequently published a revised version of the French translation of the English liturgy used at this church, with an epistle dedicatory to George I. He was often appointed to deliver occasional discourses, both in London and Dublin, but his lack of facility in English prevented his preferment in England, and also excluded him from the deanery of St. Patrick&#x27;s, Dublin, to which William III wished to promote him. Abbadie&#x27;s health suffered from devotion to his duties in the Savoy and from the English climate. He therefore settled in Ireland, and in 1699 the deanery of Killaloe was conferred on him by the king. whose favour he had attracted by a vindication of the Revolution of 1688.

The remainder of Abbadie&#x27;s life was spent in writing and preaching, and in the performance—not too sedulous, for he was frequently absent from his benefice—of the ordinary duties of his office, varied by visits to England and to Holland, where most of his books were printed. Abbadie visited Holland to see his &quot;La Vérité&quot; through the press, and stayed more than three years in Amsterdam, 1720–23, during the preparation of &quot;Le Triomphe&quot; and other works. He returned to Ireland in 1723. Abbadie&#x27;s income as dean of Killaloe was so small that he could not afford a literary amanuensis; and Hugh Boulter, archbishop of Armagh, having appealed in vain to Lord Carteret, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, on Abbadie&#x27;s behalf, gave him a letter of introduction to Dr. Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, and Abbadie left Ireland. He established himself at Marylebone. He died at his lodgings at Marylebone on Monday, 25 September 1727, aged 73.

==Works==
Abbadie is best known by his religious treatises, several of which were translated from the original French into other languages and had a wide circulation throughout Europe. The most important of these are &quot;Traite de la verité de la religion chrétienne&quot; (1684); its continuation, &quot;Traité de la divinité de Jesus-Christ&quot; (1689); and &quot;L&#x27;Art de se connaitre soi-meme&quot; (1692).

While at Berlin, he made several visits to the Netherlands, in 1684, 1686, and 1688, chiefly for the purpose of superintending the printing of several of his works, including the &quot;Traité de la Vérité&quot;, Rotterdam, 1684. The book went through a vast number of editions and was translated into several languages, an English version, by Henry Lussan, appearing in 1694. Completed by a third volume, the &quot;Traité de la Divinité de Nôtre Seigneur Jésus-Christ&quot;, it appeared at Rotterdam, 1689. An English translation, entitled &quot;A Sovereign Antidote against Arian Poyson&quot;, appeared in London, 1719, and again &quot;revised, corrected, and, in a few places, abridged&quot;, by Abraham Booth, under the title of &quot;The Deity of Jesus Christ essential to the Christian Religion&quot;, 1777. The entire apology for Christianity formed by the three volumes of the &quot;Traité&quot;, which combated severally the heresies of atheism, deism, and Socinianism, was received with praise. &quot;La Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne Réformée&quot; (1717) was a controversial treatise which in its four parts attacks the characteristic doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church; it was translated into English, for the use of the Roman Catholics of his diocese of Dromore, by Dr. Ralph Lambert, afterwards bishop of Meath. The work was completed in 1723 in &quot;Le Triomphe de la Providence et de la Religion; ou, l&#x27;Ouverture des sept Seaux par le Fils de Dieu, où l&#x27;on trouvera la première partie de l&#x27;Apocalypse clairement expliquée par ce qu&#x27;il y a de plus connu dans l&#x27;Histoire et de moins contesté dans la Parole de Dieu. Avec une nouvelle et très-sensible Démonstration de la Vérité de la Religion Chrétienne&quot;.

It was in the Irish camp with Schomberg that Abbadie commenced one of his most successful works, which was published at Rotterdam in 1692, as &quot;L&#x27;Art de se connoître soi-même; ou, La Recherche des Sources de la Morale&quot;, and went through many editions and amplifications. Translations of this work into other languages include a popular English version by the Rev. Thomas Woodcock, &quot;The Art of Knowing One-self&quot;, 1694. The last 50 pages of this 274-page work deals with pride, which he divided into five branches: love of esteem, presumptuousness, vanity, ambition and arrogance.

Among the early writings of Abbadie were four &quot;Sermons sur divers Textes de l&#x27;Ecriture&quot;, 1680; &quot;Réflexions sur la Présence réelle du Corps de Jésus-Christ dans l&#x27;Eucharistie&quot;, 1685; and two highly adulatory addresses on persons in high stations, entitled respectively &quot;Panégyrique de Monseigneur l&#x27;Electeur de Brandebourg&quot;, 1684; and &quot;Panégyrique de Marie Stuart, Reine d&#x27;Angleterre, d&#x27;Ecosse, de France, et d&#x27;Irlande, de glorieuse et immortelle mémoire, décédée à Kensington le 28 décembre 1694&quot;, 1695, also published in England as &quot;A Panegyric on our late Sovereign Lady&quot;, 1695. These four productions, with other occasional sermons, were in 1760 republished collectively, in three volumes, at Amsterdam, and preceded by an &quot;Essai historique sur la Vie et les Ouvrages de M. Abbadie&quot;. The pamphlet on the Eucharist was also reprinted at Toulouse, in 1835, under the title of &quot;Quatre Lettres sur la Trans-substantiation&quot;, and appeared in an English translation, by John W. Hamersley, as the &quot;Chemical Change in the Eucharist&quot;, 1867.

&quot;Défense de la Nation Britannique&quot;, 1693 was an elaborate defence of the Glorious Revolution, written in answer to Pierre Bayle&#x27;s &quot;Avis important aux Réfugiés&quot;, 1690. He gave a funeral oration on Queen Mary. Abbadie had also written, at the request of the king, &quot;Histoire de la dernière Conspiration d&#x27;Angleterre&quot;, 1696, a history of the conspiracy of 1696, which was reprinted in Holland and translated into English, and for which the Earl of Portland and Secretary Sir William Trumbull placed original documents at the author&#x27;s disposal. This work helped Abbadie&#x27;s preferment. After its production, &quot;his majesty sent him to Ireland, with an order to the lords justices to confer upon him some dignity in the church, which order was complied with by his promotion to the deanery of Killalow&quot; (&quot;Daily Courant,&quot; 5 October 1727).

He revised his works for a complete edition in four volumes, in which were also to be included two unpublished treatises, &quot;Nouvelle Manière de prouver l&#x27;Immortalité de l&#x27;Ame&quot;, and &quot;Notes sur le Commentaire philosophique de M. Bayle&quot;. No trace of them could be found after his death.

<doc id="15967" wikidata="Q294927" url="?curid=15967" title="Jerry Lewis">
<text>Jerry Lewis (born Joseph Levitch; March 16, 1926 – August 20, 2017) was an American comedian, filmmaker, actor, humanitarian and singer, famously nicknamed as &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;. His career rose to prominence together with singer Dean Martin, billed as Martin and Lewis, in 1946. For ten years, the two did a series of sixteen buddy-comedy films, along with their televised run on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, live stage performances, guest spots on other shows and a radio series. 

After the team&#x27;s split in 1956, Lewis became a highly popular solo movie star in twenty-eight motion pictures from 1957 to 1970, including his well-known hits &quot;The Bellboy&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963). For television, he hosted &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot; (both the ABC and NBC telecasts in 1963 and 1967) and did guest shots on other TV programs. Lewis starred in six more comedic features from 1981 to 1984, including Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1982), in which he played the role of a talk show host, earning a nomination for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also had a lasting friendship and bond with Sammy Davis Jr. The two met around 1950 and performed together into the 1980s.

Beyond his contributions to the entertainment industry, Lewis devoted time to raising funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) through his annual Labor Day-held telethon, a TV event that aired over five decades.

Lewis performed in concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings and appeared in at least 117 film and television productions. He was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and France awarded him the Legion of Honor in 2006.

==Early life==
Lewis was born on March 16, 1926, in Newark, New Jersey, to a Jewish family. His parents were Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Levitch (1902–1980), a master of ceremonies and vaudevillian who performed under the stage name Danny Lewis, whose parents immigrated to the United States from the Russian Empire to New York, and Rachael &quot;Rae&quot; Levitch (née Brodsky; 1904–1982), a WOR radio pianist and Danny&#x27;s music director, from Warsaw. Reports about his birth name are conflicting; in Lewis&#x27; 1982 autobiography, he claimed his birth name was Joseph, after his maternal grandfather, but his birth certificate, the 1930 U. S. Census, and the 1940 U. S. Census all named him as Jerome. Reports about the hospital where he was born conflict as well; biographer Shawn Levy claims Lewis was born at Clinton Private Hospital and others report it as Newark Beth Israel Hospital. Other aspects of his early life conflict with accounts made by family members, burial records, and vital records.

In his teenage years, Lewis was known for pulling pranks in his neighborhood, including sneaking into kitchens to steal fried chicken and pies. He was expelled from Weequahic High School in the ninth grade and dropped out of Irvington High School in the tenth grade. Lewis said that he ceased using the names Joseph and Joey as an adult to avoid being confused with Joe E. Lewis and Joe Louis. By age 15, Lewis had developed his &quot;Record Act&quot;, miming lyrics to songs while a phonograph played offstage. He landed a gig at a burlesque house in Buffalo, but his performance fell flat and he was unable to book any more shows.

To make ends meet, Lewis worked as a soda jerk and a theater usher for Suzanne Pleshette&#x27;s father, Gene Pleshette, at the Paramount Theatre as well as at Loew&#x27;s Capitol Theatre, both in New York City. A veteran burlesque comedian, Max Coleman, who had worked with Lewis&#x27; father years before, persuaded him to try again. Irving Kaye, a Borscht Belt comedian, saw Lewis&#x27; mime act at Brown&#x27;s Hotel in Loch Sheldrake, New York, the following summer, and the audience was so enthusiastic that Kaye became Lewis&#x27; manager and guardian for Borscht Belt appearances. During World War II, Lewis was rejected from military service because of a heart murmur.

==Career==
===Teaming with Dean Martin===
In 1945, Lewis was 19 when he met 27-year-old singer Dean Martin at the Glass Hat Club in New York City, where the two performed until they debuted at Atlantic City&#x27;s 500 Club as Martin and Lewis on July 25, 1946. The duo gained attention as a double act with Martin serving as the straight man to Lewis&#x27;s zany antics. The inclusion of ad-libbed improvisational segments in their planned routines added a unique quality to their act and separated them from previous comedy duos.

Lewis and Martin quickly rose to national prominence, first with their popular nightclub act, then as stars of their radio program &quot;The Martin and Lewis Show.&quot; The two made their television debut on CBS&#x27; &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; (later renamed as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;) June 20, 1948.

In 1950, they signed with NBC to be one of a series of weekly rotating hosts of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour,&quot; a live Sunday evening broadcast. Lewis, writer for the team&#x27;s nightclub act, hired Norman Lear and Ed Simmons as regular writers for their &quot;Comedy Hour&quot; material. By 1951, with an appearance at the Paramount Theatre in New York, they were a hit. The duo began their film careers at Paramount Pictures as ensemble players, in &quot;My Friend Irma&quot; (1949) and its sequel &quot;My Friend Irma Goes West&quot; (1950). Followed by their own series of 14 new movies, &quot;At War with the Army&quot; (1950), &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (1951), &quot;Sailor Beware&quot; (1952), &quot;Jumping Jacks&quot; (1952), &quot;The Stooge&quot; (1952), &quot;Scared Stiff&quot; (1953), &quot;The Caddy&quot; (1953), &quot;Money from Home&quot; (1953), &quot;Living It Up&quot; (1954), &quot;3 Ring Circus&quot; (1954), &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Young&quot; (1955), &quot;Artists and Models&quot; (1955), &quot;Pardners&quot; (1956) and &quot;Hollywood or Bust&quot; (1956). The two appeared on the &quot;Olympic Fund Telethon&quot; and cameoed in &quot;Road to Bali&quot; (1952).

Crosby and Hope would do the same in &quot;Scared Stiff&quot; a year later. Attesting to the duo&#x27;s popularity, DC Comics published &quot;The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis&quot; from 1952 to 1957. The team appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1954, the 27th annual Academy Awards in 1955, &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; and &quot;The Today Show&quot; in 1956. Martin&#x27;s participation became an embarrassment in 1954 when &quot;Look&quot; magazine published a publicity photo of the team for the magazine cover but cropped Martin out.

The boys did their final live nightclub act at the Copacabana on July 24, 1956. Both Lewis and Martin went on to have successful solo careers, but neither would comment on the split nor consider a reunion. Martin surprised Lewis on his appearance on &quot;The Eddie Fisher Show&quot; on September 30, 1958, appeared together at the 1959 Academy Awards closing, reunited several times publicly and sometimes privately according to interviews they gave to magazines.

===Solo performances and live shows ===
After ending his partnership with Martin in 1956, Lewis and his wife Patty took a vacation in Las Vegas to consider the direction of his career. He felt his life was in a crisis state: &quot;I was unable to put one foot in front of the other with any confidence. I was completely unnerved to be alone.&quot; While there, he received an urgent request from his friend Sid Luft, who was Judy Garland&#x27;s husband and manager, saying that she couldn&#x27;t perform that night in Las Vegas because of strep throat, and asking Lewis to fill in. Lewis had not sung alone on stage since he was five years old, twenty-five years before.

He delivered jokes and clowned with the audience while Garland sat off-stage, watching. He then sang a rendition of a song he had learned as a child, &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot; along with &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine.&quot; Lewis recalled, &quot;When I was done, the place exploded. I walked off the stage knowing I could make it on my own.&quot; At his wife&#x27;s urging, Lewis used his own money to record the songs on a single. Decca Records heard it, liked it and insisted he record an album for them. The single of &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby&quot; went to No. 10 and the album &quot;Jerry Lewis Just Sings&quot; went to No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, staying near the top for four months and selling a million and a half copies.

With the success of that album, he recorded additional albums &quot;More Jerry Lewis&quot; (an EP of songs from this release was released as &quot;Somebody Loves Me&quot;), and &quot;Jerry Lewis Sings Big Songs for Little People&quot; (later reissued with fewer tracks as &quot;Jerry Lewis Sings for Children&quot;). Non-album singles were released, and &quot;It All Depends On You&quot; hit the charts in April and May 1957, but peaked at only No. 68. Further singles were recorded and released by Lewis into the mid-1960s. But these were not Lewis&#x27;s first forays into recording, nor his first appearance on the hit charts. During his partnership with Martin, they made several recordings together, charting at No. 22 in 1948 with the 1920s &quot;That Certain Party&quot; and later mostly re-recording songs highlighted in their films.

In late 1956, Lewis began performing regularly at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which marked a turning point in his life and career. The Sands signed him for five years to perform six weeks each year and paid him the same amount they had paid Martin and Lewis as a team. Live performances became a staple of Lewis&#x27;s career and over the years he performed at casinos, theaters, and state fairs. In February 1957, Lewis followed Garland at the Palace Theater in New York and Martin called on the phone during this period to wish him the best of luck. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been happier&quot;, said Lewis. &quot;I have peace of mind for the first time.&quot; Lewis established himself as a solo act, starting with the first of six appearances on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; from 1956 to 1966, then guest starred on &quot;The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show&quot;, &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

In January 1957, Lewis did a number of solo specials for NBC and starred in his adaptation of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; for &quot;Startime&quot;, then hosted the Academy Awards three times, in 1956, 1957 and 1959. The third telecast, which ran twenty minutes short, forced him to improvise to fill time.

Lewis remained at Paramount and started off with his first solo film &quot;The Delicate Delinquent&quot; (1957) then starred in &quot;The Sad Sack&quot; (1957). Frank Tashlin, whose background as a &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon director (for Warner Bros.) suited Lewis&#x27;s brand of humor and came on board. The pair did new films, first with &quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby&quot; (1958) and then &quot;The Geisha Boy&quot; (1958). Billy Wilder asked Lewis to play the lead role of an uptight jazz musician, who winds up on the run from a mob in &quot;Some Like It Hot,&quot; but he turned it down. Lewis then appeared in &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up The Ship&quot; (1959) and cameoed in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959).

A 1959 contract between Paramount and Jerry Lewis Productions specified a payment of $10 million plus 60% of the profits for 14 films over seven years. This made Lewis the highest paid individual Hollywood talent to date and was unprecedented in that he had unlimited creative control, including final cut and the return of film rights after 30 years. Lewis&#x27;s clout and box office were so strong that Barney Balaban, head of production at Paramount, told the press, &quot;If Jerry wants to burn down the studio I&#x27;ll give him the match!&quot;

=== Paramount films ===

Lewis ended his association with Hal Wallis, their last joint venture being &quot;Visit to a Small Planet&quot; (1960). His next film was &quot;Cinderfella&quot; (1960), directed by Frank Tashlin; it was supposed to be Lewis&#x27;s summer release, but Paramount withheld it in preparation for a Christmas 1960 release. Paramount, needing a quickie movie for its summer 1960 schedule, insisted that Lewis must produce one.

This resulted in Lewis&#x27;s sudden transformation from movie clown to all-around filmmaker. He produced, directed, co-wrote, and starred in &quot;The Bellboy&quot; (1960). Using the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami as his setting—on a small budget, with a very tight shooting schedule—Lewis shot the film during the day and performed at the hotel in the evenings. Bill Richmond collaborated with him on many of the episodic blackouts and sight gags. The film presented a new approach for the usually frenetic and highly vocal comedian: in &quot;The Bellboy&quot; Lewis doesn&#x27;t speak at all—he only whistles—until a punchline at the very end of the film.

This was really a time-saving device; by concentrating on visual action, Lewis could film the scenes faster without bothering to remember written dialogue. Another time-saver was his innovative use of &quot;video assist&quot;--instant video playback, which allowed Lewis to review each scene on videotape immediately after filming it, thus eliminating film-laboratory delays and expenses. Trade reviewer Pete Harrison noted the sight gags but felt that Lewis was not a true pantomime artist: &quot;As a mute, there are only brief moments of his work coming close to Chaplin, Jacques Tati, or Harpo Marx. Lewis, always laughed at, fails to win the viewer&#x27;s heart.&quot; 

Lewis later revealed that Paramount was not happy about financing a &quot;silent movie&quot; and withdrew backing. Lewis used his own funds to cover the movie&#x27;s $950,000 budget. &quot;The Bellboy&quot; turned out to be a hit, ranking with his better successes. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Gene Arneel reported independent producer Hall Bartlett&#x27;s observation, &quot;Lewis is the only star whose pictures all turn out in the black.&quot;

Lewis continued to direct more films that he co-wrote with Bill Richmond, including &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (1961), where Lewis constructed a three-story dollhouse-like set spanning two sound stages, with the set equipped with state-of-the-art lighting and sound, eliminating the need for boom microphones in each room. His next movie &quot;The Errand Boy&quot; (1961), used the same formula as &quot;The Bellboy&quot;, with Lewis turned loose in a movie studio for blackouts and sight gags.

Lewis was also somewhat active in television. NBC released him from a long-term contract in 1960; the official reason given was that Lewis was devoting more time to his motion pictures. A more probable reason was the difficulty in finding a weekly television vehicle for Lewis. (NBC did announce two series in development, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; and &quot;The Comedy Concert.&quot;)

Lewis&#x27;s TV appearances were usually guest shots. He appeared in &quot;The Wacky World of Jerry Lewis,&quot; &quot;Celebrity Golf,&quot; &quot;The Garry Moore Show,&quot; &quot;The Soupy Sales Show,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Only Money&quot; (1962) and guest hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; during the transition from Jack Paar to Johnny Carson in 1962, and his appearance on the show scored the highest ratings thus far in late night, surpassing other guest hosts and Paar.

The three major networks began a bidding war, wooing Lewis for his own talk show. Lewis then directed, co-wrote and starred in &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963). A parody of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,&quot; it featured him as Professor Kelp, a socially inept scientist who invents a serum that turns him into a handsome but obnoxious ladies&#x27; man. It is often considered to be Lewis&#x27;s best film.
In 1963, he had a cameo in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), fully starred in &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot; (1963) and hosted &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show,&quot; a lavish 13-week, big-budget show which aired on ABC from September to December in 1963. Lewis next starred in &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1964), his satire about the Hollywood star-making industry and &quot;The Disorderly Orderly&quot; (1964), the only film executive produced by Lewis and his final collaboration with Tashlin. 

Following a cameo on &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, he starred in &quot;The Family Jewels&quot; (1965) about a young heiress who must choose among six uncles, one of whom is up to no good and out to harm the girl&#x27;s beloved bodyguard who practically raised her. The six uncles and the bodyguard were all played by Lewis.

In 1965, Lewis went on &quot;The David Susskind Show,&quot; starred in his final Paramount-released film &quot;Boeing Boeing&quot; (1965), in which he received a Golden Globe nomination, then guest appeared on &quot;Ben Casey,&quot; &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; with son Gary Lewis. Lewis left Paramount in 1966, after 17 years, as the studio was undergoing a corporate shakeup, with the industrial conglomerate Gulf + Western taking over the company. Gulf + Western, scrutinizing the balance sheets, noted the diminishing box office returns of Lewis&#x27;s recent pictures and did not renew his contract.

=== Columbia and other projects ===

Undaunted, Lewis signed with Columbia Pictures, where he tried to reinvent himself with more serious roles and starred in a string of new box-office successes: &quot;Three on a Couch&quot; (1966), also during this period, he appeared in &quot;Way...Way Out&quot; (1966) for 20th Century-Fox, then &quot;The Big Mouth&quot; (1967), &quot;Don&#x27;t Raise the Bridge, Lower the River&quot; (1968) and &quot;Hook, Line &amp; Sinker&quot; (1969).

Lewis continued to make television appearances: &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Sammy Davis Jr. Show,&quot; &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In,&quot; &quot;Password,&quot; a pilot called &quot;Sheriff Who&quot;, a second version of &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot; (this time as a one-hour variety show for NBC, which ran from 1967 to 1969), and &quot;The Danny Thomas Hour&quot;.

He also appeared on &quot;Playboy After Dark,&quot; &quot;Jimmy Durante&#x27;s The Lennon Sisters Hour,&quot; &quot;The Red Skelton Show,&quot; &quot;The Jack Benny Birthday Special,&quot; &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour,&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Palace,&quot; &quot;The Engelbert Humperdinck Show,&quot; &quot;The Irv Kupcinet Show&quot; and &quot;The Linkletter Show&quot;. Behind the scenes, he contributed to some scripts for Filmation&#x27;s animated series &quot;Will the Real Jerry Lewis Please Sit Down&quot;, directed an episode of &quot;The Bold Ones&quot; and directed the Peter Lawford and Sammy Davis, Jr. comedy &quot;One More Time&quot; (1970), a sequel to Richard Donner&#x27;s &quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; (1968).

Lewis would leave Columbia after his agreement with the studio lapsed, leaving him to produce his next movie independently. &quot;Which Way to the Front?&quot; (1970) was a World War II military comedy starring Lewis as a wealthy playboy who wants to enlist in the armed forces. Rejected, he forms his own volunteer army and infiltrates the enemy forces on the Italian front. The cast included many of Lewis&#x27;s cronies, including Jan Murray, Steve Franken, Kathleen Freeman, Kenneth MacDonald, Joe Besser, and (in a broad caricature of Adolf Hitler) Sidney Miller. The film received only a limited release by Warner Bros., and was not well received by the critics or the public. Lewis would later guest appeared on the NBC special &quot;The Klowns&quot;.

&quot;The Day the Clown Cried&quot; (1972), a drama directed by and starring Lewis and set in a Nazi concentration camp, received only brief exposure. The film was rarely discussed by him, but he said that litigation over post-production finances and copyright prevented its completion and widespread theatrical release. He also said a factor for the film&#x27;s burial was that he was not proud of the effort. It was the earliest attempt by an American film director to address the subject of The Holocaust. Following this, Lewis took a break from the movie business for several years.

His television appearances during this period included &quot;Good Morning America,&quot; &quot;The Dick Cavett Show,&quot; &quot;NBC Follies,&quot; &quot;Celebrity Sportsman,&quot; &quot;Cher,&quot; &quot;Dinah!,&quot; &quot;Tony Orlando and Dawn.&quot; As Lewis continued to appear on and annually emcee his telethons, one of the most memorable was the 1976 show, where on that broadcast, unrehearsed, Sinatra offered to bring an old friend on stage. From the wings came Dean Martin, as the audience cheered. Lewis was stunned by the surprise, but he embraced Martin and they exchanged jokes for several minutes.

In 1976, producer Alexander H. Cohen signed Lewis to star in a revival of Olsen and Johnson&#x27;s musical-comedy revue &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;. &quot;I do think that to succeed today, a comedy revue requires a larger-than-life comic&quot;, Cohen told syndicated columnist Jack O&#x27;Brian. &quot;That is why I have engaged Jerry Lewis to star in the new production of &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;, which I&#x27;m preparing for the coming season.&quot; Cohen had revived &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; as a TV special in 1972, and was impressed by the contributions of Lynn Redgrave; he signed her to appear opposite Lewis. This was Lewis&#x27;s first Broadway show, and was so eagerly awaited that NBC-TV promised Cohen $1,000,000 for the rights to broadcast the opening night live on national television.

Out-of-town tryouts were staged in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Boston to excellent business but mixed reviews. There was turmoil behind the scenes, as comedy star Lewis dominated the production and had serious arguments with producer Cohen, co-star Redgrave, and writer-adaptor Abe Burrows. &quot;Lewis and Miss Redgrave had been having a much-publicized feud&quot;, according to an account in the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;. &quot;He would neither rehearse nor perform any songs with her, reports said.&quot; The backstage chaos extended to several sudden cast changes during the Boston run.

On January 18, 1977, NBC executives flew to Boston to see the show, and their reactions were so negative that Cohen closed the show immediately and canceled both the Broadway engagement and the TV spectacular, forfeiting the million-dollar payment from NBC. &quot;It&#x27;s not ready for Broadway and cannot be made so in three remaining weeks before the opening&quot;, Cohen said. Cohen&#x27;s spokesman subsequently announced that the stars would be replaced: &quot;Recasting means recasting, and that&#x27;s it.&quot;

=== Later roles and final work ===
Lewis carried on and starred in &quot;Circus of the Stars&quot;, &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot;, &quot;Hardly Working&quot; (1981, his first &quot;comeback&quot; film in 11 years), a very rare dramatic role as a talk show host in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1982), &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Star Search&quot;, &quot;Cracking Up&quot; (1983, originally titled as &quot;Smorgasbord&quot;), &quot;Slapstick (Of Another Kind)&quot; (1984), &quot;To Catch a Cop&quot; (1984) and &quot;How Did You Get In? We Didn&#x27;t See You Leave&quot; (1984), both French films, which had their distribution under Lewis&#x27;s control. 
Later, he hosted a third and final version of &quot;The Jerry Lewis Show,&quot; this time as a syndicated talk show for Metromedia, which was not continued beyond the scheduled five shows, directed an episode of &quot;Brothers&quot;, appeared at the first Comic Relief in 1986, where he was the only performer to receive a standing ovation, appeared for &quot;Classic Treasures&quot;, &quot;Fight for Life&quot; (1987, a TV movie for ABC), did a second double act with Davis Jr., hosted &quot;America&#x27;s All-Time Favorite Movies&quot; and came on &quot;Speaking of Everything&quot;. While guest starring in five episodes of &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, its filming schedule forced Lewis to miss the Museum of the Moving Image&#x27;s opening with a retrospective of his work.

Lewis then attended Martin&#x27;s 72nd birthday at Bally&#x27;s in Las Vegas, wheeling out a cake, sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to him and joked, &quot;Why we broke up, I&#x27;ll never know.&quot; Then starred in &quot;Cookie&quot; (1989), directed episodes of &quot;Super Force&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Good Grief&quot; in 1991 and appeared in &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; (1992), &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show,&quot; &quot;The Whoopi Goldberg Show&quot;, &quot;Inside The Comedy Mind&quot;, &quot;Jerry Lewis...Unlimited&quot; (his stage tour), &quot;Mad About You&quot;, &quot;Arizona Dream&quot; (1993) and &quot;Funny Bones&quot; (1995). 

Lewis went on to feature in a revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien,&quot; &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;The Nutty Professor II&quot; (2008, also titled &quot;Facing the Fear&quot;), &quot;The Talk&quot;, &quot;Max Rose&quot; (2013) &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;The Trust&quot; (2016) and &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;.

==Style and reception ==
=== Comedic style ===
Lewis &quot;single-handedly created a style of humor that was half anarchy, half excruciation. Even comics who never took a pratfall in their careers owe something to the self-deprecation Jerry introduced into American show business.&quot; His comedy style was physically uninhibited, expressive, and potentially volatile. He was known especially for his distinctive voice, facial expressions, pratfalls, and physical stunts. His improvisations and ad-libbing, especially in nightclubs and early television were revolutionary among performers. It was &quot;marked by a raw, edgy energy that would distinguish him within the comedy landscape.&quot; Will Sloan, of &quot;Flavorwire&quot; wrote, &quot;In the late &#x27;40s and early &#x27;50s, nobody had ever seen a comedian as wild as Jerry Lewis.&quot; Placed in the context of the conservative era, his antics were radical and liberating, paving the way for future comedians Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Andy Kaufman, Paul Reubens, and Jim Carrey. Carrey wrote: &quot;Through his comedy, Jerry would stretch the boundaries of reality so far that it was an act of anarchy ... I learned from Jerry&quot;, and &quot;I am because he was.&quot;

Acting the bumbling everyman, Lewis used tightly choreographed, sophisticated sight gags, physical routines, verbal double-talk and malapropisms. &quot;You cannot help but notice Lewis&#x27;s incredible sense of control in regards to performing—they may have looked at times like the ravings of a madman but his best work had a genuine grace and finesse behind it that would put most comedic performers of any era to shame.&quot; They are &quot;choreographed as exactly as any ballet, each movement and gesture coming on natural beats and conforming to the overall rhythmic form which is headed to a spectacular finale: absolute catastrophe.&quot;

Although Lewis made it no secret that he was Jewish, he was criticized for hiding his Jewish heritage. In several of his films—both with Martin and solo—Lewis&#x27;s Jewish identity is hinted at in passing, and was never made a defining characteristic of his onscreen persona. Aside from the 1959 television movie &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and the unreleased 1972 film &quot;The Day the Clown Cried&quot;, Lewis never appeared in a film or film role that had any ties to his Jewish heritage. When asked about this lack of Jewish portrayal in a 1984 interview, Lewis stated, &quot;I never hid it, but I wouldn&#x27;t announce it and I wouldn&#x27;t exploit it. Plus the fact it had no room in the visual direction I was taking in my work.&quot;

Lewis&#x27;s physical movements in films received some criticism because he was perceived as imitating or mocking those with a physical disability. Through the years, the disability that has been attached to his comedic persona has not been physical, but mental. Neuroticism and schizophrenia have been a part of Lewis&#x27;s persona since his partnership with Dean Martin; however, it was in his solo career that these disabilities became important to the plots of his films and the characters. In films such as &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (1961), &quot;The Disorderly Orderly&quot; (1964), &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1964) and &quot;Cracking Up&quot; (1983), there is either neuroticism, schizophrenia, or both that drive the plot. Lewis was able to explore and dissect the psychological side of his persona, which provided a depth to the character and the films that was not present in his previous efforts.

=== Directorial technique ===
During the 1960 production of &quot;The Bellboy,&quot; Lewis pioneered the technique of using video cameras and multiple closed circuit monitors, which allowed him to review his performance instantly. This was necessary since he was acting as well as directing. His techniques and methods of filmmaking, documented in his book and his USC class, enabled him to complete most of his films on time and under budget since reshoots could take place immediately instead of waiting for the dailies.

&quot;Man in Motion,&quot; a featurette for &quot;Three on a Couch&quot;, features the video system, named &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Noisy Toy&quot; and shows Lewis receiving the Golden Light Technical Achievement award for its development. Lewis stated he worked with the head of Sony to produce the prototype. While he initiated its practice and use, and was instrumental in its development, he did not hold a patent.

Lewis screened Spielberg&#x27;s early film &quot;Amblin&#x27;&quot; and told his students, &quot;That&#x27;s what filmmaking is all about.&quot; The class covered all topics related to filmmaking, including pre and post production, marketing and distribution and filming comedy with rhythm and timing. His 1971 book &quot;The Total Film Maker&quot;, was based on 480 hours of his class lectures. Lewis also traveled to medical schools for seminars on laughter and healing with Clifford Kuhn and also did corporate and college lectures, motivational speaking and promoted the pain-treatment company Medtronic.

=== Exposure in France ===

While Lewis was popular in France for his duo films with Dean Martin and his solo comedy films, his reputation and stature increased after the Paramount contract, when he began to exert total control over all aspects of his films. His involvement in directing, writing, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of auteur theory in French intellectual film criticism and the French New Wave movement. He earned consistent praise from French critics in the influential magazines &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; and &quot;Positif,&quot; where he was hailed as an ingenious auteur.

His singular &quot;mise-en-scène,&quot; and skill behind the camera, were aligned with Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Satyajit Ray. Appreciated too, was the complexity of his also being in front of the camera. The new French criticism viewed cinema as an art form unto itself, and comedy as part of this art. Lewis is then fitted into a historical context and seen as not only worthy of critique, but as an innovator and satirist of his time. Jean-Pierre Coursodon states in a 1975 &quot;Film Comment&quot; article, &quot;The merit of the French critics, auteurist excesses notwithstanding, was their willingness to look at what Lewis was doing as a filmmaker for what it was, rather than with some preconception of what film comedy should be.&quot;

Curricula at universities or art schools, film studies and film theory were not yet avant-garde in early 1960s America. Mainstream movie reviewers such as Pauline Kael, were dismissive of auteur theory, and others, seeing only absurdist comedy, criticized Lewis for his ambition and &quot;castigated him for his self-indulgence&quot; and egotism. Despite this criticism being often held by American film critics, admiration for Lewis and his comedy continued to grow in France.

Appreciation of Lewis by &quot;the French&quot; became something of a stereotype and was often the object of jokes in American pop culture. &quot;That Americans can&#x27;t see Jerry Lewis&#x27;s genius is bewildering&quot;, says N. T. Binh, a French film magazine critic. Such bewilderment was the basis of the book &quot;Why the French Love Jerry Lewis.&quot;

==Acting credits and accolades ==
Lewis received numerous honorary awards including the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences&#x27;s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2008, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Governor&#x27;s Award in 2005, and the Venice International Film Festival&#x27;s Career Golden Lion in 1999. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Best Comedian or Comedienne in 1952 and the Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical Film for his performance in &quot;Boeing, Boeing&quot; (1965). For his Broadway debut, he received a Theatre World Award nomination. Lewis was nominated for ten Golden Laurel Awards winning twice. Lewis also received a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor for his performance in &quot;Slapstick of Another Kind&quot; (1985), as well as two Stinker Award nominations for Worst Director and Worst Actor for &quot;Hardly Working&quot; (1981).

== Charity and activism with MDA==

After meeting with Paul Cohen, founder of the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), Lewis and Martin made their first appeal in early December 1951 on the finale of &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour,&quot; followed by another in 1952. Lewis fought Rocky Marciano in a boxing bout for MDA&#x27;s fund drive in 1954. In 1956, the duo hosted MDA&#x27;s first telethon from June 29 to June 30, before the end of their comedy act on July 25. Right after the association named Lewis national chairman, two Thanksgiving specials were helmed in 1957 and 1959.

&quot;The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; would make its debut premiere in late 1966. Since its first broadcast on one station that year, the annual telethon aired live every Labor Day weekend for 44 years over five decades. Johnny Olson served as announcer for the first seven years, then Ed McMahon for the latter thirty-six years and Shawn Parr for Lewis&#x27;s final two shows. It originated from different locations including New York, Las Vegas, Hollywood and Chicago, becoming the most watched and most successful fundraising event in the history of television.

The event was the first to: raise over $1 million, in 1966; be shown entirely in color, in 1967; become a networked telethon, in 1968; go coast-to-coast, in 1970; be seen outside the continental U.S., in 1972. It: raised the largest sum ever in a single event for humanitarian purposes, in 1974; had the greatest amount ever pledged to a televised charitable event, in 1980 (from the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;); was the first to be seen by 100 million people, in 1985; celebrated its 25th anniversary, in 1990; saw its highest pledge in history, in 1992; and was the first seen worldwide via internet simulcast, in 1998. 

By 1990, societal views of disabled individuals and the telethon format had shifted. Lewis&#x27;s and the telethon&#x27;s methods were criticized by disabled-rights activists who believed the show was &quot;designed to evoke pity rather than empower the disabled.&quot; The activists said the telethon perpetuated prejudices and stereotypes, that Lewis treated those he claimed to be helping with little respect, and that he used offensive language when describing them. Lewis rebutted the criticism and defended his methods saying, &quot;If you don&#x27;t tug at their heartstrings, then you&#x27;re on the air for nothing.&quot;

During Lewis&#x27;s lifetime, MDA-funded scientists discovered the causes of most of the diseases in the Muscular Dystrophy Association&#x27;s program, developing treatments, therapies and standards of care that have allowed many people living with these diseases to live longer and grow stronger. Lewis received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Medical Association, a Governors Award and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.

On August 3, 2011, MDA announced that Lewis would no longer host its telethons and that he was no longer associated with MDA. The 2011 telethon (which originally was to be Lewis&#x27;s 46th and final show with MDA) featured a tribute to Lewis. In May 2015, MDA said it was discontinuing its telethon in view of &quot;the new realities of television viewing and philanthropic giving.&quot;

In early 2016, at MDA&#x27;s brand relaunch event at Carnegie Hall in New York City, Lewis broke a five-year silence during a special taped message, marking his first (and as it turned out, his final) appearance in support of MDA since his final telethon in 2010 and the end of his tenure as national chairman in 2011.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
Lewis wed Patti Palmer (née Esther Grace Calonico; 1921–2021), a singer with Ted Fio Rito, on October 3, 1944. They had six sons together; five biological: Gary (born 1945), Scott (born 1956), Christopher (born 1957), Anthony (born 1959) and Joseph (1964–2009); and one adopted: Ronald (born 1949). It was an interfaith marriage; Lewis was Jewish and Palmer was Catholic.

While married to Palmer, Lewis likely fathered a daughter, Suzan (born 1952) with Lynn Dixon Kleinman. DNA testing indicated an 88.7 percent probability that Suzan is related to Lewis&#x27; acknowledged son Gary. Lewis openly pursued relationships with other women and gave unapologetic interviews about his infidelity, revealing his affairs with Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich to &quot;People&quot; in 2011. Palmer filed for divorce from Lewis in 1980, after 35 years of marriage, citing Lewis&#x27;s extravagant spending and infidelity on his part, and it was finalized in 1983. All of Lewis&#x27;s children and grandchildren from his marriage to Palmer were excluded from inheriting any part of his estate. His eldest son, Gary, publicly called his father a &quot;mean and evil person&quot; and said that Lewis never showed him or his siblings any love or care.

Lewis&#x27;s second wife was Sandra &quot;SanDee&quot; Pitnick, a University of North Carolina School of the Arts professionally trained ballerina and stewardess, who met Lewis after winning a bit part in a dancing scene on his film &quot;Hardly Working&quot;. They wed on February 13, 1983, in Key Biscayne, Florida, adopted a daughter, Danielle (born 1992), and were married for 34 years until Lewis&#x27;s death on August 20, 2017.

=== Interests ===
After opening a camera shop in 1950, Lewis agreed to lend his name to &quot;Jerry Lewis Cinemas&quot; in 1969, offered by National Cinema Corporation, as a franchise business opportunity for those interested in theatrical movie exhibition. Jerry Lewis Cinemas stated that their theaters could be operated by a staff of as few as two with the aid of automation and support provided by the franchiser in booking film and other aspects of film exhibition. A forerunner of the smaller rooms typical of later multi-screen complexes, a Jerry Lewis Cinema was billed in franchising ads as a &quot;mini-theatre&quot; with a seating capacity of between 200 and 350.

In addition to Lewis&#x27;s name, each Jerry Lewis Cinema bore a sign with a cartoon logo of Lewis in profile. Initially 158 territories were franchised, with a buy-in fee of $10,000 or $15,000 depending on the territory, for what was called an &quot;individual exhibitor.&quot; For $50,000, Jerry Lewis Cinemas offered an opportunity known as an &quot;area directorship&quot;, in which investors controlled franchising opportunities in a territory as well as their own cinemas. The success of the chain was hampered by a policy of only booking second-run, family-friendly films. Eventually the policy was changed, and the Jerry Lewis Cinemas were allowed to show more competitive movies. But after a decade the chain failed and both Lewis and National Cinema Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1980.

In 1973, Lewis appeared on the 1st Annual 20-hour Highway Safety Foundation Telethon, then in 1990, wrote and directed &quot;Boy&quot;, a short film for UNICEF&#x27;s &quot;How Are The Children?&quot; anthology, meeting up with seven-year-old Lochie Graham in 2010, who shared his idea for &quot;Jerry&#x27;s House&quot;, a place for vulnerable and traumatized children and in 2016, would lend his name and star power to Criss Angel&#x27;s HELP (Heal Every Life Possible) charity event.

=== Political views ===
Lewis kept a low political profile for many years, having taken advice reportedly given to him by President John F. Kennedy, who told him, &quot;Don&#x27;t get into anything political. Don&#x27;t do that because they will usurp your energy.&quot; Nevertheless, he campaigned and performed on behalf of both JFK and Robert F. Kennedy, and was a supporter of the civil rights movement. For his 1957 NBC special, Lewis held his ground when southern affiliates objected to his friendship with Sammy Davis, Jr. In a 1971 &quot;Movie Mirror&quot; magazine article, Lewis spoke out against the Vietnam War. He vowed to leave the country rather than send another of his sons.

Lewis observed that political speeches should not be at the Oscars. He stated, &quot;I think we are the most dedicated industry in the world. And I think that we have to present ourselves that night as hard-working, caring and important people to the industry. We need to get more self-respect as an industry.&quot; In a 2004 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Lewis was asked what he was least proud of, to which he answered, &quot;Politics.&quot;

He mocked citizens&#x27; lack of pride in their country, stating, &quot;President Bush is my president. I will not say anything negative about the president of the United States. I don&#x27;t do that. And I don&#x27;t allow my children to do that. Likewise, when I come to England don&#x27;t you do any jokes about &#x27;Mum&#x27; to me. That is the Queen of England, you moron. Do you know how tough a job it is to be the Queen of England?&quot;

In a December 2015 interview on EWTN&#x27;s &quot;World Over&quot; with Raymond Arroyo, Lewis expressed opposition to the United States letting in Syrian refugees, saying, &quot;No one has worked harder for the human condition than I have, but they&#x27;re not part of the human condition if 11 guys in that group of 10,000 are ISIS. How can I take that chance?&quot; In the same interview, he criticized President Barack Obama for not being prepared for ISIS, while expressing support for Donald Trump, saying he would make a good president because he was a good &quot;showman.&quot; He also added that he admired Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency.

===Stalking incident===
In February 1994, a man named Gary Benson was revealed to have been stalking Lewis and his family. Benson subsequently served four years in prison.

=== Allegations of sexual assault ===
In February 2022, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported that several of Lewis&#x27;s co-stars from the 1960s had come forward to share allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and verbal abuse. Those whose accounts were made public included Karen Sharpe, Hope Holiday, Anna Maria Alberghetti, and Lainie Kazan.

=== Illness and death ===
Lewis suffered from a number of chronic health problems, illnesses and addictions related both to aging and a back injury sustained in a comedic . The fall has been stated as being either from a piano while performing at the Sands Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip on March 20, 1965, or during an appearance on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. In its aftermath, Lewis became addicted to the painkiller Percodan for thirteen years. He said he had been off the drug since 1978. In April 2002, Lewis had a Medtronic &quot;Synergy&quot; neurostimulator implanted in his back, which helped reduce the discomfort. He was one of the company&#x27;s leading spokesmen.

Lewis suffered numerous heart problems throughout his life; he revealed in the 2011 documentary &quot;Method to the Madness of Jerry Lewis&quot; that he suffered his first heart attack at age 34 while filming &quot;Cinderfella&quot; in 1960. In December 1982, at age 56, he suffered his second heart attack and that same month underwent open-heart double-bypass surgery. En route to San Diego from New York City on a cross-country commercial airline flight on June 11, 2006, Lewis suffered his third heart attack at age 80. It was discovered that he had pneumonia, as well as a severely damaged heart. He underwent a cardiac catheterization days after the heart attack, and two stents were inserted into one of his coronary arteries, which was 90 percent blocked. The surgery resulted in increased blood flow to his heart and allowed him to continue his rebound from earlier lung problems. Having the cardiac catheterization required him to cancel several major events from his schedule, but Lewis fully recuperated in a matter of weeks.

In 1999, Lewis&#x27;s Australian tour was cut short when he had to be hospitalized in Darwin with viral meningitis. He was ill for more than five months. It was reported in the Australian press that he had failed to pay his medical bills. However, Lewis maintained that the payment confusion was the fault of his health insurer. The resulting negative publicity caused him to sue his insurer for US$100 million.

In addition to his decades-long heart problems, Lewis had prostate cancer, type 1 diabetes, and pulmonary fibrosis. In the late 1990s, Lewis was treated with prednisone for pulmonary fibrosis, which caused considerable weight gain and a startling change in his appearance. In September 2001, Lewis was unable to perform at a planned London charity event at the London Palladium. He was the headlining act, and was introduced, but did not appear onstage. He had suddenly become unwell, apparently with cardiac problems.

He was subsequently taken to a hospital. Some months thereafter, Lewis began an arduous, months-long therapy that weaned him off prednisone, and he lost much of the weight gained while on the drug. The treatment enabled him to return to work. On June 12, 2012, he was treated and released from a hospital after collapsing from hypoglycemia at a New York Friars Club event. This forced him to cancel a show in Sydney. In an October 2016 interview with &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, Lewis acknowledged that he might not star in any more films, given his advanced age, while admitting, through tears, that he was afraid of dying, as it would leave his wife and daughter alone. In June 2017, Lewis was hospitalized at a Las Vegas hospital for a urinary tract infection.

Lewis died at his home in Las Vegas, Nevada, on August 20, 2017, at the age of 91. The cause was end-stage cardiac disease and peripheral artery disease. Lewis was cremated. In his will, he left his estate to his second wife of 34 years, SanDee Pitnick, and their daughter, and explicitly disinherited his children from his first marriage and their children.

==Controversies==
In 1998, at the Aspen U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, when asked which women comics he admired, Lewis answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t like any female comedians. A woman doing comedy doesn&#x27;t offend me but sets me back a bit. I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I think of her as a producing machine that brings babies in the world.&quot; He went on to praise Lucille Ball as &quot;brilliant&quot; and said Carol Burnett is &quot;the greatest female entrepreneur of comedy.&quot; On other occasions, Lewis expressed admiration for female comedians Totie Fields, Phyllis Diller, Kathleen Freeman, Elayne Boosler, Whoopi Goldberg, and Tina Fey. 

During the 2007 MDA Telethon, Lewis used the slur &quot;fag&quot; in a joke, for which he apologized. Lewis used the same word the following year on Australian television.

==Tributes and legacy==
From the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, &quot;Lewis was a major force in American popular culture.&quot; Widely acknowledged as a comic genius, Lewis influenced generations of comedians, comedy writers, performers and film makers. As Lewis was often referred to as the bridge from Vaudeville to modern comedy, Carl Reiner wrote after Lewis&#x27;s death, &quot;All comedians watch other comedians, and every generation of comedians going back to those who watched Jerry on the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; were influenced by Jerry. They say that mankind goes back to the first guy ... which everyone tries to copy. In comedy that guy was Jerry Lewis.&quot;

Lewis&#x27;s films, especially his self-directed films, have warranted steady reappraisal. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said Lewis was &quot;one of the most original, inventive, ... profound directors of the time&quot; and &quot;one of the most skilled and original comic performers, verbal and physical, ever to appear on screen.&quot; Dave Kehr, a film critic and film curator for the Museum of Modern Art, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of Lewis&#x27;s &quot;fierce creativity&quot; and &quot;the extreme formal sophistication of his direction.&quot; Kehr wrote that Lewis was &quot;one of the great American filmmakers.&quot;

&quot;Lewis was an explosive experimenter with a dazzling skill, and an audacious, innovatory flair for the technique of the cinema. He knew how to frame and present his own adrenaline-fuelled, instinctive physical comedy for the camera.&quot;

Lewis was at the forefront in the transition to independent filmmaking, which came to be known as New Hollywood in the late 1960s. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2005, screenwriter David Weddle lauded Lewis&#x27;s audacity in 1959 &quot;daring to declare his independence from the studio system.&quot; Lewis came along to a studio system in which the industry was regularly stratified between players and coaches. The studios tightly controlled the process and they wanted their people directing. Yet Lewis regularly led, often flouting the power structure to do so.
Steven Zeitchik of the LA Times wrote of Lewis, &quot;Control over material was smart business, and it was also good art. Neither the entrepreneur nor the auteur were common types among actors in mid-20th century Hollywood. But there Lewis was, at a time of strict studio control, doing both.&quot;

No other comedic star, with the exceptions of Chaplin and Keaton in the silent era, dared to direct himself. &quot;Not only would Lewis&#x27;s efforts as a director pave the way for the likes of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen, but it would reveal him to be uncommonly skilled in that area as well.&quot; &quot;Most screen comedies until that time were not especially cinematic—they tended to plop down the camera where it could best capture the action and that was it. Lewis, on the other hand, was interested in exploring the possibilities of the medium by utilizing the tools he had at his disposal in formally innovative and oftentimes hilarious ways.&quot; &quot;In Lewis&#x27;s work the way the scene is photographed is an integral part of the joke. His purposeful selection of lenses, for example, expands and contracts space to generate laughs that aren&#x27;t necessarily inherent in the material, and he often achieves his biggest effects via what he leaves off screen, not just visually but structurally.&quot;

As a director, Lewis advanced the genre of film comedy with innovations in the areas of fragmented narrative, experimental use of music and sound technology, and near surrealist use of color and art direction. This prompted his peer, filmmaker Jean Luc Godard to proclaim, &quot;Jerry Lewis ... is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn&#x27;t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ... Lewis is the only one today who&#x27;s making courageous films. He&#x27;s been able to do it because of his personal genius.&quot; Jim Hemphill for &quot;American Cinematheque&quot; wrote, &quot;They are films of ambitious visual and narrative experimentation, provocative and sometimes conflicted commentaries on masculinity in post-war America, and unsettling self-critiques and analyses of the performer&#x27;s neuroses.&quot;

Intensely personal and original, Lewis&#x27;s films were groundbreaking in their use of dark humor for psychological exploration. Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;The idea of comedians getting under the skin and tapping into their deepest, darkest selves is no longer especially novel, but it was far from a universally accepted notion when Lewis first took the spotlight. Few comedians before him had so brazenly turned arrested development into art, or held up such a warped fun house mirror to American identity in its loudest, ugliest, vulgarest excesses. Fewer still had advanced the still-radical notion that comedy doesn&#x27;t always have to be funny, just fearless, in order to strike a nerve.&quot;

Before 1960, Hollywood comedies were screwball or farce. Lewis, from his earliest &#x27;home movies, such as &quot;How to Smuggle a Hernia Across the Border&quot;, made in his playhouse in the early 1950s, was one of the first to introduce satire as a full-length film. This &quot;sharp-eyed&quot; satire continued in his mature work, commenting on the cult of celebrity, the machinery of &#x27;fame&#x27;, and &quot;the dilemma of being true to oneself while also fitting into polite society.&quot; Stephen Dalton in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote, Lewis had &quot;an agreeably bitter streak, offering self-lacerating insights into celebrity culture which now look strikingly modern. Even post-modern in places.&quot; Speaking of &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, &quot;More contemporary satirists like Garry Shandling, Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais owe at least some of their self-deconstructing chops to Lewis&#x27;s generously unappetizing turn in Scorsese&#x27;s cult classic.&quot;

Lewis was an early master of deconstruction to enhance comedy. From the first &quot;Comedy Hour&quot;s he exposed the artifice of on-stage performance by acknowledging the lens, sets, malfunctioning props, failed jokes, and tricks of production. As Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote: Lewis had &quot;the impulse to deconstruct and even demolish the fictional &quot;givens&quot; of any particular sketch, including those that he might have dreamed up himself, a kind of perpetual auto-destruction that becomes an essential part of his filmmaking as he steadily gains more control over the writing and direction of his features.&quot; His self directed films abound in behind-the-scene reveals, demystifying movie-making. Daniel Fairfax writes in &quot;Deconstructing Jerry: Lewis as a Director&quot;, &quot;Lewis deconstructs the very functioning of the joke itself.&quot; ... quoting Chris Fujiwara, &quot;&quot;The Patsy&quot; is a film so radical that it makes comedy out of the situation of a comedian who isn&#x27;t funny.&quot; The final scene of &quot;The Patsy&quot; is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director. Lewis wrote in &quot;The Total Filmmaker&quot;, his belief in breaking the fourth wall, actors looking directly into the camera, despite industry norms.

Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard, both of whom starred with Lewis in &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, reflected on his death. Bernhard said: &quot;It was one of the great experiences of my career, he was tough but one of a kind.&quot; De Niro said: &quot;Jerry was a pioneer in comedy and film. And he was a friend. I was fortunate to have seen him a few times over the past couple of years. Even at 91, he didn&#x27;t miss a beat ... or a punchline. You&#x27;ll be missed.&quot; There was also a New York Friars Club roast in honor of Lewis with Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer. Martin Scorsese recalls working with him on &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, &quot;It was like watching a virtuoso pianist at the keyboard.&quot; Lewis was the subject of a documentary &quot;Jerry Lewis: Method to the Madness&quot;.

Peter Chelsom, director of &quot;Funny Bones&quot; wrote, &quot;Working with him was a masterclass in comic acting – and in charm. From the outset he was generous.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s a very thin line between a talent for being funny and being a great actor. Jerry Lewis epitomized that. Jerry embodied the term &quot;funny bones&quot;: a way of differentiating between comedians who &quot;tell&quot; funny and those who &quot;are&quot; funny.&quot; Director Daniel Noah recalling his relationship with Lewis during production of &quot;Max Rose&quot; wrote, &quot;He was kind and loving and patient and limitlessly generous with his genius. He was unbelievably complicated and shockingly self-aware.&quot;

Actor and comedian Jeffrey Tambor wrote after Lewis&#x27;s death, &quot;You invented the whole thing. Thank you doesn&#x27;t even get close.&quot;

Actor and comedian Jim Carrey tweeted after Lewis&#x27;s death, &quot;I am because he was.&quot;

There have been numerous retrospectives of Lewis&#x27;s films in the U.S. and abroad, most notably &quot;Jerry Lewis: A Film and Television Retrospective&quot; at Museum of the Moving Image, the 2013 Viennale, the 2016 Melbourne International Film Festival, &quot;The Innovator: Jerry Lewis at Paramount&quot; at American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, &quot;Happy Birthday Mr. Lewis: The Kid Turns 90&quot; at MoMA in New York City, and &quot;Jerry Lewis, cinéaste&quot; at the French Cinémathèque in 2023.

In 2017, Lewis with others inaugurated and founded Legionnaires of Laughter and Legacy Awards, and the first Legacy Award held in Downtown, New York. On August 21, 2017, multiple hotel marquees on the Las Vegas Strip honored Lewis with a coordinated video display of images of his career as a Las Vegas performer and resident.

==In popular culture==
Between 1952 and 1957, DC Comics published a 40-issue comic book series with Martin &amp; Lewis as the main protagonists, titled &quot;The Adventures of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis&quot;. They continued the series under the new title &quot;The Adventures of Jerry Lewis&quot; after the team split up, running until issue #124 in 1971.

In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the character of Professor Frink is based on Lewis&#x27;s Julius Kelp from &quot;The Nutty Professor.&quot; Lewis himself would later voice the character&#x27;s father in the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror XIV.&quot; In &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, Lewis is parodied in the form of a recurring character named Mr. Director (voiced by series writer Paul Rugg), who initially appears as a comedy director whose appearance and mannerisms are based around those of Lewis, complete with frequent exclamations of faux-Yiddish. While he is typically depicted as a caricature of Lewis, on some occasions Mr. Director has also been seen as a caricature of Marlon Brando and as a birthday clown, although still retaining the voice and mannerisms inspired by Lewis.

In &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Peter recreates Lewis&#x27;s &#x27;chairman of the board&#x27; scene from &quot;The Errand Boy&quot;. Comedian, actor and friend of Lewis, Martin Short, satirized him on the series &quot;SCTV&quot; in the sketches &quot;The Nutty Lab Assistant&quot;, &quot;Martin Scorsese presents Jerry Lewis Live on the Champs Elysees!&quot;, &quot;The Tender Fella&quot;, and &quot;Scenes From an Idiots Marriage&quot;, as well as on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!.&quot;
Also on &quot;SNL&quot;, the Martin and Lewis reunion on the 1976 MDA Telethon is reported by Chevy Chase on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. Comedians Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo both parodied Lewis when he hosted SNL in 1983. Piscopo also channeled Jerry Lewis while performing as a 20th-century stand-up comedian in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;; in the second-season episode &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot;, Piscopo&#x27;s Holodeck character, The Comic, tutors android Lieutenant Commander Data on humor and comedy. Comedian and actor Jim Carrey satirized Lewis on &quot;In Living Color&quot; in the sketch &quot;Jheri&#x27;s Kids Telethon.&quot; Carrey had an uncredited cameo playing Lewis in the series &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; on the episode &quot;Jerry Lewis Week.&quot; He also played Lewis, with impersonator Rich Little as Dean Martin, on stage. Actor Sean Hayes portrayed Lewis in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Martin and Lewis&quot;, with Jeremy Northam as Dean Martin. Actor Kevin Bacon plays the Lewis character in the 2005 film &quot;Where The Truth Lies,&quot; based on a fictionalized version of Martin and Lewis. In the satiric novel, &quot;Funny Men&quot;, about singer/wild comic double act, the character Sigmund &quot;Ziggy&quot; Blissman, is based on Lewis.

John Saleeby, writer for &quot;National Lampoon&quot; has a humor piece &quot;Ten Things You Should Know About Jerry Lewis.&quot; In the animated cartoon &quot;Popeye&#x27;s 20th Anniversary&quot;, Martin and Lewis are portrayed on the dais. The animated series &quot;Animaniacs&quot; satirized Lewis in several episodes. The voice and boyish, naive cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants is partially based on Lewis, with particular inspiration from his film &quot;The Bellboy&quot;. In 1998, The MTV animated show &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot; had a clay-animated fight to the death between Dean Martin and Lewis. In a 1975 re-issue of &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; the contents of Lewis&#x27;s wallet is satirized in their on-going feature &quot;Celebrities&#x27; Wallets.&quot;

Lewis, and Martin &amp; Lewis, as himself or his films, have been referenced by directors and performers of differing genres spanning decades, including Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Soap Opera&quot; (1964), John Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; (1970), Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), Randal Kleiser&#x27;s &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;In a Year of 13 Moons&quot; (1978), Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Four Rooms&quot; (1995), Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Pulp Fiction (1994), Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (2012), Ben Stiller&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (2013), Jay Roach&#x27;s &quot;Trumbo&quot; (2015), &quot;The Comedians&quot; (2015), &quot;Baskets&quot; (2016), &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999), &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1996, 1998), and &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; (2017, 2018).

Similarly, varied musicians have mentioned Lewis in song lyrics including, Ice Cube, The Dead Milkmen, Queen Latifah, and Frank Zappa. The hip hop music band Beastie Boys have an unreleased single &quot;The Jerry Lewis&quot;, which they mention, and danced to, on stage in Asheville, North Carolina in 2009. In their film &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique—A Visual Companion&quot;, clips from &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; play to &quot;The Sounds of Science&quot;.

Apple iOS 10 includes an auto-text emoji for &#x27;professor&#x27; with a Lewis lookalike portrayal from &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;.
The word &quot;flaaaven!&quot;, with its many variations and rhymes, is a Lewis-ism often used as a misspoken word or a person&#x27;s mis-pronounced name. In a 2016 episode of the podcast &quot;West Wing Weekly&quot;, Joshua Malina is heard saying &quot;flaven&quot; when trying to remember a character&#x27;s correct last name. Lewis&#x27;s signature catchphrase &quot;Hey, Laaady!&quot; is ubiquitously used by comedians and laypersons alike.

Sammy Petrillo bore a coincidental resemblance to Lewis, so much so that Lewis at first tried to catch and kill Petrillo&#x27;s career by signing him to a talent contract and then not giving him any work. When that failed (as Petrillo was under 18 at the time), Lewis tried to blackball Petrillo by pressuring television outlets and then nightclubs, also threatening legal action after Petrillo used his Lewis impersonation in the film &quot;Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla&quot;.

Over the years, countless actors and performers have regularly impersonated or portrayed Lewis in various tribute shows, most notably Nicholas Arnold, Tony Lewis, David Wolf, and Matt Macis.

<text>Johann or Johannes Agricola (originally Schneider, then Schnitter; 20 April 1494 – 22 September 1566) was a German Protestant Reformer during the Protestant Reformation. He was a follower and friend of Martin Luther, who became his antagonist in the matter of the binding obligation of the law on Christians.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Agricola was born at Eisleben, whence he is sometimes called Magister Islebius. He studied at Wittenberg, where he soon gained the friendship of Martin Luther. In 1519 he accompanied Luther to the great assembly of German divines at Leipzig, and acted as recording secretary. After teaching for some time in Wittenberg, he went to Frankfurt in 1525 to establish the Protestant mode of worship. He had resided there only a month when he was called to Eisleben, where he remained until 1526 as teacher in the school of St Andrew, and preacher in the Nicolai church.

===Controversy===

In 1536 he was recalled to teach in Wittenberg, and was welcomed by Luther. Almost immediately, however, a controversy, which had been begun ten years before and been temporarily silenced, broke out more violently than ever. Agricola was the first to teach the views which Luther was the first to stigmatize by the name Antinomian, maintaining that while non-Christians were still held to the Mosaic law, Christians were entirely free from it, being under the gospel alone. (See also: Law and Gospel). The controversy made the two theologians break apart.
Philip Melanchthon taught that it was necessary to do good works, but they were an outgrowth of faith and not the reason for receiving forgiveness. Agricola felt that Melanchthon&#x27;s view of the law was at odds with Luther&#x27;s. Agricola felt there was no need for the law after justification possibly ignoring the idea that someone could still fall from faith. This may be closer to the Calvinistic view of &quot;Once saved, Always saved&quot;.

===Restoration and later life===
As a consequence of the bitter controversy with Luther, in 1540 Agricola left Wittenberg secretly for Berlin, where he published a letter addressed to Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, which was generally interpreted as a recantation of his prior views. Luther, however, seems not to have so accepted it, and Agricola remained at Berlin.

Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg, having taken Agricola into his favour, appointed him court preacher and general superintendent. He held both offices until his death in 1566, and his career in Brandenburg was one of great activity and influence.

Along with Julius von Pflug, bishop of Naumburg-Zeitz, and Michael Helding, titular bishop of Sidon, he prepared the Augsburg Interim of 1548, a proposed settlement under which Protestants would accept all Catholic authority, being permitted to retain the Protestant teaching on communion under both kinds and married clergy, but otherwise compelled to accept Catholic doctrine and practice, including the rejection of justification by faith alone. From that time, he was an outcast among Protestant theologians. It was an irony that one of the most radical Reformers ended his life viewed as having capitulated to Catholics.

He endeavored in vain to appease the Adiaphoristic controversy.

He died during an epidemic of plague on 22 September 1566 in Berlin.

==Writings==
Agricola wrote a number of theological works. He was among the first to make a commentated collection of German proverbs. The first volume contains 300 proverbs and was published in 1529 (&quot;Drey hundert Gemeyner Sprichworter, der wir Deutschen vns gebrauchen, vnd doch nicht wissen woher sie kommen&quot;; first published in Low German the year before); the second volume contains 450 proverbs and was published in 1530 (&quot;Das ander teyl gemainer Tewtscher Sprichwörter, mit jhrer außlegung : hat fünffthalb hundert newer Wörtter&quot;). A revised edition containing the seven hundred and fifty proverbs of the previous two volumes was published in 1534 (&quot;Sybenhundert und fünfftzig teütscher Sprichwörter, verneüwert und gebessert&quot;) and later republished with updated orthography, for example, in Wittenberg in 1592.

==In literature==
In 1836, Robert Browning used him as the subject of an early poetic soliloquy, &quot;Johannes Agricola in Meditation&quot;.

<text>Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (3 February 1736 – 7 March 1809) was an Austrian composer, organist, and music theorist, and one of the teachers of Ludwig van Beethoven. He was also a friend of Haydn and Mozart.

==Biography==
Albrechtsberger was born at Klosterneuburg, near Vienna. He originally studied music at Melk Abbey and philosophy at a Benedictine seminary in Vienna, and became one of the most learned and skilful contrapuntists of his age. Albrechtsberger&#x27;s earliest classmates included Michael Haydn and Franz Joseph Aumann. After being employed as organist at Raab in 1755 and Maria Taferl in 1757, he was appointed Thurnermeister back at Melk Abbey. In 1772 he was appointed organist to the court of Vienna, and in 1792 Kapellmeister of St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral.

His fame as a theorist attracted to him in the Austrian capital a large number of pupils, some of whom afterwards became eminent musicians. Among these were Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Ignaz Moscheles, Josef Weigl, Ludwig-Wilhelm Tepper de Ferguson, Antonio Casimir Cartellieri, Ludwig van Beethoven, Anton Reicha and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart. Beethoven had arrived in Vienna in 1792 to study with Joseph Haydn, but quickly became infuriated when his work was not being given attention or corrected. Haydn recommended his friend Albrechtsberger, with whom Beethoven then studied harmony and counterpoint. On completion of his studies, the young student noted, &quot;Patience, diligence, persistence, and sincerity will lead to success&quot;, which reflects upon Albrechtsberger&#x27;s own compositional philosophy.

Albrechtsberger died in Vienna; his grave is in St. Marx cemetery.

==Compositions==

His published compositions consist of preludes, fugues and sonatas for the piano and organ, string quartets, etc.; but the greater proportion of his works, vocal and instrumental, exists only in manuscript. They are in the library of the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Around 1765, he wrote at least seven concerti for Jew&#x27;s harp and strings (three survive in the Hungarian National Library in Budapest). They are pleasant, well-written works in the &quot;galant&quot; style. 

One of his most notable works is his Concerto for Alto Trombone and Orchestra in B Major (1759). As the trombone has few works dating back to the classical period, his concerto is often highlighted by the trombone community. He also wrote a Concerto for the Mandola, Op. 27, discussed positively in the 1914 book &quot;The Guitar and Mandolin&quot;.

Possibly the most valuable service he rendered to music was in his theoretical works. In 1790 he published at Leipzig a treatise on composition, of which a third edition appeared in 1821. A collection of his writings on harmony, in three volumes, was published under the care of his pupil Ignaz von Seyfried (1776–1841) in 1826. An English version of this was published by Novello in 1855. His compositional style derives from the counterpoint of Johann Joseph Fux, who was Kapellmeister at St Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral from 1713 to 1741; Albrechtsberger later held the same position.

A continuous thread can be traced from his teaching through that of his pupil Anton Reicha, who went on to become the first Professor of Counterpoint and Fugue at the Paris Conservatoire from 1818 until his death in 1836, and who in turn reached a wide audience through both his own teaching and his theoretical writings, which were standard reference at the Conservatoire for most of the 19th century, and translated into German by Carl Czerny.

<text>John Alden ( - September 12, 1687) was an English politician, settler, and cooper, best known for being a crew member on the historic 1620 voyage of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; which brought the English settlers commonly known as Pilgrims to Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. He was hired in Southampton, England as the ship&#x27;s cooper, responsible for maintaining the ship&#x27;s barrels. He was a member of the ship&#x27;s crew and not initially a settler, yet he decided to remain in Plymouth Colony when the &quot;Mayflower&quot; returned to England. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact.

He married fellow &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger Priscilla Mullins, whose entire family perished in the first winter in Plymouth Colony. The marriage of the young couple became prominent in Victorian popular culture after the 1858 publication of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s fictitious narrative poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish.&quot; The book inspired widespread depictions of John and Priscilla Alden in art and literature during the 19th and 20th centuries.

Alden was one of Plymouth Colony&#x27;s most active public servants and played a prominent role in colonial affairs. He was annually elected to the Governor&#x27;s Council nearly every year from 1640 to 1686. He served as Treasurer of Plymouth Colony, Deputy to the General Court of Plymouth, a member of the colony&#x27;s Council of War, and a member of the colony&#x27;s Committee on Kennebec Trade, among other posts.

He was the last surviving signer of the Mayflower Compact upon his death in 1687. The approximate location of his grave in the Myles Standish Burial Ground was marked with a memorial stone in 1930. The site of his first house in Duxbury is preserved and marked with interpretative signs. The Alden Kindred of America began as a society of John and Priscilla&#x27;s descendants, and it maintains the Alden House Historic Site in Duxbury, Massachusetts—likely built by Alden&#x27;s son Capt. Jonathan Alden.

== English origins ==

Historians and genealogists have advanced many theories to the English origin of John Alden. According to the &quot;American Ancestors&quot; project of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, Alden genealogical expert Alicia Crane Williams has called two of the hypothesized origins &quot;tempting&quot;; however, she asserts that none are definitively proven.

The only definite primary source evidence regarding Alden&#x27;s background comes from Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford&#x27;s history &quot;Of Plymouth Plantation&quot;. Bradford wrote that Alden &quot;was hired for a cooper, at South-Hampton, wher the ship victuled; and being a hopefull yong man, was much desired, but left to his owne liking to go or stay when he came here; but he stayed, and maryed here&quot;. Charles Edward Banks states that the employment of Alden &quot;at Southampton&quot; does not necessarily mean that he was a resident of the seaport and may have only been there to work temporarily when the &quot;Mayflower&quot; arrived.

Banks cited research by certain historians and genealogists who offered theories as to Alden&#x27;s origin based on inconclusive but possibly relevant evidence. One such theory was proposed by historian and genealogist B. Carlyon-Hughes who found evidence of an Alden family living in Harwich in Essex, England during the 17th century. Harwich is an ancient North Sea port, northeast of London, which was the home port of the ship &quot;Mayflower&quot; and home of its captain Christopher Jones. Carlyon-Hughes asserted that the Aldens of Harwich were related to Jones and also that a young John Alden of the Harwich Aldens was about the same age as the &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger. A prior association with the captain of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; (although not definitively proven) could account, according to Banks, for Alden joining the crew. Historian George F. Willison subscribed to the Harwich origin theory and wrote that Alden&#x27;s children &quot;remembered him as tall, blond, and very powerful in physique&quot;. Willison, however, offers no specific source material for this description.

Another theory cited by Banks, which he called &quot;a fair presumption&quot;, involves a John Alden of Southampton who &quot;may have been the son of George Alden the fletcher, who disappeared—probably dying in that year—leaving John, an orphan, free to take employment overseas. Jane, the widow, may have been his mother and Richard and Avys his grandparents&quot;. The tax list of Holyrood Ward, Southampton in 1602 lists the names of George Alden and John&#x27;s future father-in-law William Mullins. Banks even went so far as to postulate that, if the Alden and Mullins families both originated from Southampton, then perhaps their courtship began in Southampton.

Alicia Crane Williams analyzed these and several other theories in &quot;The Mayflower Descendant&quot;, a scholarly journal of Pilgrim history and genealogy. She pointed out that some genealogists have connected John Alden of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; with John Alden, &quot;son and heir of John Alden of Swanscomb, Kent&quot; who obtained a Patent of Arms in 1607. There is no evidence that John Alden of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; was connected to this family or inherited this coat of arms. Williams states, &quot;This Alden coat of arms was published in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and has led many unsuspecting [genealogists] astray.&quot;

== Voyage of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; ==

Alden was hired by Capt. Christopher Jones in Southampton when he was about 21 years old to work as the ship&#x27;s cooper during the &quot;Mayflower&#x27;s&quot; voyage to America. According to historian Nathaniel Philbrick, the colonists encouraged him during the voyage to remain with them in America due to his useful skills as a barrel-maker and carpenter.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed Plymouth, England on September 6, 1620. The 100-foot ship had aboard 102 passengers and a crew of about 20 to 30 in extremely cramped conditions. A lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for months caused illnesses that eventually proved fatal for many, particularly to women and children. There were two deaths during the ocean crossing, a crew member and a passenger.

The ship spotted Cape Cod on November 9, 1620 after about two months at sea. Their original destination had been the mouth of the Hudson River, which was then part of the Colony of Virginia. Capt. Jones made an attempt to round the southern end of Cape Cod, but he lacked an adequate chart of the area known as Pollock&#x27;s Rip, and the strong currents and dangerous shoals there forced him to turn back. Jones determined that the colonists would have to disembark and settle in New England rather than the Hudson River due to widespread illness aboard ship and dwindling supplies. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; eventually came to anchor on November 11 in Provincetown Harbor at the northern tip of Cape Cod.

The decision to settle outside of Virginia Colony raised some problems. The group carried a patent which granted authority to their elected leaders and entitled them to establish their own plantation within the bounds of Virginia Colony. They were settling in New England, however, so the patent became irrelevant and some members began to question the authority of their leaders. To settle these questions, the colony&#x27;s leadership drew up the Mayflower Compact, an agreement that they would work together, acting as &quot;a civil body politic&quot; in obedience to such laws as the colony might enact. The Mayflower Compact was signed by all free male settlers on November 11, the same day that they set anchor at Provincetown. John Alden signed the document, which is an indication that he had already made the decision to remain with the settlers. He was the youngest of the signers and the last survivor.

== Establishing Plymouth Colony ==

After exploring the inner shoreline of Cape Cod, the colonists chose to settle in Plymouth. The site offered a good harbor, several fresh water springs, and a large hill overlooking the harbor (which they would later name Burial Hill) suitable for a fort. A tribe known as the Patuxet (part of the Wampanoag peoples) had settled the site and cleared a large area of land for planting corn. By the time the &quot;Mayflower&quot; arrived, the Patuxet tribe had been wiped out by plagues, likely as a result of contact with English fishermen.

During their first winter in Plymouth, most of the settlers fell ill and half died of disease. Priscilla Mullins (John Alden&#x27;s future wife) lost her entire family—her father William, her mother Alice, and her brother Joseph. The fifty colonists who survived began building a fort atop Burial Hill and small wooden houses on either side of a &quot;street&quot; now known as Leyden Street, named in 1823 after the town in Holland where the Pilgrims lived for several years. A small plot of land at the foot of Burial Hill near the top of the street was designated for John Alden. He built a primitive house in this location and lived there for about seven years with his wife Priscilla and his growing family. The site of Alden&#x27;s first house in Plymouth was marked in 1930 with a boulder and bronze plaque placed by the Alden Kindred of America. A recreation of this house stands today at Plimoth Plantation, a living history museum which replicates the original Pilgrim settlement.

== Marriage to Priscilla Mullins ==

The exact date of John Alden&#x27;s marriage to Priscilla Mullins was not noted in colonial records. According to the Pilgrim Society, it was likely in 1622 as Priscilla Mullins is not listed separately in the 1623 Division of Land. It was either the second or third marriage to take place in the colony.

The marriage of the two young colonists has been widely depicted in art and literature primarily due to the extraordinary popularity of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish,&quot; published in 1858. The fictionalized story tells of a love triangle involving John Alden, Priscilla Mullins, and Myles Standish (the captain of the colony&#x27;s militia). In the story, Standish is too timid to express his feelings to Priscilla Mullins and therefore asks Alden to speak for him. Alden&#x27;s words of courtship on Standish&#x27;s behalf prompt Mullins to offer an often-quoted quip, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you speak for yourself, John?&quot; The book sold 10,000 copies in London in a single day. In the United States, the story brought the Pilgrims to the forefront of American culture, contributing to the establishment of a national Thanksgiving holiday in 1863. The book made John and Priscilla Alden celebrated figures in American popular culture.

While some historians state that the courtship story is &quot;loosely based&quot; on Alden family oral history, others dismiss it as complete fiction. A brief account of a rivalry between John Alden and Myles Standish for Priscilla&#x27;s hand was first published in &quot;A Collection of American Epitaphs and Inscriptions&quot; by Timothy Alden in 1814. Longfellow, therefore, was not the originator of the story but he greatly embellished it. No part of the tale is supported by 17th century documentation. Historian John Goodwin pointed out several anachronisms and inconsistencies, asserting, there was no &quot;reason for believing any part of it.&quot;

== Service to Plymouth Colony ==
In 1626, the colony&#x27;s financial backers in London, known as the Merchant Adventurers, disbanded. This left the colonists with no means of settling their significant debts to those who had funded the effort. Eight of the Plymouth colonists, including John Alden, agreed to collectively assume, or undertake, the debt in exchange for a monopoly on the fur trade from the colony. These men who averted financial ruin for the colony became known as the &quot;Undertakers&quot;. This agreement to grant the Undertakers a monopoly was signed by the 37 freemen of Plymouth Colony. The fact that Alden was among the Undertakers is indicative of his growing stature in the colony.

Alden was elected Governor&#x27;s Assistant (one of a small council of advisors to the Governor) in 1632 and was regularly reelected to that office until 1640 and then again from 1650 to 1686, because he was deputy from Duxbury from 1641 to 1642, and from 1645 to 1649, and a member of Captain Miles Standish&#x27;s militia company from 1643. He also served as Deputy Governor on two occasions in the absence of the Governor in 1665 and 1677. The colonists elected him Treasurer annually from 1656 to 1658. Alden served on the colony&#x27;s Council of War, an important committee to decide on matters pertaining to the defense of the colony, in 1642, 1643, 1646, 1653, 1658 and 1667. The Plymouth General Court appointed Alden to a number of important committees including the Committee to Revise Laws, the Committee on the Kennebec Trade, and a number of additional minor posts. He then served for several years as magistrate.

Plymouth Colony held a patent entitling them to a monopoly on the fur trade at the Kennebec River in what would later become Maine. In 1634, a man named John Hocking from Piscataqua Plantation in New Hampshire interloped in the trade provoking a confrontation between him and traders from Plymouth Colony at Kennebec. Hocking shot a Plymouth colonist named Moses Talbot and, in turn, a Plymouth man shot Hocking. When the Plymouth traders arrived by boat at Boston, authorities there decided to imprison John Alden who was aboard the Plymouth vessel, even though he had not been present during the violence. It was only through the intervention of William Bradford that Alden was eventually released.

== Settlement of Duxbury ==

In January 1628, the land along Plymouth Bay was divided up into farm lots with each individual receiving 20 acres plus an additional 20 acres for each family member. John and Priscilla Alden, who had three children at that time, received 100 acres along the Bluefish River in the area known as Duxbury (sometimes spelled Duxburough or Duxborrow at that time). Grants were drawn by lot, so the location of Alden&#x27;s farm was not his selection. By chance, as historian Dorothy Wentworth observed, the location was ideal as it included upland that had been partially cleared by Native Americans, woodland, and salt marshes (a good source of hay). Alden built their first small house in 1628. As they were required to travel to Plymouth every Sunday for Sabbath services (10 miles away), they lived seasonally on their Duxbury farm for the first few years, staying in Plymouth during the winter to avoid long travels in harsh weather. The site was professionally excavated by Roland Wells Robbins in 1960, unearthing many artifacts including a halberd blade which is now exhibited at Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth. The site is now part of the Duxbury school campus and is located next to a playing field. The footprint of the house is evident as a depression in the ground and is marked by a boulder, plaque, and other interpretive signage.
In 1632, Alden was one of several men who petitioned the colony to have Duxbury set off as a separate church congregation with their own minister. This would allow those with Duxbury grants to reside on their farms year-round. William Bradford and other colonial officials were reluctant to break apart the &quot;mother&quot; church congregation in Plymouth but nonetheless gave permission. Duxbury was incorporated as a separate town in 1637. John Alden became one of the leading men of the new town of Duxbury and a key figure in the colony. He served as Deputy from Duxbury to the General Court for most of the 1640s.

Local historians of the 19th and 20th centuries asserted that a later Alden house in Duxbury was the second home of John and Priscilla Alden and was constructed in 1653. As local historian Dorothy Wentworth wrote, the tradition &quot;has been accepted for so long that there seems no point in doubting it.&quot; This house is now owned by the Alden Kindred of America and maintained as a museum known as the Alden House Historic Site. Long-standing assumptions about the house turned out to be incorrect as Dendrochronological and architectural analysis conducted in 2003 suggest that the house was likely built about 1700 and therefore was not the home of John and Priscilla Alden. It was likely built by one of their children (possibly Jonathan Alden) or grandchildren.

The Alden&#x27;s first Duxbury home site and the Alden House Historic Site were together granted National Historic Landmark status in 2008.

== Family ==

John and Priscilla Alden had ten children:

#Elizabeth was born in 1623 in Plymouth and died in Little Compton, Rhode Island, on May 31, 1717. She married William Pabodie on December 26, 1644 in Duxbury and had thirteen children. Her grave and that of her husband are in the Old Commons Cemetery in Little Compton.
#John Jr. was born about 1626 in Plymouth and died in Boston on March 14, 1701/2. He married Elizabeth (Phillips) Everill on April 1, 1660, and had fourteen children. He became a prosperous maritime merchant. He also played a controversial role in dealings with Native Americans in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during King William&#x27;s War. In 1692, he was accused of being a witch during the Salem witch trials and jailed, though he later escaped and fled to Duxbury.
#Joseph was born about 1628 and died in Bridgewater, Massachusetts on February 8, 1696/7. He married Mary Simmons about 1660 and had seven children.
#Priscilla was born about 1630. Little is known about her life except for a record which indicates she was alive and unmarried in 1688.
#Jonathan was born about 1632 and died in Duxbury on February 14, 1697. He married Abigail Hallett on December 10, 1672, and had six children. Jonathan was buried in the Old Burying Ground in Duxbury. He was captain of the Plymouth Colony militia and documentation indicates that at his burial, the militia company attended in formation. During his burial, Rev. Ichabod Wiswall of Duxbury delivered a sermon. It is the first known instance of a sermon being delivered at a Plymouth Colony burial indicated changing religious customs. Prior to this, burials were simple affairs without religious ritual.
#Sarah was born about 1634 and died before the settlement of her father&#x27;s estate in 1688. She married Alexander Standish, son of Myles Standish, about 1660 and had eight children.
#Ruth was born about 1636 and died in Braintree, Massachusetts on October 12, 1674. She married John Bass in Braintree on February 3, 1658, and had seven children. Among her children was Hannah Bass, paternal grandmother of future United States President John Adams.
#Mary was born about 1638. She was alive and unmarried in 1688.
#Rebecca was born about 1640. She married Thomas Delano in 1677 and had nine children. She died between June 12, 1696 and October 5, 1722. She is buried in Old Burying Ground in Duxbury.
#David was born about 1642 and died in Duxbury between July 2, 1718, and April 1, 1719. He married Mary Southworth by 1674 and had six children.

== Final days and legacy ==
John Alden was the last survivor of the signers of the Mayflower Compact. He died in Duxbury on September 12, 1687. Both he and his wife Priscilla were buried in the Old Burying Ground in South Duxbury. The precise location of their graves is not known as markers either were not placed or have crumbled away. In 1930, the Alden Kindred of America placed commemorative slate stones at the estimated location of their graves near the headstone of their son, Capt. Jonathan Alden.

Several artifacts attributed to John Alden are exhibited at major museums. These include the halberd blade discovered in the 1960 archaeological dig at the Alden first house site in Duxbury, the Alden family bible, and a mortar and pestle attributed to John and Priscilla Alden, all of which are displayed at Pilgrim Hall Museum. A wheel-lock carbine attributed to John Alden is housed at the National Firearms Museum. Of early-17th-century Italian make, the carbine was found in the Alden House during a 1924 restoration.

The Alden Kindred of America, initially a society composed strictly of Alden descendants, was established in 1906. It is now an incorporated non-profit organization welcoming both Alden descendants and non-descendants to its membership. The organization manages the Alden House Historic Site in Duxbury, Massachusetts.

According to the Alden Kindred of America, John Alden had more than one million living descendants as of 2008.

<text>Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan (Japanese: ) is based on rice with miso soup and other dishes with an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, tamagoyaki, and vegetables cooked in broth. Common seafood is often grilled, but it is also sometimes served raw as sashimi or as sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as &quot;&quot;. Apart from rice, a staple includes noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered dishes, such as fish products in broth called , or beef in and .

Historically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine has also opened up to influence from Western cuisines in the modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign food—in particular Chinese food—like ramen and , as well as foods like spaghetti, curry and hamburgers, have been adapted to Japanese tastes and ingredients. Traditionally, the Japanese shunned meat as a result of adherence to Buddhism, but with the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as and have become common. Since this time, Japanese cuisine, particularly sushi and ramen, has become popular globally.

In 2011, Japan overtook France to become the country with the most 3-starred Michelin restaurants; , the capital of Tokyo has maintained the title of the city with the most 3-starred restaurants in the world. In 2013, Japanese cuisine was added to the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List.
==History==

Rice is a staple in Japanese cuisine. Wheat and soybeans were introduced shortly after rice. All three act as staple foods in Japanese cuisine today. At the end of the Kofun Period and beginning of the Asuka Period, Buddhism became the official religion of the country. Therefore, eating meat and fish was prohibited. In 675 AD, Emperor Tenmu prohibited the eating of horses, dogs, monkeys, and chickens. In the 8th and 9th centuries, many emperors continued to prohibit killing many types of animals. The number of regulated meats increased significantly, leading to the banning of all mammals except whale, which were categorized as fish. During the Asuka period, chopsticks were introduced to Japan. Initially, they were used only by the nobility. The general population used their hands, as utensils were quite expensive.

Due to the lack of meat products, Japanese people minimized spice utilization. Spices were rare to find at the time. Spices, like pepper and garlic, were used only in a minimalist amount. In the absence of meat, fish was served as the main protein, as Japan is an island nation. Fish has influenced many iconic Japanese dishes today. In the 9th century, grilled fish and sliced raw fish were widely popular. Japanese people who could afford it would eat fish at every meal; others would have to make do without animal protein for many of their meals. In traditional Japanese cuisine, oil and fat are usually avoided during the cooking process in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Preserving fish became a sensation; sushi originated as a means of preserving fish by fermenting it in boiled rice. Fish that are salted and then placed in rice are preserved by lactic acid fermentation, which helps prevent the proliferation of the bacteria that bring about putrefaction. During the 15th century, advancement and development helped shorten the fermentation of sushi to about one to two weeks. Sushi thus became popular both as a main meal and as a snack food, combining fish with rice. During the late Edo period (early 19th century), sushi without fermentation was introduced. Sushi was still being consumed with and without fermentation till the 19th century when the hand-rolled and nigiri-type sushi was invented.

In 1854, Japan started to enter new trade deals with Western countries. When Emperor Meiji took power in 1868 as part of the Meiji Restoration, the government began to adopt Western customs, including the use of animal products in food. The new ruler staged a New Year’s feast designed to embrace the Western world and countries in 1872. The feast contained food that reflected European cuisine. For the first time in a thousand years, people were allowed to consume meat in public, and the general population started to include meat in their regular diets.

==Culture==
=== Terminology ===

The word is now the common word for traditional Japanese cooking. The term is synonymous with &quot;cooking&quot;, but became a reference to mostly Japanese cooking, or restaurants, and was much used in the Meiji and Taishō eras. It has come to connote a certain standard, perhaps even of the highest caliber, a restaurant with the most highly trained chefs. However, is generally seen as an eating establishment which is slightly more casual or informal compared to the .

The is tied with the Japanese tea ceremony. The is considered a (simplified) form of , which was formal banquet dining where several trays of food were served. The homophone term originally referred to a gathering of composers of haiku or , and the simplified version of the dishes served at the poem parties became . However, the meaning of degenerated to become just another term for a sumptuous carousing banquet, or .

===Traditional table settings===
The traditional Japanese table setting has varied considerably over the centuries, depending primarily on the type of table common during a given era. Before the 19th century, small individual box tables (&quot;hakozen&quot;, 箱膳) or flat floor trays were set before each diner. Larger low tables (&quot;chabudai&quot;, ちゃぶ台) that accommodated entire families were gaining popularity by the beginning of the 20th century, but these gave way to Western-style dining tables and chairs by the end of the 20th century.

The traditional Japanese table setting is to place a bowl of rice on the diner’s left and to place a bowl of miso soup on the diner’s right side at the table. Behind these, each &quot;okazu&quot; is served on its own individual plate. Based on the standard three &quot;okazu&quot; formula, behind the rice and soup are three flat plates to hold the three &quot;okazu&quot;; one to far back left, one at far back right, and one in the center. Pickled vegetables are often served on the side but are not counted as part of the three &quot;okazu&quot;. Chopsticks are generally placed at the very front of the tray near the diner with pointed ends facing left and supported by a chopstick rest, or &quot;hashioki&quot;.

===Dining etiquette===

Many restaurants and homes in Japan are equipped with Western-style chairs and tables. However, traditional Japanese low tables and cushions, usually found on tatami floors, are also very common. Tatami mats, which are made of straw, can be easily damaged and are hard to clean, thus shoes or any type of footwear are always taken off when stepping on tatami floors.

When dining in a traditional tatami room, sitting upright on the floor is common. In a casual setting, men usually sit with their feet crossed and women sit with both legs to one side. Only men are supposed to sit cross-legged. The formal way of sitting for both sexes is a kneeling style known as &quot;seiza&quot;. To sit in a &quot;seiza&quot; position, one kneels on the floor with legs folded under the thighs and the buttocks resting on the heels.

When dining out in a restaurant, the customers are guided to their seats by the host. The honored or eldest guest will usually be seated at the center of the table farthest from the entrance. In the home, the most important guest is also seated farthest away from the entrance. If there is a tokonoma, or alcove, in the room, the guest is seated in front of it. The host sits next to or closest to the entrance.

In Japan, it is customary to say &quot;itadakimasu&quot; (&quot;I [humbly] receive&quot;) before starting to eat a meal. When saying &quot;itadakimasu&quot;, both hands are put together in front of the chest or on the lap. &quot;Itadakimasu&quot; is preceded by complimenting the appearance of food. Another customary and important etiquette is to say &quot;go-chisō-sama deshita&quot; (&quot;It was a feast&quot;) to the host after the meal and the restaurant staff when leaving.

===Traditional cuisine===
Japanese cuisine is based on combining the staple food, which is steamed white rice or , with one or more , &quot;main&quot; or &quot;side&quot; dishes. This may be accompanied by a clear or miso soup and (pickles). The phrase refers to the makeup of a typical meal served but has roots in classic , , and cuisine. The term is also used to describe the first course served in standard cuisine nowadays.

The origin of Japanese &quot;one soup, three sides&quot; cuisine is a dietary style called Ichiju-Issai (一汁一菜, &quot;one soup, one dish&quot;), tracing back to the Five Great Zen Temples of the 12-century Kamakura period (Kamakura Gozan), developed as a form of meal that emphasized frugality and simplicity.

Rice is served in its own small bowl (), and each main course item is placed on its own small plate () or bowl () for each individual portion. This is done even in Japanese homes. This contrasts with Western-style home dinners in which each individual takes helpings from large serving dishes of food placed in the middle of the dining table. Japanese style traditionally abhors different flavored dishes touching each other on a single plate, so different dishes are given their own individual plates as mentioned or are partitioned using, for example, leaves. Placing main dishes on top of rice, thereby &quot;soiling&quot; it, is also frowned upon by traditional etiquette.
Although this tradition of not placing other foods on rice originated from classical Chinese dining formalities, especially after the adoption of Buddhist tea ceremonies; it became most popular and common during and after the Kamakura period, such as in the . Although present-day Chinese cuisine has abandoned this practice, Japanese cuisine retains it. One exception is the popular , in which toppings are directly served on rice.

The small , literally &quot;tea bowl&quot;, doubles as a word for the large tea bowls in tea ceremonies. Thus in common speech, the drinking cup is referred to as or for the purpose of distinction. Among the nobility, each course of a full-course Japanese meal would be brought on serving napkins called , which were originally platformed trays or small dining tables. In the modern age, faldstool trays or stackup-type legged trays may still be seen used in , i.e. tatami-mat rooms, for large banquets or at a type inn. Some restaurants might use the suffix as a more sophisticated though dated synonym to the more familiar , since the latter basically is a term for a combo meal served at a , akin to a diner. means a meal of fixed menu (for example, grilled fish with rice and soup), a dinner &quot;à prix fixe&quot; served at or , which is somewhat vague ( can mean a diner-type restaurant or a corporate lunch hall); writer on Japanese popular culture Ishikawa Hiroyoshi defines it as fare served at , and comparable diner-like establishments.

===Seasonality===

Emphasis is placed on seasonality of food or , and dishes are designed to herald the arrival of the four seasons or calendar months.

Seasonality means taking advantage of the (for example, bamboo shoots in spring, chestnuts in the autumn) as well as the as they come into season. Thus that arrives with the Kuroshio Current has traditionally been greatly prized.

If something becomes available rather earlier than what is usual for the item in question, the first crop or early catch is called &quot;hashiri&quot;.

Use of tree leaves and branches as decor is also characteristic of Japanese cuisine. Maple leaves are often floated on water to exude coolness or ; sprigs of nandina are popularly used. The &quot;haran&quot; (&quot;Aspidistra&quot;) and sasa bamboo leaves were often cut into shapes and placed underneath or used as separators.

===UNESCO recognition===
In February 2012, the Agency for Cultural Affairs recommended that &#x27;Washoku: Traditional Dietary Cultures of the Japanese&#x27; be added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. On December 4, 2013, &quot;Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year&quot; was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage, bringing the number of Japanese assets listed on UNESCO&#x27;s Intangible Cultural Heritage list to 22.

==Traditional ingredients==

A characteristic of traditional Japanese food is the sparing use of red meat, oils and fats, and dairy products. Use of ingredients such as soy sauce, miso, and umeboshi tends to result in dishes with high salt content, though there are low-sodium versions of these available.

===Meat consumption===

As Japan is an island nation surrounded by an ocean, its people have always taken advantage of the abundant seafood supply. It is the opinion of some food scholars that the Japanese diet always relied mainly on &quot;grains with vegetables or seaweeds as main, with poultry secondary, and red meat in slight amounts&quot; even before the advent of Buddhism which placed an even stronger taboo. The eating of was spoken of as taboo, unclean or something to be avoided by personal choice through the Edo period. The consumption of whale and terrapin meat were not forbidden under this definition. Despite this, the consumption of red meat did not completely disappear in Japan. Eating wild game—as opposed to domesticated livestock—was tolerated; in particular, trapped hare was counted using the measure word , a term normally reserved for birds.

In 1872 of the Meiji restoration, as part of the opening up of Japan to Western influence, Emperor Meiji lifted the ban on the consumption of red meat. The removal of the ban encountered resistance and in one notable response, ten monks attempted to break into the Imperial Palace. The monks asserted that due to foreign influence, large numbers of Japanese had begun eating meat and that this was &quot;destroying the soul of the Japanese people.&quot; Several of the monks were killed during the break-in attempt, and the remainder were arrested. On the other hand, the consumption of meat was accepted by the common people. Gyūnabe (beef hot pot), the prototype of sukiyaki, became the rage of the time. Western restaurants moved in, and some of them changed their form to Yōshoku.

Vegetable consumption has dwindled while processed foods have become more prominent in Japanese households due to the rising costs of general foodstuffs. Nonetheless, Kyoto vegetables, or Kyoyasai, are rising in popularity and different varieties of Kyoto vegetables are being revived.

===Cooking oil===
Generally speaking, traditional Japanese cuisine is prepared with little cooking oil. A major exception is the deep-frying of foods. This cooking method was introduced during the Edo period due to influence from Western (formerly called ) and Chinese cuisine, and became commonplace with the availability of cooking oil due to increased productivity. Dishes such as tempura, aburaage, and satsuma age are now part of established traditional Japanese cuisine. Words such as &quot;tempura&quot; or &quot;hiryōzu&quot; (synonymous with ganmodoki) are said to be of Portuguese origin.

Also, certain rustic sorts of traditional Japanese foods such as kinpira, hijiki, and &quot;kiriboshi&quot; daikon usually involve stir-frying in oil before stewing in soy sauce. Some standard &quot;osōzai&quot; or obanzai dishes feature stir-fried Japanese greens with either age or , dried sardines.

===Seasonings===

Traditional Japanese food is typically seasoned with a combination of dashi, soy sauce, sake and mirin, vinegar, sugar, and salt. A modest number of herbs and spices may be used during cooking as a hint or accent, or as a means of neutralizing fishy or gamy odors present. Examples of such spices include ginger, perilla and red pepper.

Intense condiments, such as wasabi or Japanese mustard, are provided as condiments to raw fish, due to their effect on the mucous membrane which paralyze the sense of smell, particularly from fish odors. A sprig of mitsuba or a piece of yuzu rind floated on soups are called &quot;ukimi&quot;. Minced shiso leaves and myoga often serve as &quot;yakumi&quot;, a type of condiment paired with tataki of katsuo or soba. Shichimi is also a very popular spice mixture often added to soups, noodles and rice cakes. Shichimi is a chilli-based spice mix which contains seven spices: chilli, sansho, orange peel, black sesame, white sesame, hemp, ginger, and nori.

=== Garnishes ===
Once a main dish has been cooked, spices such as minced ginger and various pungent herbs may be added as a garnish, called &quot;tsuma&quot;. Finally, a dish may be garnished with minced seaweed in the form of crumpled nori or flakes of aonori.

Inedible garnishes are featured in dishes to reflect a holiday or the season. Generally these include inedible leaves, flowers native to Japan or with a long history of being grown in the country, as well as their artificial counterparts.

===Salads===

The is boiled green-leaf vegetables bunched and cut to size, steeped in dashi broth, eaten with dashes of soy sauce. Another item is , which could be made with wakame seaweed, or be something like a made from thin toothpick slices of daikon and carrot. The so-called vinegar that is blended with the ingredient here is often which is a blend of vinegar, mirin, and soy sauce. A adds katsuo dashi to this.

An is another group of items, describable as a sort of &quot;tossed salad&quot; or &quot;dressed&quot; (though &quot;aemono&quot; also includes thin strips of squid or fish sashimi (&quot;itozukuri&quot;) etc. similarly prepared). One type is where usually vegetables such as green beans are tossed with white or black sesame seeds ground in a suribachi mortar bowl, flavored additionally with sugar and soy sauce. adds tofu (bean curd) in the mix. An &quot;aemono&quot; is tossed with vinegar-white miso mix and uses &quot;wakegi&quot; scallion and as standard.

===Rice===
Rice has historically been the staple food of the Japanese people. Its fundamental importance is evident from the fact that the word for cooked rice, &quot;gohan&quot; or &quot;meshi&quot;, also stands for a &quot;meal&quot;. While rice has an ancient history of cultivation in Japan, its use as a staple has not been universal. Notably, in northern areas (northern Honshū and Hokkaidō), other grains such as wheat were more common into the 19th century.

In most of Japan, rice used to be consumed for almost every meal, and although a 2007 survey showed that 70% of Japanese still eat it once or twice a day, its popularity is now declining. In the 20th century there has been a shift in dietary habits, with an increasing number of people choosing wheat-based products (such as bread and noodles) over rice.

Japanese rice is short-grained and becomes sticky when cooked. Most rice is sold as &quot;hakumai&quot; (白米, &quot;white rice&quot;), with the outer portion of the grains (糠, &quot;nuka&quot;) polished away. Unpolished brown rice (玄米, &quot;genmai&quot;) is considered less desirable, but its popularity has been increasing.

===Noodles===


Japanese noodles often substitute for a rice-based meal. &quot;Soba&quot; (thin, grayish-brown noodles containing buckwheat flour) and &quot;udon&quot; (thick wheat noodles) are the main traditional noodles, while ramen is a modern import and now very popular. There are also other, less common noodles, such as &quot;somen&quot; (thin, white noodles containing wheat flour).

Japanese noodles, such as soba and udon, are eaten as a standalone, and usually not with a side dish, in terms of general custom. It may have toppings, but they are called . The fried battered shrimp tempura sitting in a bowl of tempura-soba would be referred to as &quot;the shrimp&quot; or &quot;the tempura&quot;, and not so much be referred to as a topping (&quot;gu&quot;). The identical toppings, if served as a dish to be eaten with plain white rice could be called &quot;okazu&quot;, so these terms are context-sensitive. Some noodle dishes derive their name from Japanese folklore, such as kitsune and tanuki, reflecting dishes in which the noodles can be changed, but the broth and garnishes correspond to their respective legend.

Hot noodles are usually served in a bowl already steeped in their broth and are called &quot;kakesoba&quot; or &quot;kakeudon&quot;. Cold soba arrive unseasoned and heaped atop a &quot;zaru&quot; or &quot;seiro&quot;, and are picked up with a chopstick and dunked in their dipping sauce. The broth can consist of many ingredients but is generally based on dashi; the sauce, called tsuyu, is usually more concentrated and made from soy sauce, dashi and mirin, sake or both.

In the simple form, &quot;yakumi&quot; (condiments and spices) such as shichimi, nori, finely chopped scallions, wasabi, etc. are added to the noodles, besides the broth/dip sauce.

Udon may also be eaten in &quot;kama-age&quot; style, piping hot straight out of the boiling pot, and eaten with plain soy sauce and sometimes with raw egg also.

Japanese noodles are traditionally eaten by bringing the bowl close to the mouth, and sucking in the noodles with the aid of chopsticks. The resulting loud slurping noise is considered normal in Japan, although in the 2010s concerns began to be voiced about the slurping being offensive to others, especially tourists. The word &quot;nuuhara&quot; (ヌーハラ, from &quot;nuudoru harasumento&quot;, noodle harassment) was coined to describe this.

===Sweets===


Traditional Japanese sweets are known as &quot;wagashi&quot;. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream, a very popular flavor. Almost all manufacturers produce a version of it. Kakigōri is a shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup or condensed milk. It is usually sold and eaten at summer festivals. A dessert very popular amongst children in Japan is dorayaki. They are sweet pancakes filled with a sweet red bean paste. They are mostly eaten at room temperature but are also considered very delicious hot.

==Drinks==

===Tea===

Green tea may be served with most Japanese dishes. It is produced in Japan and prepared in various forms, such as matcha, the tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony.

===Beer===
Beer production started in Japan in the 1860s. The most commonly consumed beers in Japan are pale-coloured light lagers, with an alcohol strength of around 5.0% ABV. Lager beers are the most commonly produced beer style in Japan, but beer-like beverages, made with lower levels of malts called &quot;Happoshu&quot; (発泡酒, literally, &quot;bubbly alcohol&quot;) or non-malt Happousei (発泡性, literally &quot;effervescence&quot;) have captured a large part of the market as tax is substantially lower on these products. Beer and its varieties have a market share of almost 2/3 of alcoholic beverages.

Small local microbreweries have also gained increasing popularity since the 1990s, supplying distinct tasting beers in a variety of styles that seek to match the emphasis on craftsmanship, quality, and ingredient provenance often associated with Japanese food.

===Sake===

Sake is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 15–17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. At traditional formal meals, it is considered an equivalent to rice and is not simultaneously taken with other rice-based dishes, although this notion is typically no longer applied to modern, refined, premium (&quot;ginjo&quot;) sake, which bear little resemblance to the sakes of even 100 years ago. Side dishes for sake are particularly called &quot;sakana&quot; or &quot;otsumami&quot;.

Sake is brewed in a highly labor-intensive process more similar to beer production than winemaking, hence, the common description of sake as rice &quot;wine&quot; is misleading.
Sake is made with, by legal definition, strictly just four ingredients: special rice, water, koji, and special yeast.

As of 2014, Japan had some 1500 registered breweries, which produce thousands of different sakes. Sake characteristics and flavor profiles vary with regionality, ingredients, and the styles (maintained by brewmaster guilds) that brewery leaders want to produce.

Sake flavor profiles lend extremely well to pairing with a wide variety of cuisines, including non-Japanese cuisines.
===Shōchū===
&quot;Shōchū&quot; is a distilled spirit that is typically made from barley, sweet potato, buckwheat, or rice. &quot;Shōchū&quot; is produced everywhere in Japan, but its production started in Kyushu.

===Whisky===
Japanese whisky began commercial production in the early 20th century, and is now extremely popular, primarily consumed in . It is produced in the Scottish style, with malt whisky produced since the 1980s, and has won top international awards since the 2000s.

===Wine===
A domestic wine production has existed since the 1860s, yet most wine is imported. The total market share of wine on alcoholic beverages is about 3%.

==Specialty food==

Wagyu is the collective name for the four principal Japanese breeds of beef cattle. All wagyū cattle derive from cross-breeding in the early twentieth century of native Japanese cattle with imported stock, mostly from Europe.
In several areas of Japan, Wagyu beef is shipped carrying area names. Some examples are Matsusaka beef, Kobe beef, Yonezawa beef, Ōmi beef, and Sanda beef. In recent years, Wagyu beef has increased in fat percentage due to a decrease in grazing and an increase in using feed, resulting in larger, fattier cattle.

Specialty eggs – compared to ordinary eggs, eggs produced with special feed and poultry-raising.

The is a cantaloupe cultivar farmed in greenhouses in Yūbari, Hokkaido, a small city close to Sapporo.

Square or cube watermelons are watermelons grown into the shape of a cube. Cube watermelons are commonly sold in Japan, where they are essentially ornamental and are often very expensive, with prices as high as .

==Cooking techniques==
Different cooking techniques are applied to each of the three &quot;okazu&quot;; they may be raw (sashimi), grilled, simmered (sometimes called boiled), steamed, deep-fried, vinegared, or dressed.

==Dishes==

In , the word has the basic meaning of &quot;vegetable&quot;, but secondarily means any accompanying dish (whether it uses fish or meat), with the more familiar combined form , which is a term for any side dish, such as the vast selections sold at Japanese supermarkets or .

It figures in the Japanese word for appetizer, ; main dish, ; or (formal synonym for &quot;okazu&quot;), but the latter is considered somewhat of a ladies&#x27; term or &quot;nyōbō kotoba&quot;.

==Classification==

===Kaiseki===

&quot;Kaiseki&quot;, closely associated with tea ceremony (&quot;chanoyu&quot;), is a high form of hospitality through cuisine. The style is minimalist, extolling the aesthetics of wabi-sabi. Like the tea ceremony, appreciation of the diningware and vessels is part of the experience. In the modern standard form, the first course consists of &quot;ichijū-sansai&quot; (one soup, three dishes), followed by the serving of sake accompanied by dish(es) plated on a square wooden bordered tray of sorts called . Sometimes another element called is served to complement the sake, for guests who are heavier drinkers.
===Vegetarian===

Strictly vegetarian food is rare since even vegetable dishes are flavored with the ubiquitous dashi stock, usually made with katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes), and are therefore pescetarian more often than carnivorous. An exception is &quot;shōjin-ryōri&quot; (精進料理), vegetarian dishes developed by Buddhist monks. However, the advertised &quot;shōjin-ryōri&quot; at public eating places includes some non-vegetarian elements. Vegetarianism, was introduced from China by the Ōbaku sect (a sub-sect of Zen Buddhism), and which some sources still regard as part of &quot;Japanese cuisine&quot;. The sect in Japan was founded by the priest Ingen (d. 1673), and is headquartered in Uji, Kyoto. The Japanese name for the common green bean takes after this priest who allegedly introduced the New World crop via China. One aspect of the fucha-ryōri practiced at the temple is the wealth of , one example being mock-eel, made from strained tofu, with nori seaweed used expertly to mimic the black skin. The secret ingredient used is grated &quot;gobō&quot; (burdock) roots.

Masakazu Tada, Honorary Vice-President of the International Vegetarian Union for 25 years from 1960, stated that &quot;Japan was vegetarian for 1,000 years&quot;. The taboo against eating meat was lifted in 1872 by the Meiji Emperor as part of an effort towards westernizing Japan. British journalist J. W. Robertson Scott reported in the 1920s that the society was still 90% vegetarian, and 50–60% of the population ate fish only on festive occasions, probably due to poverty more than for any other reason.

===Regional cuisine===

Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties known as &quot;kyōdo-ryōri&quot; (郷土料理), many of them originating from dishes prepared using traditional recipes with local ingredients. Foods from the Kantō region taste very strong. For example, the dashi-based broth for serving udon noodles is heavy on dark soy sauce, similar to soba broth. On the other hand, Kansai region foods are lightly seasoned, with clear udon noodles. made with light soy sauce.

==Dishes for special occasions==
In Japanese tradition, some dishes are strongly tied to a festival or event. These dishes include:
In some regions, on every first and fifteenth day of the month, people eat a mixture of rice and azuki (&quot;azuki meshi&quot; (小豆飯); see Sekihan).

==Imported and adapted foods==
Japan has a long history of importing food from other countries, some of which are now part of Japan&#x27;s most popular cuisine. Ramen is considered an important part to their culinary history, to the extent where in survey of 2,000 Tokyo residents, instant ramen came up many times as a product they thought was an outstanding Japanese invention. Believed to have originated in China, ramen became popular in Japan after the Second Sino-Japanese war (1937–1945), when many Chinese students were displaced to Japan.
Curry is another popular imported dish and is ranked near the top of nearly all Japanese surveys for favorite foods. The origins of curry, as well many other foreign imports such as &quot;pan&quot; or bread, are linked to the emergence of &quot;yōshoku&quot;, or western cuisine. &quot;Yōshoku&quot; can be traced as far back as the late Muromachi period (1336–1573) during a culinary revolution called &quot;namban ryori&quot; (南蛮料理), which means &quot;Southern barbarian cooking&quot;, as it is rooted in European cuisine. This cuisine style was first seen in Nagasaki, which served as the point of contact between Europe and Japan at that point in time. Food items such as potatoes, corn, dairy products, as well as the hard candy &quot;kompeito&quot; (金平糖), spread during this time. This cuisine became popular in the Meiji period, which is considered by many historians to be when Japan first opened itself to the outside world. 

Bread was not a traditional food in Japan, but &quot;shokupan&quot;, or Japanese milk bread, was developed and came into broad use after the American response to post-World War II Japanese rice shortages included relief shipments of wheat.

Today, many of these imported items still hold a heavy presence in Japan.

===Yōshoku – Foreign (Western) food, dishes===
Japan today abounds with home-grown, loosely Western-style food. Many of these were invented in the wake of the 1868 Meiji Restoration and the end of national seclusion, when the sudden influx of foreign (in particular, Western) culture led to many restaurants serving Western food, known as &quot;yōshoku&quot; (洋食), a shortened form of &quot;seiyōshoku&quot; (西洋食, &quot;Western cuisine&quot;), opening up in cities. Restaurants that serve these foods are called &quot;yōshokuya&quot; (洋食屋, &quot;Western cuisine restaurants&quot;).

Many &quot;yōshoku&quot; items from that time have been adapted to a degree that they are now considered Japanese and are an integral part of any Japanese family menu. Many are served alongside rice and miso soup, and eaten with chopsticks. Yet, due to their origins these are still categorized as &quot;yōshoku&quot; as opposed to the more traditional &quot;washoku&quot; (和食, &quot;Japanese cuisine&quot;).

=== Chūka ryōri – Japanese Chinese cuisine ===

Chinese cuisine is one of the oldest and most common foreign cuisines in Japan, predating the introduction of Western food dishes into the country. Many Chinese dishes have been altered to suit Japanese palates in a type of cuisine known as &quot;chuka ryori&quot;. Iconic dishes of chuka ryori include ramen, gyoza, and chukaman.

===Okonomiyaki===
Okonomiyaki is a savoury pancake containing a variety of ingredients in a wheat-flour-based batter.

===Tonkatsu===
Tonkatsu is a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. It is frequently served with tonkatsu sauce.

===Curry===

Curry was introduced by Anglo-Indian officers of the Royal Navy from India who brought curry powder to Japan in the Meiji period. The Imperial Japanese Navy adopted curry to prevent beriberi. Overtime it was reinvented and adapted to suit Japanese tastes that it became uniquely Japanese. It is consumed so much that it is considered a national dish. Many recipes are on the menu of the JMSDF. A variety of vegetables and meats are used to make Japanese curry, usually vegetables like onions, carrots, and potatoes. The types of meat used are beef, pork, and chicken. A popular dish is &quot;Katsu-karē&quot; which is a breaded deep-fried cutlet (&quot;tonkatsu&quot;; usually pork or chicken) with Japanese curry sauce. Japanese curry can be found in foods such as curry udon, curry bread, and &quot;katsukarē&quot;, tonkatsu served with curry. It&#x27;s very commonly made with rice beside the curry on the dish called . This can be eaten during dinner.

===Wafū burgers (Japanese-style burgers)===
Hamburger chains active in Japan include McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, First Kitchen, Lotteria and MOS Burger. Many chains developed uniquely Japanese versions of American fast food such as the teriyaki burger, kinpira (sauté) rice burger, fried shrimp burgers, and green tea milkshakes.

===Italian===

High-class Japanese chefs have preserved many Italian seafood dishes that are forgotten in other countries. These include pasta with prawns, lobster (a specialty known in Italy as pasta all&#x27;aragosta), crab (an Italian specialty; in Japan it is served with a different species of crab), and pasta with sea urchin sauce (sea urchin pasta being a specialty of the Puglia region).

==Outside Japan==

Many countries have imported portions of Japanese cuisine. Some may adhere to the traditional preparations of the cuisines, but in some cultures the dishes have been adapted to fit the palate of the local populace. In 1970s sushi travelled from Japan to Canada and the United States, it was modified to suit the American palate, and re-entered the Japanese market as &quot;American Sushi&quot;. An example of this phenomenon is the California roll, which was created in North America in the 1970s, rose in popularity across the United States through the 1980s, and thus sparked Japanese food&#x27;s – more precisely, sushi&#x27;s – global popularity.

In 2014, Japanese Restaurant Organization has selected potential countries where Japanese food is becoming increasingly popular, and conducted research concerning the Japanese restaurants abroad. These key nations or region are Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. This was meant as an effort to promote Japanese cuisine and to expand the market of Japanese ingredients, products and foodstuffs. Numbers of Japanese foodstuff and seasoning brands such as Ajinomoto, Kikkoman, Nissin and Kewpie mayonnaise, are establishing production base in other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia.

===Australia===
Japanese cuisine is very popular in Australia, and Australians are becoming increasingly familiar with traditional Japanese foods. Restaurants serving Japanese cuisine feature prominently in popular rankings, including Gourmet Traveller and The Good Food Guide.

Sushi in particular has been described as being &quot;as popular as sandwiches&quot;, particularly in large cities like Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane. As such, sushi bars are a mainstay in shopping centre food courts, and are extremely common in cities and towns all over the country.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, Japanese food is widespread due to the large Japanese-Brazilian population living in the country, which represents the largest Japanese community living outside Japan. Over the past years, many restaurant chains such as Koni Store have opened, selling typical dishes such as the popular temaki. Yakisoba, which is readily available in all supermarkets, and often included in non-Japanese restaurant menus.

===Canada===
In Canada, Japanese cuisine has become quite popular. Sushi, sashimi, and instant ramen are highly popular at opposite ends of the income scale, with instant ramen being a common low-budget meal. Sushi and sashimi takeout began in Vancouver and Toronto, and is now common throughout Canada. The largest supermarket chains all carry basic sushi and sashimi, and Japanese ingredients and instant ramen are readily available in most supermarkets. Most mid-sized mall food courts feature fast-food teppan cooking. Izakaya restaurants have surged in popularity. Higher-end ramen restaurants (as opposed to instant ramen noodles of variable quality) are increasingly common.

===Indonesia===

In the ASEAN region, Indonesia is the second largest market for Japanese food, after Thailand. Japanese cuisine has been increasingly popular as a result of the growing Indonesian middle-class expecting higher quality foods. This has also contributed to the fact that Indonesia has large numbers of Japanese expatriates. The main concern is the issue of many traditional Japanese recipes not being halal. As a Muslim majority country, Indonesians expect that Japanese foods served there are halal according to Islamic dietary law, which means no pork or alcohol are allowed. Japanese restaurants in Indonesia often offer a set menu which includes rice served with an array of Japanese favourites in a single setting. A set menu might include a choice of yakiniku or sukiyaki, including a sample of sushi, tempura, gyoza and miso soup. Authentic Japanese style izakaya and ramen shops can be found in the Little Tokyo (Melawai) area in Blok M, South Jakarta, serving both Japanese expats and local clienteles. Today, Japanese restaurants can be found in most major Indonesian cities, with a high concentration in Greater Jakarta area, Bandung, Surabaya and Bali.

In some cases, Japanese cuisine in Indonesia is often altered to suit Indonesian taste. Hoka Hoka Bento in particular is an Indonesian-owned Japanese fast food restaurant chain that caters to the Indonesian clientele. As a result, the foods served there have been adapted to suit Indonesians&#x27; taste. Examples of the change include stronger flavours compared to the authentic subtle Japanese taste, the preference for fried food, as well as the addition of sambal to cater to the Indonesians&#x27; preference for hot and spicy food.

Japanese food popularity also has penetrated street food culture, as modest &quot;Warjep&quot; or &quot;Warung Jepang&quot; (Japanese food stall) offer Japanese food such as tempura, okonomiyaki and takoyaki, at moderately low prices. Today, okonomiyaki and takoyaki are popular street fare in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities. This is also pushed further by the Japanese convenience stores operating in Indonesia, such as 7-Eleven and Lawson offering Japanese favourites such as oden, chicken katsu (deep-fried chicken cutlet), chicken teriyaki and onigiri.

Some chefs in Indonesian sushi establishments have created a Japanese-Indonesian fusion cuisine, such as krakatau roll, gado-gado roll, rendang roll and gulai ramen. The idea of fusion cuisine melding spicy Indonesian Padang and Japanese cuisine was combined because both cuisine traditions are well-liked by Indonesians. Nevertheless, some of these Japanese eating establishments might strive to serve authentic Japanese cuisine abroad. Numbers of Japanese chain restaurants has established their business in Indonesia, such as Yoshinoya gyūdon restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku yakiniku restaurant chain and Ajisen Ramen restaurant chain.

===Mexico===
In Mexico, certain Japanese restaurants have created what is known as &quot;sushi Mexicano&quot;, in which spicy sauces and ingredients accompany the dish or are integrated in sushi rolls. The habanero and serrano chiles have become nearly standard and are referred to as chiles toreados, as they are fried, diced and tossed over a dish upon request.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, Japanese cuisine is also popular among the local population. The Philippines have been exposed to the influences from the Japanese, Indian and Chinese. The cities of Davao and Metro Manila probably have the most Japanese influence in the country. The popular dining spots for Japanese nationals are located in Makati, which is called as &quot;Little Tokyo&quot;, a small area filled with restaurants specializing in different types of Japanese food. Some of the best Japanese no-frills restaurants in the Philippines can be found in Makati&#x27;s &quot;Little Tokyo&quot; area. In the Philippines, Halo-halo is derived from Japanese Kakigori. Halo-halo is believed to be an indigenized version of the Japanese &quot;kakigori&quot; class of desserts, originating from pre-war Japanese migrants into the islands. The earliest versions were composed only of cooked red beans or mung beans in crushed ice with sugar and milk, a dessert known locally as &quot;mongo-ya&quot;. Over the years, more native ingredients were added, resulting in the development of the modern &quot;halo-halo&quot;. Some authors specifically attribute it to the 1920s or 1930s Japanese migrants in the Quinta Market of Quiapo, Manila, due to its proximity to the now defunct Insular Ice Plant, which was the source of the city&#x27;s ice supply. In Cebu City, the Little Kyoto district let&#x27;s you experience the feel of being in Kyoto, Japan with a statue of the reclining Buddha overlooking the city. The Little Kyoto district also features Japanese food stalls serving various Japanese dishes like Takoyaki, Tempura, and various other Japanese cuisine that is enjoyed by the people of Cebu City, Philippines. Odong, also called pancit odong, is a Visayan noodle soup made with noodles, canned smoked sardines (&quot;tinapa&quot;) in tomato sauce, bottle gourd (), loofah (), chayote, ginger, garlic, red onions, and various other vegetables. It is garnished and spiced with black pepper, scallions, toasted garlic, calamansi, or labuyo chilis. The dish is usually prepared as a soup, but it can also be cooked with minimal water, in which case, it is known as odong guisado. 

It is a common simple and cheap meal in Mindanao (particularly the Davao Region) and the Visayas Islands. It is almost always eaten with white rice, rarely on its own.

It is named after the round flour noodles called which are closest in texture and taste to the Okinawa soba. These noodles are characteristically sold dried into straight sticks around long. The name is derived from the Japanese &quot;udon&quot; noodles, although it does not use &quot;udon&quot; noodles or bear any resemblance to &quot;udon&quot; dishes. It originates from the Davao Region of Mindanao which had a large Japanese migrant community in the early 1900s. The noodles were previously locally manufactured by Okinawans, but modern noodles (which are distinctly yellowish) are imported from China. Because noodles are difficult to find in other regions, they can be substituted with other types of noodles; including &quot;misua&quot;, &quot;miki&quot; (egg noodles), &quot;udon&quot;, and even instant noodles.

===Taiwan===
Japan and Taiwan have shared close historical and cultural relations. Dishes such as sushi, ramen, and donburi are very popular among locals. Japanese chain restaurants such as Coco Ichibanya, Ippudo, Kura Sushi, Marugame Seimen, Mister Donut, MOS Burger, Ootoya, Ramen Kagetsu Arashi, Saizeriya, Sukiya, Sushiro, Tonkatsu Shinjuku Saboten, Yayoi Ken, and Yoshinoya, can all be found in Taiwan, among others. Taiwan has adapted many Japanese food items. Tianbula (&quot;Taiwanese tempura&quot;) is actually satsuma-age and was introduced to Taiwan during Japanese rule by people from Kyushu, where the word &quot;tempura&quot; is commonly used to refer to satsuma-age. It is popular as a night market snack and as an ingredient for oden, hot pot and lu wei. Taiwanese versions of oden are sold locally as olen or, more recently, as guandongzhu (from Japanese Kantō-ni) in convenience stores.

===Thailand===
In Southeast Asia, Thailand is the largest market for Japanese food. This is partly because Thailand is a popular tourist destination, having large numbers of Japanese expatriates, as well as the local population having developed a taste for authentic Japanese cuisine. According to the Organisation that Promote Japanese Restaurants Abroad (JRO), the number of Japanese restaurants in Thailand jumped about 2.2-fold from 2007&#x27;s figures to 1,676 in June 2012. In Bangkok, Japanese restaurants accounts for 8.3 percent of all restaurants, following those that serve Thai. Numbers of Japanese chain restaurants has established their business in Thailand, such as Yoshinoya gyūdon restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku yakiniku restaurant chain and Kourakuen ramen restaurant chain.

===United Kingdom===

Japanese food Inspired restaurant chains in the UK include Wagamama, YO! Sushi, Nudo Sushi Box, Wasabi, Bone Daddies and Kokoro, often localising the food and mixing in other ingredients originating from Southeast Asia and India.

===United States===
The California roll has been influential in sushi&#x27;s global popularity; its invention often credited to a Japanese-born chef working in Los Angeles, with dates assigned to 1973, or even 1964. The dish has been snubbed by some purist sushi chefs, and also likened to the American-born chop suey by one scholar.

 the country has about 4,200 sushi restaurants. It is one of the most popular styles of sushi in the US market. Japanese cuisine is an integral part of food culture in Hawaii as well as in other parts of the United States. Popular items are sushi, sashimi, and teriyaki. Kamaboko, known locally as fish cake, is a staple of saimin, a noodle soup that is a local favorite in Hawaii. Sushi, long regarded as quite exotic in the west until the 1970s, has become a popular health food in parts of North America, Western Europe and Asia.

Two of the first Japanese restaurants in the United States were Saito and Nippon. Restaurants such as these popularized dishes such as sukiyaki and tempura, while Nippon was the first restaurant in Manhattan to have a dedicated sushi bar. Nippon was also one of the first Japanese restaurants in the U.S. to grow and process their own soba and responsible for creation of the now standard beef negimayaki dish.

In the U.S., the teppanyaki &quot;iron hot plate&quot; cooking restaurant took foothold. Such restaurants featured steak, shrimp and vegetables (including bean sprouts), cooked in front of the customer on a &quot;teppanyaki grill&quot; (teppan) by a personal chef who turns cooking into performance art, twirling and juggling cutting knives like batons. The meal would be served with steamed rice and Japanese soup. This style of cooking was made popular in the U.S. when Rocky Aoki founded his popular restaurant chain Benihana in 1964. In Japan this type of cooking is thought to be American food, but in the U.S. it is thought to be Japanese. Aoki thought this would go over better in the U.S. than traditional Japanese cuisine because he felt that Americans enjoyed &quot;eating in exotic surroundings, but are deeply mistrustful of exotic foods&quot;.

==Food controversies==

Some elements of Japanese cuisine involving eating live seafood, such as Ikizukuri and Odori ebi, have received criticism overseas as a form of animal cruelty.

Japanese cuisine is heavily dependent on seafood products. About 45 kilograms of seafood are consumed per capita annually in Japan, more than most other developed countries. An aspect of environmental concern is Japanese appetite for seafood, which could contribute to the depletion of natural ocean resources. For example, Japan consumes 80% of the global supply of blue fin tuna, a popularly sought sushi and sashimi ingredient, which could lead to its extinction due to commercial overfishing. Another environmental concern is commercial whaling and the consumption of whale meat, for which Japan is the world&#x27;s largest market.
