In 1990 he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Joseph E. Murray for the development of cell and organ transplantation. Thomas developed bone marrow transplantation as a treatment for leukemia.
* John Tyndall (1820–1893): Prominent 19th century experimental physicist. Known for producing a number of discoveries about processes in the atmosphere.
* Neil deGrasse Tyson (born 1958): American astrophysicist, science communicator, the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and a Research Associate in the Department of Astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History.
* Stanislaw Ulam (1909–1984): Polish-Jewish mathematician. He participated in America&#x27;s Manhattan Project, originated the Teller–Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons, invented the Monte Carlo method of computation, and suggested nuclear pulse propulsion.
* Martinus J. G. Veltman (1931–2021): Dutch theoretical physicist. He shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics with his former student Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft for their work on particle theory.
* Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902): German doctor, anthropologist, pathologist, prehistorian, biologist and politician. Referred to as &quot;the father of modern pathology&quot;, he is considered one of the founders of social medicine.
* John von Neumann (1903–1957): Hungarian-American mathematician and polymath who made major contributions to a vast number of fields, including set theory, functional analysis, quantum mechanics, ergodic theory, geometry, fluid dynamics, economics, linear programming, game theory, computer science, numerical analysis, hydrodynamics, and statistics, as well as many other mathematical fields. It is indicated that he was an &quot;agnostic Catholic&quot; due to his agreement with Pascal&#x27;s Wager.
* Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913): British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist. He is best known for independently proposing a theory of evolution due to natural selection that prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own theory.
* André Weil (1906–1998): French mathematician. He is especially known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry.
* Walter Frank Raphael Weldon (1860–1906): English evolutionary biologist and a founder of biometry. He was the joint founding editor of Biometrika, with Francis Galton and Karl Pearson.
* Norbert Wiener (1894–1964): American mathematician and child prodigy. He is regarded as the originator of cybernetics.
* Eugene Wigner (1902–1995): Hungarian American theoretical physicist and mathematician. He received a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 &quot;for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles&quot;; the other half of the award was shared between Maria Goeppert-Mayer and J. Hans D. Jensen. Wigner is important for having laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics as well as for his research into the structure of the atomic nucleus. It was Eugene Wigner who first identified Xe-135 &quot;poisoning&quot; in nuclear reactors, and for this reason it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Wigner poisoning&quot;. Wigner is also important for his work in pure mathematics, having authored a number of theorems.
* Frank Wilczek (born 1951): American theoretical physicist. Along with David J. Gross and Hugh David Politzer, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004.

<text>In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains data, and a reference (in other words, a &quot;link&quot;) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that data access time is linear in respect to the number of nodes in the list. Because nodes are serially linked, accessing any node requires that the prior node be accessed beforehand (which introduces difficulties in pipelining). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis.

The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items do not need to be stored in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal.

On the other hand, since simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data or any form of efficient indexing, many basic operations—such as obtaining the last node of the list, finding a node that contains a given datum, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted—may require iterating through most or all of the list elements.

==History==
Linked lists were developed in 1955–1956, by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University as the primary data structure for their Information Processing Language (IPL). IPL was used by the authors to develop several early artificial intelligence programs, including the Logic Theory Machine, the General Problem Solver, and a computer chess program. Reports on their work appeared in IRE Transactions on Information Theory in 1956, and several conference proceedings from 1957 to 1959, including Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference in 1957 and 1958, and Information Processing (Proceedings of the first UNESCO International Conference on Information Processing) in 1959. The now-classic diagram consisting of blocks representing list nodes with arrows pointing to successive list nodes appears in &quot;Programming the Logic Theory Machine&quot; by Newell and Shaw in Proc. WJCC, February 1957. Newell and Simon were recognized with the ACM Turing Award in 1975 for having &quot;made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing&quot;. The problem of machine translation for natural language processing led Victor Yngve at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use linked lists as data structures in his COMIT programming language for computer research in the field of linguistics. A report on this language entitled &quot;A programming language for mechanical translation&quot; appeared in Mechanical Translation in 1958.

Another early appearance of linked lists was by Hans Peter Luhn who wrote an internal IBM memorandum in January 1953 that suggested the use of linked lists in chained hash tables.

LISP, standing for list processor, was created by John McCarthy in 1958 while he was at MIT and in 1960 he published its design in a paper in the Communications of the ACM, entitled &quot;Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I&quot;. One of LISP&#x27;s major data structures is the linked list.

By the early 1960s, the utility of both linked lists and languages which use these structures as their primary data representation was well established. Bert Green of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory published a review article entitled &quot;Computer languages for symbol manipulation&quot; in IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics in March 1961 which summarized the advantages of the linked list approach. A later review article, &quot;A Comparison of list-processing computer languages&quot; by Bobrow and Raphael, appeared in Communications of the ACM in April 1964.

Several operating systems developed by Technical Systems Consultants (originally of West Lafayette Indiana, and later of Chapel Hill, North Carolina) used singly linked lists as file structures. A directory entry pointed to the first sector of a file, and succeeding portions of the file were located by traversing pointers. Systems using this technique included Flex (for the Motorola 6800 CPU), mini-Flex (same CPU), and Flex9 (for the Motorola 6809 CPU). A variant developed by TSC for and marketed by Smoke Signal Broadcasting in California, used doubly linked lists in the same manner.

The TSS/360 operating system, developed by IBM for the System 360/370 machines, used a double linked list for their file system catalog. The directory structure was similar to Unix, where a directory could contain files and other directories and extend to any depth.

==Basic concepts and nomenclature==
Each record of a linked list is often called an &#x27;element&#x27; or &#x27;node&#x27;.

The field of each node that contains the address of the next node is usually called the &#x27;next link&#x27; or &#x27;next pointer&#x27;. The remaining fields are known as the &#x27;data&#x27;, &#x27;information&#x27;, &#x27;value&#x27;, &#x27;cargo&#x27;, or &#x27;payload&#x27; fields.

The &#x27;head&#x27; of a list is its first node. The &#x27;tail&#x27; of a list may refer either to the rest of the list after the head, or to the last node in the list. In Lisp and some derived languages, the next node may be called the &#x27;cdr&#x27; (pronounced ) of the list, while the payload of the head node may be called the &#x27;car&#x27;.

===Singly linked list===
Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a &#x27;value&#x27; field as well as &#x27;next&#x27; field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.

The following C language code demonstrates how to add a new node with the &quot;value&quot; to the end of a singly linked list:
// Each node in a linked list is a structure. The head node is the first node in the list.

Node *addNodeToTail(Node *head, int value) {
 // declare Node pointer and initialize to point to the new Node (i.e., it will have the new Node&#x27;s memory address) being added to the end of the list.
 Node *temp = malloc(sizeof *temp); /// &#x27;malloc&#x27; in stdlib.
 temp-&gt;value = value; // Add data to the value field of the new Node.
 temp-&gt;next = NULL; // initialize invalid links to nil.
 if (head == NULL) {
 head = temp; // If the linked list is empty (i.e., the head node pointer is a null pointer), then have the head node pointer point to the new Node.
 else {
 Node *p = head; // Assign the head node pointer to the Node pointer &#x27;p&#x27;.
 while (p-&gt;next != NULL) {
 p = p-&gt;next; // Traverse the list until p is the last Node. The last Node always points to NULL.
 p-&gt;next = temp; // Make the previously last Node point to the new Node.
 
 return head; // Return the head node pointer.


===Doubly linked list===

In a &#x27;doubly linked list&#x27;, each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field pointing to the &#x27;previous&#x27; node in the sequence. The two links may be called &#x27;forward(&#x27;s&#x27;) and &#x27;backwards&#x27;, or &#x27;next&#x27; and &#x27;prev&#x27;(&#x27;previous&#x27;).

A technique known as XOR-linking allows a doubly linked list to be implemented using a single link field in each node. However, this technique requires the ability to do bit operations on addresses, and therefore may not be available in some high-level languages.

Many modern operating systems use doubly linked lists to maintain references to active processes, threads, and other dynamic objects. A common strategy for rootkits to evade detection is to unlink themselves from these lists.

===Multiply linked list===
In a &#x27;multiply linked list&#x27;, each node contains two or more link fields, each field being used to connect the same set of data arranged in a different order (e.g., by name, by department, by date of birth, etc.). While a doubly linked list can be seen as a special case of multiply linked list, the fact that the two and more orders are opposite to each other leads to simpler and more efficient algorithms, so they are usually treated as a separate case.

===Circular linked list===
In the last node of a linked list, the link field often contains a null reference, a special value is used to indicate the lack of further nodes. A less common convention is to make it point to the first node of the list; in that case, the list is said to be &#x27;circular&#x27; or &#x27;circularly linked&#x27;; otherwise, it is said to be &#x27;open&#x27; or &#x27;linear&#x27;. It is a list where the last node pointer points to the first node (i.e., the &quot;next link&quot; pointer of the last node has the memory address of the first node).

In the case of a circular doubly linked list, the first node also points to the last node of the list.

===Sentinel nodes===

In some implementations an extra &#x27;sentinel&#x27; or &#x27;dummy&#x27; node may be added before the first data record or after the last one. This convention simplifies and accelerates some list-handling algorithms, by ensuring that all links can be safely dereferenced and that every list (even one that contains no data elements) always has a &quot;first&quot; and &quot;last&quot; node.

===Empty lists===
An empty list is a list that contains no data records. This is usually the same as saying that it has zero nodes. If sentinel nodes are being used, the list is usually said to be empty when it has only sentinel nodes.

===Hash linking===
The link fields need not be physically part of the nodes. If the data records are stored in an array and referenced by their indices, the link field may be stored in a separate array with the same indices as the data records.

===List handles===
Since a reference to the first node gives access to the whole list, that reference is often called the &#x27;address&#x27;, &#x27;pointer&#x27;, or &#x27;handle&#x27; of the list. Algorithms that manipulate linked lists usually get such handles to the input lists and return the handles to the resulting lists. In fact, in the context of such algorithms, the word &quot;list&quot; often means &quot;list handle&quot;. In some situations, however, it may be convenient to refer to a list by a handle that consists of two links, pointing to its first and last nodes.

===Combining alternatives===
The alternatives listed above may be arbitrarily combined in almost every way, so one may have circular doubly linked lists without sentinels, circular singly linked lists with sentinels, etc.

==Tradeoffs==
As with most choices in computer programming and design, no method is well suited to all circumstances. A linked list data structure might work well in one case, but cause problems in another. This is a list of some of the common tradeoffs involving linked list structures.

===Linked lists vs. dynamic arrays===

A &quot;dynamic array&quot; is a data structure that allocates all elements contiguously in memory, and keeps a count of the current number of elements. If the space reserved for the dynamic array is exceeded, it is reallocated and (possibly) copied, which is an expensive operation.

Linked lists have several advantages over dynamic arrays. Insertion or deletion of an element at a specific point of a list, assuming that a pointer is indexed to the node (before the one to be removed, or before the insertion point) already, is a constant-time operation (otherwise without this reference it is O(n)), whereas insertion in a dynamic array at random locations will require moving half of the elements on average, and all the elements in the worst case. While one can &quot;delete&quot; an element from an array in constant time by somehow marking its slot as &quot;vacant&quot;, this causes fragmentation that impedes the performance of iteration.

Moreover, arbitrarily many elements may be inserted into a linked list, limited only by the total memory available; while a dynamic array will eventually fill up its underlying array data structure and will have to reallocate—an expensive operation, one that may not even be possible if memory is fragmented, although the cost of reallocation can be averaged over insertions, and the cost of an insertion due to reallocation would still be amortized O(1). This helps with appending elements at the array&#x27;s end, but inserting into (or removing from) middle positions still carries prohibitive costs due to data moving to maintain contiguity. An array from which many elements are removed may also have to be resized in order to avoid wasting too much space.

On the other hand, dynamic arrays (as well as fixed-size array data structures) allow constant-time random access, while linked lists allow only sequential access to elements. Singly linked lists, in fact, can be easily traversed in only one direction. This makes linked lists unsuitable for applications where it&#x27;s useful to look up an element by its index quickly, such as heapsort. Sequential access on arrays and dynamic arrays is also faster than on linked lists on many machines, because they have optimal locality of reference and thus make good use of data caching.

Another disadvantage of linked lists is the extra storage needed for references, which often makes them impractical for lists of small data items such as characters or Boolean values, because the storage overhead for the links may exceed by a factor of two or more the size of the data. In contrast, a dynamic array requires only the space for the data itself (and a very small amount of control data). It can also be slow, and with a naïve allocator, wasteful, to allocate memory separately for each new element, a problem generally solved using memory pools.

Some hybrid solutions try to combine the advantages of the two representations. Unrolled linked lists store several elements in each list node, increasing cache performance while decreasing memory overhead for references. CDR coding does both these as well, by replacing references with the actual data referenced, which extends off the end of the referencing record.

A good example that highlights the pros and cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, one may count around the circle &quot;n&quot; times. Once the &quot;n&quot;th person is reached, one should remove them from the circle and have the members close the circle. The process is repeated until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list vs. a dynamic array, because if the people are viewed as connected nodes in a circular linked list, then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the &quot;n&quot;th person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.

The list ranking problem concerns the efficient conversion of a linked list representation into an array. Although trivial for a conventional computer, solving this problem by a parallel algorithm is complicated and has been the subject of much research.

A balanced tree has similar memory access patterns and space overhead to a linked list while permitting much more efficient indexing, taking O(log n) time instead of O(n) for a random access. However, insertion and deletion operations are more expensive due to the overhead of tree manipulations to maintain balance. Schemes exist for trees to automatically maintain themselves in a balanced state: AVL trees or red–black trees.

===Singly linked linear lists vs. other lists===
While doubly linked and circular lists have advantages over singly linked linear lists, linear lists offer some advantages that make them preferable in some situations.

A singly linked linear list is a recursive data structure, because it contains a pointer to a &quot;smaller&quot; object of the same type. For that reason, many operations on singly linked linear lists (such as merging two lists, or enumerating the elements in reverse order) often have very simple recursive algorithms, much simpler than any solution using iterative commands. While those recursive solutions can be adapted for doubly linked and circularly linked lists, the procedures generally need extra arguments and more complicated base cases.

Linear singly linked lists also allow tail-sharing, the use of a common final portion of sub-list as the terminal portion of two different lists. In particular, if a new node is added at the beginning of a list, the former list remains available as the tail of the new one—a simple example of a persistent data structure. Again, this is not true with the other variants: a node may never belong to two different circular or doubly linked lists.

In particular, end-sentinel nodes can be shared among singly linked non-circular lists. The same end-sentinel node may be used for &quot;every&quot; such list. In Lisp, for example, every proper list ends with a link to a special node, denoted by codice_1 or codice_2.

The advantages of the fancy variants are often limited to the complexity of the algorithms, not in their efficiency. A circular list, in particular, can usually be emulated by a linear list together with two variables that point to the first and last nodes, at no extra cost.

===Doubly linked vs. singly linked===
Double-linked lists require more space per node (unless one uses XOR-linking), and their elementary operations are more expensive; but they are often easier to manipulate because they allow fast and easy sequential access to the list in both directions. In a doubly linked list, one can insert or delete a node in a constant number of operations given only that node&#x27;s address. To do the same in a singly linked list, one must have the &quot;address of the pointer&quot; to that node, which is either the handle for the whole list (in case of the first node) or the link field in the &quot;previous&quot; node. Some algorithms require access in both directions. On the other hand, doubly linked lists do not allow tail-sharing and cannot be used as persistent data structures.

===Circularly linked vs. linearly linked===

A circularly linked list may be a natural option to represent arrays that are naturally circular, e.g. the corners of a polygon, a pool of buffers that are used and released in FIFO (&quot;first in, first out&quot;) order, or a set of processes that should be time-shared in round-robin order. In these applications, a pointer to any node serves as a handle to the whole list.

With a circular list, a pointer to the last node gives easy access also to the first node, by following one link. Thus, in applications that require access to both ends of the list (e.g., in the implementation of a queue), a circular structure allows one to handle the structure by a single pointer, instead of two.

A circular list can be split into two circular lists, in constant time, by giving the addresses of the last node of each piece. The operation consists in swapping the contents of the link fields of those two nodes. Applying the same operation to any two nodes in two distinct lists joins the two list into one. This property greatly simplifies some algorithms and data structures, such as the quad-edge and face-edge.

The simplest representation for an empty &quot;circular&quot; list (when such a thing makes sense) is a null pointer, indicating that the list has no nodes. Without this choice, many algorithms have to test for this special case, and handle it separately. By contrast, the use of null to denote an empty &quot;linear&quot; list is more natural and often creates fewer special cases.

For some applications, it can be useful to use singly linked lists that can vary between being circular and being linear, or even circular with a linear initial segment. Algorithms for searching or otherwise operating on these have to take precautions to avoid accidentally entering an endless loop. One well-known method is to have a second pointer walking the list at half or double the speed, and if both pointers meet at the same node, a cycle has been found.

===Using sentinel nodes===
Sentinel node may simplify certain list operations, by ensuring that the next or previous nodes exist for every element, and that even empty lists have at least one node. One may also use a sentinel node at the end of the list, with an appropriate data field, to eliminate some end-of-list tests. For example, when scanning the list looking for a node with a given value &quot;x&quot;, setting the sentinel&#x27;s data field to &quot;x&quot; makes it unnecessary to test for end-of-list inside the loop. Another example is the merging two sorted lists: if their sentinels have data fields set to +∞, the choice of the next output node does not need special handling for empty lists.

However, sentinel nodes use up extra space (especially in applications that use many short lists), and they may complicate other operations (such as the creation of a new empty list).

However, if the circular list is used merely to simulate a linear list, one may avoid some of this complexity by adding a single sentinel node to every list, between the last and the first data nodes. With this convention, an empty list consists of the sentinel node alone, pointing to itself via the next-node link. The list handle should then be a pointer to the last data node, before the sentinel, if the list is not empty; or to the sentinel itself, if the list is empty.

The same trick can be used to simplify the handling of a doubly linked linear list, by turning it into a circular doubly linked list with a single sentinel node. However, in this case, the handle should be a single pointer to the dummy node itself.

==Linked list operations==

When manipulating linked lists in-place, care must be taken to not use values that have been invalidated in previous assignments. This makes algorithms for inserting or deleting linked list nodes somewhat subtle. This section gives pseudocode for adding or removing nodes from singly, doubly, and circularly linked lists in-place. Throughout, &quot;null&quot; is used to refer to an end-of-list marker or sentinel, which may be implemented in a number of ways.

===Linearly linked lists===

====Singly linked lists====

The node data structure will have two fields. There is also a variable, &quot;firstNode&quot; which always points to the first node in the list, or is &quot;null&quot; for an empty list.

 record &quot;Node&quot;
 data; &quot;// The data being stored in the node&quot;
 &quot;Node&quot; next &quot;// A reference&quot; to the next node, null for last node

 record &quot;List&quot;
 &quot;Node&quot; firstNode &quot;// points to first node of list; null for empty list&quot;

Traversal of a singly linked list is simple, beginning at the first node and following each &quot;next&quot; link until reaching the end:

 node := list.firstNode
 while node not null
 &quot;(do something with node.data)&quot;
 node := node.next

The following code inserts a node after an existing node in a singly linked list. The diagram shows how it works. Inserting a node before an existing one cannot be done directly; instead, one must keep track of the previous node and insert a node after it.

 function insertAfter(&quot;Node&quot; node, &quot;Node&quot; newNode) &quot;// insert newNode after node&quot;
 newNode.next := node.next
 node.next := newNode

Inserting at the beginning of the list requires a separate function. This requires updating &quot;firstNode&quot;.

 function insertBeginning(&quot;List&quot; list, &quot;Node&quot; newNode) &quot;// insert node before current first node&quot;
 newNode.next := list.firstNode
 list.firstNode := newNode

Similarly, there are functions for removing the node &quot;after&quot; a given node, and for removing a node from the beginning of the list. The diagram demonstrates the former. To find and remove a particular node, one must again keep track of the previous element.

 function removeAfter(&quot;Node&quot; node) &quot;// remove node past this one&quot;
 obsoleteNode := node.next
 node.next := node.next.next
 destroy obsoleteNode

 function removeBeginning(&quot;List&quot; list) &quot;// remove first node&quot;
 obsoleteNode := list.firstNode
 list.firstNode := list.firstNode.next &quot;// point past deleted node&quot;
 destroy obsoleteNode

Notice that codice_3 sets codice_4 to codice_5 when removing the last node in the list.

Since it is not possible to iterate backwards, efficient codice_6 or codice_7 operations are not possible. Inserting to a list before a specific node requires traversing the list, which would have a worst case running time of O(n).

Appending one linked list to another can be inefficient unless a reference to the tail is kept as part of the List structure, because it is needed to traverse the entire first list in order to find the tail, and then append the second list to this. Thus, if two linearly linked lists are each of length formula_1, list appending has asymptotic time complexity of formula_2. In the Lisp family of languages, list appending is provided by the codice_8 procedure.

Many of the special cases of linked list operations can be eliminated by including a dummy element at the front of the list. This ensures that there are no special cases for the beginning of the list and renders both codice_9 and codice_3 unnecessary, i.e., every element or node is next to another node (even the first node is next to the dummy node). In this case, the first useful data in the list will be found at codice_11.

===Circularly linked list===

In a circularly linked list, all nodes are linked in a continuous circle, without using &quot;null.&quot; For lists with a front and a back (such as a queue), one stores a reference to the last node in the list. The &quot;next&quot; node after the last node is the first node. Elements can be added to the back of the list and removed from the front in constant time.

Circularly linked lists can be either singly or doubly linked.

Both types of circularly linked lists benefit from the ability to traverse the full list beginning at any given node. This often allows us to avoid storing &quot;firstNode&quot; and &quot;lastNode&quot;, although if the list may be empty, there needs to be a special representation for the empty list, such as a &quot;lastNode&quot; variable which points to some node in the list or is &quot;null&quot; if it is empty; it uses such a &quot;lastNode&quot; here. This representation significantly simplifies adding and removing nodes with a non-empty list, but empty lists are then a special case.

====Algorithms====
Assuming that &quot;someNode&quot; is some node in a non-empty circular singly linked list, this code iterates through that list starting with &quot;someNode&quot;:

 function iterate(someNode)
 if someNode ≠ null
 node := someNode
 do
 do something with node.value
 node := node.next
 while node ≠ someNode

Notice that the test &quot;while node ≠ someNode&quot; must be at the end of the loop. If the test was moved to the beginning of the loop, the procedure would fail whenever the list had only one node.

This function inserts a node &quot;newNode&quot; into a circular linked list after a given node &quot;node&quot;. If &quot;node&quot; is null, it assumes that the list is empty.

 function insertAfter(&quot;Node&quot; node, &quot;Node&quot; newNode)
 if node = null // assume list is empty
 newNode.next := newNode
 else
 newNode.next := node.next
 node.next := newNode
 update &quot;lastNode&quot; variable if necessary

Suppose that &quot;L&quot; is a variable pointing to the last node of a circular linked list (or null if the list is empty). To append &quot;newNode&quot; to the &quot;end&quot; of the list, one may do

 insertAfter(L, newNode)
 L := newNode

To insert &quot;newNode&quot; at the &quot;beginning&quot; of the list, one may do

 insertAfter(L, newNode)
 if L = null
 L := newNode
This function inserts a value &quot;newVal&quot; before a given node &quot;node&quot; in O(1) time. A new node has been created between &quot;node&quot; and the next node, then puts the value of &quot;node&quot; into that new node, and puts &quot;newVal&quot; in &quot;node&quot;. Thus, a singly linked circularly linked list with only a &quot;firstNode&quot; variable can both insert to the front and back in O(1) time.
 function insertBefore(&quot;Node&quot; node, newVal)
 if node = null // assume list is empty
 newNode := new Node(data:=newVal, next:=newNode)
 else
 newNode := new Node(data:=node.data, next:=node.next)
 node.data := newVal
 node.next := newNode
 update &quot;firstNode&quot; variable if necessary
This function removes a non-null node from a list of size greater than 1 in O(1) time. It copies data from the next node into the node, and then sets the node&#x27;s &quot;next&quot; pointer to skip over the next node.
 function remove(&quot;Node&quot; node)
 if node ≠ null and size of list &gt; 1
 removedData := node.data
 node.data := node.next.data
 node.next = node.next.next
 return removedData
=== Linked lists using arrays of nodes ===
Languages that do not support any type of reference can still create links by replacing pointers with array indices. The approach is to keep an array of records, where each record has integer fields indicating the index of the next (and possibly previous) node in the array. Not all nodes in the array need be used. If records are also not supported, parallel arrays can often be used instead.

As an example, consider the following linked list record that uses arrays instead of pointers:

 record &quot;Entry&quot; {
 &quot;integer&quot; next; &quot;// index of next entry in array&quot;
 &quot;integer&quot; prev; &quot;// previous entry (if double-linked)&quot;
 &quot;string&quot; name;
 &quot;real&quot; balance;

A linked list can be built by creating an array of these structures, and an integer variable to store the index of the first element.

 &quot;integer&quot; listHead
 &quot;Entry&quot; Records[1000]

Links between elements are formed by placing the array index of the next (or previous) cell into the Next or Prev field within a given element. For example:

In the above example, codice_12 would be set to 2, the location of the first entry in the list. Notice that entry 3 and 5 through 7 are not part of the list. These cells are available for any additions to the list. By creating a codice_13 integer variable, a free list could be created to keep track of what cells are available. If all entries are in use, the size of the array would have to be increased or some elements would have to be deleted before new entries could be stored in the list.

The following code would traverse the list and display names and account balance:
 i := listHead
 while i ≥ 0 &quot;// loop through the list&quot;
 print i, Records[i].name, Records[i].balance &quot;// print entry&quot;
 i := Records[i].next

When faced with a choice, the advantages of this approach include:
* The linked list is relocatable, meaning it can be moved about in memory at will, and it can also be quickly and directly serialized for storage on disk or transfer over a network.
* Especially for a small list, array indexes can occupy significantly less space than a full pointer on many architectures.
* Locality of reference can be improved by keeping the nodes together in memory and by periodically rearranging them, although this can also be done in a general store.
* Naïve dynamic memory allocators can produce an excessive amount of overhead storage for each node allocated; almost no allocation overhead is incurred per node in this approach.
* Seizing an entry from a pre-allocated array is faster than using dynamic memory allocation for each node, since dynamic memory allocation typically requires a search for a free memory block of the desired size.

This approach has one main disadvantage, however: it creates and manages a private memory space for its nodes. This leads to the following issues:
* It increases complexity of the implementation.
* Growing a large array when it is full may be difficult or impossible, whereas finding space for a new linked list node in a large, general memory pool may be easier.
* Adding elements to a dynamic array will occasionally (when it is full) unexpectedly take linear (O(n)) instead of constant time (although it is still an amortized constant).
* Using a general memory pool leaves more memory for other data if the list is smaller than expected or if many nodes are freed.
For these reasons, this approach is mainly used for languages that do not support dynamic memory allocation. These disadvantages are also mitigated if the maximum size of the list is known at the time the array is created.

==Language support==

Many programming languages such as Lisp and Scheme have singly linked lists built in. In many functional languages, these lists are constructed from nodes, each called a &quot;cons&quot; or &quot;cons cell&quot;. The cons has two fields: the &quot;car&quot;, a reference to the data for that node, and the &quot;cdr&quot;, a reference to the next node. Although cons cells can be used to build other data structures, this is their primary purpose.

In languages that support abstract data types or templates, linked list ADTs or templates are available for building linked lists. In other languages, linked lists are typically built using references together with records.

==Internal and external storage==

When constructing a linked list, one is faced with the choice of whether to store the data of the list directly in the linked list nodes, called &quot;internal storage&quot;, or merely to store a reference to the data, called &quot;external storage&quot;. Internal storage has the advantage of making access to the data more efficient, requiring less storage overall, having better locality of reference, and simplifying memory management for the list (its data is allocated and deallocated at the same time as the list nodes).

External storage, on the other hand, has the advantage of being more generic, in that the same data structure and machine code can be used for a linked list no matter what the size of the data is. It also makes it easy to place the same data in multiple linked lists. Although with internal storage the same data can be placed in multiple lists by including multiple &quot;next&quot; references in the node data structure, it would then be necessary to create separate routines to add or delete cells based on each field. It is possible to create additional linked lists of elements that use internal storage by using external storage, and having the cells of the additional linked lists store references to the nodes of the linked list containing the data.

In general, if a set of data structures needs to be included in linked lists, external storage is the best approach. If a set of data structures need to be included in only one linked list, then internal storage is slightly better, unless a generic linked list package using external storage is available. Likewise, if different sets of data that can be stored in the same data structure are to be included in a single linked list, then internal storage would be fine.

Another approach that can be used with some languages involves having different data structures, but all have the initial fields, including the &quot;next&quot; (and &quot;prev&quot; if double linked list) references in the same location. After defining separate structures for each type of data, a generic structure can be defined that contains the minimum amount of data shared by all the other structures and contained at the top (beginning) of the structures. Then generic routines can be created that use the minimal structure to perform linked list type operations, but separate routines can then handle the specific data. This approach is often used in message parsing routines, where several types of messages are received, but all start with the same set of fields, usually including a field for message type. The generic routines are used to add new messages to a queue when they are received, and remove them from the queue in order to process the message. The message type field is then used to call the correct routine to process the specific type of message.

===Example of internal and external storage===

To create a linked list of families and their members, using internal storage, the structure might look like the following:

 record &quot;member&quot; { &quot;// member of a family&quot;
 &quot;member&quot; next;
 &quot;string&quot; firstName;
 &quot;integer&quot; age;
 record &quot;family&quot; { &quot;// the family itself&quot;
 &quot;family&quot; next;
 &quot;string&quot; lastName;
 &quot;string&quot; address;
 &quot;member&quot; members &quot;// head of list of members of this family&quot;

To print a complete list of families and their members using internal storage, write:

 aFamily := Families &quot;// start at head of families list&quot;
 while aFamily ≠ null &quot;// loop through list of families&quot;
 print information about family
 aMember := aFamily.members &quot;// get head of list of this family&#x27;s members&quot;
 while aMember ≠ null &quot;// loop through list of members&quot;
 print information about member
 aMember := aMember.next
 aFamily := aFamily.next

Using external storage, the following structures can be created:

 record &quot;node&quot; { &quot;// generic link structure&quot;
 &quot;node&quot; next;
 &quot;pointer&quot; data &quot;// generic pointer for data at node&quot;
 record &quot;member&quot; { &quot;// structure for family member&quot;
 &quot;string&quot; firstName;
 &quot;integer&quot; age
 record &quot;family&quot; { &quot;// structure for family&quot;
 &quot;string&quot; lastName;
 &quot;string&quot; address;
 &quot;node&quot; members &quot;// head of list of members of this family&quot;

To print a complete list of families and their members using external storage, write:

 famNode := Families &quot;// start at head of families list&quot;
 while famNode ≠ null &quot;// loop through list of families&quot;
 aFamily := (family) famNode.data &quot;// extract family from node&quot;
 print information about family
 memNode := aFamily.members &quot;// get list of family members&quot;
 while memNode ≠ null &quot;// loop through list of members&quot;
 aMember := (member)memNode.data &quot;// extract member from node&quot;
 print information about member
 memNode := memNode.next
 famNode := famNode.next

Notice that when using external storage, an extra step is needed to extract the record from the node and cast it into the proper data type. This is because both the list of families and the list of members within the family are stored in two linked lists using the same data structure (&quot;node&quot;), and this language does not have parametric types.

As long as the number of families that a member can belong to is known at compile time, internal storage works fine. If, however, a member needed to be included in an arbitrary number of families, with the specific number known only at run time, external storage would be necessary.

===Speeding up search===
Finding a specific element in a linked list, even if it is sorted, normally requires O(&quot;n&quot;) time (linear search). This is one of the primary disadvantages of linked lists over other data structures. In addition to the variants discussed above, below are two simple ways to improve search time.

In an unordered list, one simple heuristic for decreasing average search time is the &quot;move-to-front heuristic&quot;, which simply moves an element to the beginning of the list once it is found. This scheme, handy for creating simple caches, ensures that the most recently used items are also the quickest to find again.

Another common approach is to &quot;index&quot; a linked list using a more efficient external data structure. For example, one can build a red–black tree or hash table whose elements are references to the linked list nodes. Multiple such indexes can be built on a single list. The disadvantage is that these indexes may need to be updated each time a node is added or removed (or at least, before that index is used again).

===Random-access lists===
A random-access list is a list with support for fast random access to read or modify any element in the list. One possible implementation is a skew binary random-access list using the skew binary number system, which involves a list of trees with special properties; this allows worst-case constant time head/cons operations, and worst-case logarithmic time random access to an element by index. Random-access lists can be implemented as persistent data structures.

Random-access lists can be viewed as immutable linked lists in that they likewise support the same O(1) head and tail operations.

A simple extension to random-access lists is the min-list, which provides an additional operation that yields the minimum element in the entire list in constant time (without mutation complexities).

==Related data structures==
Both stacks and queues are often implemented using linked lists, and simply restrict the type of operations which are supported.

The skip list is a linked list augmented with layers of pointers for quickly jumping over large numbers of elements, and then descending to the next layer. This process continues down to the bottom layer, which is the actual list.

A binary tree can be seen as a type of linked list where the elements are themselves linked lists of the same nature. The result is that each node may include a reference to the first node of one or two other linked lists, which, together with their contents, form the subtrees below that node.

An unrolled linked list is a linked list in which each node contains an array of data values. This leads to improved cache performance, since more list elements are contiguous in memory, and reduced memory overhead, because less metadata needs to be stored for each element of the list.

A hash table may use linked lists to store the chains of items that hash to the same position in the hash table.

A heap shares some of the ordering properties of a linked list, but is almost always implemented using an array. Instead of references from node to node, the next and previous data indexes are calculated using the current data&#x27;s index.

A self-organizing list rearranges its nodes based on some heuristic which reduces search times for data retrieval by keeping commonly accessed nodes at the head of the list.

<text>A logic gate is a device that performs a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has, for instance, zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device (see ideal and real op-amps for comparison).

The primary way of building logic gates uses diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches. Today, most logic gates are made from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors). They can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays with relay logic, fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, acoustics, or even mechanical or thermal elements.

Logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic. Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million logic gates.

Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert (OAI) are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.

== History and development ==
The binary number system was refined by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (published in 1705), influenced by the ancient &quot;I Ching&quot;″s binary system. Leibniz established that using the binary system combined the principles of arithmetic and logic.

The analytical engine devised by Charles Babbage in 1837 used mechanical logic gates based on gears.

In an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. Early electro-mechanical computers were constructed from switches and relay logic rather than the later innovations of vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) or transistors (from which later electronic computers were constructed). Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced a version of the 16-row truth table as proposition 5.101 of &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; (1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, got part of the 1954 Nobel Prize in physics, for the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924. Konrad Zuse designed and built electromechanical logic gates for his computer Z1 (from 1935 to 1938).

From 1934 to 1936, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima, Claude Shannon and Victor Shestakov introduced switching circuit theory in a series of papers showing that two-valued Boolean algebra, which they discovered independently, can describe the operation of switching circuits. Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all electronic digital computers. Switching circuit theory became the foundation of digital circuit design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after World War II, with theoretical rigor superseding the &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods that had prevailed previously.

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Their concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. In 1957 Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture PMOS and NMOS planar gates. Later a team at Bell Labs demonstrated a working MOS with PMOS and NMOS gates. Both types were later combined and adapted into complementary MOS (CMOS) logic by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963.

== Symbols ==

There are two sets of symbols for elementary logic gates in common use, both defined in ANSI/IEEE Std 91-1984 and its supplement ANSI/IEEE Std 91a-1991. The &quot;distinctive shape&quot; set, based on traditional schematics, is used for simple drawings and derives from United States Military Standard MIL-STD-806 of the 1950s and 1960s. It is sometimes unofficially described as &quot;military&quot;, reflecting its origin. The &quot;rectangular shape&quot; set, based on ANSI Y32.14 and other early industry standards as later refined by IEEE and IEC, has rectangular outlines for all types of gate and allows representation of a much wider range of devices than is possible with the traditional symbols. The IEC standard, IEC 60617-12, has been adopted by other standards, such as EN 60617-12:1999 in Europe, BS EN 60617-12:1999 in the United Kingdom, and DIN EN 60617-12:1998 in Germany.

The mutual goal of IEEE Std 91-1984 and IEC 617-12 was to provide a uniform method of describing the complex logic functions of digital circuits with schematic symbols. These functions were more complex than simple AND and OR gates. They could be medium-scale circuits such as a 4-bit counter to a large-scale circuit such as a microprocessor.

IEC 617-12 and its renumbered successor IEC 60617-12 do not explicitly show the &quot;distinctive shape&quot; symbols, but do not prohibit them. These are, however, shown in ANSI/IEEE Std 91 (and 91a) with this note: &quot;The distinctive-shape symbol is, according to IEC Publication 617, Part 12, not preferred, but is not considered to be in contradiction to that standard.&quot; IEC 60617-12 correspondingly contains the note (Section 2.1) &quot;Although non-preferred, the use of other symbols recognized by official national standards, that is distinctive shapes in place of symbols [list of basic gates], shall not be considered to be in contradiction with this standard. Usage of these other symbols in combination to form complex symbols (for example, use as embedded symbols) is discouraged.&quot; This compromise was reached between the respective IEEE and IEC working groups to permit the IEEE and IEC standards to be in mutual compliance with one another.

In the 1980s, schematics were the predominant method to design both circuit boards and custom ICs known as gate arrays. Today custom ICs and the field-programmable gate array are typically designed with Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL.

== De Morgan equivalent symbols ==
By use of De Morgan&#x27;s laws, an &quot;AND&quot; function is identical to an &quot;OR&quot; function with negated inputs and outputs. Likewise, an &quot;OR&quot; function is identical to an &quot;AND&quot; function with negated inputs and outputs. A NAND gate is equivalent to an OR gate with negated inputs, and a NOR gate is equivalent to an AND gate with negated inputs.

This leads to an alternative set of symbols for basic gates that use the opposite core symbol (&quot;AND&quot; or &quot;OR&quot;) but with the inputs and outputs negated. Use of these alternative symbols can make logic circuit diagrams much clearer and help to show accidental connection of an active high output to an active low input or vice versa. Any connection that has logic negations at both ends can be replaced by a negationless connection and a suitable change of gate or vice versa. Any connection that has a negation at one end and no negation at the other can be made easier to interpret by instead using the De Morgan equivalent symbol at either of the two ends. When negation or polarity indicators on both ends of a connection match, there is no logic negation in that path (effectively, bubbles &quot;cancel&quot;), making it easier to follow logic states from one symbol to the next. This is commonly seen in real logic diagrams – thus the reader must not get into the habit of associating the shapes exclusively as OR or AND shapes, but also take into account the bubbles at both inputs and outputs in order to determine the &quot;true&quot; logic function indicated.

A De Morgan symbol can show more clearly a gate&#x27;s primary logical purpose and the polarity of its nodes that are considered in the &quot;signaled&quot; (active, on) state. Consider the simplified case where a two-input NAND gate is used to drive a motor when either of its inputs are brought low by a switch. The &quot;signaled&quot; state (motor on) occurs when either one OR the other switch is on. Unlike a regular NAND symbol, which suggests AND logic, the De Morgan version, a two negative-input OR gate, correctly shows that OR is of interest. The regular NAND symbol has a bubble at the output and none at the inputs (the opposite of the states that will turn the motor on), but the De Morgan symbol shows both inputs and output in the polarity that will drive the motor.

De Morgan&#x27;s theorem is most commonly used to implement logic gates as combinations of only NAND gates, or as combinations of only NOR gates, for economic reasons.

== Truth tables ==
Output comparison of various logic gates:

== Universal logic gates ==

Charles Sanders Peirce (during 1880–1881) showed that NOR gates alone (or alternatively NAND gates alone) can be used to reproduce the functions of all the other logic gates, but his work on it was unpublished until 1933. The first published proof was by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913, so the NAND logical operation is sometimes called &quot;Sheffer stroke&quot;; the logical NOR is sometimes called &quot;Peirce&#x27;s arrow&quot;. Consequently, these gates are sometimes called &quot;universal logic gates&quot;.

== Data storage and sequential logic ==

Logic gates can also be used to hold a state, allowing data storage. A storage element can be constructed by connecting several gates in a &quot;latch&quot; circuit. Latching circuitry is used in static random-access memory. More complicated designs that use clock signals and that change only on a rising or falling edge of the clock are called edge-triggered &quot;flip-flops&quot;. Formally, a flip-flop is called a bistable circuit, because it has two stable states which it can maintain indefinitely. The combination of multiple flip-flops in parallel, to store a multiple-bit value, is known as a register. When using any of these gate setups the overall system has memory; it is then called a sequential logic system since its output can be influenced by its previous state(s), i.e. by the &quot;sequence&quot; of input states. In contrast, the output from combinational logic is purely a combination of its present inputs, unaffected by the previous input and output states.

These logic circuits are used in computer memory. They vary in performance, based on factors of speed, complexity, and reliability of storage, and many different types of designs are used based on the application.

== Manufacturing ==
=== Electronic gates ===
A functionally complete logic system may be composed of relays, valves (vacuum tubes), or transistors.

Electronic logic gates differ significantly from their relay-and-switch equivalents. They are much faster, consume much less power, and are much smaller (all by a factor of a million or more in most cases). Also, there is a fundamental structural difference. The switch circuit creates a continuous metallic path for current to flow (in either direction) between its input and its output. The semiconductor logic gate, on the other hand, acts as a high-gain voltage amplifier, which sinks a tiny current at its input and produces a low-impedance voltage at its output. It is not possible for current to flow between the output and the input of a semiconductor logic gate.
For small-scale logic, designers now use prefabricated logic gates from families of devices such as the TTL 7400 series by Texas Instruments, the CMOS 4000 series by RCA, and their more recent descendants. Increasingly, these fixed-function logic gates are being replaced by programmable logic devices, which allow designers to pack many mixed logic gates into a single integrated circuit. The field-programmable nature of programmable logic devices such as FPGAs has reduced the &#x27;hard&#x27; property of hardware; it is now possible to change the logic design of a hardware system by reprogramming some of its components, thus allowing the features or function of a hardware implementation of a logic system to be changed.

An important advantage of standardized integrated circuit logic families, such as the 7400 and 4000 families, is that they can be cascaded. This means that the output of one gate can be wired to the inputs of one or several other gates, and so on. Systems with varying degrees of complexity can be built without great concern of the designer for the internal workings of the gates, provided the limitations of each integrated circuit are considered.

The output of one gate can only drive a finite number of inputs to other gates, a number called the &#x27;fan-out limit&#x27;. Also, there is always a delay, called the &#x27;propagation delay&#x27;, from a change in input of a gate to the corresponding change in its output. When gates are cascaded, the total propagation delay is approximately the sum of the individual delays, an effect which can become a problem in high-speed synchronous circuits. Additional delay can be caused when many inputs are connected to an output, due to the distributed capacitance of all the inputs and wiring and the finite amount of current that each output can provide.

==== Logic families ====

There are several logic families with different characteristics (power consumption, speed, cost, size) such as: RDL (resistor–diode logic), RTL (resistor-transistor logic), DTL (diode–transistor logic), TTL (transistor–transistor logic) and CMOS. There are also sub-variants, e.g. standard CMOS logic vs. advanced types using still CMOS technology, but with some optimizations for avoiding loss of speed due to slower PMOS transistors.

The simplest family of logic gates uses bipolar transistors, and is called resistor–transistor logic (RTL). Unlike simple diode logic gates (which do not have a gain element), RTL gates can be cascaded indefinitely to produce more complex logic functions. RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode–transistor logic (DTL). Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL.
As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic. CMOS uses complementary (both n-channel and p-channel) MOSFET devices to achieve a high speed with low power dissipation.

Other types of logic gates include, but are not limited to:

==== Three-state logic gates ====

A three-state logic gate is a type of logic gate that can have three different outputs: high (H), low (L) and high-impedance (Z). The high-impedance state plays no role in the logic, which is strictly binary. These devices are used on buses of the CPU to allow multiple chips to send data. A group of three-states driving a line with a suitable control circuit is basically equivalent to a multiplexer, which may be physically distributed over separate devices or plug-in cards.

In electronics, a high output would mean the output is sourcing current from the positive power terminal (positive voltage). A low output would mean the output is sinking current to the negative power terminal (zero voltage). High impedance would mean that the output is effectively disconnected from the circuit.

=== Non-electronic logic gates ===
Non-electronic implementations are varied, though few of them are used in practical applications. Many early electromechanical digital computers, such as the Harvard Mark I, were built from relay logic gates, using electro-mechanical relays. Logic gates can be made using pneumatic devices, such as the Sorteberg relay or mechanical logic gates, including on a molecular scale. Various types of fundamental logic gates have been constructed using molecules (molecular logic gates), which are based on chemical inputs and spectroscopic outputs. Logic gates have been made out of DNA (see DNA nanotechnology) and used to create a computer called MAYA (see MAYA-II). Logic gates can be made from quantum mechanical effects, see quantum logic gate. Photonic logic gates use nonlinear optical effects.

In principle any method that leads to a gate that is functionally complete (for example, either a NOR or a NAND gate) can be used to make any kind of digital logic circuit. Note that the use of 3-state logic for bus systems is not needed, and can be replaced by digital multiplexers, which can be built using only simple logic gates (such as NAND gates, NOR gates, or AND and OR gates).

<doc id="18171" wikidata="Q787903" url="?curid=18171" title="Linear search">
<text>In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

A linear search runs in linear time in the worst case, and makes at most comparisons, where is the length of the list. If each element is equally likely to be searched, then linear search has an average case of comparisons, but the average case can be affected if the search probabilities for each element vary. Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.

==Algorithm==
A linear search sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds an element that matches the target value. If the algorithm reaches the end of the list, the search terminates unsuccessfully.

===Basic algorithm===
Given a list of elements with values or records , and target value , the following subroutine uses linear search to find the index of the target in .

# Set to 0.
# If , the search terminates successfully; return .
# Increase by 1.
# If , go to step 2. Otherwise, the search terminates unsuccessfully.

===With a sentinel===
The basic algorithm above makes two comparisons per iteration: one to check if equals &quot;T&quot;, and the other to check if still points to a valid index of the list. By adding an extra record to the list (a sentinel value) that equals the target, the second comparison can be eliminated until the end of the search, making the algorithm faster. The search will reach the sentinel if the target is not contained within the list.

# Set to 0.
# If , go to step 4.
# Increase by 1 and go to step 2.
# If , the search terminates successfully; return . Else, the search terminates unsuccessfully.

===In an ordered table===
If the list is ordered such that , the search can establish the absence of the target more quickly by concluding the search once exceeds the target. This variation requires a sentinel that is greater than the target.

# Set to 0.
# If , go to step 4.
# Increase by 1 and go to step 2.
# If , the search terminates successfully; return . Else, the search terminates unsuccessfully.

==Analysis==
For a list with &quot;n&quot; items, the best case is when the value is equal to the first element of the list, in which case only one comparison is needed. The worst case is when the value is not in the list (or occurs only once at the end of the list), in which case &quot;n&quot; comparisons are needed.

If the value being sought occurs &quot;k&quot; times in the list, and all orderings of the list are equally likely, the expected number of comparisons is

:formula_1

For example, if the value being sought occurs once in the list, and all orderings of the list are equally likely, the expected number of comparisons is formula_2. However, if it is &quot;known&quot; that it occurs once, then at most &quot;n&quot; - 1 comparisons are needed, and the expected number of comparisons is 
:formula_3

(for example, for &quot;n&quot; = 2 this is 1, corresponding to a single if-then-else construct).

Either way, asymptotically the worst-case cost and the expected cost of linear search are both O(&quot;n&quot;).

===Non-uniform probabilities===
The performance of linear search improves if the desired value is more likely to be near the beginning of the list than to its end. Therefore, if some values are much more likely to be searched than others, it is desirable to place them at the beginning of the list.

In particular, when the list items are arranged in order of decreasing probability, and these probabilities are geometrically distributed, the cost of linear search is only O(1). 

==Application==
Linear search is usually very simple to implement, and is practical when the list has only a few elements, or when performing a single search in an un-ordered list.

When many values have to be searched in the same list, it often pays to pre-process the list in order to use a faster method. For example, one may sort the list and use binary search, or build an efficient search data structure from it. Should the content of the list change frequently, repeated re-organization may be more trouble than it is worth.

As a result, even though in theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. On larger arrays, it only makes sense to use other, faster search methods if the data is large enough, because the initial time to prepare (sort) the data is comparable to many linear searches.

<doc id="18172" wikidata="Q178795" url="?curid=18172" title="Land mine">
<text>A land mine, or landmine, is an explosive weapon often concealed under or camouflaged on the ground, and designed to destroy or disable enemy targets as they pass over or near it. Land mines are divided into two types: anti-tank mines, which are designed to disable tanks or other vehicles; and anti-personnel mines, designed to injure or kill people.

Land mines are typically pressure activated, exploding automatically when stepped on by a person or driven over by a vehicle, though alternative detonation mechanisms are sometimes used. A land mine may cause damage by direct blast effect, by fragments that are thrown by the blast, or by both. Land mines are typically laid throughout an area, creating a &quot;minefield&quot; which is dangerous to cross.

The use of land mines is controversial because of their indiscriminate nature and their potential to remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended, harming civilians and the economy. With pressure from a number of campaign groups organised through the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a global movement to prohibit their use led to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, also known as the &quot;Ottawa Treaty&quot;. To date, 164 nations have signed the treaty. However, China, the Russian Federation and the United States are not signatories.

==Definition==
The Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (also known as the Ottawa Treaty) and the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices define a mine as a &quot;munition designed to be placed under, on or near the ground or other surface area and to be exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person or vehicle&quot;. Similar in function is the &quot;booby-trap&quot;, which the protocol defines as &quot;any device or material which is designed, constructed or adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act&quot;. Such actions might include opening a door or picking up an object. Normally, mines are mass-produced and placed in groups, while booby traps are improvised and deployed one at a time. Booby traps can also be non-explosive devices such as punji sticks. Overlapping both categories is the &quot;improvised explosive device&quot; (IED), which is &quot;a device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating explosive material, destructive, lethal, noxious, incendiary, pyrotechnic materials or chemicals designed to destroy, disfigure, distract or harass. They may incorporate military stores, but are normally devised from non-military components.&quot; Some meet the definition of mines or booby traps and are also referred to as &quot;improvised&quot;, &quot;artisanal&quot; or &quot;locally manufactured&quot; mines. Other types of IED are remotely activated, so are not considered mines.

&quot;Remotely delivered mines&quot; are dropped from aircraft or carried by devices such as artillery shells or rockets. Another type of remotely delivered explosive is the cluster munition, a device that releases several submunitions (&quot;bomblets&quot;) over a large area. The use, transfer, production, and stockpiling of cluster munitions is prohibited by the international CCM treaty. If bomblets do not explode, they are referred to as &quot;unexploded ordnance&quot; (UXO), along with unexploded artillery shells and other explosive devices that were not manually placed (that is, mines and booby traps are not UXOs). &quot;Explosive remnants of war&quot; (ERW) include UXOs and &quot;abandoned explosive ordnance&quot; (AXO), devices that were never used and were left behind after a conflict.

==History==
The history of land mines can be divided into three main phases: In the ancient world, buried spikes provided many of the same functions as modern mines. Mines using gunpowder as the explosive were used from the Ming dynasty to the American Civil War. Subsequently, high explosives were developed for use in land mines.

===Before explosives===

Some fortifications in the Roman Empire were surrounded by a series of hazards buried in the ground. These included &quot;goads&quot;, pieces of wood with iron hooks on their ends; &quot;lilia&quot; (lilies, so named after their appearance), which were pits in which sharpened logs were arranged in a five-point pattern; and &quot;abatis&quot;, fallen trees with sharpened branches facing outwards. As with modern land mines, they were &quot;victim-operated&quot;, often concealed, and complicated attempts by the enemy to remove the obstacles by making them vulnerable to projectiles such as spears. A notable use of these defenses was by Julius Caesar in the Battle of Alesia. His forces were besieging Vercingetorix, the leader of the Gauls, but Vercingetorix managed to send for reinforcements. To maintain the siege and defend against the reinforcements, Caesar formed a line of fortifications on both sides, and they played an important role in his victory. Lilies were also used by Scots against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, and by Germans at the Battle of Passchendaele in the First World War.

A more easily deployed defense used by the Romans was the caltrop, a weapon 12–15 cm across with four sharp spikes that are oriented so that when it is thrown on the ground, one spike always points up. As with modern antipersonnel mines, caltrops are designed to disable soldiers rather than kill them; they are also more effective in stopping mounted forces, who lack the advantage of being able to carefully scrutinize each step they take (though forcing foot-mounted forces to take the time to do so has benefits in and of itself). They were used by the Jin dynasty in China at the Battle of Zhongdu to slow down the advance of Genghis Khan&#x27;s army; Joan of Arc was wounded by one in the Siege of Orléans; in Japan they are known as &quot;tetsu-bishu&quot; and were used by ninjas from the fourteenth century onward. Caltrops are still strung together and used as roadblocks in some modern conflicts.

===Gunpowder===
====East Asia====

Gunpowder, an explosive mixture of sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate was invented in China by the 10th century and was used in warfare soon after. An &quot;enormous bomb&quot;, credited to Lou Qianxia, was used in 1277 by the Chinese at the Battle of Zhongdu.

A 14th-century military treatise, the &quot;Huolongjing&quot; (&quot;Fire Dragon Manual&quot;), describes hollow cast iron cannonball shells filled with gunpowder. The wad of the mine was made of hard wood, carrying three different fuses in case of defective connection to the touch hole. These fuses were long and lit by hand, so they required carefully timed calculations of enemy movements.

The &quot;Huolongjing&quot; also describes land mines that were set off by enemy movement. A length of bamboo was waterproofed by wrapping it in cowhide and covering it with oil. It was filled with compressed gunpowder and lead or iron pellets, sealed with wax and concealed in a trench. The triggering mechanism was not fully described until the early 17th century. When the enemy stepped onto hidden boards, they dislodged a pin, causing a weight to fall. A cord attached to the weight was wrapped around a drum attached to two steel wheels; when the weight fell, the wheels struck sparks against flint, igniting a set of fuses leading to multiple mines. A similar mechanism was used in the first wheellock musket in Europe as sketched by Leonardo da Vinci around 1500 AD.

Another victim-operated device was the &quot;underground sky-soaring thunder&quot;, which lured bounty hunters with halberds, pikes, and lances planted in the ground. If they pulled on one of these weapons, the butt end disturbed a bowl underneath and a slow-burning incandescent material in the bowl ignited the fuses.

====Western world====
At Augsburg in 1573, three centuries after the Chinese invented the first pressure-operated mine, a German military engineer by the name of Samuel Zimmermann invented the &quot;Fladdermine&quot; (flying mine). It consisted of a few pounds of black powder buried near the surface and was activated by stepping on it or tripping a wire that made a flintlock fire. Such mines were deployed on the slope in front of a fort. They were used during the Franco-Prussian War, but were probably not very effective because a flintlock does not work for long when left untended.

The fougasse, was a precursor of modern fragmentation mines and the claymore mine. It consisted of a cone-shape hole with gunpowder at the bottom, covered either by rocks and scrap iron (&quot;stone fougasse&quot;) or mortar shells, similar to large black powder hand grenades (&quot;shell fougasse&quot;). It was triggered by a flintlock connected to a tripwire on the surface. It could sometimes cause heavy casualties but required high maintenance due to the susceptibility of black powder to dampness. Consequently, it was mainly employed in the defenses of major fortifications, in which role it used in several European wars of the eighteenth century and the American Revolution.

Early land mines suffered from unreliable fuses which were vulnerable to damp. This changed with the invention of the safety fuse. Later, &quot;command initiation&quot;, the ability to detonate a charge immediately instead of waiting several minutes for a fuse to burn, became possible after electricity was developed. An electric current sent down a wire could ignite the charge with a spark. The Russians claim first use of this technology in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829, and with it the fougasse remained useful until it was superseded by the Claymore mine in the 1960s.

Victim-activated mines were also unreliable because they relied on a flintlock to ignite the explosive. The percussion cap, developed in the early 19th century, made them much more reliable, and pressure-operated mines were deployed on land and sea in the Crimean War (1853–1856).

During the American Civil War, the Confederate brigadier general Gabriel J. Rains deployed thousands of &quot;torpedoes&quot; consisting of artillery shells with pressure caps, beginning with the Battle of Yorktown in 1862. As a captain, Rains had earlier employed explosive booby traps during the Seminole Wars in Florida in 1840. Over the course of the war, mines only caused a few hundred casualties, but they had a large effect on morale and slowed down the advance of Union troops. Many on both sides considered the use of mines barbaric, and in response, generals in the Union Army forced Confederate prisoners to remove the mines.

=== High explosives ===
Starting in the 19th century, more powerful explosives than gunpowder were developed, often for non-military reasons such as blasting train tunnels in the Alps and Rockies. Guncotton, up to four times more powerful than gunpowder, was invented by Christian Schonbein in 1846. It was dangerous to make until Frederick Augustus Abel developed a safe method in 1865. From the 1870s to the First World War, it was the standard explosive used by the British military.

In 1847, Ascanio Sobrero invented nitroglycerine to treat angina pectoris and it turned out to be a much more powerful explosive than guncotton. It was very dangerous to use until Alfred Nobel formulated a solid mixture he called dynamite and paired it with a safe detonator he developed. Even then, dynamite needed to be stored carefully or it could form crystals that detonated easily. Thus, the military still preferred guncotton.

In 1863, the German chemical industry developed trinitrotoluene (TNT). This had the advantage that it was difficult to detonate, so it could withstand the shock of firing by artillery pieces. It was also advantageous for land mines for several reasons: it was not detonated by the shock of shells landing nearby; it was lightweight, unaffected by damp, and stable under a wide range of conditions; it could be melted to fill a container of any shape, and it was cheap to make. Thus, it became the standard explosive in mines after the First World War.

==== Between the American Civil War and the First World War ====
The British used mines in the Siege of Khartoum. A Sudanese Mahdist force much larger than British strength was held off for ten months, but the town was ultimately taken and the British massacred. In the Boer War (1899–1903), they succeeded in holding Mafeking against Boer forces with the help of a mixture of real and fake minefields; and they laid mines alongside railroad tracks to discourage sabotage.

In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, both sides used land and sea mines, although the effect on land mainly affected morale. The naval mines were far more effective, destroying several battleships.

==== First World War ====

One sign of the increasing power of explosives used in land mines was that, by the First World War, they burst into about 1,000 high-velocity fragments; in the Franco-Prussian War (1870), it had only been 20 to 30 fragments. Nevertheless, anti-personnel mines were not a big factor in the war because machine guns, barbed wire and rapid-fire artillery were far more effective defenses. An exception was in Africa (now Tanzania and Namibia) where the warfare was much more mobile.

Towards the end of the war, the British started to use tanks to break through trench defenses. The Germans responded with anti-tank guns and mines. Improvised mines gave way to mass-produced mines consisting of wooden boxes filled with guncotton, and minefields were standardized to stop masses of tanks from advancing.

Between world wars, the future Allies did little work on land mines, but the Germans developed a series of anti-tank mines, the &quot;Tellermines&quot; (plate mines). They also developed the &quot;Schrapnell mine&quot; (also known as the S-mine), the first bounding mine. When triggered, this jumped up to about waist height and exploded, sending thousands of steel balls in all directions. Triggered by pressure, trip wires or electronics, it could harm soldiers within an area of about 2,800 square feet.

==== Second World War ====

Tens of millions of mines were laid in the Second World War, particularly in the deserts of North Africa and the steppes of Eastern Europe, where the open ground favored tanks. However, the first country to use them was Finland. They were defending against a much larger Soviet force with over 6,000 tanks, twenty times the number the Finns had; but they had terrain that was broken up by lakes and forests, so tank movement was restricted to roads and tracks. Their defensive line, the Mannerheim Line, integrated these natural defenses with mines, including simple fragmentation mines mounted on stakes.

While the Germans were advancing rapidly using &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics, they did not make much use of mines. After 1942, however, they were on the defensive and became the most inventive and systematic users of mines. Their production shot up and they began inventing new types of mines as the Allies found ways to counter the existing ones. To make it more difficult to remove antitank mines, they surrounded them with S-mines and added anti-handling devices that would explode when soldiers tried to lift them. They also took a formal approach to laying mines and they kept detailed records of the locations of mines.

In the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942, the Germans prepared for an Allied attack by laying about half a million mines in two fields running across the entire battlefield and five miles deep. Nicknamed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s gardens&quot;, they were covered by 88 mm anti-tank guns and small-arms fire. The Allies prevailed, but at the cost of over half their tanks; 20 percent of the losses were caused by mines.

The Soviets learned the value of mines from their war with Finland, and when Germany invaded they made heavy use of them, manufacturing over 67 million. At the Battle of Kursk, which put an end to the German advance, they laid over a million mines in eight belts with an overall depth of 35 kilometres.

Mines forced tanks to slow down and wait for soldiers to go ahead and remove the mines. The main method of breaching minefields involved prodding the dirt with a bayonet or stick at an angle of 30 degrees to avoid pressuring the top of the mine. Since all mines at the beginning of the war had metal casings, metal detectors could be used to speed up the locating of mines. A Polish officer, Józef Kosacki, developed a portable mine detector known as the Polish mine detector. To counter the detector, Germans developed mines with wooden casings, the Schü-mine 42 (anti-personnel) and Holzmine 42 (anti-tank). Effective, cheap and easy to make, the Schü-mine became the most common mine in the war. Mine casings were also made of glass, concrete and clay. The Russians developed a mine with a pressed-cardboard casing, the PMK40, and the Italians made an anti-tank mine out of bakelite. In 1944, the Germans created the Topfmine, an entirely non-metallic mine. They ensured that they could detect their own mines by covering them with radioactive sand; the Allies did not find this out until after the war.

Several mechanical methods for clearing mines were tried. Heavy rollers were attached to tanks or cargo trucks, but they did not last long and their weight made the tanks considerably slower. Tanks and bulldozers pushed ploughs that pushed aside any mines to a depth of 30 cm. The Bangalore torpedo, a long thin tube filled with explosives, was invented in 1912 and used to clear barbed wire; larger versions such as the Snake and the Conger were developed for clearing mines, but were not very effective. One of the best options was the flail, which had weights attached by chains to rotating drums. The first version, the Scorpion, was attached to the Matilda tank and used in the Second Battle of El Alamein. The Crab, attached to the Sherman tank, was faster, at 2 kilometers per hour; it was used during D-Day and the aftermath.

==== Cold War ====

During the Cold War, the members of NATO were concerned about massive armored attacks by the Soviet Union. They planned for a minefield stretching across the entire West German border, and developed new types of mines. The British designed an anti-tank mine, the Mark 7, to defeat rollers by detonating the second time it was pressed. It also had a 0.7-second delay so the tank would be directly over the mine. They also developed the first scatterable mine, the No. 7 Dingbat. The Americans used the M6 anti-tank mine and tripwire-operated bounding anti-personnel mines such as the M2 and M16.

In the Korean War, land mine use was dictated by the steep terrain, narrow valleys, forest cover and lack of developed roads. This made tanks less effective and more easily stopped by mines. However, mines laid near roads were often easy to spot. In response to this problem, the U.S. developed the M24, a mine that was placed off to the side of the road. When triggered by a tripwire, it fired a rocket. However, the mine was not available until after the war.

The Chinese had a lot of success with massed infantry attacks. The extensive forest cover limited the range of machine guns, but anti-personnel mines were effective. However, mines were poorly recorded and marked, often becoming as much a hazard to allies as enemies. Tripwire-operated mines were not defended by pressure mines; the Chinese were often able to disable them and reuse them against U.N. forces.

Looking for more destructive mines, the Americans developed the Claymore, a directional fragmentation mine that hurls steel balls in a 60-degree arc at a speed of 1,200m/s. They also developed a pressure-operated mine, the M14 &quot;toe-popper&quot;. These, too, were ready too late for the Korean War.
In 1948, the British developed the No. 6 anti-personnel mine, a minimum-metal mine with a narrow diameter, making it difficult to detect with metal detectors or prodding. Its three-pronged pressure piece inspired the nickname &quot;carrot mine&quot;. However, it was unreliable in wet conditions. In the 1960s the Canadians developed a similar, but more reliable mine, the C3A1 &quot;Elsie&quot; and the British army adopted it. The British also developed the L9 bar mine, a wide anti-tank mine with a rectangular shape, which covered more area, allowing a minefield to be laid four times as fast as previous mines. They also upgraded the Dingbat to the Ranger, a plastic mine that was fired from a truck-mounted discharger that could fire 72 mines at a time.

In the 1950s, the US Operation Doan Brook studied the feasibility of delivering mines by air. This led to three types of air-delivered mine. &quot;Wide Area Anti-Personnel Mines&quot; (WAAPMs) were small steel spheres that discharged tripwires when they hit the ground; each dispenser held 540 mines. The BLU-43 Dragontooth was small and had a flattened &quot;W&quot; shape to slow its descent, while the gravel mine was larger. Both were packed by the thousand into bombs. All three were designed to inactivate after a period of time, but any that failed to activate presented a safety challenge. Over 37 million gravel mines were produced between 1967 and 1968, and when they were dropped in places like Vietnam their locations were unmarked and unrecorded. A similar problem was presented by unexploded cluster munitions.

The next generation of scatterable mines arose in response to the increasing mobility of war. The Germans developed the Skorpion system, which scattered AT2 mines from a tracked vehicle. The Italians developed a helicopter delivery system that could rapidly switch between SB-33 anti-personnel mines and SB-81 anti-tank mines. The US developed a range of systems called the Family of Scatterable Mines (FASCAM) that could deliver mines by fast jet, artillery, helicopter and ground launcher.

==== Middle eastern conflicts ====
The Iraq-Iran War, the Gulf War, and the Islamic State have all contributed to land mine saturation in Iraq from the 1980s through 2020. In 2019, Iraq was the most saturated country in the world with land mines. Countries that provided land mines during the Iran-Iraq War included Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Italy, Romania, Singapore, the former Soviet Union and the U.S., and were concentrated in the Kurdish areas in the northern area of Iraq. During the Gulf War, the U.S. deployed 117,634 mines, with 27,967 being anti-personnel mines and 89,667 being anti-vehicle mines. The U.S. did not use land mines during the Iraq War.

Landmines and other unexploded battlefield ordnance contaminate at least 724 million square meters of land in Afghanistan. Only two of Afghanistan&#x27;s twenty-nine provinces are believed to be free of landmines. The most heavily mined provinces are Herat and Kandahar. Since 1989, nearly 44,000 Afghan civilians have been recorded to have been killed or injured by landmines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) averaging to around 110 people per month. Improvised mines and ERW from armed clashes caused nearly 99 percent of the casualties recorded in 2021.

==== Invasion of Ukraine ====
During the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, both Russian and Ukrainian forces have used land mines. Ukrainian officials claim Russian forces planted thousands of land mines or other explosive devices during their withdrawal from Ukrainian cities, including in civilian areas. Russian forces have also utilized remotely delivered anti-personnel mines such as the POM-3.

=== Chemical and nuclear ===
In the First World War, the Germans developed a device, nicknamed the &quot;Yperite Mine&quot; by the British, that they left behind in abandoned trenches and bunkers. It was detonated by a delayed charge, spreading mustard gas (&quot;Yperite&quot;). In the Second World War they developed a modern chemical mine, the Sprüh-Büchse 37 (Bounding Gas Mine 37), but never used it. The United States developed the M1 chemical mine, which used mustard gas, in 1939; and the M23 chemical mine, which used the VX nerve agent, in 1960. The Soviets developed the KhF, a &quot;bounding chemical mine&quot;. The French had chemical mines and the Iraqis were believed to have them before the invasion of Kuwait. In 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention came into force, prohibiting the use of chemical weapons and mandating their destruction. By July 2023 all declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed.

For a few decades during the Cold War, the U.S. developed atomic demolition munitions, often referred to as nuclear land mines. These were portable nuclear bombs that could be placed by hand, and could be detonated remotely or with a timer. Some of these were deployed in Europe. Governments in West Germany, Turkey and Greece wanted to have nuclear minefields as a defense against attack from the Warsaw Pact. However, such weapons were politically and tactically infeasible, and by 1989 the last of these munitions was retired. The British also had a project, codenamed Blue Peacock, to develop nuclear mines to be buried in Germany; the project was cancelled in 1958.

==Characteristics and function==

A conventional land mine consists of a casing that is mostly filled with the main charge. It has a firing mechanism such as a pressure plate; this triggers a detonator or igniter, which in turn sets off a booster charge. There may be additional firing mechanisms in anti-handling devices.

===Firing mechanisms and initiating actions===
A land mine can be triggered by a number of things including pressure, movement, sound, magnetism and vibration. Anti-personnel mines commonly use the pressure of a person&#x27;s foot as a trigger, but tripwires are also frequently employed. Because modern anti-vehicle mines usually employ magnetic triggers, they can detonate even if the victim&#x27;s tires or tracks do not directly impact it. Advanced mines are able to sense the difference between friendly and enemy types of vehicles by way of a built-in signature catalog (an identification friend or foe system). This theoretically enables friendly forces to use the mined area while denying the enemy access.

Many mines combine the main trigger with a touch or tilt trigger to prevent enemy engineers from defusing the mine. Land mine designs tend to use as little metal as possible to make searching with a metal detector more difficult; land mines made mostly of plastic have the added advantage of being very inexpensive.

Some types of modern mines are designed to self-destruct, or chemically render themselves inert after a period of weeks or months to reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties at the conflict&#x27;s end. These self-destruct mechanisms are not absolutely reliable, and most land mines laid historically are not equipped in this manner.

There is a common misconception that a landmine is armed by stepping on it and only triggered by stepping off. This is not the case for almost all types of mine. In virtually all cases the initial pressure trigger detonates the mine, since mines are designed to kill or maim the victim rather than standing still until the mine can be disarmed. This misperception originated with the fictional portrayal of mines, often in movies in which the disarming of a mine is a source of narrative tension.

===Anti-handling devices===
Anti-handling devices detonate the mine if someone attempts to lift, shift or disarm it. The intention is to hinder deminers by discouraging any attempts to clear minefields. There is a degree of overlap between the function of a boobytrap and an anti-handling device insofar as some mines have optional fuze pockets into which standard pull or pressure-release boobytrap firing devices can be screwed. Alternatively, some mines may mimic a standard design, but actually be specifically intended to kill deminers, such as the MC-3 and PMN-3 variants of the PMN mine. Anti-handling devices can be found on both anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines, either as an integral part of their design or as improvised add-ons. For this reason, the standard render safe procedure for mines is often to destroy them on site without attempting to lift them.

===Smart mines===

&quot;Smart mines&quot; utilize a number of advanced technologies developed in the late 20th and early 21st century. Most commonly, this includes mechanisms to deactivate or self-destruct the mine after a preset period of time. This is intended to reduce civilian casualties and simplify demining.

Other innovations include &quot;self-healing&quot; minefields, which detect gaps in the field and can direct the mines to rearrange their positions, eliminating the gaps.

==Anti-tank mines==
Anti-tank mines were created in response to the invention of the tank in the First World War. Though improvised at first, purpose-built designs were soon developed. Set off when a tank passes, they attack the tank at one of its weaker areas – the tracks. They are designed to immobilize or destroy vehicles and their occupants. In U.S. military terminology destroying the vehicles is referred to as a catastrophic kill while only disabling its movement is referred to as a mobility kill.

Anti-tank mines are typically larger than anti-personnel mines and require more pressure to detonate. The high trigger pressure, normally requiring prevents them from being set off by infantry or smaller vehicles of lesser importance. More modern anti-tank mines use shaped charges to focus and increase the armor penetration of the explosives.

==Anti-personnel mines==

Anti-personnel mines are designed primarily to kill or injure people, as opposed to vehicles. They are often designed to injure rather than kill to increase the logistical support (evacuation, medical) burden on the opposing force. Some types of anti-personnel mines can also damage the tracks or wheels of armored vehicles.

In the asymmetric warfare conflicts and civil wars of the 21st century, improvised explosives, known as IEDs, have partially supplanted conventional land mines as the source of injury to dismounted (pedestrian) soldiers and civilians. IEDs are used mainly by insurgents and terrorists against regular armed forces and civilians. The injuries from the anti-personnel IED were recently reported in BMJ Open to be far worse than with landmines resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation.

==Warfare==

Land mines were designed for two main uses:
* To create defensive tactical barriers, channelling attacking forces into predetermined fire zones or slowing an invading force&#x27;s progress to allow reinforcements to arrive.
* To act as passive area denial weapons (to deny the enemy use of valuable terrain, resources or facilities when active defense of the area is not desirable or possible).

Land mines are currently used in large quantities mostly for this first purpose, thus their widespread use in the demilitarized zones (DMZs) of likely flashpoints such as Cyprus, Afghanistan and Korea. Syria has used land mines in its civil war. Since 2021, land mine use has risen in Myanmar during its internal conflict. As of 2023, both Russia and Ukraine have deployed land mines.

In military science, minefields are considered a defensive or harassing weapon, used to slow the enemy down, to deny certain terrain to the enemy, to focus enemy movement into kill zones, or to reduce morale by randomly attacking materiel and personnel. In some engagements during World War II, anti-tank mines accounted for half of all vehicles disabled.

Since combat engineers with mine-clearing equipment can clear a path through a minefield relatively quickly, mines are usually considered effective only if covered by fire.

The extents of minefields are often marked with warning signs and cloth tape, to prevent friendly troops and non-combatants from entering them. Of course, sometimes terrain can be denied using dummy minefields. Most forces carefully record the location and disposition of their own minefields, because warning signs can be destroyed or removed, and minefields should eventually be cleared. Minefields may also have marked or unmarked safe routes to allow friendly movement through them.

Placing minefields without marking and recording them for later removal is considered a war crime under Protocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which is itself an annex to the Geneva Conventions.

Artillery and aircraft-scatterable mines allow minefields to be placed in front of moving formations of enemy units, including the reinforcement of minefields or other obstacles that have been breached by enemy engineers. They can also be used to cover the retreat of forces disengaging from the enemy, or for interdiction of supporting units to isolate front line units from resupply. In most cases these minefields consist of a combination of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, with the anti-personnel mines making removal of the anti-tank mines more difficult. Mines of this type used by the United States are designed to self-destruct after a preset period of time, reducing the requirement for mine clearing to only those mines whose self-destruct system did not function. Some designs of these scatterable mines require an electrical charge (capacitor or battery) to detonate. After a certain period of time, either the charge dissipates, leaving them effectively inert or the circuitry is designed such that upon reaching a low level, the device is triggered, destroying the mine.

===Guerrilla warfare===
None of the conventional tactics and norms of mine warfare applies when they are employed in a guerrilla role:
* The mines are not used in defensive roles (for specific position or area).
* Mined areas are not marked.
* Mines are usually placed singly and not in groups covering an area.
* Mines are often left unattended (not covered by fire).

Land mines were commonly deployed by insurgents during the South African Border War, leading directly to the development of the first dedicated mine-protected armoured vehicles in South Africa. Namibian insurgents used anti-tank mines to throw South African military convoys into disarray before attacking them. To discourage detection and removal efforts, they also laid anti-personnel mines directly parallel to the anti-tank mines. This initially resulted in heavy South African military and police casualties, as the vast distances of road network vulnerable to insurgent sappers every day made comprehensive detection and clearance efforts impractical. The only other viable option was the adoption of mine-protected vehicles which could remain mobile on the roads with little risk to their passengers even if a mine was detonated. South Africa is widely credited with inventing the v-hull, a vee-shaped hull for armoured vehicles which deflects mine blasts away from the passenger compartment.

During the ongoing Syrian Civil War, Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017) and Yemeni Civil War (2015–present) land mines have been used for both defensive and guerrilla purposes.

===Laying mines===
Minefields may be laid by several means. The preferred, but most labour-intensive, way is to have engineers bury the mines, since this will make the mines practically invisible and reduce the number of mines needed to deny the enemy an area. Mines can be laid by specialized mine-laying vehicles. Mine-scattering shells may be fired by artillery from a distance of several tens of kilometers.

Mines may be dropped from helicopters or airplanes, or ejected from cluster bombs or cruise missiles.

Anti-tank minefields can be scattered with anti-personnel mines to make clearing them manually more time-consuming; and anti-personnel minefields are scattered with anti-tank mines to prevent the use of armored vehicles to clear them quickly. Some anti-tank mine types are also able to be triggered by infantry, giving them a dual purpose even though their main and official intention is to work as anti-tank weapons.

Some minefields are specifically booby-trapped to make clearing them more dangerous. Mixed anti-personnel and anti-tank minefields, anti-personnel mines &quot;under&quot; anti-tank mines, and fuses separated from mines have all been used for this purpose. Often, single mines are backed by a secondary device, designed to kill or maim personnel tasked with clearing the mine.

Multiple anti-tank mines have been buried in stacks of two or three with the bottom mine fuzed, to multiply the penetrating power. Since the mines are buried, the ground directs the energy of the blast in a single direction—through the bottom of the target vehicle or on the track.

Another specific use is to mine an aircraft runway immediately after it has been bombed to delay or discourage repair. Some cluster bombs combine these functions. One example was the British JP233 cluster bomb which includes munitions to damage (crater) the runway as well as anti-personnel mines in the same cluster bomb. As a result of the anti-personnel mine ban it was withdrawn from British Royal Air Force service, and the last stockpiles of the mine were destroyed on October 19, 1999.

==Demining==


Metal detectors were first used for demining, after their invention by the Polish officer Józef Kosacki. His invention, known as the Polish mine detector, was used by the Allies alongside mechanical methods, to clear the German mine fields during the Second Battle of El Alamein when 500 units were shipped to Field Marshal Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army.

The Nazis used captured civilians who were chased across minefields to detonate the explosives. According to Laurence Rees &quot;Curt von Gottberg, the SS-Obergruppenführer who, during 1943, conducted another huge anti-partisan action called Operation Kottbus on the eastern border of Belarus, reported that &#x27;approximately two to three thousand local people were blown up in the clearing of the minefields&#x27;.&quot;

Whereas the placing and arming of mines is relatively inexpensive and simple, the process of detecting and removing them is typically expensive, slow, and dangerous. This is especially true of irregular warfare where mines were used on an ad hoc basis in unmarked and undocumented areas. Anti-personnel mines are most difficult to find, due to their small size and many being made almost entirely of non-metallic materials specifically to evade metal detectors.

Manual clearing remains the most effective technique for clearing mine fields, although hybrid techniques involving the use of animals and robots are being developed. Many animals are desirable due to having a strong sense of smell capable of detecting a land mine. Animals such as rats and dogs can be trained to detect the explosive agent.

Other techniques involve the use of geolocation technologies. a joint team of researchers at the University of New South Wales and Ohio State University was working to develop a system based on multi-sensor integration. Furthermore, defence firms have been increasingly competing on the creation of unmanned demining systems. In addition to conventional remote control mine defusing robots that operate either through precise mechanical dismantling, electronic destabilization and kinetic triggering methods, fully autonomous methods are in development. Notably, these autonomous methods utilize unmanned ground systems, or more recently subterranean systems such as the EMC Operations Termite, using either outward pressure differentials along system bodies, or corkscrew mechanisms.

The laying of land mines has inadvertently led to a positive development in the Falkland Islands. Minefields laid near the sea during the Falklands War have become favorite places for penguins, which do not weigh enough to detonate the mines. Therefore, they can breed safely, free of human intrusion. These odd sanctuaries have proven so popular and lucrative for ecotourism that efforts existed to prevent removal of the mines, but the area has since been demined.

==International treaties==

The use of land mines is controversial because they are indiscriminate weapons, harming soldier and civilian alike. They remain dangerous after the conflict in which they were deployed has ended, killing and injuring civilians and rendering land impassable and unusable for decades. To make matters worse, many factions have not kept accurate records (or any at all) of the exact locations of their minefields, making removal efforts painstakingly slow. These facts pose serious difficulties in many developing nations where the presence of mines hampers resettlement, agriculture, and tourism. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines campaigned successfully to prohibit their use, culminating in the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, known informally as the Ottawa Treaty.

The Treaty came into force on March 1, 1999. The treaty was the result of the leadership of the Governments of Canada, Norway, South Africa and Mozambique working with the &quot;International Campaign to Ban Landmines&quot;, launched in 1992. The campaign and its leader, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its efforts.

The treaty does not include anti-tank mines, cluster bombs or Claymore-type mines operated in command mode and focuses specifically on anti-personnel mines, because these pose the greatest long term (post-conflict) risk to humans and animals since they are typically designed to be triggered by any movement or pressure of only a few kilograms, whereas anti-tank mines require much more weight (or a combination of factors that would exclude humans). Existing stocks must be destroyed within four years of signing the treaty.

Signatories of the Ottawa Treaty agree that they will not use, produce, stockpile or trade in anti-personnel land mines. In 1997, there were 122 signatories; as of early 2016, 162 countries have joined the Treaty. Thirty-six countries, including the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the United States, which together may hold tens of millions of stockpiled anti-personnel mines, are not party to the Convention. Another 34 have yet to sign on. The United States did not sign because the treaty lacks an exception for the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

Article 3 of the Treaty permits countries to retain land mines for use in training or development of countermeasures. Sixty-four countries have taken this option.

As an alternative to an outright ban, 10 countries follow regulations that are contained in a 1996 amendment of Protocol II of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW). The countries are China, Finland, India, Israel, Morocco, Pakistan, South Korea and the United States. Sri Lanka, which had adhered to this regulation, announced in 2016 that it would join the Ottawa Treaty.

Submunitions and unexploded ordnance from cluster munitions can also function as land mines, in that they continue to kill and maim indiscriminately long after conflicts have ended. The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) is an international treaty that prohibits the use, distribution, or manufacture of cluster munitions. The CCM entered into force in 2010, and has been ratified by over 100 countries.

==Manufacturers==
Before the Ottawa Treaty was adopted, the Arms Project of Human Rights Watch identified &quot;almost 100 companies and government agencies in 48 countries&quot; that had manufactured &quot;more than 340 types of anti-personnel land mines in recent decades&quot;. Five to ten million mines were produced per year with a value of $50 to $200 million. The largest producers were probably China, Italy and the Soviet Union. The companies involved included giants such as Daimler-Benz, the Fiat Group, the Daewoo Group, RCA and General Electric.

As of 2017, the &quot;Landmine &amp; Cluster Munition Monitor&quot; identified four countries that were &quot;likely to be actively producing&quot; land mines: India, Myanmar, Pakistan and South Korea. Another seven states reserved the right to make them but were probably not doing so: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Singapore, and Vietnam.

In recent years, arms industry manufacturers have been utilizing non-static mines that can be specifically targeted in order to remove the imprecision of anti-personnel devices, promoting the use of movable underground systems, movable above ground systems and systems that can be expired (automatically or manually via strategic operators.)
Development of systems such as Termite, by arms firm EMC Operations has led to criticism from proponents of past multilateral agreements against the placement of land mines and submunitions due to expectations of similar long-dormancy period issues after systems break or fail after it was announced that vehicles would likely be armed to destroy static targets, rather than focus purely on demining efforts.

== Impacts ==
Throughout the world there are millions of hectares that are contaminated with land mines.

=== Casualties ===
From 1999 to 2017, the &quot;Landmine Monitor&quot; has recorded over 120,000 casualties from mines, IEDs and ERW; it estimates that another 1,000 per year go unrecorded. The estimate for all time is over half a million. In 2017, at least 2,793 were killed and 4,431 injured. 87% of the casualties were civilians and 47% were children (less than 18 years old). The largest numbers of casualties were in Afghanistan (2,300), Syria (1,906), and Ukraine (429).

=== Environmental ===
Natural disasters can have a significant impact on efforts to demine areas of land. For example, the floods that occurred in Mozambique in 1999 and 2000 may have displaced hundreds of thousands of land mines left from the war. Uncertainty about their locations delayed recovery efforts.

=== Land degradation ===
From a study by Asmeret Asefaw Berhe, land degradation caused by land mines &quot;can be classified into five groups: access denial, loss of biodiversity, micro-relief disruption, chemical composition, and loss of productivity&quot;. The effects of an explosion depend on: &quot;(i) the objectives and methodological approaches of the investigation; (ii) concentration of mines in a unit area; (iii) chemical composition and toxicity of the mines; (iv) previous uses of the land and (v) alternatives that are available for the affected populations&quot;.

==== Access denial ====
The most prominent ecological issue associated with land mines (or fear of them) is denial of access to vital resources (where &quot;access&quot; refers to the ability to use resources, in contrast to &quot;property&quot;, the right to use them). The presence and fear of presence of even a single land mine can discourage access for agriculture, water supplies and possibly conservation measures. Reconstruction and development of important structures such as schools and hospitals are likely to be delayed, and populations may shift to urban areas, increasing overcrowding and the risk of spreading diseases.

Access denial can have positive effects on the environment. When a mined area becomes a &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot;, plants and vegetation have a chance to grow and recover. For example, formerly arable lands in Nicaragua returned to forests and remained undisturbed after the establishment of land mines. Similarly, the penguins of the Falkland Islands have benefited because they are not heavy enough to trigger the mines present. However, these benefits can only last as long as animals, tree limbs, etc. do not detonate the mines. In addition, long idle periods could &quot;potentially end up creating or exacerbating loss of productivity&quot;, particularly within land of low quality.

==== Loss of biodiversity ====
Land mines can threaten biodiversity by wiping out vegetation and wildlife during explosions or demining. This extra burden can push threatened and endangered species to extinction. They have also been used by poachers to target endangered species. Displaced refugees hunt animals for food and destroy habitat by making shelters.

Shrapnel, or abrasions of bark or roots caused by detonated mines, can cause the slow death of trees and provide entry sites for wood-rotting fungi. When land mines make land unavailable for farming, residents resort to the forests to meet all of their survival needs. This exploitation furthers the loss of biodiversity.

==== Chemical contamination ====
Near mines that have exploded or decayed, soils tend to be contaminated, particularly with heavy metals. Products produced from the explosives, both organic and inorganic substances, are most likely to be &quot;long lasting, water-soluble and toxic even in small amounts&quot;. They can be implemented either &quot;directly or indirectly into soil, water bodies, microorganisms and plants with drinking water, food products or during respiration&quot;.

Toxic compounds can also find their way into bodies of water and accumulate in land animals, fish and plants. They can act &quot;as a nerve poison to hamper growth&quot;, with deadly effect.

<doc id="18175" wikidata="Q752920" url="?curid=18175" title="Lwa">
<text>, also called loa, are spirits in the African diasporic religion of Haitian Vodou and Dominican Vudú. They have also been incorporated into some revivalist forms of Louisiana Voodoo. Many of the lwa derive their identities in part from deities venerated in the traditional religions of West Africa, especially those of the Fon and Yoruba.

In Haitian Vodou, the lwa serve as intermediaries between humanity and Bondye, a transcendent creator divinity. Vodouists believe that over a thousand lwa exist, the names of at least 232 of which are recorded. Each lwa has its own personality and is associated with specific colors and objects. Many of them are equated with specific Roman Catholic saints on the basis of similar characteristics or shared symbols. The lwa are divided into different groups, known as &quot;nanchon&quot; (nations), the most notable of which are the Petwo and the Rada. According to Vodou belief, the lwa communicate with humans through dreams and divination, and in turn are given offerings, including sacrificed animals. Vodou teaches that during ceremonies, the lwa possess specific practitioners, who during the possession are considered the &quot;chwal&quot; (horse) of the lwa. Through possessing an individual, Vodouists believe, the lwa can communicate with other humans, offering advice, admonishment, or healing. 

During the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries, enslaved West Africans brought their traditional religions with them. In the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which became the republic of Haiti in the early 19th century, the diasporic religion of Vodou emerged amid the mixing of different West African traditional religions and the influence of the French colonists&#x27; Roman Catholicism. From at least the 19th century, Haitian migrants took their religion to Louisiana, by that point part of the United States, where they contributed to the formation of Louisiana Voodoo, a religion that largely died out in the early 20th century. In the latter part of that century, Voodoo revivalist groups emerged in Louisiana, often incorporating both the lwa spirits of Haitian Vodou and the oricha spirits of Cuban Santería into their practices.

==Etymology==

Modern linguists trace the etymology of &quot;lwa&quot; to a family of Yoruba language words which include &quot;&quot; (god) and &quot;babalawo&quot; (diviner or priest).
The term &quot;lwa&quot; is phonetically identical to both a French term for law, &quot;loi&quot;, and a Haitian Creole term for law, &quot;lwa&quot;. The early 20th-century writer Jean Price-Mars pondered if the term &quot;lwa&quot;, used in reference to Vodou spirits, emerged from their popular identification with the laws of the Roman Catholic Church. In the early 21st century, the historian Kate Ramsey agreed that the phonetic similarity between the terms for the law and the Vodou spirits may not be &quot;mere linguistic coincidence&quot; but could reflect the complex interactions of African and French colonial cultures in Haiti.

Several spelling for &quot;lwa&quot; have been used. Early 20th-century writers on Haitian religion, such as Price-Mars, usually spelled the term &quot;loi&quot;. During that century, writers like the American anthropologist Melville Herskovits favored the spelling &quot;loa&quot;, although in 2008 the historian Jeffrey E. Anderson wrote that the spelling &quot;loa&quot; was typically found in older works on the topic, having fallen out of favor with scholarly writers. The spelling &quot;lwa&quot; has been favored by more recent scholarly writers including Anderson, Ramsey, the anthropologist Karen McCarthy Brown, the scholar of religious studies Leslie Desmangles, and the Hispanic studies scholars Margarite Fernández Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gebert.

==Theology==

Vodou teaches that there are over a thousand lwa. They are regarded as the intermediaries of Bondyé, the supreme creator deity in Vodou. Desmangles argued that by learning about the various lwas, practitioners come to understand the different facets of Bondyé. Much as Vodouists often identify Bondyé with the Christian God, the lwa are sometimes equated with the angels of Christian cosmology. The lwa are also known as the &quot;mystères&quot;, &quot;anges&quot;, &quot;saints&quot;, and &quot;les invisibles&quot;.

The lwa can offer help, protection, and counsel to humans, in return for ritual service. They are thought of as having wisdom that is useful for humans, although they are not seen as moral exemplars which practitioners should imitate. Each lwa has its own personality, and is associated with specific colors, days of the week, and objects. The lwa can be either loyal or capricious in their dealings with their devotees; Vodouists believe that the lwa are easily offended, for instance if offered food that they dislike. When angered, the lwa are believed to remove their protection from their devotees, or to inflict misfortune, illness, or madness on an individual.

Although there are exceptions, most lwa names derive from the Fon and Yoruba languages. New lwa are nevertheless added to those brought from Africa; practitioners believe that some Vodou priests and priestesses became lwa after death, or that certain talismans become lwa. Vodouists often refer to the lwa residing in &quot;Guinea&quot;, but this is not intended as a precise geographical location. Many lwa are also understood to live under the water, at the bottom of the sea or in rivers. Vodouists believe that the lwa communicate with humans through dreams and through the possession of human beings.

During rituals, the lwa are summoned through designs known as &quot;veve&quot;. These are sketched out on the floor of the ceremonial space using cornmeal, ash, coffee grounds, or powdered eggshells.

The lwa are associated with specific Roman Catholic saints. For instance, Azaka, the lwa of agriculture, is associated with Saint Isidore the farmer. Similarly, because he is understood as the &quot;key&quot; to the spirit world, Papa Legba is typically associated with Saint Peter, who is visually depicted holding keys in traditional Roman Catholic imagery. The lwa of love and luxury, Ezili Freda, is associated with Mater Dolorosa. Damballa, who is a serpent, is often equated with Saint Patrick, who is traditionally depicted in a scene with snakes; alternatively he is often associated with Moses. The Marasa, or sacred twins, are typically equated with the twin saints Cosmos and Damian.

==Nanchon==

In Haitian Vodou, the lwa are divided into &quot;nanchon&quot; or &quot;nations&quot;. This classificatory system derives from the way in which enslaved West Africans were divided into &quot;nations&quot; upon their arrival in Haiti, usually based on their African port of departure rather than their ethno-cultural identity. The nanchons are nevertheless not groupings based in the geographical origins of specific lwas. The term &quot;fanmi&quot; (family) is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;nation&quot; or alternatively as a sub-division of the latter category. It is often claimed that there are 17 nanchon, although few Haitians could name all of them. Each is deemed to have its own characteristic ethos.

Among the more commonly known nanchon are the Wangol, Ginen, Kongo, Nago (or Anago), Ibo, Rada, and Petwo. Of these, the Rada and the Petwo are the largest and most dominant. The Rada derive their name from Arada, a city in the Dahomey kingdom of West Africa. The Rada lwa are usually regarded as &quot;dous&quot; or &quot;doux&quot;, meaning that they are sweet-tempered. The Petwo lwa are conversely seen as &quot;lwa chaud&quot; (&quot;lwa cho&quot;), indicating that they can be forceful or violent and are associated with fire; they are generally regarded as being socially transgressive and subversive. The Rada lwa are seen as being &#x27;cool&#x27;; the Petwo lwa as &#x27;hot&#x27;.
The Rada lwa are generally regarded as righteous, whereas their Petwo counterparts are thought of as being more morally ambiguous, associated with issues like money. At the same time, the Rada lwa are regarded as being less effective or powerful than those of the Petwo nation. The Petwo lwa derive from various backgrounds, including Creole, Kongo, and Dahomeyan. 

In various cases, certain lwa can be absorbed from one nanchon into another; various Kongo and Ibo lwa have been incorporated into the Petwo nanchon. Many lwa exist &quot;andezo&quot; or &quot;en deux eaux&quot;, meaning that they are &quot;in two waters&quot; and are served in both Rada and Petwo rituals. Various lwas are understood to have direct counterparts in different nanchon; several Rada lwas for instance have Petwo counterparts whose names bear epithets like &quot;Flangbo&quot; (afire), &quot;Je-Rouge&quot; (Red-Eye), or &quot;Zarenyen&quot; (spider). One example is the Rada lwa Ezili, who is associated with love, but who has a Petwo parallel known as Ezili Je-Rouge, who is regarded as dangerous and prone to causing harm. Another is the Rada lwa Legba, who directs human destiny, and who is paralleled in the Petwo pantheon by Kafou Legba, a trickster who causes accidents that alter a person&#x27;s destiny.

The Gede (also &quot;Ghede&quot; or &quot;Guede&quot;) family of lwa are associated with the realm of the dead. The head of the family is Baron Samedi (&quot;Baron Saturday&quot;). His consort is Grand Brigitte; she has authority over cemeteries and is regarded as the mother of many of the other Gede. When the Gede are believed to have arrived at a Vodou ceremony they are usually greeted with joy because they bring merriment. Those possessed by the Gede at these ceremonies are known for making sexual innuendos; the Gede&#x27;s symbol is an erect penis, while the &quot;banda&quot; dance associated with them involves sexual-style thrusting.

==Ritual==
===Offerings and animal sacrifice===

Feeding the lwa is of great importance in Vodou, with rites often termed &quot;mangers-lwa&quot; (&quot;feeding the lwa&quot;). Offering food and drink to the lwa is the most common ritual within the religion, conducted both communally and in the home. An &quot;oungan&quot; (priest) or &quot;manbo&quot; (priestess) will also organize an annual feast for their congregation in which animal sacrifices to various lwa will be made. The choice of food and drink offered varies depending on the lwa in question, with different lwa believed to favour different foodstuffs. Damballa for instance requires white foods, especially eggs. Foods offered to Legba, whether meat, tubers, or vegetables, need to be grilled on a fire. The lwa of the Ogu and Nago nations prefer raw rum or clairin as an offering.

A &quot;mange sèc&quot; (dry meal) is an offering of grains, fruit, and vegetables that often precedes a simple ceremony; it takes its name from the absence of blood. Species used for sacrifice include chickens, goats, and bulls, with pigs often favored for petwo lwa. The animal may be washed, dressed in the color of the specific lwa, and marked with food or water. Often, the animal&#x27;s throat will be cut and the blood collected in a calabash. Chickens are often killed by the pulling off of their heads; their limbs may be broken beforehand. The organs are removed and placed on the altar or vèvè. The flesh will be cooked and placed on the altar, subsequently often being buried.
Maya Deren wrote that: &quot;The intent and emphasis of sacrifice is not upon the death of the animal, it is upon the transfusion of its life to the lwa; for the understanding is that flesh and blood are of the essence of life and vigor, and these will restore the divine energy of the god.&quot; Because Agwé is believed to reside in the sea, rituals devoted to him often take place beside a large body of water such as a lake, river, or sea. His devotees sometimes sail out to Trois Ilets, drumming and singing, where they throw a white sheep overboard as a sacrifice to him.

The food is typically offered when it is cool; it remains there for a while before humans can then eat it. The food is often placed within a &quot;kwi&quot;, a calabash shell bowl. Once selected, the food is placed on special calabashes known as &quot;assiettes de Guinée&quot; which are located on the altar. Offerings not consumed by the celebrants are then often buried or left at a crossroads. Libations might be poured into the ground. Vodouists believe that the lwa then consume the essence of the food. Certain foods are also offered in the belief that they are intrinsically virtuous, such as grilled maize, peanuts, and cassava. These are sometimes sprinkled over animals that are about to be sacrificed or piled upon the &quot;vèvè&quot; designs on the floor of the &quot;peristil&quot;.

Possession by the lwa constitutes an important element of Vodou. It lies the heart of many of its rituals; these typically take place in a temple called an &quot;ounfò&quot;, specifically in a room termed the &quot;peristil&quot; or &quot;peristyle&quot;. 

The person being possessed is referred to as the &quot;chwal&quot; or &quot;chual&quot; (horse); the act of possession is called &quot;mounting a horse&quot;. Vodou teaches that a lwa can possess an individual regardless of gender; both male and female lwa can possess either men or women. Although children are often present at these ceremonies, they are rarely possessed as it is considered too dangerous. While the specific drums and songs used are designed to encourage a specific lwa to possess someone, sometimes an unexpected lwa appears and takes possession instead. In some instances a succession of lwa possess the same individual, one after the other.

The trance of possession is known as the &quot;crise de lwa&quot;. Vodouists believe that during this process, the lwa enters the head of the chwal and displaces their &quot;gwo bon anj&quot;, which is one of the two halves of a person&#x27;s soul. This displacement is believed to cause the chwal to tremble and convulse; Maya Deren described a look of &quot;anguish, ordeal and blind terror&quot; on the faces of those as they became possessed. Because their consciousness has been removed from their head during the possession, Vodouists believe that the chwal will have no memory of what occurs during the incident. The length of the possession varies, often lasting a few hours but sometimes several days. It may end with the chwal collapsing in a semi-conscious state; they are typically left physically exhausted. Some individuals attending the dance will put a certain item, often wax, in their hair or headgear to prevent possession.

Once the lwa possesses an individual, the congregation greet it with a burst of song and dance. The chwal will typically bow before the officiating priest or priestess and prostrate before the &quot;poto mitan&quot;, a central pillar within the temple. The chwal is often escorted into an adjacent room where they are dressed in clothing associated with the possessing lwa. Alternatively, the clothes are brought out and they are dressed in the peristil itself. Once the chwal has been dressed, congregants kiss the floor before them. These costumes and props help the chwal take on the appearance of the lwa. Many ounfo have a large wooden phallus on hand which is used by those possessed by Ghede lwa during their dances.

The chwal takes on the behaviour and expressions of the possessing lwa; their performance can be very theatrical. Those believing themselves possessed by the serpent Damballa, for instance, often slither on the floor, dart out their tongue, and climb the posts of the peristil. Those possessed by Zaka, lwa of agriculture, will dress as a peasant in a straw hat with a clay pipe and will often speak in a rustic accent. The chwal will often then join in with the dances, dancing with anyone whom they wish to, or sometimes eating and drinking. Sometimes the lwa, through the chwal, will engage in financial transactions with members of the congregation, for instance by selling them food that has been given as an offering or lending them money.

Possession facilitates direct communication between the lwa and its followers; through the chwal, the lwa communicates with their devotees, offering counsel, chastisement, blessings, warnings about the future, and healing. Lwa possession has a healing function, with the possessed individual expected to reveal possible cures to the ailments of those assembled. Clothing that the chwal touches is regarded as bringing luck. The lwa may also offer advice to the individual they are possessing; because the latter is not believed to retain any memory of the events, it is expected that other members of the congregation will pass along the lwa&#x27;s message. In some instances, practitioners have reported being possessed at other times of ordinary life, such as when someone is in the middle of the market, or when they are asleep.

==History==

During the closing decades of the 20th century, attempts were made to revive Louisiana Voodoo, often by individuals drawing heavily on Haitian Vodou and Cuban Santería in doing so. Among those drawing on both Vodou lwa and Santería oricha to create a new Voodoo was the African American Miriam Chamani, who established the Voodoo Spiritual Temple in the French Quarter of New Orleans in 1990. Another initiate of Haitian Vodou, the Ukrainian-Jewish American Sallie Ann Glassman, launched an alternative group, La Source Ancienne, in the city&#x27;s Bywater neighborhood. A further Haitian Vodou initiate, the Louisiana Creole Ava Kay Jones, also began promoting a form of Louisiana Voodoo.

==List==
Vodouisants will sometimes comment that there are over a thousand lwas, most of whom are not known to humans. Of these, the names of at least 232 have been recorded. The large number of lwas found in Vodou contrasts with the Cuban religion of Santería, where only 15 orichas (spirits) have gained prominence among its followers.

<doc id="18178" wikidata="Q28161" url="?curid=18178" title="Labour economics">
<text>Labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour. Labour is a commodity that is supplied by labourers, usually in exchange for a wage paid by demanding firms. Because these labourers exist as parts of a social, institutional, or political system, labour economics must also account for social, cultural and political variables.

Labour markets or job markets function through the interaction of workers and employers. Labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services (workers) and the demanders of labour services (employers), and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages, employment, and income. These patterns exist because each individual in the market is presumed to make rational choices based on the information that they know regarding wage, desire to provide labour, and desire for leisure. Labour markets are normally geographically bounded, but the rise of the internet has brought about a &#x27;planetary labour market&#x27; in some sectors.

Labour is a measure of the work done by human beings. It is conventionally contrasted with other factors of production, such as land and capital. Some theories focus on human capital, or entrepreneurship, (which refers to the skills that workers possess and not necessarily the actual work that they produce). Labour is unique to study because it is a special type of good that cannot be separated from the owner (i.e. the work cannot be separated from the person who does it). A labour market is also different from other markets in that workers are the suppliers and firms are the demanders.

==Macro and micro analysis of labour markets==
There are two sides to labour economics. Labour economics can generally be seen as the application of microeconomic or macroeconomic techniques to the labour market. Microeconomic techniques study the role of individuals and individual firms in the labour market. Macroeconomic techniques look at the interrelations between the labour market, the goods market, the money market, and the foreign trade market. It looks at how these interactions influence macro variables such as employment levels, participation rates, aggregate income and gross domestic product.

==Macroeconomics of labour markets==
The labour market in macroeconomic theory shows that the supply of labour exceeds demand, which has been proven by salary growth that lags productivity growth. When labour supply exceeds demand, salary faces downward pressure due to an employer&#x27;s ability to pick from a labour pool that exceeds the jobs pool. However, if the demand for labour is larger than the supply, salary increases, as employee have more bargaining power while employers have to compete for scarce labour.

The labour force (LF) is defined as the number of people of working age, who are either employed or actively looking for work (unemployed). The &quot;labour force participation rate&quot; (LFPR) is the number of people in the labour force divided by the size of the adult civilian noninstitutional population (or by the population of working age that is not institutionalized), LFPR = LF/Population.

The non-labour force includes those who are not looking for work, those who are institutionalized (such as in prisons or psychiatric wards), stay-at-home spouses, children not of working age, and those serving in the military. The unemployment level is defined as the labour force minus the number of people currently employed. The unemployment rate is defined as the level of unemployment divided by the labour force. The employment rate is defined as the number of people currently employed divided by the adult population (or by the population of working age). In these statistics, self-employed people are counted as employed.

The labour market has the ability to create a higher derivative efficiency of labour, especially on a national and international level, compared to simpler forms of labour distribution, leading to a higher financial GDP growth and output. An efficient labour market is important for the private sector as it drives up derivative income through the reduction of relative costs of labour. This presupposes that division of labour is used as a method to attain cost efficiency.

Variables like employment level, unemployment level, labour force, and unfilled vacancies are called stock variables because they measure a quantity at a point in time. They can be contrasted with flow variables which measure a quantity over a duration of time. Changes in the labour force are due to flow variables such as natural population growth, net immigration, new entrants, and retirements. Changes in unemployment depend on inflows (non-employed people starting to look for jobs and employed people who lose their jobs that are looking for new ones) and outflows (people who find new employment and people who stop looking for employment). When looking at the overall macroeconomy, several types of unemployment have been identified, which can be separated into two categories of natural and unnatural unemployment.

&quot;Natural Unemployment&quot;

* Frictional unemployment – This reflects the fact that it takes time for people to find and settle into new jobs that they feel are appropriate for them and their skill set. Technological advancement often reduces frictional unemployment; for example, internet search engines have reduced the cost and time associated with finding work and hiring decisions.
* Structural unemployment – The number of jobs available in an industry are insufficient to provide jobs to all persons who are interested in working or qualified to work in that industry. This can be due to the changes in industries prevalent in a country or because wages for the industry are too high, causing people to want to supply their labour to that industry.
* Seasonal unemployment – Unemployment due to seasonal fluctuations of demand for workers across industries, such as in the retail industry after holidays that involve a lot of shopping are over.
* Natural rate of unemployment (also known as full employment) – This is the summation of frictional and structural unemployment, that excludes cyclical contributions of unemployment (e.g. recessions) and seasonal unemployment. It is the lowest rate of unemployment that a stable economy can expect to achieve, given that some frictional and structural unemployment is inevitable. Economists do not agree on the level of the natural rate, with estimates ranging from 1% to 5%, or on its meaning – some associate it with &quot;non-accelerating inflation&quot;. The estimated rate varies between countries and across time.

&quot;Unnatural Unemployment&quot;

* Demand deficient unemployment (also known as cyclical unemployment) – Any level of unemployment beyond the natural rate caused by the failure of markets to clear, generally due to insufficient aggregate demand in the economy. During a recession, demand is deficient, causing the underutilisation of inputs (including labour). 
Aggregate expenditure (AE) can be increased by increasing consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), or increasing exports (X), since AE = C + I + G + X. 

==Neoclassical microeconomics==

Neoclassical economists view the labour market as similar to other markets in that the forces of supply and demand jointly determine the price (in this case the wage rate) and quantity (in this case the number of people employed).

However, the labour market differs from other markets (like the markets for goods or the financial market) in several ways. In particular, the labour market may act as a non-clearing market. While according to neoclassical theory most markets quickly attain a point of equilibrium without excess supply or demand, this may not be true of the labour market: it may have a persistent level of unemployment. Contrasting the labour market to other markets also reveals persistent compensating differentials among similar workers.

Models that assume perfect competition in the labour market, as discussed below, conclude that workers earn their marginal product of labour.

===Neoclassical supply===

Households are suppliers of labour. In microeconomic theory, people are assumed to be rational and seeking to maximize their utility function. In the labour market model, their utility function expresses trade-offs in preference between leisure time and income from time used for labour. However, they are constrained by the hours available to them.

Let &quot;w&quot; denote the hourly wage, &quot;k&quot; denote total hours available for labour and leisure, &quot;L&quot; denote the chosen number of working hours, π denote income from non-labour sources, and &quot;A&quot; denote leisure hours chosen. The individual&#x27;s problem is to maximise utility &quot;U&quot;, which depends on total income available for spending on consumption and also depends on the time spent in leisure, subject to a time constraint, with respect to the choices of labour time and leisure time:

:formula_1

This is shown in the graph below, which illustrates the trade-off between allocating time to leisure activities and allocating it to income-generating activities. The linear constraint indicates that every additional hour of leisure undertaken requires the loss of an hour of labour and thus of the fixed amount of goods that that labour&#x27;s income could purchase. Individuals must choose how much time to allocate to leisure activities and how much to working. This allocation decision is informed by the indifference curve labelled IC1. The curve indicates the combinations of leisure and work that will give the individual a specific level of utility. The point where the highest indifference curve is just tangent to the constraint line (point A), illustrates the optimum for this supplier of labour services.

If consumption is measured by the value of income obtained, this diagram can be used to show a variety of interesting effects. This is because the absolute value of the slope of the budget constraint is the wage rate. The point of optimisation (point A) reflects the equivalency between the wage rate and the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for income (the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve). Because the marginal rate of substitution of leisure for income is also the ratio of the marginal utility of leisure (MUL) to the marginal utility of income (MUY), one can conclude:

:formula_2

where &quot;Y&quot; is total income and the right side is the wage rate.
&quot;Effects of a wage increase&quot;
If the wage rate increases, this individual&#x27;s constraint line pivots up from X,Y1 to X,Y2. He/she can now purchase more goods and services. His/her utility will increase from point A on IC1 to point B on IC2.
To understand what effect this might have on the decision of how many hours to work, one must look at the income effect and substitution effect.

The wage increase shown in the previous diagram can be decomposed into two separate effects. The pure income effect is shown as the movement from point A to point C in the next diagram. Consumption increases from YA to YC and – since the diagram assumes that leisure is a normal good – leisure time increases from XA to XC. (Employment time decreases by the same amount as leisure increases.)

&quot;The Income and Substitution effects of a wage increase&quot;

But that is only part of the picture. As the wage rate rises, the worker will substitute away from leisure and into the provision of labour—that is, will work more hours to take advantage of the higher wage rate, or in other words substitute away from leisure because of its higher opportunity cost. This substitution effect is represented by the shift from point C to point B. The net impact of these two effects is shown by the shift from point A to point B. The relative magnitude of the two effects depends on the circumstances. In some cases, such as the one shown, the substitution effect is greater than the income effect (in which case more time will be allocated to working), but in other cases, the income effect will be greater than the substitution effect (in which case less time is allocated to working). The intuition behind this latter case is that the individual decides that the higher earnings on the previous amount of labour can be &quot;spent&quot; by purchasing more leisure.

&quot;The Labour Supply curve&quot;

If the substitution effect is greater than the income effect, an individual&#x27;s supply of labour services will increase as the wage rate rises, which is represented by a positive slope in the labour supply curve (as at point E in the adjacent diagram, which exhibits a positive wage elasticity). This positive relationship is increasing until point F, beyond which the income effect dominates the substitution effect and the individual starts to reduce the number of labour hours he supplies (point G) as wage increases; in other words, the wage elasticity is now negative.

The direction of the slope may change more than once for some individuals, and the labour supply curve is different for different individuals.

Other variables that affect the labour supply decision, and can be readily incorporated into the model, include taxation, welfare, work environment, and income as a signal of ability or social contribution.

===Neoclassical demand===
A firm&#x27;s labour demand is based on its marginal physical product of labour (MPPL). This is defined as the additional output (or physical product) that results from an increase of one unit of labour (or from an infinitesimal increase in labour). (See also Production theory basics.)

Labour demand is a derived demand; that is, hiring labour is not desired for its own sake but rather because it aids in producing output, which contributes to an employer&#x27;s revenue and hence profits. The demand for an additional amount of labour depends on the Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) and the marginal cost (MC) of the worker. With a perfectly competitive goods market, the MRP is calculated by multiplying the price of the end product or service by the Marginal Physical Product of the worker. If the MRP is greater than a firm&#x27;s Marginal Cost, then the firm will employ the worker since doing so will increase profit. The firm only employs however up to the point where MRP=MC, and not beyond, in neoclassical economic theory.

The MRP of the worker is affected by other inputs to production with which the worker can work (e.g. machinery), often aggregated under the term &quot;capital&quot;. It is typical in economic models for greater availability of capital for a firm to increase the MRP of the worker, all else equal. Education and training are counted as &quot;human capital&quot;. Since the amount of physical capital affects MRP, and since financial capital flows can affect the amount of physical capital available, MRP and thus wages can be affected by financial capital flows within and between countries, and the degree of capital mobility within and between countries.

According to neoclassical theory, over the relevant range of outputs, the marginal physical product of labour is declining (law of diminishing returns). That is, as more and more units of labour are employed, their additional output begins to decline.

Additionally, although the MRP is a good way of expressing an employer&#x27;s demand, other factors such as social group formation can the demand, as well as the labour supply. This constantly restructures exactly what a labour market is, and leads way to cause problems for theories of inflation.

===Equilibrium===

&quot;A firm&#x27;s labour demand in the short run (D) and a horizontal supply curve (S)&quot;

The marginal revenue product of labour can be used as the demand for labour curve for this firm in the short run. In competitive markets, a firm faces a perfectly elastic supply of labour which corresponds with the wage rate and the marginal resource cost of labour (W = SL = MFCL). In imperfect markets, the diagram would have to be adjusted because MFCL would then be equal to the wage rate divided by marginal costs. Because optimum resource allocation requires that marginal factor costs equal marginal revenue product, this firm would demand L units of labour as shown in the diagram.

The demand for labour of this firm can be summed with the demand for labour of all other firms in the economy to obtain the aggregate demand for labour. Likewise, the supply curves of all the individual workers (mentioned above) can be summed to obtain the aggregate supply of labour. These supply and demand curves can be analysed in the same way as any other industry demand and supply curves to determine equilibrium wage and employment levels.

Wage differences exist, particularly in mixed and fully/partly flexible labour markets. For example, the wages of a doctor and a port cleaner, both employed by the NHS, differ greatly. There are various factors concerning this phenomenon. This includes the MRP of the worker. A doctor&#x27;s MRP is far greater than that of the port cleaner. In addition, the barriers to becoming a doctor are far greater than that of becoming a port cleaner. To become a doctor takes a lot of education and training which is costly, and only those who excel in academia can succeed in becoming doctors. The port cleaner, however, requires relatively less training. The supply of doctors is therefore significantly less elastic than that of port cleaners. Demand is also inelastic as there is a high demand for doctors and medical care is a necessity, so the NHS will pay higher wage rates to attract the profession.

==Monopsony==
Some labour markets have a single employer and thus do not satisfy the perfect competition assumption of the neoclassical model above. The model of a monopsonistic labour market gives a lower quantity of employment and a lower equilibrium wage rate than does the competitive model.

==Asymmetric information==

In many real-life situations, the assumption of perfect information is unrealistic. An employer does not necessarily know how hard workers are working or how productive they are. This provides an incentive for workers to shirk from providing their full effort, called moral hazard. Since it is difficult for the employer to identify the hard-working and the shirking employees, there is no incentive to work hard and productivity falls overall, leading to the hiring of more workers and a lower unemployment rate.

One solution that is used to avoid a moral hazard is stock options that grant employees the chance to benefit directly from a firm&#x27;s success. However, this solution has attracted criticism as executives with large stock-option packages have been suspected of acting to over-inflate share values to the detriment of the long-run welfare of the firm. Another solution, foreshadowed by the rise of temporary workers in Japan and the firing of many of these workers in response to the financial crisis of 2008, is more flexible job- contracts and -terms that encourage employees to work less than full-time by partially compensating for the loss of hours, relying on workers to adapt their working time in response to job requirements and economic conditions instead of the employer trying to determine how much work is needed to complete a given task and overestimating.

Another aspect of uncertainty results from the firm&#x27;s imperfect knowledge about worker ability. If a firm is unsure about a worker&#x27;s ability, it pays a wage assuming that the worker&#x27;s ability is the average of similar workers. This wage under compensates high-ability workers which may drive them away from the labour market as well as at the same time attracting low-ability workers. Such a phenomenon, called adverse selection, can sometimes lead to market collapse.

One way to combat adverse selection, firms will try to use signalling, pioneered by Michael Spence, whereby employers could use various characteristics of applicants differentiate between high-ability or low-ability workers. One common signal used is education, whereby employers assume that high-ability workers will have higher levels of education. Employers can then compensate high-ability workers with higher wages. However, signalling does not always work, and it may appear to an external observer that education has raised the marginal product of labour, without this necessarily being true.

=== Search models ===

One of the major research achievements of the 1990–2010 period was the development of a framework with dynamic search, matching, and bargaining.

==Personnel economics: hiring and incentives==
At the micro level, one sub-discipline eliciting increased attention in recent decades is analysis of internal labour markets, that is, &quot;within&quot; firms (or other organisations), studied in personnel economics from the perspective of personnel management. By contrast, external labour markets &quot;imply that workers move somewhat fluidly between firms and wages are determined by some aggregate process where firms do not have significant discretion over wage setting.&quot; The focus is on &quot;how firms establish, maintain, and end employment relationships and on how firms provide incentives to employees,&quot; including models and empirical work on incentive systems and as constrained by economic efficiency and risk/incentive tradeoffs relating to personnel compensation.

=== Discrimination and inequality ===
Inequality and discrimination in the workplace can have many effects on workers.

In the context of labour economics, inequality is usually referring to the unequal distribution of earning between households. Inequality is commonly measured by economists using the Gini coefficient. This coefficient does not have a concrete meaning but is more used as a way to compare inequality across regions. The higher the Gini coefficient is calculated to be the larger inequality exists in a region. Over time, inequality has, on average, been increasing. This is due to numerous factors including labour supply and demand shifts as well as institutional changes in the labour market. On the shifts in labour supply and demand, factors include demand for skilled workers going up more than the supply of skilled workers and relative to unskilled workers as well as technological changes that increase productivity; all of these things cause wages to go up for skilled labour while unskilled worker wages stay the same or decline. As for the institutional changes, a decrease in union power and a declining real minimum wage, which both reduce unskilled workers wages, and tax cuts for the wealthy all increase the inequality gap between groups of earners.

As for discrimination, it is the difference in pay that can be attributed to the demographic differences between people, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc, even though these factors do not affect the productivity of the worker. Many regions and countries have enacted government policies to combat discrimination, including discrimination in the workplace. Discrimination can be modelled and measured in numerous ways. The Oaxaca decomposition is a common method to calculate the amount of discrimination that exists when wages differ between groups of people. This decomposition aims to calculate the difference in wages that occurs because of differences in skills versus the returns to those skills. A way of modelling discrimination in the workplace when dealing with wages are Gary Becker&#x27;s taste models. Using taste models, employer discrimination can be thought of as the employer not hiring the minority worker because of their perceived cost of hiring that worker is higher than that of the cost of hiring a non-minority worker, which causes less hiring of the minority. Another taste model is for employee discrimination, which does not cause a decline in the hiring of minorities, but instead causes a more segregated workforce because the prejudiced worker feels that they should be paid more to work next to the worker they are prejudiced against or that they are not paid an equal amount as the worker they are prejudiced against. One more taste model involves customer discrimination, whereby the employers themselves are not prejudiced but believe that their customers might be, so therefore the employer is less likely to hire the minority worker if they are going to interact with customers that are prejudiced. There are many other taste models other than these that Gary Becker has made to explain discrimination that causes differences in hiring in wages in the labour market.

<text>Lammas (from Old English &quot;hlāfmæsse&quot;, &quot;loaf-mass&quot;), also known as Loaf Mass Day, is a Christian holiday celebrated in some English-speaking countries on 1 August. The name originates from the word &quot;loaf&quot; in reference to bread and &quot;Mass&quot; in reference to the Eucharist. It is a festival in the liturgical calendar to mark the blessing of the First Fruits of harvest, with a loaf of bread being brought to the church for this purpose. Lammastide falls at the halfway point between the summer solstice and the autumn equinox. Christians also have church processions to bakeries, where those working therein are blessed by Christian clergy.

While Lammas is traditionally a Christian holy day, some neopagans have adopted the name and date for one of their harvest festivals in their Wheel of the Year. It is also the same date as the Gaelic harvest festival Lughnasadh.

==Name==
The name &#x27;Lammas&#x27; comes from Old English meaning &quot;loaf mass&quot;. 

Several antiquarians suggested that the name &#x27;Lammas&#x27; came from &#x27;lamb mass&#x27;. John Brady supposed that tenants of the Cathedral of York, dedicated to St Peter in Chains, of which this is the feast, were required to bring a live lamb to the church.

Another name for the feast in the Middle Ages was the &#x27;Gule of August&#x27;. It has been suggested, following the 18th-century Welsh clerical antiquary John Pettingall, that this is an anglicisation of &quot;&quot;, Welsh for &quot;feast of August&quot;.

==History==

In Christianity, the offering of first fruits to God has a history, as in the Old Testament, &quot;when the harvest ripened the priest went into the field and gathered a sheaf of first-ripened grain. Then he took that sheaf into the temple and waved it before the Lord.&quot; The Didache of the early Church enjoined firstfruits be given of &quot;money, clothes, and all of your possessions&quot; (13:7).

In Anglo-Saxon England Lammas was the name for the first day of August and was described in Old English literature as &quot;the feast of first fruits&quot;, being mentioned often in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. It was probably the day when loaves baked from the first of the wheat harvest were blessed at church. The loaves might then have been used in protective rituals: a book of Anglo-Saxon charms directed that the Lammas loaf be broken into four parts, which were to be placed at the four corners of the barn, to protect the grain.

For many villeins, the wheat must have run low in the days before Lammas, and the new harvest began a season of plenty, of hard work and company in the fields, reaping in teams. In the medieval agricultural year, Lammas also marked the end of the hay harvest that had begun after Midsummer. At the end of hay-making a sheep would be loosed in the meadow among the mowers, for him to keep who could catch it.

Historian Ronald Hutton writes &quot;the time that the first of the harvest could be gathered would have been a natural point for celebration in an agrarian society&quot;. He says it is likely &quot;that a pre-Christian festival had existed among the Anglo-Saxons on that date&quot;. Folklorist Máire MacNeill linked Lammas with the Insular Celtic harvest festival Lughnasadh, held on the same date, and suggested the Anglo-Saxons adopted it from the Celtic Britons. She highlighted the apparent lack of a Continental Germanic festival on 1 August, and the apparent borrowing of the Welsh name &quot;Gŵyl Awst&quot;, &#x27;Gule of August&#x27;. However, Hutton says that &quot;MacNeill&#x27;s thesis of a pan-Celtic seasonal ritual, like her reconstruction of pagan rites, is so far un-proven&quot; and to prove it &quot;would involve a detailed knowledge of the religious calendar of the Anglo-Saxons before they arrived in England, which is impossible&quot;.

Lammas Day was one of the traditional Scottish quarter days before 1886. Lammas also coincided with the feast of St Peter in Chains, commemorating Saint Peter&#x27;s miraculous deliverance from prison, but in the liturgical reform of 1969 the feast of St Alphonsus Liguori was transferred to this day.

Ann Lewin explains the Christian feast of Lammas (Loaf Mass Day) and its importance in the liturgical year:

Today, in the Church of England, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, during the celebration of Holy Communion, &quot;The Lammas loaf, or part of it, may be used as the bread of the Eucharist, or the Lammas loaf and the eucharistic bread may be kept separate.&quot; &quot;Common Worship&quot; specifies: 
Christians also have church processions to bakeries, where those working therein are blessed by Christian clergy.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1.3.19) it is observed of Juliet, &quot;Come Lammas Eve at night shall she [Juliet] be fourteen.&quot; Another well-known cultural reference is the opening of &quot;The Battle of Otterburn&quot;: &quot;It fell about the Lammas tide when the muir-men win their hay.&quot;

==Other uses==

===Neopaganism===

Some neopagans have adopted the name and date of Lammas, making it one of the harvest festivals in their Wheel of the Year. Other neopagans use the Gaelic name &quot;Lughnasa&quot;. It is the first of the three autumn festivals, the others being the autumn equinox and Samhain. In the Northern Hemisphere it takes place around 1 August, while in the Southern Hemisphere it is celebrated around 1 February.

===Horticulture===
&quot;Lammas leaves&quot; or &quot;Lammas growth&quot; refers to a second crop of leaves produced in high summer by some species of trees in temperate countries to replace those lost to insect damage. They often differ slightly in shape, texture and/or hairiness from the earlier leaves. 

Exeter in Devon is one of the few towns in England that still celebrates its Lammas Fair and has a processional custom which stretches back over 900 years, led by the Lord Mayor. During the fair a white glove on a pole decorated with garlands is raised above the Guildhall. The fair now takes place on the first Thursday in July.

A low-impact development project at Tir y Gafel, Glandwr, Pembrokeshire, Lammas Ecovillage, is a collective initiative for nine self-built homes. It was the first such project to obtain planning permission based on a predecessor of what is now the sixth national planning guidance for sustainable rural communities originally proposed by the One Planet Council.

===In popular culture===
* In the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Day of the Devil&quot;, Lammas Day is presented as a Satanic (un)holy day, &quot;the Devil&#x27;s day&quot;.
* Lammas is a prominent plot point in the novel, &quot;Lammas Night&quot; (1983) by Katherine Kurtz.

<text>Longmeadow is a town in Hampden County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 15,853 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Longmeadow was first settled in 1644, and officially incorporated October 17, 1783. The town was originally farmland within the limits of Springfield. It remained relatively pastoral until the street railway was built , when the population tripled over a fifteen-year period. After Interstate 91 was built in the wetlands on the west side of town, population tripled again between 1960 and 1975.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Longmeadow was best known as the site from which Longmeadow brownstone was mined. Several famous American buildings, including Princeton University&#x27;s Neo-Gothic library, are made of Longmeadow brownstone. In 1894, the more populous and industrialized &quot;East Village&quot; portion of the town containing the brownstone quarries split off to become East Longmeadow.

Designed by famed golf course architect Donald Ross in 1922, the Longmeadow Country Club was the proving ground for golf equipment designed and manufactured by the Spalding Co. of Chicopee. Bobby Jones, a consultant for Spalding, was a member in standing at LCC and made a number of his instructional films at LCC in the 1930s.

==Geography==
Longmeadow is located in the western part of the state, just south of the city of Springfield, and is bordered on the west by the Connecticut River and Agawam, to the east by East Longmeadow, and to the south by Enfield, Connecticut. It extends approximately north to south and east to west. It is approximately north of Hartford.

More than 30% of the town is permanent open space. Conservation areas on the west side of town include more than bordering the Connecticut River. The area supports a wide range of wildlife including deer, beaver, wild turkeys, foxes, and eagles. Springfield&#x27;s Forest Park, which at is the largest city park in New England, forms the northern border of the town. The private Twin Hills and public Franconia golf courses, plus town athletic fields and conservation land, cover nearly 2/3 of the eastern border of the town. Two large public parks, the Longmeadow Country Club, and three conservation areas account for the bulk of the remaining formal open space. Almost 20% of the houses in town are in proximity to a &quot;dingle&quot;, a tree-lined steep-sided sandy ravine with a wetland at the bottom that provides a privacy barrier between yards.

Longmeadow has a town common, commonly referred to as &quot;The Green&quot;, located along U.S. Route 5 on the west side of town. It is approximately long. Roughly 100 houses date back before 1900, most of which are in the historic district, are located near the town green. Longmeadow&#x27;s Town Green is a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, and it is surrounded by a number of buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Longmeadow is unique as the town green has maintained its residential purpose and has resisted commercial pressure. The current function as listed by the National Register of Historic Places is domestic and landscape. The current sub-function as listed by the National Register of Historic Places is park and single dwelling. Houses along the photogenic main street (Longmeadow Street) are set back farther than in most towns of similar residential density. The town has three recently remodeled elementary schools, two secondary schools, and one high school. The commercial center of town is an area called &quot;The Longmeadow Shops&quot;, including restaurants and clothing stores.

Williams Middle School and Glenbrook Middle School serve grades 6–8. Longmeadow High School serves all students in the town between grades 9 and 12. The town&#x27;s elementary schools have been recently rebuilt, statements of interest for improvements to the two middle schools and Longmeadow High School were filed with the Massachusetts School Building Authority in 2007. In 2010, the voters of Longmeadow approved a 2.5% budget override to support the construction of a new $78 million high school. The town received an estimated $34 million in state funds to be used towards the new construction The new High School was completed and opened to students on February 26, 2013. After students and faculty had moved into the new school, the demolition of the old school was begun. The demolition was completed by June 2013. The school had its grand opening in September 2013 with both the brand new school and renovated business &amp; administration wing open.

Longmeadow also hosts two private parochial schools, the Lubavitcher Yeshiva Academy (LYA) and St. Mary&#x27;s Academy. LYA was established in 1946 in response to the Greater Springfield Jewish community&#x27;s need for a quality Jewish day school. In 1999, LYA became the first Jewish day school to be accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). The more than 90 students that the school serves each year from across the spectrum of Jewish life include orthodox, conservative, reform, and unaffiliated families. St. Mary&#x27;s Academy, located behind St. Mary&#x27;s Church, serves Catholic students grades Pre-K through Grade 8.

Approximately 50% of the students at Longmeadow High School participate in the music program. The choruses have won numerous gold medals at the MICCA competition. The jazz ensemble has won numerous gold medals as well, but no longer competes. The honors chorus &quot;Lyrics&quot; has won numerous awards and has traveled to many places around the world on tours, such as Italy and Sweden. The wind ensemble and symphony orchestra have had the honor of performing in Indianapolis, Boston (Boston Symphony Hall), and New York (Carnegie Hall). In 2010, Longmeadow was awarded The American Prize in Orchestral Performance. The music program&#x27;s crowning achievement has been receiving three national Grammy Awards based on the high level of excellence maintained throughout all groups in the music program.

Longmeadow is home to the primary campus of Bay Path University, a private undergraduate and graduate institution founded in 1897.

<text>Body relative directions (also known as egocentric coordinates) are geometrical orientations relative to a body such as a human person&#x27;s body or a road sign.
The most common ones are: left and right; forward and backward; up and down.
They form three pairs of orthogonal axes.

==Traditions and conventions==
Since definitions of left and right based on the geometry of the natural environment are unwieldy, in practice, the meaning of relative direction words is conveyed through tradition, acculturation, education, and direct reference. One common definition of up and down uses the gravity of Earth as a frame of reference. Since there is a very noticeable force of gravity acting between the Earth and any other nearby object, down is defined as that direction which an object moves in reference to the Earth when the object is allowed to fall freely. Up is then defined as the opposite direction of down. Another common definition uses a human body, standing upright, as a frame of reference. In that case, up is defined as the direction from feet to head, perpendicular to the surface of the Earth. In most cases, up is a directionally oriented position generally opposite to that of the pull of gravity.
In situations where a common frame of reference is needed, it is most common to use an egocentric view. A simple example is road signage. Another example is stage blocking, where &quot;stage left&quot; &quot;stage right&quot; are, by convention, defined from the point of view of actors facing the audience. &quot;Upstage&quot; and &quot;downstage&quot; do not follow gravity but by convention mean away from and towards the audience. An example of a non-egocentric view is page layout, where the relative terms &quot;upper half&quot; &quot;left margin,&quot; etc. are defined in terms of the observer but employed in reverse for a type compositor, returning to an egocentric view. In medicine and science, where precise definitions are crucial, relative directions (left and right) are the sides of the organism, not those of the observer. The same is true in heraldry, where left and right in a coat of arms is treated as if the shield were being held by the armiger. To avoid confusion, Latin terminology is employed: &quot;dexter&quot; and &quot;sinister&quot; for right and left. Proper right and proper left are terms mainly used to describe artistic images, and overcome the potential confusion that a figure&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; right or &quot;proper right&quot; hand is on the left hand as the viewer sees it from the front.

Forward and backward may be defined by referring to an object&#x27;s or organism&#x27;s motion. Forward is defined as the direction in which the object is moving. Backward is then defined as the opposite direction to forward. Alternatively, &#x27;forward&#x27; may be the direction pointed by the observer&#x27;s nose, defining &#x27;backward&#x27; as the direction from the nose to the sagittal border in the observer&#x27;s skull. With respect to a ship &#x27;forward&#x27; would indicate the relative position of any object lying in the direction the ship is pointing. For symmetrical objects, it is also necessary to define forward and backward in terms of expected direction. Many mass transit trains are built symmetrically with paired control booths, and definitions of forward, backward, left, and right are temporary.

Given significant distance from the magnetic poles, one can figure which hand is which using a magnetic compass and the sun. Facing the sun, before noon, the north pointer of the compass points to the &quot;left&quot; hand. After noon, it points to the &quot;right&quot;.

==Geometry of the natural environment==
 A right-hand rule is one common way to relate three principal directions. For many years a fundamental question in physics was whether a left-hand rule would be equivalent. Many natural structures, including human bodies, follow a certain &quot;handedness&quot;, but it was widely assumed that nature did not distinguish the two possibilities. This changed with the discovery of parity violations in particle physics. If a sample of cobalt-60 atoms is magnetized so that they spin counterclockwise around some axis, the beta radiation resulting from their nuclear decay will be preferentially directed opposite that axis. Since counter-clockwise may be defined in terms of up, forward, and right, this experiment unambiguously differentiates left from right using only natural elements: if they were reversed, or the atoms spun clockwise, the radiation would follow the spin axis instead of being opposite to it.

==Nautical terminology==
Bow, stern, port, starboard, fore and aft are nautical terms that convey an impersonal relative direction in the context of the moving frame of persons aboard a ship. The need for impersonal terms is most clearly seen in a rowing shell where the majority of the crew face aft (&quot;backwards&quot;), hence the oars to their right are actually on the port side of the boat. Rowers eschew the terms left, right, port and starboard in favor of stroke-side and bow-side. The usage derives from the tradition of having the stroke (the rower closest to the stern of the boat) oar on the port side of the boat.

==Cultures without relative directions==
Most human cultures use relative directions for reference, but there are exceptions. Some Australian Aboriginal languages like Guugu Yimithirr, Kayardild and Kuuk Thaayorre have no words denoting the egocentric directions; instead, speakers exclusively refer to cardinal directions, even when describing small-scale spaces. For instance, if they wanted someone to move over on the car seat to make room, they might say &quot;move a bit to the east&quot;. To tell someone where exactly they left something in their house, they might say, &quot;I left it on the southern edge of the western table.&quot; Or they might warn a person to &quot;look out for that big ant just north of your foot&quot;. Other peoples &quot;from Polynesia to Mexico and from Namibia to Bali&quot; similarly have predominantly &quot;geographic languages&quot;. American Sign Language makes heavy use of geographical direction through absolute orientation.

<text>Lizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than snakes (and to a lesser extent amphisbaenians), encompassing over 7,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The grouping is paraphyletic as some lizards are more closely related to snakes than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.

Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as &quot;legless lizards&quot;) have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some lizards, such as the forest-dwelling &quot;Draco&quot;, are able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with bright colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.

Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails.

==Anatomy==

=== Largest and smallest ===

The adult length of species within the suborder ranges from a few centimeters for chameleons such as &quot;Brookesia micra&quot; and geckos such as &quot;Sphaerodactylus ariasae&quot; to nearly in the case of the largest living varanid lizard, the Komodo dragon. Most lizards are fairly small animals.

=== Distinguishing features ===

Lizards typically have rounded torsos, elevated heads on short necks, four limbs and long tails, although some are legless. Lizards and snakes share a movable quadrate bone, distinguishing them from the rhynchocephalians, which have more rigid diapsid skulls. Some lizards such as chameleons have prehensile tails, assisting them in climbing among vegetation.

As in other reptiles, the skin of lizards is covered in overlapping scales made of keratin. This provides protection from the environment and reduces water loss through evaporation. This adaptation enables lizards to thrive in some of the driest deserts on earth. The skin is tough and leathery, and is shed (sloughed) as the animal grows. Unlike snakes which shed the skin in a single piece, lizards slough their skin in several pieces. The scales may be modified into spines for display or protection, and some species have bone osteoderms underneath the scales.

The dentitions of lizards reflect their wide range of diets, including carnivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, nectivorous, and molluscivorous. Species typically have uniform teeth suited to their diet, but several species have variable teeth, such as cutting teeth in the front of the jaws and crushing teeth in the rear. Most species are pleurodont, though agamids and chameleons are acrodont.

The tongue can be extended outside the mouth, and is often long. In the beaded lizards, whiptails and monitor lizards, the tongue is forked and used mainly or exclusively to sense the environment, continually flicking out to sample the environment, and back to transfer molecules to the vomeronasal organ responsible for chemosensation, analogous to but different from smell or taste. In geckos, the tongue is used to lick the eyes clean: they have no eyelids. Chameleons have very long sticky tongues which can be extended rapidly to catch their insect prey.

Three lineages, the geckos, anoles, and chameleons, have modified the scales under their toes to form adhesive pads, highly prominent in the first two groups. The pads are composed of millions of tiny setae (hair-like structures) which fit closely to the substrate to adhere using van der Waals forces; no liquid adhesive is needed. In addition, the toes of chameleons are divided into two opposed groups on each foot (zygodactyly), enabling them to perch on branches as birds do.

==Physiology==
===Locomotion===

Aside from legless lizards, most lizards are quadrupedal and move using gaits with alternating movement of the right and left limbs with substantial body bending. This body bending prevents significant respiration during movement, limiting their endurance, in a mechanism called Carrier&#x27;s constraint. Several species can run bipedally, and a few can prop themselves up on their hindlimbs and tail while stationary. Several small species such as those in the genus &quot;Draco&quot; can glide: some can attain a distance of , losing in height. Some species, like geckos and chameleons, adhere to vertical surfaces including glass and ceilings. Some species, like the common basilisk, can run across water.

===Senses===

Lizards make use of their senses of sight, touch, olfaction and hearing like other vertebrates. The balance of these varies with the habitat of different species; for instance, skinks that live largely covered by loose soil rely heavily on olfaction and touch, while geckos depend largely on acute vision for their ability to hunt and to evaluate the distance to their prey before striking. Monitor lizards have acute vision, hearing, and olfactory senses. Some lizards make unusual use of their sense organs: chameleons can steer their eyes in different directions, sometimes providing non-overlapping fields of view, such as forwards and backwards at once. Lizards lack external ears, having instead a circular opening in which the tympanic membrane (eardrum) can be seen. Many species rely on hearing for early warning of predators, and flee at the slightest sound.

As in snakes and many mammals, all lizards have a specialised olfactory system, the vomeronasal organ, used to detect pheromones. Monitor lizards transfer scent from the tip of their tongue to the organ; the tongue is used only for this information-gathering purpose, and is not involved in manipulating food.

Some lizards, particularly iguanas, have retained a photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the parietal eye, a basal (&quot;primitive&quot;) feature also present in the tuatara. This &quot;eye&quot; has only a rudimentary retina and lens and cannot form images, but is sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement. This helps them detect predators stalking it from above.

===Venom===
Until 2006 it was thought that the Gila monster and the Mexican beaded lizard were the only venomous lizards. However, several species of monitor lizards, including the Komodo dragon, produce powerful venom in their oral glands. Lace monitor venom, for instance, causes swift loss of consciousness and extensive bleeding through its pharmacological effects, both lowering blood pressure and preventing blood clotting. Nine classes of toxin known from snakes are produced by lizards. The range of actions provides the potential for new medicinal drugs based on lizard venom proteins.

Genes associated with venom toxins have been found in the salivary glands of a wide range of lizards, including species traditionally thought of as non-venomous, such as iguanas and bearded dragons. This suggests that these genes evolved in the common ancestor of lizards and snakes, some 200 million years ago (forming a single clade, the Toxicofera). However, most of these putative venom genes were &quot;housekeeping genes&quot; found in all cells and tissues, including skin and cloacal scent glands. The genes in question may thus be evolutionary precursors of venom genes.

===Respiration===
Recent studies (2013 and 2014) on the lung anatomy of the savannah monitor and green iguana found them to have a unidirectional airflow system, which involves the air moving in a loop through the lungs when breathing. This was previously thought to only exist in the archosaurs (crocodilians and birds). This may be evidence that unidirectional airflow is an ancestral trait in diapsids.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

As with all amniotes, lizards rely on internal fertilisation and copulation involves the male inserting one of his hemipenes into the female&#x27;s cloaca. Female lizards also have
hemiclitorises, a doubled
clitoris. The majority of species are oviparous (egg laying). The female deposits the eggs in a protective structure like a nest or crevice or simply on the ground. Depending on the species, clutch size can vary from 4–5 percent of the females body weight to 40–50 percent and clutches range from one or a few large eggs to dozens of small ones. 

In most lizards, the eggs have leathery shells to allow for the exchange of water, although more arid-living species have calcified shells to retain water. Inside the eggs, the embryos use nutrients from the yolk. Parental care is uncommon and the female usually abandons the eggs after laying them. Brooding and protection of eggs do occur in some species. The female prairie skink uses respiratory water loss to maintain the humidity of the eggs which facilitates embryonic development. In lace monitors, the young hatch close to 300 days, and the female returns to help them escape the termite mound where the eggs were laid.

Around 20 percent of lizard species reproduce via viviparity (live birth). This is particularly common in Anguimorphs. Viviparous species give birth to relatively developed young which look like miniature adults. Embryos are nourished via a placenta-like structure. A minority of lizards have parthenogenesis (reproduction from unfertilised eggs). These species consist of all females who reproduce asexually with no need for males. This is known to occur in various species of whiptail lizards. Parthenogenesis was also recorded in species that normally reproduce sexually. A captive female Komodo dragon produced a clutch of eggs, despite being separated from males for over two years.

Sex determination in lizards can be temperature-dependent. The temperature of the eggs&#x27; micro-environment can determine the sex of the hatched young: low temperature incubation produces more females while higher temperatures produce more males. However, some lizards have sex chromosomes and both male heterogamety (XY and XXY) and female heterogamety (ZW) occur.

===Aging===

A significant component of aging in the painted dragon lizard &quot;Ctenophorus pictus&quot; is fading breeding colors. By manipulating superoxide levels (using a superoxide dismutase mimetic) it was shown that this fading coloration is likely due to gradual loss with lizard age of an innate capacity for antioxidation due to increasing DNA damage.

==Behaviour==

===Diurnality and thermoregulation===
The majority of lizard species are active during the day, though some are active at night, notably geckos. As ectotherms, lizards have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature, and must seek out and bask in sunlight to gain enough heat to become fully active. Thermoregulation behavior can be beneficial in the short term for lizards as it allows the ability to buffer environmental variation and endure climate warming.

In high altitudes, the &quot;Podarcis hispaniscus&quot; responds to higher temperature with a darker dorsal coloration to prevent UV-radiation and background matching. Their thermoregulatory mechanisms also allow the lizard to maintain their ideal body temperature for optimal mobility.

===Territoriality===
Most social interactions among lizards are between breeding individuals. Territoriality is common and is correlated with species that use sit-and-wait hunting strategies. Males establish and maintain territories that contain resources that attract females and which they defend from other males. Important resources include basking, feeding, and nesting sites as well as refuges from predators. The habitat of a species affects the structure of territories, for example, rock lizards have territories atop rocky outcrops. Some species may aggregate in groups, enhancing vigilance and lessening the risk of predation for individuals, particularly for juveniles. Agonistic behaviour typically occurs between sexually mature males over territory or mates and may involve displays, posturing, chasing, grappling and biting.

===Communication===
Lizards signal both to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Visual displays include body postures and inflation, push-ups, bright colours, mouth gapings and tail waggings. Male anoles and iguanas have dewlaps or skin flaps which come in various sizes, colours and patterns and the expansion of the dewlap as well as head-bobs and body movements add to the visual signals. Some species have deep blue dewlaps and communicate with ultraviolet signals. Blue-tongued skinks will flash their tongues as a threat display. Chameleons are known to change their complex colour patterns when communicating, particularly during agonistic encounters. They tend to show brighter colours when displaying aggression and darker colours when they submit or &quot;give up&quot;.

Several gecko species are brightly coloured; some species tilt their bodies to display their coloration. In certain species, brightly coloured males turn dull when not in the presence of rivals or females. While it is usually males that display, in some species females also use such communication. In the bronze anole, head-bobs are a common form of communication among females, the speed and frequency varying with age and territorial status. Chemical cues or pheromones are also important in communication. Males typically direct signals at rivals, while females direct them at potential mates. Lizards may be able to recognise individuals of the same species by their scent.

Acoustic communication is less common in lizards. , a typical reptilian sound, is mostly produced by larger species as part of a threat display, accompanying gaping jaws. Some groups, particularly geckos, snake-lizards, and some iguanids, can produce more complex sounds and vocal apparatuses have independently evolved in different groups. These sounds are used for courtship, territorial defense and in distress, and include clicks, squeaks, barks and growls. The mating call of the male tokay gecko is heard as &quot;tokay-tokay!&quot;. Tactile communication involves individuals rubbing against each other, either in courtship or in aggression. Some chameleon species communicate with one another by vibrating the substrate that they are standing on, such as a tree branch or leaf.

===Defence===

Lizards are normally quick and agile to easily outrun attackers.

==Ecology==

===Distribution and habitat===
Lizards are found worldwide, excluding the far north and Antarctica, and some islands. They can be found in elevations from sea level to . They prefer warmer, tropical climates but are adaptable and can live in all but the most extreme environments. Lizards also exploit a number of habitats; most primarily live on the ground, but others may live in rocks, on trees, underground and even in water. The marine iguana is adapted for life in the sea.

===Diet===
The majority of lizard species are predatory and the most common prey items are small, terrestrial invertebrates, particularly insects. Many species are sit-and-wait predators though others may be more active foragers. Chameleons prey on numerous insect species, such as beetles, grasshoppers and winged termites as well as spiders. They rely on persistence and ambush to capture these prey. An individual perches on a branch and stays perfectly still, with only its eyes moving. When an insect lands, the chameleon focuses its eyes on the target and slowly moves toward it before projecting its long sticky tongue which, when hauled back, brings the attached prey with it. Geckos feed on crickets, beetles, termites and moths.

Termites are an important part of the diets of some species of Autarchoglossa, since, as social insects, they can be found in large numbers in one spot. Ants may form a prominent part of the diet of some lizards, particularly among the lacertas. Horned lizards are also well known for specializing on ants. Due to their small size and indigestible chitin, ants must be consumed in large amounts, and ant-eating lizards have larger stomachs than even herbivorous ones. Species of skink and alligator lizards eat snails and their power jaws and molar-like teeth are adapted for breaking the shells.

Larger species, such as monitor lizards, can feed on larger prey including fish, frogs, birds, mammals and other reptiles. Prey may be swallowed whole and torn into smaller pieces. Both bird and reptile eggs may also be consumed as well. Gila monsters and beaded lizards climb trees to reach both the eggs and young of birds. Despite being venomous, these species rely on their strong jaws to kill prey. Mammalian prey typically consists of rodents and leporids; the Komodo dragon can kill prey as large as water buffalo. Dragons are prolific scavengers, and a single decaying carcass can attract several from away. A dragon is capable of consuming a carcass in 17 minutes.

Around 2 percent of lizard species, including many iguanids, are herbivores. Adults of these species eat plant parts like flowers, leaves, stems and fruit, while juveniles eat more insects. Plant parts can be hard to digest, and, as they get closer to adulthood, juvenile iguanas eat faeces from adults to acquire the microflora necessary for their transition to a plant-based diet. Perhaps the most herbivorous species is the marine iguana which dives to forage for algae, kelp and other marine plants. Some non-herbivorous species supplement their insect diet with fruit, which is easily digested.

===Antipredator adaptations===
Lizards have a variety of antipredator adaptations, including running and climbing, venom, camouflage, tail autotomy, and reflex bleeding.

====Camouflage====
Lizards exploit a variety of different camouflage methods. Many lizards are disruptively patterned. In some species, such as Aegean wall lizards, individuals vary in colour, and select rocks which best match their own colour to minimise the risk of being detected by predators. The Moorish gecko is able to change colour for camouflage: when a light-coloured gecko is placed on a dark surface, it darkens within an hour to match the environment. The chameleons in general use their ability to change their coloration for signalling rather than camouflage, but some species such as Smith&#x27;s dwarf chameleon do use active colour change for camouflage purposes.
The flat-tail horned lizard&#x27;s body is coloured like its desert background, and is flattened and fringed with white scales to minimise its shadow.

====Autotomy====

Many lizards, including geckos and skinks, are capable of shedding their tails (autotomy). The detached tail, sometimes brilliantly coloured, continues to writhe after detaching, distracting the predator&#x27;s attention from the fleeing prey. Lizards partially regenerate their tails over a period of weeks. Some 326 genes are involved in regenerating lizard tails. The fish-scale gecko &quot;Geckolepis megalepis &quot; sheds patches of skin and scales if grabbed.

====Escape, playing dead, reflex bleeding====
Many lizards attempt to escape from danger by running to a place of safety; for example, wall lizards can run up walls and hide in holes or cracks. Horned lizards adopt differing defences for specific predators. They may play dead to deceive a predator that has caught them; attempt to outrun the rattlesnake, which does not pursue prey; but stay still, relying on their cryptic coloration, for &quot;Masticophis&quot; whip snakes which can catch even swift prey. If caught, some species such as the greater short-horned lizard puff themselves up, making their bodies hard for a narrow-mouthed predator like a whip snake to swallow. Finally, horned lizards can squirt blood at cat and dog predators from a pouch beneath its eyes, to a distance of about ; the blood tastes foul to these attackers.

==Evolution==

===Fossil history===
The closest living relatives of lizards are rhynchocephalians, a once diverse order of reptiles, of which is there is now only one living species, the tuatara of New Zealand. Some reptiles from the Early and Middle Triassic, like &quot;Sophineta&quot; and &quot;Megachirella&quot;, are suggested to be stem-group squamates, more closely related to modern lizards than rhynchocephalians, however, their position is disputed, with some studies recovering them as less closely related to squamates than rhynchocephalians are. The oldest undisputed lizards date to the Middle Jurassic, from remains found In Europe, Asia and North Africa. Lizard morphological and ecological diversity substantially increased over the course of the Cretaceous. In the Palaeogene, lizard body sizes in North America peaked during the middle of the period.

Mosasaurs likely evolved from an extinct group of aquatic lizards known as aigialosaurs in the Early Cretaceous. Dolichosauridae is a family of Late Cretaceous aquatic varanoid lizards closely related to the mosasaurs.

===Phylogeny===

====External====

The position of the lizards and other Squamata among the reptiles was studied using fossil evidence by Rainer Schoch and Hans-Dieter Sues in 2015. Lizards form about 60% of the extant non-avian reptiles.
====Internal====
Both the snakes and the Amphisbaenia (worm lizards) are clades deep within the Squamata (the smallest clade that contains all the lizards), so &quot;lizard&quot; is paraphyletic.
The cladogram is based on genomic analysis by Wiens and colleagues in 2012 and 2016. Excluded taxa are shown in upper case on the cladogram.

===Taxonomy===
In the 13th century, lizards were recognized in Europe as part of a broad category of &quot;reptiles&quot; that consisted of a miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including &quot;snakes, various fantastic monsters, […], assorted amphibians, and worms&quot;, as recorded by Vincent of Beauvais in his &quot;Mirror of Nature&quot;. The seventeenth century saw changes in this loose description. The name Sauria was coined by James Macartney (1802); it was the Latinisation of the French name &quot;Sauriens&quot;, coined by Alexandre Brongniart (1800) for an order of reptiles in the classification proposed by the author, containing lizards and crocodilians, later discovered not to be each other&#x27;s closest relatives. Later authors used the term &quot;Sauria&quot; in a more restricted sense, i.e. as a synonym of Lacertilia, a suborder of Squamata that includes all lizards but excludes snakes. This classification is rarely used today because Sauria so-defined is a paraphyletic group. It was defined as a clade by Jacques Gauthier, Arnold G. Kluge and Timothy Rowe (1988) as the group containing the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs (the groups containing crocodiles and lizards, as per Mcartney&#x27;s original definition) and all its descendants. A different definition was formulated by Michael deBraga and Olivier Rieppel (1997), who defined Sauria as the clade containing the most recent common ancestor of Choristodera, Archosauromorpha, Lepidosauromorpha and all their descendants. However, these uses have not gained wide acceptance among specialists.

===Convergence===

Lizards have frequently evolved convergently, with multiple groups independently developing similar morphology and ecological niches. &quot;Anolis&quot; ecomorphs have become a model system in evolutionary biology for studying convergence. Limbs have been lost or reduced independently over two dozen times across lizard evolution, including in the Anniellidae, Anguidae, Cordylidae, Dibamidae, Gymnophthalmidae, Pygopodidae, and Scincidae; snakes are just the most famous and species-rich group of Squamata to have followed this path.

==Relationship with humans==

=== Interactions and uses by humans ===
Most lizard species are harmless to humans. Only the largest lizard species, the Komodo dragon, which reaches in length and weighs up to , has been known to stalk, attack, and, on occasion, kill humans. An eight-year-old Indonesian boy died from blood loss after an attack in 2007.

Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including bearded dragons, iguanas, anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko).Monitor lizards such as the savannah monitor and tegus such as the Argentine tegu and red tegu are also kept.

Green iguanas are eaten in Central America, where they are sometimes referred to as &quot;chicken of the tree&quot; after their habit of resting in trees and their supposedly chicken-like taste, while spiny-tailed lizards are eaten in Africa. In North Africa, &quot;Uromastyx&quot; species are considered &quot;dhaab&quot; or &#x27;fish of the desert&#x27; and eaten by nomadic tribes.Lizards such as the Gila monster produce toxins with medical applications. Gila toxin reduces plasma glucose; the substance is now synthesized for use in the anti-diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta). Another toxin from Gila monster saliva has been studied for use as an anti-Alzheimer&#x27;s drug.

=== In culture ===
Lizards appear in myths and folktales around the world. In Australian Aboriginal mythology, Tarrotarro, the lizard god, split the human race into male and female, and gave people the ability to express themselves in art. A lizard king named Mo&#x27;o features in Hawaii and other cultures in Polynesia. In the Amazon, the lizard is the king of beasts, while among the Bantu of Africa, the god UNkulunkulu sent a chameleon to tell humans they would live forever, but the chameleon was held up, and another lizard brought a different message, that the time of humanity was limited. A popular legend in Maharashtra tells the tale of how a common Indian monitor, with ropes attached, was used to scale the walls of the fort in the Battle of Sinhagad. In the Bhojpuri speaking region of India and Nepal, there is a belief among children that, on touching skink&#x27;s tail three (or five) time with the shortest finger gives money.

Lizards in many cultures share the symbolism of snakes, especially as an emblem of resurrection. This may have derived from their regular molting. The motif of lizards on Christian candle holders probably alludes to the same symbolism. According to Jack Tresidder, in Egypt and the Classical world, they were beneficial emblems, linked with wisdom. In African, Aboriginal and Melanesian folklore they are linked to cultural heroes or ancestral figures.

* Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), sixteenth president of the United States. He never joined any church and has been described as a &quot;Christian deist&quot;. As a young man, he was religiously skeptical and sometimes ridiculed revivalists. During his early years, Lincoln enjoyed reading the works of deists such as Thomas Paine and Voltaire. He drafted a pamphlet incorporating such ideas but did not publish it. After charges of hostility to Christianity almost cost him a congressional bid, he kept his unorthodox beliefs private. James Adams labelled Lincoln as a deist. In 1834, he reportedly wrote a manuscript essay challenging Christianity modelled on Paine&#x27;s book &quot;The Age of Reason&quot;, which a friend supposedly burned to protect him from ridicule.

<text>The Book of Leviticus (, from , ; , , &#x27;And He called&#x27;; ) is the third book of the Torah (the Pentateuch) and of the Old Testament, also known as the Third Book of Moses. Many hypotheses presented by scholars as to its origins agree that it developed over a long period of time, reaching its present form during the Persian Period, from 538 to 332 BC, although this is disputed.

Most of its chapters (1–7, 11–27) consist of God&#x27;s speeches to Moses, which he tells Moses to repeat to the Israelites. This takes place within the story of the Israelites&#x27; Exodus after they escaped Egypt and reached Mount Sinai (Exodus 19:1). The Book of Exodus narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the Tabernacle (Exodus 35–40) with God&#x27;s instructions (Exodus 25–31). In Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests, Aaron and his sons, how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary. Leviticus takes place during the month or month-and-a-half between the completion of the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the Israelites&#x27; departure from Sinai (Numbers 1:1, 10:11).

The instructions of Leviticus emphasize ritual, legal, and moral practices rather than beliefs. Nevertheless, they reflect the world view of the creation story in Genesis 1 that God wishes to live with humans. The book teaches that faithful performance of the sanctuary rituals can make that possible, so long as the people avoid sin and impurity whenever possible. The rituals, especially the sin and guilt offerings, provide the means to gain forgiveness for sins (Leviticus 4–5) and purification from impurities (Leviticus 11–16) so that God can continue to live in the Tabernacle in the midst of the people.

== Title ==

The English name Leviticus comes from the Latin , which is in turn from the (), referring to the priestly tribe of the Israelites, &#x27;Levi&#x27;. The Greek expression is in turn a variant of the rabbinic Hebrew , &#x27;law of priests&#x27;, as many of its laws relate to priests.

In Hebrew the book is called (), from the opening of the book, &quot;And He God] called.&quot;

==Summary==
Chapters 1–5 describe the various sacrifices from the sacrificers&#x27; point of view, although the priests are essential for handling the blood. Chapters 6–7 go over much the same ground, but from the point of view of the priest, who, as the one actually carrying out the sacrifice and dividing the &quot;portions&quot;, needs to know how to do it. Sacrifices are between God, the priest, and the offers, although in some cases the entire sacrifice is a single portion to God—i.e., burnt to ashes.

Chapters 8–10 describe how Moses consecrates Aaron and his sons as the first priests, the first sacrifices, and God&#x27;s destruction of two of Aaron&#x27;s sons for ritual offenses. The purpose is to underline the character of altar priesthood (i.e., those priests with power to offer sacrifices to God) as an Aaronite privilege, and the responsibilities and dangers of their position.

With sacrifice and priesthood established, chapters 11–15 instruct the lay people on purity (or cleanliness). Eating certain animals produces uncleanliness, as does giving birth; certain skin diseases (but not all) are unclean, as are certain conditions affecting walls and clothing (mildew and similar conditions); and unusual bodily discharges, including female menses and male emissions (gonorrhea), are unclean. The reasoning behind the food rules are obscure; for the rest the guiding principle seems to be that all these conditions involve a loss of &quot;life force&quot;, usually but not always blood.

Chapter 16 concerns the Day of Atonement (though that phrase appears first in 23:27). This is the only day on which the High Priest is to enter the holiest part of the sanctuary, the holy of holies. He is to sacrifice a bull for the sins of the priests, and a goat for the sins of the laypeople. The priest is to send a second goat into the desert to &quot;Azazel&quot;, bearing the sins of the whole people. Azazel&#x27;s identity is unknown, with some Christian tradition linking him to a fallen angel, older English Bible translations like the King James Version translating it as &quot;a scapegoat&quot;.

Chapters 17–26 are the Holiness code. It begins with a prohibition on all unauthorized ritual slaughter of animals, and then prohibits a long list of sexual contacts and also child sacrifice. The &quot;holiness&quot; injunctions which give the code its name begin with the next section: there are penalties for the worship of Molech, consulting mediums and wizards, cursing one&#x27;s parents and engaging in unlawful sex. Priests receive instruction on mourning rituals and acceptable bodily defects. The punishment for blasphemy is death, and there is the setting of rules for eating sacrifices; there is an explanation of the calendar, and there are rules for sabbatical and Jubilee years; there are rules for oil lamps and bread in the sanctuary; and there are rules for slavery. The code ends by telling the Israelites they must choose between the law and prosperity on the one hand, or, on the other, horrible punishments, the worst of which will be expulsion from the land.

Chapter 27 is a disparate and probably late addition telling about persons and things serving as dedication to the Lord and how one can redeem, instead of fulfill, vows.

==Composition==
The majority of scholars have concluded that the Pentateuch received its final form during the Persian period (538–332 BC). Nevertheless, Leviticus had a long period of growth before reaching that form.

The entire composition of the book of Leviticus is Priestly literature. Most scholars see chapters 1–16 (the Priestly code) and chapters 17–26 (the Holiness code) as the work of two related schools, but while the Holiness material employs the same technical terms as the Priestly code, it broadens their meaning from pure ritual to the theological and moral, turning the ritual of the Priestly code into a model for the relationship of Israel to Yahweh: as the tabernacle, which is apart from uncleanliness, becomes holy by the presence of Yahweh, so he will dwell among Israel when Israel receives purification (becomes holy) and separates from other peoples. The ritual instructions in the Priestly code apparently grew from priests giving instruction and answering questions about ritual matters; the Holiness code (or H) used to be a separate document, later becoming part of Leviticus, but it seems better to think of the Holiness authors as editors who worked with the Priestly code and actually produced Leviticus as is now extant.

== Themes ==

===Sacrifice and ritual===
Many scholars argue that the rituals of Leviticus have a theological meaning concerning Israel&#x27;s relationship with its God. Jacob Milgrom was especially influential in spreading this view. He maintained that the priestly regulations in Leviticus expressed a rational system of theological thought. The writers expected them to be put into practice in Israel&#x27;s temple, so the rituals would express this theology as well, as well as ethical concern for the poor. Milgrom also argued that the book&#x27;s purity regulations (chapters 11–15) have a basis in ethical thinking. Many other interpreters have followed Milgrom in exploring the theological and ethical implications of Leviticus&#x27;s regulations (e.g., Marx, Balentine), though some have questioned how systematic they really are. Ritual, therefore, is not taking a series of actions for their own sake, but a means of maintaining the relationship between God, the world, and humankind.

===Kehuna (Jewish priesthood)===
The main function of the priests is service at the altar, and only the sons of Aaron are priests in the full sense. (Ezekiel also distinguishes between altar-priests and lower Levites, but in Ezekiel the altar-priests are sons of Zadok instead of sons of Aaron; many scholars see this as a remnant of struggles between different priestly factions in First Temple times, finding resolution by the Second Temple into a hierarchy of Aaronite altar-priests and lower-level Levites, including singers, gatekeepers and the like.)

In chapter 10, God kills Nadab and Abihu, the oldest sons of Aaron, for offering &quot;strange incense&quot;. Aaron has two sons left. Commentators have read various messages in the incident: a reflection of struggles between priestly factions in the post-Exilic period (Gerstenberger); or a warning against offering incense outside the Temple, where there might be the risk of invoking strange gods (Milgrom). In any case, there has been a pollution of the sanctuary by the bodies of the two dead priests, leading into the next theme, holiness.

===Uncleanliness and purity===
Ritual purity is essential for an Israelite to be able to approach Yahweh and remain part of the community. Uncleanliness threatens holiness; chapters 11–15 review the various causes of uncleanliness and describe the rituals which will restore cleanliness; one is to maintain cleanliness through observation of the rules on sexual behaviour, family relations, land ownership, worship, sacrifice, and observance of holy days.

Yahweh dwells with Israel in the Tabernacle. All of the priestly ritual focuses on Yahweh and the construction and maintenance of a holy space, but sin generates impurity, as do everyday events such as childbirth and menstruation; impurity pollutes the holy dwelling place. Failure to purify the sacred space ritually could result in God&#x27;s leaving, which would be disastrous.

=== Infectious diseases in chapter 13 ===
In chapter 13, God instructs Moses and Aaron on how to identify infectious diseases and deal with them accordingly. The translators and interpreters of the Hebrew Bible in various languages have never reached a consensus on these infectious diseases, or (), and the translation and interpretation of the scriptures are not known for certain. The most common translation is that these infectious diseases are leprosy; however, what is described in chapter 13 does not represent a typical manifestation of leprosy. Modern dermatology shows that many of the infectious diseases in chapter 13 were likely dermatophytoses, a group of highly contagious skin diseases.

The infectious disease of the chin described in verses 29–37 seems to be Tinea barbae in men or Tinea faciei in women; the infectious disease described in verses 29–37 (as resulting in hair loss and eventual baldness) seems to be Tinea capitis (Favus). Verses 1–17 seem to describe Tinea corporis.

The Hebrew word in verses 38–39 is translated as &#x27;tetter&#x27; or &#x27;freckles&#x27;, likely because translators did not know what it meant at the time, and thus, translated it incorrectly. Later translations identify it as talking about vitiligo; however, vitiligo is not an infectious disease. The disease, described as healing itself and leaving white patches after infection, is likely to be pityriasis versicolor (tinea versicolor). &quot;Tetter&quot; originally referred to an outbreak, which later evolved meaning ringworm-like lesions. Therefore, a common name for Tinea pedis (athlete&#x27;s foot) was Cantlie&#x27;s foot tetter. In addition, verses 18–23 describe infections after scald, and verses 24–28 describe infections after burn.

===Atonement===
Through sacrifice, the priest &quot;makes atonement&quot; for sin and the offeror receives forgiveness (but only if Yahweh accepts the sacrifice). Atonement rituals involve the pouring or sprinkling of blood as the symbol of the life of the victim: the blood has the power to wipe out or absorb the sin. The two-part division of the book structurally reflects the role of atonement: chapters 1–16 call for the establishment of the institution for atonement, and chapters 17–27 call for the life of the atoned community in holiness.

===Holiness===
The consistent theme of chapters 17–26 is in the repetition of the phrase, &quot;Be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.&quot; Holiness in ancient Israel and the Hebrew Bible had a different meaning than in contemporary usage: it might have been regarded as the essence of Yahweh, an invisible but physical and potentially dangerous force. Specific objects, or even days, can be holy, but they derive holiness from being connected with Yahweh—the seventh day, the tabernacle, and the priests all derive their holiness from him. As a result, Israel had to maintain its own holiness in order to live safely alongside God.

The need for holiness is for the possession of the Promised Land (Canaan), where the Jews will become a holy people: &quot;You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt where you dwelt, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you[...] You shall do my ordinances and keep my statutes[...] I am the Lord, your God.&quot; (Leviticus 18:3).

== Subsequent tradition ==
Leviticus, as part of the Torah, became the law book of Jerusalem&#x27;s Second Temple as well as of the Samaritan temple. Its influence is evident among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which included fragments of seventeen manuscripts of Leviticus dating from the 3rd to the 1st centuries BC. Many other Qumran scrolls cite the book, especially the Temple Scroll and 4QMMT.

Jews and Christians have not observed Leviticus&#x27;s instructions for animal offerings since the 1st century AD, following the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD. As there was no longer a Temple at which to offer animal sacrifices, Judaism pivoted towards prayer and the study of the Torah, eventually giving rise to Rabbinic Judaism. Nevertheless, Leviticus constitutes a major source of Jewish law and is traditionally the first book children learn in the Rabbinic system of education. There are two main Midrashim on Leviticus—the halakhic one (Sifra) and a more aggadic one (Vayikra Rabbah).

The New Testament, particularly the Epistle to the Hebrews, uses ideas and images from Leviticus to describe Jesus as the high priest who offers his own blood as a sin offering. Therefore, Christians do not make animal offerings either, because as Gordon Wenham summarized: &quot;With the death of Christ the only sufficient &#x27;burnt offering&#x27; was offered once and for all, and therefore the animal sacrifices which foreshadowed Christ&#x27;s sacrifice were made obsolete.&quot;

Christians generally have the view that the New Covenant supersedes the Old Testament&#x27;s ritual laws, which includes some of the rules in Leviticus. Christians, therefore, do not usually follow Leviticus&#x27; rules regarding diet purity, and agriculture. Christian teachings have differed, however, as to where to draw the line between ritual and moral regulations. In &quot;Homilies on Leviticus&quot;, the third century theologian, Origen, expounded on the qualities of priests as models for Christians to be perfect in everything, strict, wise and to examine themselves individually, forgive sins, and convert sinners (by words and by doctrine).

<doc id="18188" wikidata="Q207544" url="?curid=18188" title="L. Frank Baum">
<text>Lyman Frank Baum (; May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children&#x27;s fantasy books, particularly &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, part of a series. In addition to the 14 &quot;Oz&quot; books, Baum penned 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the 1939 adaptation of the first &quot;Oz&quot; book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema.

Born and raised in Chittenango, New York, Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright. He and his wife opened a store in South Dakota and he edited and published a newspaper. They then moved to Chicago, where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children&#x27;s literature, coming out with the first &quot;Oz&quot; book in 1900. While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a film studio focused on children&#x27;s films in Los Angeles, California.

His works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (&quot;The Master Key&quot;), wireless telephones (&quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (&quot;Mary Louise in the Country&quot;), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (&quot;Aunt Jane&#x27;s Nieces at Work&quot;).

==Childhood and early life==
Baum was born in Chittenango, New York, in 1856 into a devout Methodist family. He had German, Scots-Irish, and English ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (née Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood. &quot;Lyman&quot; was the name of his father&#x27;s brother (Lyman Spaulding Baum), but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name &quot;Frank&quot;.

His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, oil drilling in Pennsylvania, and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents&#x27; expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise. Rose Lawn was located in Mattydale, New York. Baum was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two years at Peekskill Military Academy, but after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly psychogenic heart attack and was allowed to return home.

Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap printing press. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of &quot;The Rose Lawn Home Journal&quot;. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they gave to family and friends for free. By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called &quot;The Stamp Collector&quot;, printed an 11-page pamphlet called &quot;Baum&#x27;s Complete Stamp Dealers&#x27; Directory&quot;, and started a stamp dealership with friends.

At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding poultry. He specialized in raising the Hamburg chicken. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, &quot;The Poultry Record&quot; and, in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: &quot;The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs&quot;.

Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the Fourth of July memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and fireworks filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. Christmas was even more festive. Baum dressed as Santa Claus for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.

==Career==
===Theater===
Baum embarked on his lifetime infatuation—and wavering financial success—with the theater. A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way. Disillusioned, Baum left the theater—temporarily—and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law&#x27;s dry goods company in Syracuse. This experience may have influenced his story &quot;The Suicide of Kiaros&quot;, first published in the literary journal &quot;The White Elephant&quot;. A fellow clerk one day had been found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide.

Baum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks. In 1880, his father built him a theater in Richburg, New York, and Baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them. &quot;The Maid of Arran&quot; proved a modest success, a melodrama with songs based on William Black&#x27;s novel &quot;A Princess of Thule&quot;. Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical musical, as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character&#x27;s aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and operettas.

On November 9, 1882, Baum married Maud Gage, a daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, a famous women&#x27;s suffrage and feminist activist. A local newspaper reported that their ceremony was &quot;one of equality&quot; and that their marriage vows were &quot;precisely the same.&quot; While Baum was touring with &quot;The Maid of Arran&quot;, the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum&#x27;s ironically titled parlor drama &quot;Matches&quot;, destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum&#x27;s scripts, including &quot;Matches&quot;, as well as costumes.

===The South Dakota years===
In July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to Aberdeen, Dakota Territory where he opened a store called &quot;Baum&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store, so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper &quot;The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer&quot; where he wrote the column &quot;Our Landlady&quot;. Following the death of Sitting Bull at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum recommended the wholesale extermination of all America&#x27;s native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below). It is unclear whether Baum meant it as a satire or not, especially since his mother-in-law Matilda Joslyn Gage received an honorary adoption into the Wolf Clan of the Mohawk Nation and was a fierce defender of Native American rights, but on January 3, 1891, he returned to the subject in an editorial response to the Wounded Knee Massacre:

The Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries, we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.

Baum&#x27;s description of Kansas in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; is based on his experiences in drought-ridden South Dakota. During much of this time, his mother-in-law was living in the Baum household. While Baum was in South Dakota, he sang in a quartet which included James Kyle, who became one of the first Populist (People&#x27;s Party) senators in the U.S.

===Writing===

Baum&#x27;s newspaper failed in 1891, and he, Maud, and their four sons moved to the Humboldt Park section of Chicago, where Baum took a job reporting for the &quot;Evening Post&quot;. 
Beginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called &quot;The Show Window&quot;, later known as the &quot;Merchants Record and Show Window&quot;, which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising. The major department stores of the time created elaborate Christmas time fantasies, using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move. The former &quot;Show Window&quot; magazine is still currently in operation, now known as &quot;VMSD&quot; magazine (visual merchandising + store design), based in Cincinnati. 

In 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in drawing customers. He also had to work as a traveling salesman.

In 1897, he wrote and published &quot;Mother Goose in Prose&quot;, a collection of Mother Goose rhymes written as prose stories and illustrated by Maxfield Parrish. &quot;Mother Goose&quot; was a moderate success and allowed Baum to quit his sales job (which had had a negative impact on his health). In 1899, Baum partnered with illustrator W. W. Denslow to publish &quot;Father Goose, His Book&quot;, a collection of nonsense poetry. The book was a success, becoming the best-selling children&#x27;s book of the year.

====&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;====
In 1900, Baum and Denslow (with whom he shared the copyright) published &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; to much critical acclaim and financial success. The book was the best-selling children&#x27;s book for two years after its initial publication. Baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the Land of Oz.

====&quot;The Wizard of Oz: Fred R. Hamlin&#x27;s Musical Extravaganza&quot;====

Two years after &quot;Wizard&quot; publication, Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer Paul Tietjens and director Julian Mitchell to produce a musical stage version of the book under Fred R. Hamlin. Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; in 1901 and based closely upon the book, but it was rejected. This stage version opened in Chicago in 1902 (the first to use the shortened title &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;), then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use. The stage version starred Anna Laughlin as Dorothy Gale, alongside David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone as the Tin Woodman and Scarecrow respectively, which shot the pair to instant fame.

The stage version differed quite a bit from the book, and was aimed primarily at adults. Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and Pastoria (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Mark Hanna, Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.

Beginning with the success of the stage version, most subsequent versions of the story, including newer editions of the novel, have been titled &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, rather than using the full, original title. In more recent years, restoring the full title has become increasingly common, particularly to distinguish the novel from the Hollywood film.

Baum wrote a new Oz book, &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, with a view to making it into a stage production, which was titled &quot;The Woggle-Bug&quot;, but Montgomery and Stone balked at appearing when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot;, which eventually became &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot;. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well enough to convince producer Oliver Morosco to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&quot;, but this was ultimately realized as a film&quot;.

==Later life and work==
With the success of &quot;Wizard&quot; on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and published &quot;Dot and Tot of Merryland&quot; in 1901. The book was one of Baum&#x27;s weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with John R. Neill on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill&#x27;s art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published &quot;The Oz Toy Book: Cut-outs for the Kiddies&quot; without authorization.

Baum reportedly designed the chandeliers in the Crown Room of the Hotel del Coronado; however, that attribution has yet to be corroborated. Several times during the development of the Oz series, Baum declared that he had written his last Oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands, including &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot; and &quot;Queen Zixi of Ix&quot;. However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with &quot;The Master Key&quot; appearing on &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;&#x27;s survey of readers&#x27; favorite books well into the 1920s.

In 1905, Baum declared plans for an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying &quot;Pedloe Island&quot; off the coast of California to turn it into an Oz park. However, there is no evidence that he purchased such an island, and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles Pedloe in that area. Nevertheless, Baum stated to the press that he had discovered a Pedloe Island off the coast of California and that he had purchased it to be &quot;the Marvelous Land of Oz,&quot; intending it to be &quot;a fairy paradise for children.&quot; Eleven-year-old Dorothy Talbot of San Francisco was reported to be ascendant to the throne on March 1, 1906, when the Palace of Oz was expected to be completed. Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E. Baum abandoned his Oz park project after the failure of &quot;The Woggle-Bug&quot;, which was playing at the Garrick Theatre in 1905.
Because of his lifelong love of theatre, he financed elaborate musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum&#x27;s worst financial endeavors was his &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot; (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum as if he were giving a travelogue to Oz. However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum&#x27;s newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. He claimed bankruptcy in August 1911. However, Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud&#x27;s name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children&#x27;s books, such as the fairy tales of Andrew Lang, whose portrait he kept in his study)—all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much less than he could have.

Baum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-Oz books. They include:
* Edith Van Dyne (the &quot;Aunt Jane&#x27;s Nieces&quot; series)
* Laura Bancroft (&quot;The Twinkle Tales&quot;, &quot;Policeman Bluejay&quot;)
* Floyd Akers (&quot;The Boy Fortune Hunters&quot; series, continuing the &quot;Sam Steele&quot; series)
* Suzanne Metcalf (&quot;Annabel&quot;)
* Schuyler Staunton (&quot;The Fate of a Crown&quot;, &quot;Daughters of Destiny&quot;)
* John Estes Cooke (&quot;Tamawaca Folks&quot;)
* Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald (the &quot;Sam Steele&quot; series)

Baum also anonymously wrote &quot;The Last Egyptian: A Romance of the Nile&quot;. He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman&#x27;s men&#x27;s social group The Uplifters, for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations. He also wrote the group&#x27;s parodic by-laws. The group also included Will Rogers, but was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent. Many of these play&#x27;s titles are known, but only &quot;The Uplift of Lucifer&quot; is known to survive (it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s). Prior to that, his last produced play was &quot;The Tik-Tok Man of Oz&quot; (based on &quot;Ozma of Oz&quot; and the basis for &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;), a modest success in Hollywood that producer Oliver Morosco decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway. Morosco, incidentally, quickly turned to film production, as did Baum.

In 1914, Baum started his own film production company The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters. He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter. The rest of the board consisted of Louis F. Gottschalk, Harry Marston Haldeman, and Clarence R. Rundel. The films were directed by J. Farrell MacDonald, with casts that included Violet MacMillan, Vivian Reed, Mildred Harris, Juanita Hansen, Pierre Couderc, Mai Welles, Louise Emmons, J. Charles Haydon, and early appearances by Harold Lloyd and Hal Roach. Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films (Rosson&#x27;s younger brother Harold Rosson was the cinematographer on &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, released in 1939). After little success probing the unrealized children&#x27;s film market, Baum acknowledged his authorship of &quot;The Last Egyptian&quot; and made a film of it (portions of which are included in &quot;Decasia&quot;), but the Oz name had become box office poison for the time being, and even a name change to Dramatic Feature Films and transfer of ownership to Frank Joslyn Baum did not help. Baum invested none of his own money in the venture, unlike &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot;, but the stress probably took its toll on his health.

==Personal life and death==


On May 5, 1919, Baum suffered a stroke, slipped into a coma and died the following day, nine days before his 63rd birthday. His last words were spoken to his wife during a brief period of lucidity: &quot;Now we can cross the Shifting Sands.&quot; He was buried in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery.

His final Oz book, &quot;Glinda of Oz&quot;, was published on July 10, 1920, a year after his death. The Oz series was continued long after his death by other authors, notably Ruth Plumly Thompson, who wrote an additional twenty-one Oz books.

==Baum&#x27;s beliefs==

===Political===

====Racial views====
During the period of the 1890 Ghost Dance movement and Wounded Knee Massacre, Baum wrote two editorials asserting that the safety of American settlers depended on the wholesale genocide of Native Americans. These editorials were re-published in 1990 by sociologist Robert Venables of Cornell University, who argues that Baum was not using sarcasm. Historian Camilla Townsend, the editor of &quot;American Indian History: A Documentary Reader&quot;, argued that the editorial was &quot;Against character&quot;, as he had earlier published a piece that criticized the idea of White Americans fearing Native Americans; Townsend stated that she failed to find evidence that Baum was using sarcasm.

The first piece was published on December 20, 1890, five days after the killing of the Lakota Sioux holy man Sitting Bull. The piece opined that with Sitting Bull&#x27;s death, &quot;the nobility of the Redskin&quot; had been extinguished, and the safety of the frontier would not be established until there was &quot;total annihilation&quot; of the remaining Native Americans, who, he claimed, lived as &quot;miserable wretches.&quot; Baum said that their extermination should not be regretted, and their elimination would &quot;do justice to the manly characteristics&quot; of their ancestors.

The Wounded Knee Massacre occurred nine days later; the second editorial was published on January 3, 1891. Baum alleged that General Nelson A. Miles&#x27; weak rule on the Native Americans had caused American soldiers to suffer a &quot;terrible loss of blood&quot;, in a &quot;battle&quot; which had been a disgrace to the Department of War. He found that the &quot;disaster&quot; could have easily been prevented with proper preparations. Baum reiterated that he believed, due to the history of mistreatment of Native Americans, that the extermination of the &quot;untamed and untamable&quot; tribes was necessary to protect American settlers. Baum ended the editorial with the following anecdote: &quot;An eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that &#x27;when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.&#x27;&quot;

In 2006, two descendants of Baum apologized to the Sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had caused.

The short story &quot;The Enchanted Buffalo&quot; claims to be a legend about a tribe of bison, and it states that a key element of it made it into the legends of Native American tribes. Baum mentions his characters&#x27; distaste for a Hopi snake dance in &quot;Aunt Jane&#x27;s Nieces and Uncle John&quot;, but he also deplores the horrible situation which exists on Native American reservations. &quot;Aunt Jane&#x27;s Nieces on the Ranch&quot; features a hard-working Mexican in order to disprove Anglo-American stereotypes which portray Mexicans as lazy. Baum&#x27;s mother-in-law and woman&#x27;s suffrage leader Matilda Joslyn Gage strongly influenced his views. Gage was initiated into the Wolf Clan and admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons in recognition of her outspoken respect and sympathy for the Native American people.

====Women&#x27;s suffrage advocate====
When Baum lived in Aberdeen, South Dakota, where he was secretary of its Equal Suffrage Club, much of the politics in the Republican &quot;Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer&quot; dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for women&#x27;s suffrage. Susan B. Anthony visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women&#x27;s enfranchisement.

Sally Roesch Wagner of The Matilda Joslyn Gage Foundation published &quot;The Wonderful Mother of Oz&quot;, describing how Matilda Gage&#x27;s feminist politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Some of Baum&#x27;s contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;. In this story, General Jinjur leads the girls and women of Oz in a revolt, armed with knitting needles; they succeed and make the men do the household chores. Jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler, but Princess Ozma, who advocates gender equality, is ultimately placed on the throne. Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s 1915 classic of feminist science fiction, &quot;Herland&quot;, bears strong similarities to &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot; (1910); the link between Baum and Gilman is considered to be Gage. Baum&#x27;s stories outside of Oz also contain feminist or egalitarian themes. His Edith Van Dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities, including &quot;Aunt Jane&#x27;s Nieces&quot; and &quot;The Flying Girl&quot; and its sequel. The Bluebird Books feature a girl sleuth.

====Political imagery in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;====
Numerous political references to the &quot;Wizard&quot; appeared early in the 20th century. Henry Littlefield, an upstate New York high school history teacher, wrote a scholarly article in 1964, the first full-fledged interpretation of the novel as an extended metaphor of the politics and characters of the 1890s. He paid special attention to the Populist metaphors and debates over silver and gold. He published a poem in support of William McKinley.

Since 1964, many scholars, economists, and historians have expanded on Littlefield&#x27;s interpretation, pointing to multiple similarities between the characters (especially as depicted in Denslow&#x27;s illustrations) and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period. Littlefield wrote to &quot;The New York Times&quot; letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact, but that his original point was &quot;not to label Baum, or to lessen any of his magic, but rather, as a history teacher at Mount Vernon High School, to invest turn-of-the-century America with the imagery and wonder I have always found in his stories.&quot;

Baum&#x27;s newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s, and Denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children&#x27;s books. A series of political references is included in the 1902 stage version, such as references to the President, to a powerful senator, and to John D. Rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the Tin Woodman. Scholars have found few political references in Baum&#x27;s Oz books after 1902. Baum was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings, but he always replied that they were written to &quot;please children&quot;.

===Literary===
Baum&#x27;s avowed intentions with the Oz books and his other fairy tales was to retell tales such as those which are found in the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, remake them in an American vein, update them, omit stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. His first Oz books contained a fair amount of violence, but the amount of it decreased as the series progressed; in &quot;The Emerald City of Oz&quot;, Ozma objects to the use of violence, even to the use of violence against the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginning of the sanitization of children&#x27;s stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.

Another traditional element that Baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on romance. He considered romantic love to be uninteresting to young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the only elements of romance lay in the background of the Tin Woodman and his love for Nimmie Amee, which explains his condition but does not affect the tale in any other way, and the background of Gayelette and the enchantment of the winged monkeys. The only other stories with such elements were &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; and &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;; both of them were based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.

===Religion===
Baum was originally a Methodist, but he joined the Episcopal Church in Aberdeen in order to participate in community theatricals. Later, he and his wife were encouraged to become members of the Theosophical Society in 1892 by Matilda Joslyn Gage. Baum&#x27;s beliefs are frequently reflected in his writings; however, the only mention of a church in his Oz books is the porcelain one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. The Baums sent their older sons to &quot;Ethical Culture Sunday School&quot; in Chicago, which taught morality, not religion.

Writers including Evan I. Schwartz among others have suggested that Baum intentionally used allegory and symbolism in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; to convey concepts that are central to spiritual teachings such as Theosophy and Buddhism. They postulate that the main characters&#x27; experiences in Oz represent the soul&#x27;s journey toward enlightenment. Schwartz specifically states that key plot elements of the book take &quot;the reader on a journey guided by Eastern philosophy&quot; (Schwartz, p. 265). An article in BBC Culture lists several allegorical interpretations of the book including that it may be viewed as a parable of Theosophy. The article cites various symbols and their possible meanings, for example the Yellow Brick Road representing the &#x27;Golden Path&#x27; in Buddhism, along which the soul travels to a state of spiritual realization.

Baum&#x27;s own writing suggests he believed the story may have been divinely inspired: &quot;It was pure inspiration. It came to me right out of the blue. I think that sometimes the Great Author had a message to get across and He was to use the instrument at hand&quot;.

==Legacy and popular culture ==
* A 1970 episode of the long-running American Western anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; presents a highly romanticized portrayal of Baum&#x27;s time in South Dakota. The comedic teleplay, titled &quot;The Wizard of Aberdeen&quot;, stars Conlan Carter as Baum and Beverlee McKinsey as Maud. Although the 30-minute presentation touches on Baum&#x27;s family life and his struggles in Aberdeen as a newspaper editor, it focuses principally on his storytelling to local children about characters in a distant land he initially refers to as &quot;Ooz&quot;.
*John Ritter portrayed Baum in the television film &quot;The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story&quot; (1990).
*Jeffrey Combs portrays a highly fictionalized L. Frank Baum, depicted as a farmer from Kansas in the 1890s, in a flashback subplot in &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot; (2011).
*Zach Braff plays Frank Baum, part owner of Oscar Diggs&#x27; circus in 1905, in &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; (2013). While named in tribute to the author, the character is not actually meant to be him.
* The theme park Storybook Land, located in Aberdeen, South Dakota, features the Land of Oz, with characters and attractions from the books.
*In 2013, Baum was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.
* &quot;The Woodsman&quot;, a 2012 stage play by Edward W. Hardy, tells the backstory of the Tin Man, using puppetry, movement, and music. The play has received multiple Off-Broadway productions, critical praise for Hardy&#x27;s music, and won a 2016 Obie Award for Ortiz&#x27;s puppet design.

<doc id="18189" wikidata="Q15288" url="?curid=18189" title="Lake Ladoga">
<text>Lake Ladoga is a freshwater lake located in the Republic of Karelia and Leningrad Oblast in northwestern Russia, in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg.

It is the largest lake located entirely in Europe, the second largest lake in Russia after Lake Baikal, and the 14th largest freshwater lake by area in the world. It is comparable in size to Lake Ontario. &quot;Ladoga Lacus&quot;, a methane lake on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, is named after the lake.

==Etymology==
In one of Nestor&#x27;s chronicles from the 12th century a lake called &quot;the Great Nevo&quot; is mentioned, a clear link to the Neva River and possibly further to Finnish &quot;nevo&quot; &#x27;sea&#x27; or &quot;neva&quot; &#x27;bog, quagmire&#x27;.

Ancient Norse sagas and Hanseatic treaties both mention a city made of lakes named Old Norse &quot;Aldeigja&quot; or &quot;Aldoga&quot;. Since the beginning of the 14th century this hydronym was commonly known as &quot;Ladoga&quot;. According to T. N. Jackson, it can be taken &quot;almost for granted that the name of Ladoga first referred to the river, then the city, and only then the lake&quot;. Therefore, he considers the primary hydronym Ladoga to originate in the eponymous inflow to the lower reaches of the Volkhov River whose early Finnic name was &quot;Alodejoki&quot; (corresponding to modern ) &#x27;river of the lowlands&#x27;.

The Germanic toponym (&quot;Aldeigja&quot; ~ &quot;Aldoga&quot;) was soon borrowed by the Slavic population and transformed by means of the Old East Slavic metathesis &quot;ald- → lad-&quot; to . The Old Norse intermediary word between Finnish and Old East Slavic word is fully supported by archeology, since the Scandinavians first appeared in Ladoga in the early 750s, that is, a couple of decades before the Slavs.

Other hypotheses about the origin of the name derive it from &#x27;wave&#x27; and &#x27;wavy&#x27;, or from the Russian dialectal word алодь, meaning &#x27;open lake, extensive water field&#x27;. Eugene Helimski by contrast, offers an etymology rooted in German. In his opinion, the primary name of the lake was &#x27;old source&#x27;, associated to the open sea, in contrast to the name of the Neva River (flowing from Lake Ladoga) which would derive from the German expression for &#x27;the new&#x27;. Through the intermediate form &quot;*Aldaugja&quot;, came about, referring to the city of Ladoga.

==Geography==

The lake has an average surface area of 17,891 km2 (excluding the islands), slightly larger than Kuwait. Its north-to-south length is 219 km and its average width is 83 km; the average depth is 47 m, although it reaches a maximum of 230 m in the north-western part. Basin area: 276,000 km2, volume: 837 km3 (earlier estimated as 908 km3). There are around 660 islands, with a total area of about 435 km2. Ladoga is, on average, 5 m above sea level. Most of the islands, including the famous Valaam archipelago, Kilpola and Konevets, are situated in the northwest of the lake.

Separated from the Baltic Sea by the Karelian Isthmus, it drains into the Gulf of Finland via the Neva River.

Lake Ladoga is navigable, being a part of the Volga–Baltic Waterway connecting the Baltic Sea with the Volga River. The Ladoga Canal bypasses the lake in the south, connecting the Neva to the Svir.

The basin of Lake Ladoga includes about 50,000 lakes and 3,500 rivers longer than 10 km. About 85% of the water inflow is due to tributaries, 13% is due to precipitation, and 2% is due to underground waters.

==Geological history==
Geologically, the Lake Ladoga depression is a graben and syncline structure of Proterozoic age (Precambrian). This &quot;Ladoga–Pasha structure&quot;, as it is known, hosts Jotnian sediments. During the Pleistocene glaciations the depression was partially stripped of its sedimentary rock fill by glacial overdeepening. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 17,000 years BP, the lake served likely as a channel that concentrated ice of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet into an ice stream that fed glacier lobes further east.

Deglaciation following the Weichselian glaciation took place in the Lake Ladoga basin between 12,500 and 11,500 radiocarbon years BP. Lake Ladoga was initially part of the Baltic Ice Lake (70–80 m. above present sea level), a historical freshwater stage of Baltic Sea. It is possible, though not certain, that Ladoga was isolated from it during regression of the subsequent Yoldia Sea brackish stage (10,200–9,500 BP). The isolation threshold should be at Heinjoki to the east of Vyborg, where the Baltic Sea and Ladoga were connected by a strait or a river outlet at least until the formation of the River Neva, and possibly even much later, until the 12th century AD or so.

At 9,500 BP, Lake Onega, previously draining into the White Sea, started emptying into Ladoga via the River Svir. Between 9,500 and 9,100 BP, during the transgression of Ancylus Lake, the next freshwater stage of the Baltic, Ladoga certainly became part of it, even if they hadn&#x27;t been connected immediately before. During the Ancylus Lake subsequent regression, around 8,800 BP Ladoga became isolated.

Ladoga slowly transgressed in its southern part due to uplift of the Baltic Shield in the north. It has been hypothesized, but not proven, that waters of the Litorina Sea, the next brackish-water stage of the Baltic, occasionally invaded Ladoga between 7,000 and 5,000 BP. Around 5,000 BP the waters of the Saimaa Lake penetrated Salpausselkä and formed a new outlet, River Vuoksi, entering Lake Ladoga in the northwestern corner and raising its level by 1–2 m.

The River Neva originated when the Ladoga waters at last broke through the threshold at Porogi into the lower portions of Izhora River, then a tributary of the Gulf of Finland, between 4,000 and 2,000 BP. Dating of some sediments in the northwestern part of Lake Ladoga suggests it happened at 3,100 radiocarbon years BP (3,410–3,250 calendar years BP).
==Wildlife==
The Ladoga is rich with fish. 48 forms (species and infra specific taxa) of fish have been encountered in the lake, including roach, carp bream, zander, European perch, ruffe, endemic variety of smelt, two varieties of &quot;Coregonus albula&quot; (vendace), eight varieties of &quot;Coregonus lavaretus&quot;, a number of other Salmonidae as well as, albeit rarely, endangered Atlantic sturgeon (formerly confused with European sea sturgeon). Commercial fishing was once a major industry but has been hurt by overfishing. After the war, between 1945 and 1954, the total annual catch increased and reached a maximum of 4,900 tonnes. However, unbalanced fishery led to the drastic decrease of catch in 1955–1963, sometimes to 1,600 tonnes per year. Trawling has been forbidden in Lake Ladoga since 1956 and some other restrictions were imposed. The situation gradually recovered, and in 1971–1990 the catch ranged between 4,900 and 6,900 tonnes per year, about the same level as the total catch in 1938. Fish farms and recreational fishing are developing.

It has its own endemic ringed seal subspecies known as the Ladoga seal.

Since the beginning of the 1960s Ladoga has become considerably eutrophicated.

Nizhnesvirsky Natural Reserve is situated along the shore of Lake Ladoga immediately to the north of the mouth of the River Svir.

The Ladoga has a population of Arctic char that is genetically close to the chars of Lake Sommen and Lake Vättern in southern Sweden.

== History ==

In the Middle Ages, the lake formed a vital part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Eastern Roman Empire, with the Norse emporium at Staraya Ladoga defending the mouth of the Volkhov since the 8th century. In the course of the Swedish–Novgorodian Wars, the area was disputed between the Novgorod Republic and Sweden. In the early 14th century, the fortresses of Korela (Kexholm) and Oreshek (Nöteborg) were established along the banks of the lake.

During the Russo-Swedish War of 1656–1658, the Swedes deployed several armed vessels (called Lodja) on lake Ladoga to combat the Russians though no large sea battles were fought.

The ancient Valaam Monastery was founded on the island of Valaam, the largest in Lake Ladoga, abandoned between 1611 and 1715, restored in the 18th century, and evacuated to Finland during the Winter War in 1940. In 1989 the monastic activities in the Valaam were resumed. Other historic cloisters in the vicinity are the Konevets Monastery, which sits on the Konevets island, and the Alexander-Svirsky Monastery, which preserves samples of medieval Muscovite architecture.

During the Ingrian War, a fraction of the Ladoga coast was occupied by Sweden. In 1617, by the Treaty of Stolbovo, the northern and western coast was ceded by Russia to Sweden. In 1721, after the Great Northern War, it was restitutioned to Russia by the Treaty of Nystad. In the 18th century, the Ladoga Canal was built to bypass the lake which was prone to winds and storms that destroyed hundreds of cargo ships.

Later, from around 1812–1940 the lake was shared between Finland and Russia. According to the conditions of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty militarization of the lake was severely restricted. However, both Soviet Russia and Finland had flotillas in Ladoga (see also Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment). After the Winter War (1939–40) according to the Moscow Peace Treaty, Ladoga, previously shared with Finland, became an internal basin of the Soviet Union.

During World War II not only Finnish and Soviet, but also German and Italian vessels operated there (see also Naval Detachment K and Regia Marina). Under these circumstances, during much of the Siege of Leningrad (1941–44), Lake Ladoga provided the only access to the besieged city as a section of the eastern shore remained in Soviet hands. Supplies were transported into Leningrad with trucks on winter roads over the ice, the &quot;Road of Life&quot;, and by boat in the summer. After World War II, Finland lost the Karelia region again to the USSR, and all Finnish citizens were evacuated from the ceded territory. Ladoga became an internal Soviet basin once again. The northern shore, Ladoga Karelia with the town of Sortavala, is now part of the Republic of Karelia. The western shore, Karelian Isthmus, became part of Leningrad Oblast.

<text>A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a common ancestor, called the proto-language of that family. The term &quot;family&quot; is a metaphor borrowed from biology, with the tree model used in historical linguistics analogous to a family tree, or to phylogenetic trees of taxa used in evolutionary taxonomy. Linguists thus describe the &quot;daughter languages&quot; within a language family as being &quot;genetically related&quot;. The divergence of a proto-language into daughter languages typically occurs through geographical separation, with different regional dialects of the proto-language undergoing different language changes and thus becoming distinct languages over time. 

One well-known example of a language family is the Romance languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Catalan, and many others, all of which are descended from Vulgar Latin. The Romance family itself is part of the larger Indo-European family, which includes many other languages native to Europe and South Asia, all believed to have descended from a common ancestor known as Proto-Indo-European.

A language family is usually said to contain at least two languages, although language isolates — languages that are not related to any other language — are occasionally referred to as families that contain one language. Inversely, there is no upper bound to the number of languages a family can contain. Some families, such as the Austronesian languages, contain over 1000.

Language families can be identified from shared characteristics amongst languages. Sound changes are one of the strongest pieces of evidence that can be used to identify a genetic relationship because of their predictable and consistent nature, and through the comparative method can be used to reconstruct proto-languages. However, languages can also change through language contact which can falsely suggest genetic relationships. For example, the Mongolic, Tungusic, and Turkic languages share a great deal of similarities that lead several scholars to believe they were related. These supposed relationships were later discovered to be derived through language contact and thus they are not truly related. Eventually though, high amounts of language contact and inconsistent changes will render it essentially impossible to derive any more relationships; even the oldest demonstrable language family, Afroasiatic, is far younger than language itself.

==Major language families==

Estimates of the number of language families in the world may vary widely. According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot; there are 7,151 living human languages distributed in 142 different language families. Lyle Campbell (2019) identifies a total of 406 independent language families, including isolates.

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; 27 (2024) lists the following families that contain at least 1% of the 7,164 known languages in the world:

#Niger–Congo (1,552 languages)
#Austronesian (1,256 languages)
#Trans–New Guinea (481 languages)
#Sino-Tibetan (458 languages)
#Indo-European (454 languages)
#Australian (384 languages)
#Afroasiatic (382 languages)
#Nilo-Saharan (210 languages)
#Otomanguean (179 languages)
#Austroasiatic (167 languages)
#Kra-Dai (91 languages)
#Dravidian (85 languages)
&quot;Glottolog&quot; 5.0 (2024) lists the following as the largest families, of 7,788 languages (other than sign languages, pidgins, and unclassifiable languages):
# Atlantic–Congo (1,410 languages) 
# Austronesian (1,274 languages) 
# Indo-European (586 languages) 
# Sino-Tibetan (514 languages)
# Afroasiatic (381 languages)
# Nuclear Trans–New Guinea (316 languages) 
# Pama–Nyungan (250 languages)
# Otomanguean (181 languages)
# Austroasiatic (158 languages)
# Tai–Kadai (95 languages)
# Dravidian (82 languages)
# Arawakan (77 languages)

Language counts can vary significantly depending on what is considered a dialect; for example Lyle Campbell counts only 27 Otomanguean languages, although he, &quot;Ethnologue&quot; and &quot;Glottolog&quot; also disagree as to which languages belong in the family.

The largest five language families in terms of number of speakers (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic, Niger-Congo and Austronesian) make up five-sixths (almost 83.3%) of the world’s population.

== Genetic relationship ==
Two languages have a &quot;genetic relationship&quot;, and belong to the same language family, if both are descended from a common ancestor through the process of language change, or one is descended from the other.
The term and the process of language evolution are independent of, and not reliant on, the terminology, understanding, and theories related to genetics in the biological sense, so, to avoid confusion, some linguists prefer the term &quot;genealogical relationship&quot;.

There is a remarkably similar pattern shown by the linguistic tree and the genetic tree of human ancestry 
that was verified statistically. Languages interpreted in terms of the putative phylogenetic tree of human languages are transmitted to a great extent vertically (by ancestry) as opposed to horizontally (by spatial diffusion).

===Establishment===

In some cases, the shared derivation of a group of related languages from a common ancestor is directly attested in the historical record. For example, this is the case for the Romance language family, wherein Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and French are all descended from Latin, as well as for the North Germanic language family, including Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Icelandic, which have shared descent from Ancient Norse. Latin and ancient Norse are both attested in written records, as are many intermediate stages between those ancestral languages and their modern descendants.

In other cases, genetic relationships between languages are not directly attested. For instance, the Romance languages and the North Germanic languages are also related to each other, being subfamilies of the Indo-European language family, since both Latin and Old Norse are believed to be descended from an even more ancient language, Proto-Indo-European; however, no direct evidence of Proto-Indo-European or its divergence into its descendant languages survives. In cases such as these, genetic relationships are established through use of the comparative method of linguistic analysis.

In order to test the hypothesis that two languages are related, the comparative method begins with the collection of pairs of words that are hypothesized to be cognates: i.e., words in related languages that are derived from the same word in the shared ancestral language. Pairs of words that have similar pronunciations and meanings in the two languages are often good candidates for hypothetical cognates. The researcher must rule out the possibility that the two words are similar merely due to chance, or due to one having borrowed the words from the other (or from a language related to the other). Chance resemblance is ruled out by the existence of large collections of pairs of words between the two languages showing similar patterns of phonetic similarity. Once coincidental similarity and borrowing have been eliminated as possible explanations for similarities in sound and meaning of words, the remaining explanation is common origin: it is inferred that the similarities occurred due to descent from a common ancestor, and the words are actually cognates, implying the languages must be related.

====Linguistic interference and borrowing====
When languages are in contact with one another, either of them may influence the other through linguistic interference such as borrowing. For example, French has influenced English, Arabic has influenced Persian, Sanskrit has influenced Tamil, and Chinese has influenced Japanese in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between languages that are genetically closely related, between languages that are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related Indo-European languages) and between languages that have no genetic relationship.

===Complications===
Some exceptions to the simple genetic relationship model of languages include language isolates and mixed, pidgin and creole languages. 

Mixed languages, pidgins and creole languages constitute special genetic types of languages. They do not descend linearly or directly from a single language and have no single ancestor. 

Isolates are languages that cannot be proven to be genealogically related to any other modern language. As a corollary, every language isolate also forms its own language family — a genetic family which happens to consist of just one language. One often cited example is Basque, which forms a language family on its own; but there are many other examples outside Europe. On the global scale, the site Glottolog counts a total of 423 language families in the world, including 184 isolates.

===Monogenesis===
One controversial theory concerning the genetic relationships among languages is monogenesis, the idea that all known languages, with the exceptions of creoles, pidgins and sign languages, are descendant from a single ancestral language. If that is true, it would mean all languages (other than pidgins, creoles, and sign languages) are genetically related, but in many cases, the relationships may be too remote to be detectable. Alternative explanations for some basic observed commonalities between languages include developmental theories, related to the biological development of the capacity for language as the child grows from newborn.

== Structure of a family ==

A language family is a monophyletic unit; all its members derive from a common ancestor, and all descendants of that ancestor are included in the family. Thus, the term &quot;family&quot; is analogous to the biological term &quot;clade&quot;. Language families can be divided into smaller phylogenetic units, sometimes referred to as &quot;branches&quot; or &quot;subfamilies&quot; of the family; for instance, the Germanic languages are a subfamily of the Indo-European family. Subfamilies share a more recent common ancestor than the common ancestor of the larger family; Proto-Germanic, the common ancestor of the Germanic subfamily, was itself a descendant of Proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor of the Indo-European family. Within a large family, subfamilies can be identified through &quot;shared innovations&quot;: members of a subfamily will share features that represent retentions from their more recent common ancestor, but were not present in the overall proto-language of the larger family.

Some taxonomists restrict the term &quot;family&quot; to a certain level, but there is little consensus on how to do so. Those who affix such labels also subdivide branches into &quot;groups&quot;, and groups into &quot;complexes&quot;. A top-level (i.e., the largest) family is often called a &quot;phylum&quot; or &quot;stock&quot;. The closer the branches are to each other, the more closely the languages will be related. This means if a branch of a proto-language is four branches down and there is also a sister language to that fourth branch, then the two sister languages are more closely related to each other than to that common ancestral proto-language.

The term &quot;macrofamily&quot; or &quot;superfamily&quot; is sometimes applied to proposed groupings of language families whose status as phylogenetic units is generally considered to be unsubstantiated by accepted historical linguistic methods.

=== Dialect continua ===
Some close-knit language families, and many branches within larger families, take the form of dialect continua in which there are no clear-cut borders that make it possible to unequivocally identify, define, or count individual languages within the family. However, when the differences between the speech of different regions at the extremes of the continuum are so great that there is no mutual intelligibility between them, as occurs in Arabic, the continuum cannot meaningfully be seen as a single language.

A speech variety may also be considered either a language or a dialect depending on social or political considerations. Thus, different sources, especially over time, can give wildly different numbers of languages within a certain family. Classifications of the Japonic family, for example, range from one language (a language isolate with dialects) to nearly twenty—until the classification of Ryukyuan as separate languages within a Japonic language family rather than dialects of Japanese, the Japanese language itself was considered a language isolate and therefore the only language in its family.

=== Isolates ===

Most of the world&#x27;s languages are known to be related to others. Those that have no known relatives (or for which family relationships are only tentatively proposed) are called language isolates, essentially language families consisting of a single language. There are an estimated 129 language isolates known today. An example is Basque. In general, it is assumed that language isolates have relatives or had relatives at some point in their history but at a time depth too great for linguistic comparison to recover them.

A language isolate is classified based on the fact that enough is known about the isolate to compare it genetically to other languages but no common ancestry or relationship is found with any other known language.

A language isolated in its own branch within a family, such as Albanian and Armenian within Indo-European, is often also called an isolate, but the meaning of the word &quot;isolate&quot; in such cases is usually clarified with a modifier. For instance, Albanian and Armenian may be referred to as an &quot;Indo-European isolate&quot;. By contrast, so far as is known, the Basque language is an absolute isolate: it has not been shown to be related to any other modern language despite numerous attempts. A language may be said to be an isolate currently but not historically if related but now extinct relatives are attested. The Aquitanian language, spoken in Roman times, may have been an ancestor of Basque, but it could also have been a sister language to the ancestor of Basque. In the latter case, Basque and Aquitanian would form a small family together. Ancestors are not considered to be distinct members of a family.

=== Proto-languages ===

A proto-language can be thought of as a mother language (not to be confused with a mother tongue) being the root from which all languages in the family stem. The common ancestor of a language family is seldom known directly since most languages have a relatively short recorded history. However, it is possible to recover many features of a proto-language by applying the comparative method, a reconstructive procedure worked out by 19th century linguist August Schleicher. This can demonstrate the validity of many of the proposed families in the list of language families. For example, the reconstructible common ancestor of the Indo-European language family is called &quot;Proto-Indo-European&quot;. Proto-Indo-European is not attested by written records and so is conjectured to have been spoken before the invention of writing.

==Visual representation==

A common visual representation of a language family is given by a genetic language tree. The tree model is sometimes termed a dendrogram or phylogeny. The family tree shows the relationship of the languages within a family, much as a family tree of an individual shows their relationship with their relatives. There are criticisms to the family tree model. Critics focus mainly on the claim that the internal structure of the trees is subject to variation based on the criteria of classification. Even among those who support the family tree model, there are debates over which languages should be included in a language family. For example, within the dubious Altaic language family, there are debates over whether the Japonic and Koreanic languages should be included or not.

The wave model has been proposed as an alternative to the tree model. The wave model uses isoglosses to group language varieties; unlike in the tree model, these groups can overlap. While the tree model implies a lack of contact between languages after derivation from an ancestral form, the wave model emphasizes the relationship between languages that remain in contact, which is more realistic. Historical glottometry is an application of the wave model, meant to identify and evaluate genetic relations in linguistic linkages.

== Other classifications of languages ==
=== Sprachbund ===
A sprachbund is a geographic area having several languages that feature common linguistic structures. The similarities between those languages are caused by language contact, not by chance or common origin, and are not recognized as criteria that define a language family. An example of a sprachbund would be the Indian subcontinent.

Shared innovations, acquired by borrowing or other means, are not considered genetic and have no bearing with the language family concept. It has been asserted, for example, that many of the more striking features shared by Italic languages (Latin, Oscan, Umbrian, etc.) might well be &quot;areal features&quot;. However, very similar-looking alterations in the systems of long vowels in the West Germanic languages greatly postdate any possible notion of a proto-language innovation (and cannot readily be regarded as &quot;areal&quot;, either, since English and continental West Germanic were not a linguistic area). In a similar vein, there are many similar unique innovations in Germanic, Baltic and Slavic that are far more likely to be areal features than traceable to a common proto-language. But legitimate uncertainty about whether shared innovations are areal features, coincidence, or inheritance from a common ancestor, leads to disagreement over the proper subdivisions of any large language family.

=== Contact languages ===

The concept of language families is based on the historical observation that languages develop dialects, which over time may diverge into distinct languages. However, linguistic ancestry is less clear-cut than familiar biological ancestry, in which species do not crossbreed. It is more like the evolution of microbes, with extensive lateral gene transfer. Quite distantly related languages may affect each other through language contact, which in extreme cases may lead to languages with no single ancestor, whether they be creoles or mixed languages. In addition, a number of sign languages have developed in isolation and appear to have no relatives at all. Nonetheless, such cases are relatively rare and most well-attested languages can be unambiguously classified as belonging to one language family or another, even if this family&#x27;s relation to other families is not known.

Language contact can lead to the development of new languages from the mixture of two or more languages for the purposes of interactions between two groups who speak different languages. Languages that arise in order for two groups to communicate with each other to engage in commercial trade or that appeared as a result of colonialism are called pidgin. Pidgins are an example of linguistic and cultural expansion caused by language contact. However, language contact can also lead to cultural divisions. In some cases, two different language speaking groups can feel territorial towards their language and do not want any changes to be made to it. This causes language boundaries and groups in contact are not willing to make any compromises to accommodate the other language.

<text>Looe Island nature reserve (, meaning &quot;Island of the Monk&#x27;s Enclosure&quot;), also known as St George&#x27;s Island, and historically St Michael&#x27;s Island is a small island nature reserve a mile from the mainland town of Looe off Cornwall, England. The island and its foreshore belongs to the charity, Cornwall Wildlife Trust.

According to local legend, Joseph of Arimathea landed here with the Christ Child. Some scholars, including Glyn S. Lewis, suggest the island could be Ictis, the location described by Diodorus Siculus as a centre for the tin trade in pre-Roman Britain.

The island is now owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust charity where access (including landing on the foreshore and flying of drones over the island) is carefully managed for the benefit of wildlife and landing is only possible via the Cornwall Wildlife Trust authorized boat operator. The waters around the island are a marine nature reserve and form part of the Whitsand and Looe Bay Marine Conservation Area (VMCA). First established in 1995, the Whitsand and Looe Bay Marine Conservation Area covers nearly 5 km of coastline and aims to protect the coastal and marine wildlife around Looe.

==History==

People have been living on Looe Island since the Iron Age. Evidence of early habitation includes pieces of Roman amphorae as well as stone boat anchors and Roman coins. A number of late prehistoric or Romano-British finds have been made in the vicinity of the island, including a large bronze ingot found by divers south of Looe Island, which has led a number of people to suggest the island is possibly Ictis, the tin trading island seen by Pytheas in the 4th century BC and recalled by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC. A small hoard of eight late Roman coins was recovered in 2008. These coins were recovered from one of the shallow ditches forming a &#x27;pear shaped enclosure&#x27; which encompassed the top of Looe Island and the later Christian chapel site. All eight coins date to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD.

In the Dark Ages, the island was used a seat of early Christian settlement. The child Jesus was believed to have visited the Island with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, who traded with the Cornish tin traders. Looe Island was already a place of pilgrimage for early Christians before the creation of this story and a small thatched roofed chapel was built there during this time.

In the later medieval period, the island came under the overall control of Glastonbury Abbey, with the Prior of Lammana being directly responsible for its governance; the island&#x27;s chapel was under the care of two Benedictine monks until 1289 when the property was sold to a local landowner. The priory was replaced by a domestic chapel served by a secular priest until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 when it became property of the Crown. From the 13th to the 16th centuries it was known as St Michael&#x27;s Island but after the dissolution of the monasteries, it was rededicated in 1594 as St George&#x27;s Island.

Through the 17th and 18th centuries the island was used by smugglers to avoid the British Government&#x27;s revenue cutters out of Plymouth and Falmouth. The Guildhall Museum in Looe holds information and research about the smuggling families of Looe Island and information is also available in the more recent publications about the island.

During the Second World War, Looe Island was for a time renamed as &#x27;H.M.S St. George&#x27;, following the dropping of a probable parachute mine which resulted in a large crater in the summit. It was believed the island was mistaken for an Allied ship. The incident was recorded in &quot;The Cornish Times&quot; under the headline &quot;H.M.S St. George. Nazi Airman&#x27;s Direct Hit Off Looe – Another &#x27;Success&#x27; for the Luftwaffe&quot;. The article continued &quot;H.M.S St. George is still riding peacefully at her anchorage in Looe Bay, after being bombed recently by a Nazi air-raider in what would seem to have been an attempt to sink her. Although St. George has occupied the same berth for millennia, and is as well-known to inhabitants and visitors to Looe as the palms of their hands, no one has determined to what particular class of battleship she belongs, indeed all are familiar with the shapely hulk lying seaward of Hannafore as Looe Island (or, cartographically St. Georges Island)&quot;.

In 1965 the island was bought for £25,000 () by two sisters, Babs and Evelyn Atkins. They wrote two books chronicling their purchase and subsequent life on Looe; &quot;We Bought An Island&quot; and its sequel &quot;Tales From Our Cornish Island&quot;. Evelyn died in 1997 at the age of 87; Babs continued to live on the island until her death in 2004, at the age of 86. On her death, the island was bequeathed to Cornwall Wildlife Trust; it will be preserved as a nature reserve in perpetuity. Today the wardens for Cornwall Wildlife Trust live on the island and manage it for the benefit of wildlife. The adjoining islet, formerly known as Little Island, now renamed Trelawny Island and connected by a small bridge, was bequeathed by Miss Atkins back to the Trelawny family, who previously owned Looe Island from 1743 to 1921.

==Geography==
Situated in the English Channel, about one mile from East Looe in the direction of Polperro, it is about in area and a mile (1.6 km) in circumference. Its highest point is above sea level. Looe Island, like much of south west England, has a mild climate with frost and snow being rare.

The island is owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. This is a non-profit-making venture, the landing fees and other income being devoted to conserving the island&#x27;s natural environment and providing facilities. The island is open during the summer to day visitors arriving by the Trust&#x27;s authorised boat operator. After a short welcome talk visitors are directed to the small visitor centre from where they can pick up a copy of the self-guided trail. Visitors have some two hours on the island and all trips are subject to tides and weather/sea state. 

==Media appearances==
In 2008, Channel 4&#x27;s archaeology series &quot;Time Team&quot; visited the island to carry out an investigation into its early Christian history. They excavated the sites of Christian chapels built on both the island and on the mainland opposite. During their dig they found the remains of a Benedictine chapel that was built in c.1139 by monks from Glastonbury Abbey, a reliquary, graves and the remains of much earlier Anglo-Romano places of worship built of wood with dating evidence suggesting use by Christians before the reign of Constantine the Great.

In 1994/95 Andrew Hugill composed &quot;Island Symphony&quot;, an electro-acoustic piece utilising sampled sounds sourced over the net plus recorded natural sounds from the island itself.

<doc id="18195" wikidata="Q5310" url="?curid=18195" title="LaTeX">
<text>LaTeX ( or , often stylized as ) is a software system for typesetting documents. LaTeX markup describes the content and layout of the document, as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG word processors like Google Docs, LibreOffice Writer, and Microsoft Word. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document, to stylize text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.

LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents and technical note-taking in many fields, owing partially to its support for complex mathematical notation. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Arabic and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.

LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats for PDF. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.

Like TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Devanagari, and Chinese.

LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language to utilize TeX more easily. TeX handles the document layout, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.

LaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. The current version is LaTeX2e, first released in 1994 but incrementally updated starting in 2015. This update policy replaced earlier plans for a separate release of LaTeX3, which had been in development since 1989. LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).

==History==
LaTeX was created in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport when he was working at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). He needed to write TeX macros for his own use and thought that with a little extra effort, he could make a general package usable by others. Peter Gordon, an editor at Addison-Wesley, convinced him to write a LaTeX user&#x27;s manual for publication (Lamport was initially skeptical that anyone would pay money for it); it came out in 1986 and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Meanwhile, Lamport released versions of his LaTeX macros in 1984 and 1985. On 21 August 1989, at a TeX Users Group (TUG) meeting at Stanford, Lamport agreed to turn over maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach. Mittelbach, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Schöpf, formed the LaTeX3 team; in 1994, they released LaTeX2e, the current standard version. LaTeX3 has since been cancelled with features intended for that version being back-ported to LaTeX2e since 2018.

==Typesetting system==
LaTeX attempts to follow the design philosophy of separating presentation from content, so that authors can focus on the content of what they are writing without attending simultaneously to its visual appearance. In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as &quot;chapter&quot;, &quot;section&quot;, &quot;table&quot;, &quot;figure&quot;, etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content — while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many word processors allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of Cascading Style Sheets in styling HyperText Markup Language (HTML) documents.

The LaTeX system is a markup language that handles typesetting and rendering, and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying macro language to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands. Such macros are often collected into &quot;packages,&quot; which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics (e.g., the use of the codice_1 environment provided by the codice_2 package to produce aligned equations).

To create a document in LaTeX, a user first creates a file, such as codice_3, typically using a text editor. The user then gives their codice_3 file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing. This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) style of document editing. It is similar to the code-compile-execute cycle known to computer programmers. Today, many LaTeX-aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter through the pressing of a single key, while showing the output preview on the screen beside the input window. Some online LaTeX editors even automatically refresh the preview, while other online tools provide incremental editing in-place, mixed in with the preview in a single window.

==Example==
The example below shows the input to LaTeX and the corresponding output from the system:


==Pronouncing and writing &quot;LaTeX&quot;==
The characters &#x27;T&#x27;, &#x27;E&#x27;, and &#x27;X&#x27; in the name come from the Greek capital letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as the name of TeX derives from the (&#x27;skill&#x27;, &#x27;art&#x27;, &#x27;technique&#x27;); for this reason, TeX&#x27;s creator Donald Knuth promotes its pronunciation as () (that is, with a voiceless velar fricative as in Modern Greek, similar to the ch in loch). Lamport remarks that &quot;TeX is usually pronounced &quot;tech&quot;, making &quot;lah&quot;-tech, lah-&quot;tech&quot;, and &quot;lay&quot;-tech the logical choices; but language is not always logical, so &quot;lay-tecks&quot; is also possible.&quot;

The name is printed in running text with a typographical logo: . In media where the logo cannot be precisely reproduced in running text, the word is typically given the unique capitalization LaTeX. Alternatively, the TeX, LaTeX, and XeTeX logos can also be rendered via pure CSS and XHTML for use in graphical web browsers — by following the specifications of the internal codice_5 macro.

==Related software==
As a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, GNU Texinfo, AMSTeX, and ConTeXt.

When TeX &quot;compiles&quot; a document, it follows (from the user&#x27;s point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros → TeX → Driver → Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a DVI file, which is usually converted to a PostScript file. In 2000, Hàn Thế Thành and others wrote an implementation of TeX called pdfTeX, which also outputs to PDF and takes advantage of features available in that format. The XeTeX engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX. LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an embedded scripting language.

There are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based. For more, see Comparison of TeX editors.

==Compatibility and converters==
LaTeX documents (codice_6) can be opened with any text editor. They consist of plain text and contain no hidden formatting codes or binary information. TeX documents can also be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to other formats such as OpenDocument, XML, or class () files. LaTeX can also (and commonly is) rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the codice_7 package, or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.
* TeX4ht is a converter that can translate TeX and LaTeX documents to HTML and certain XML formats. It is now included preconfigured with all TeX distributions.
* HeVeA is a converter written in OCaml that converts LaTeX documents to HTML5. This way documents such as scientific papers, primarily typeset for printing, can be placed on the World Wide Web for online viewing. It is licensed under the Q Public License.
* LaTeX2HTML is a converter written in Perl that converts LaTeX documents to HTML. It is licensed under GPL v2. The latest updates are available from Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN).
* LaTeX2RTF is a converter written in C that converts LaTeX documents to RTF. It is licensed under GPL v2 or later.
* LaTeXML is a converter written in Perl that converts LaTeX documents into a variety of XML-based formats, including HTML5 (with MathML), ePub ebooks, JATS, and TEI. It was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology by US Federal Government employees and is therefore in the public domain. It is available for free.
* Pandoc is a &quot;universal document converter&quot; able to transform LaTeX (as well as other formats) into many different file formats, including HTML5, ePub, OpenDocument (codice_8), Microsoft Office Open XML (codice_9), and even text with MediaWiki markup as used in Wikipedia. It is licensed under GPL v2.

LaTeX has become the de facto standard to typeset mathematical expression in scientific documents. Hence, there are several conversion tools focusing on mathematical LaTeX expressions, such as converters to MathML or Computer Algebra System.
* MathJax is a JavaScript library for converting LaTeX to MathML, picture formats including SVG and PNG, or HTML for embedding within a webpage.
** The Wikimedia Foundation uses MathJax to build Mathoid, a web service that uses Node.js to render math that is used in Wikipedia.
* KaTeX is a JavaScript library for converting LaTeX to HTML and MathML. It is developed by Khan Academy, and is among the fastest LaTeX to HTML converters.

== Licensing ==
LaTeX is typically distributed along with plain TeX under a free software licence: the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL). The LPPL is not compatible with the GNU General Public License, as it requires that modified files must be clearly differentiable from their originals (usually by changing the filename); this was done to ensure that files that depend on other files will produce the expected behavior and avoid dependency hell. The LPPL is Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) compliant as of version 1.3. As free software, LaTeX is available on most operating systems, which include Unix (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX), BSD (FreeBSD, macOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD), Linux (Red Hat, Debian, Arch, Gentoo), Windows, DOS, RISC OS, AmigaOS, and Plan 9.

==Versions==

LaTeX2e is the current version of LaTeX, since it replaced LaTeX 2.09 in 1994. , LaTeX3, which started in the early 1990s, is under a long-term development project. Planned features include improved syntax (separation of content from styling), hyperlink support, a new user interface, access to arbitrary fonts and a new documentation. Some LaTeX3 features are available in LaTeX2e using packages, and by 2020 many features have been enabled in LaTeX2e by default for a gradual transition.

There are many commercial implementations of the entire TeX system. System vendors may add extra features like added typefaces and telephone support. LyX is a free software, WYSIWYM visual document processor that uses LaTeX for a back-end. TeXmacs is a free, WYSIWYG editor with similar functionalities as LaTeX, but with a different typesetting engine. Other WYSIWYG editors that produce LaTeX include Scientific Word on Windows and macOS.

Many community-supported TeX distributions are available.

<text>In measure theory, a branch of mathematics, the Lebesgue measure, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of higher dimensional Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-spaces. For lower dimensions &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n&quot;-dimensional volume, n&quot;-volume, hypervolume, or simply volume. It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue-measurable; the measure of the Lebesgue-measurable set &quot;A&quot; is here denoted by &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;).

Henri Lebesgue described this measure in the year 1901 which, a year after, was followed up by his description of the Lebesgue integral. Both were published as part of his dissertation in 1902.

==Definition==

For any interval formula_1, or formula_2, in the set formula_3 of real numbers, let formula_4 denote its length. For any subset formula_5, the Lebesgue outer measure formula_6 is defined as an infimum

formula_7

The above definition can be generalised to higher dimensions as follows.
For any rectangular cuboid formula_8 which is a Cartesian product formula_9 of open intervals, let formula_10 (a real number product) denote its volume.
For any subset formula_11,

formula_12

Some sets formula_13 satisfy the Carathéodory criterion, which requires that for every formula_14,

formula_15

Here formula_16 denotes the complement set. The sets formula_13 that satisfy the Carathéodory criterion are said to be Lebesgue-measurable, with its Lebesgue measure being defined as its Lebesgue outer measure: formula_18. The set of all such formula_13 forms a &quot;σ&quot;-algebra. 

A set formula_13 that does not satisfy the Carathéodory criterion is not Lebesgue-measurable. ZFC proves that non-measurable sets do exist; examples are the Vitali sets.

=== Intuition ===

The first part of the definition states that the subset formula_13 of the real numbers is reduced to its outer measure by coverage by sets of open intervals. Each of these sets of intervals formula_22 covers formula_13 in a sense, since the union of these intervals contains formula_13. The total length of any covering interval set may overestimate the measure of formula_25 because formula_13 is a subset of the union of the intervals, and so the intervals may include points which are not in formula_13. The Lebesgue outer measure emerges as the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the lengths from among all possible such sets. Intuitively, it is the total length of those interval sets which fit formula_13 most tightly and do not overlap.

That characterizes the Lebesgue outer measure. Whether this outer measure translates to the Lebesgue measure proper depends on an additional condition. This condition is tested by taking subsets formula_29 of the real numbers using formula_13 as an instrument to split formula_29 into two partitions: the part of formula_29 which intersects with formula_13 and the remaining part of formula_29 which is not in formula_13: the set difference of formula_29 and formula_13. These partitions of formula_29 are subject to the outer measure. If for all possible such subsets formula_29 of the real numbers, the partitions of formula_29 cut apart by formula_13 have outer measures whose sum is the outer measure of formula_29, then the outer Lebesgue measure of formula_13 gives its Lebesgue measure. Intuitively, this condition means that the set formula_13 must not have some curious properties which causes a discrepancy in the measure of another set when formula_13 is used as a &quot;mask&quot; to &quot;clip&quot; that set, hinting at the existence of sets for which the Lebesgue outer measure does not give the Lebesgue measure. (Such sets are, in fact, not Lebesgue-measurable.)

== Examples ==

* Any closed interval of real numbers is Lebesgue-measurable, and its Lebesgue measure is the length . The open interval has the same measure, since the difference between the two sets consists only of the end points &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, which each have measure zero.
* Any Cartesian product of intervals and is Lebesgue-measurable, and its Lebesgue measure is , the area of the corresponding rectangle.
* Moreover, every Borel set is Lebesgue-measurable. However, there are Lebesgue-measurable sets which are not Borel sets.
* Any countable set of real numbers has Lebesgue measure 0. In particular, the Lebesgue measure of the set of algebraic numbers is 0, even though the set is dense in formula_3.
* The Cantor set and the set of Liouville numbers are examples of uncountable sets that have Lebesgue measure 0.
* If the axiom of determinacy holds then all sets of reals are Lebesgue-measurable. Determinacy is however not compatible with the axiom of choice.
* Vitali sets are examples of sets that are not measurable with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Their existence relies on the axiom of choice.
* Osgood curves are simple plane curves with positive Lebesgue measure (it can be obtained by small variation of the Peano curve construction). The dragon curve is another unusual example.
* Any line in formula_47, for formula_48, has a zero Lebesgue measure. In general, every proper hyperplane has a zero Lebesgue measure in its ambient space.
* The volume of an &quot;n&quot;-ball can be calculated in terms of Euler&#x27;s gamma function.

== Properties ==

The Lebesgue measure on R&quot;n&quot; has the following properties:

# If &quot;A&quot; is a cartesian product of intervals &quot;I&quot;1 × &quot;I&quot;2 × ⋯ × &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable and formula_49
# If &quot;A&quot; is a union of countably many pairwise disjoint Lebesgue-measurable sets, then &quot;A&quot; is itself Lebesgue-measurable and &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is equal to the sum (or infinite series) of the measures of the involved measurable sets.
# If &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable, then so is its complement.
# &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) ≥ 0 for every Lebesgue-measurable set &quot;A&quot;.
# If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are Lebesgue-measurable and &quot;A&quot; is a subset of &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) ≤ &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;B&quot;). (A consequence of 2.)
# Countable unions and intersections of Lebesgue-measurable sets are Lebesgue-measurable. (Not a consequence of 2 and 3, because a family of sets that is closed under complements and disjoint countable unions does not need to be closed under countable unions: formula_50.)
# If &quot;A&quot; is an open or closed subset of R&quot;n&quot; (or even Borel set, see metric space), then &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable.
# If &quot;A&quot; is a Lebesgue-measurable set, then it is &quot;approximately open&quot; and &quot;approximately closed&quot; in the sense of Lebesgue measure. 
# A Lebesgue-measurable set can be &quot;squeezed&quot; between a containing open set and a contained closed set. This property has been used as an alternative definition of Lebesgue measurability. More precisely, formula_51 is Lebesgue-measurable if and only if for every formula_52 there exist an open set formula_53 and a closed set formula_54 such that formula_55 and formula_56.
# A Lebesgue-measurable set can be &quot;squeezed&quot; between a containing G&quot;δ&quot; set and a contained F&quot;σ&quot;. I.e, if &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable then there exist a G&quot;δ&quot; set &quot;G&quot; and an F&quot;σ&quot; &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;G&quot; ⊇ &quot;A&quot; ⊇ &quot;F&quot; and &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;G&quot; \ &quot;A&quot;) = &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;A&quot; \ &quot;F&quot;) = 0.
# Lebesgue measure is both locally finite and inner regular, and so it is a Radon measure.
# Lebesgue measure is strictly positive on non-empty open sets, and so its support is the whole of R&quot;n&quot;.
# If &quot;A&quot; is a Lebesgue-measurable set with &quot;λ(&quot;A&quot;) = 0 (a null set), then every subset of &quot;A&quot; is also a null set. A fortiori, every subset of &quot;A&quot; is measurable.
# If &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable and &quot;x&quot; is an element of R&quot;n&quot;, then the &quot;translation of &quot;A&quot; by x&quot;, defined by &quot;A&quot; + &quot;x&quot; = {&quot;a&quot; + &quot;x&quot; : &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;}, is also Lebesgue-measurable and has the same measure as &quot;A&quot;.
# If &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable and formula_57, then the &quot;dilation of formula_29 by formula_59&quot; defined by formula_60 is also Lebesgue-measurable and has measure formula_61
# More generally, if &quot;T&quot; is a linear transformation and &quot;A&quot; is a measurable subset of R&quot;n&quot;, then &quot;T&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is also Lebesgue-measurable and has the measure formula_62.

All the above may be succinctly summarized as follows (although the last two assertions are non-trivially linked to the following):

The Lebesgue measure also has the property of being &quot;σ&quot;-finite.

== Null sets ==

A subset of R&quot;n&quot; is a &quot;null set&quot; if, for every ε &gt; 0, it can be covered with countably many products of &quot;n&quot; intervals whose total volume is at most ε. All countable sets are null sets.

If a subset of R&quot;n&quot; has Hausdorff dimension less than &quot;n&quot; then it is a null set with respect to &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Here Hausdorff dimension is relative to the Euclidean metric on R&quot;n&quot; (or any metric Lipschitz equivalent to it). On the other hand, a set may have topological dimension less than &quot;n&quot; and have positive &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure. An example of this is the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set which has topological dimension 0 yet has positive 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

In order to show that a given set &quot;A&quot; is Lebesgue-measurable, one usually tries to find a &quot;nicer&quot; set &quot;B&quot; which differs from &quot;A&quot; only by a null set (in the sense that the symmetric difference (&quot;A&quot; − &quot;B&quot;) ∪ (&quot;B&quot; − &quot;A&quot;) is a null set) and then show that &quot;B&quot; can be generated using countable unions and intersections from open or closed sets.

== Construction of the Lebesgue measure ==
The modern construction of the Lebesgue measure is an application of Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem. It proceeds as follows.

Fix . A box in R&quot;n&quot; is a set of the form

formula_63

where , and the product symbol here represents a Cartesian product. The volume of this box is defined to be

formula_64

For &quot;any&quot; subset &quot;A&quot; of R&quot;n&quot;, we can define its outer measure &quot;λ&quot;*(&quot;A&quot;) by:

formula_65

We then define the set &quot;A&quot; to be Lebesgue-measurable if for every subset &quot;S&quot; of R&quot;n&quot;,

formula_66

These Lebesgue-measurable sets form a &quot;σ&quot;-algebra, and the Lebesgue measure is defined by for any Lebesgue-measurable set &quot;A&quot;.

The existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is a consequence of the set-theoretical axiom of choice, which is independent from many of the conventional systems of axioms for set theory. The Vitali theorem, which follows from the axiom, states that there exist subsets of R that are not Lebesgue-measurable. Assuming the axiom of choice, non-measurable sets with many surprising properties have been demonstrated, such as those of the Banach–Tarski paradox.

In 1970, Robert M. Solovay showed that the existence of sets that are not Lebesgue-measurable is not provable within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in the absence of the axiom of choice (see Solovay&#x27;s model).

== Relation to other measures ==
The Borel measure agrees with the Lebesgue measure on those sets for which it is defined; however, there are many more Lebesgue-measurable sets than there are Borel measurable sets. While the Lebesgue measure on R&quot;n&quot; is automatically a locally finite Borel measure, not every locally finite Borel measure on R&quot;n&quot; is necessarily a Lebesgue measure. The Borel measure is translation-invariant, but not complete.

The Haar measure can be defined on any locally compact group and is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure (R&quot;n&quot; with addition is a locally compact group).

The Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure that is useful for measuring the subsets of R&quot;n&quot; of lower dimensions than &quot;n&quot;, like submanifolds, for example, surfaces or curves in R3 and fractal sets. The Hausdorff measure is not to be confused with the notion of Hausdorff dimension.

It can be shown that there is no infinite-dimensional analogue of Lebesgue measure.
