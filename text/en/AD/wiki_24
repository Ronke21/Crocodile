<text>Sir John Alexander Macdonald (10 or 11January 18156June 1891) was the first prime minister of Canada, serving from 1867 to 1873 and from 1878 until his death in 1891. He was the dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, and had a political career that spanned almost half a century.

Macdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). As a lawyer, he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada. By 1857, he had become premier under the colony&#x27;s unstable political system. In 1864, when no party proved capable of governing for long, he agreed to a proposal from his political rival, George Brown, that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform. He was a leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences which resulted in the British North America Act and the establishment of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867.

Macdonald was the first prime minister of the new nation, and served 19 years; only William Lyon Mackenzie King has served longer. In his first term, he established the North-West Mounted Police and expanded Canada by annexing the North-Western Territory, Rupert&#x27;s Land, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island. In 1873, he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. He was reelected in 1878. His greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and completing the railway. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in Ottawa. He approved the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885 which alienated many francophones from his Conservative Party. He sat until his death in 1891 and remains the oldest Canadian prime minister.

Macdonald came under criticism for his role in the Chinese head tax and federal policies toward Indigenous peoples, including his actions during the North-West Rebellion that resulted in Riel&#x27;s execution, and the development of the residential school system designed to assimilate Indigenous children. He remains respected by others for his key role in Confederation. Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of Canada have consistently made him one of the highest-rated in Canadian history.

==Early years, 1815–1830 ==
John Alexander Macdonald was born in Ramshorn parish in Glasgow, Scotland, on 10 January (official record) or 11 (father&#x27;s journal) 1815. His father Hugh, an unsuccessful merchant, had married John&#x27;s mother, Helen Shaw, on 21 October 1811. John Alexander Macdonald was the third of five children. After Hugh&#x27;s business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to Kingston, in Upper Canada (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, as the family had several relatives and connections there.

The family initially lived together, then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John&#x27;s younger brother James died from a blow to the head by a servant charged with taking care of the boys. After Hugh&#x27;s store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. In 1829, his father was appointed as a magistrate for the Midland District. John Macdonald&#x27;s mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining influential in his life until her 1862 death.

Macdonald initially attended local schools. When he was aged 10, his family gathered enough money to send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald&#x27;s formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.

==Legal career, 1830–1843 ==

===Legal training and early career, 1830–1837 ===
Macdonald&#x27;s parents decided he should become a lawyer after leaving school. As Donald Creighton (who penned a two-volume biography of Macdonald in the 1950s) wrote, &quot;law was a broad, well-trodden path to comfort, influence, even to power&quot;. It was also &quot;the obvious choice for a boy who seemed as attracted to study as he was uninterested in trade.&quot; Macdonald needed to start earning money immediately to support his family because his father&#x27;s businesses were failing. &quot;I had no boyhood,&quot; he complained many years later. &quot;From the age of 15, I began to earn my own living.&quot;

Macdonald travelled by steamboat to Toronto (known until 1834 as York), where he passed an examination set by The Law Society of Upper Canada. British North America had no law schools in 1830; students were examined when beginning and ending their tutelage. Between the two examinations, they were apprenticed, or articled to established lawyers. Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston&#x27;s rising Scottish community. Mackenzie practised corporate law, a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue. Macdonald was a promising student, and in the summer of 1833, managed the Mackenzie office when his employer went on a business trip to Montreal and Quebec in Lower Canada (today the southern portion of the province of Quebec). Later that year, Macdonald was sent to manage the law office of a Mackenzie cousin who had fallen ill.

In August 1834, George Mackenzie died of cholera. With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald remained at the cousin&#x27;s law office in Hallowell (today Picton, Ontario). In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began his practice as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer&#x27;s clients. Macdonald&#x27;s parents and sisters also returned to Kingston.

Soon after Macdonald was called to the Bar in February 1836, he arranged to take in two students; both became, like Macdonald, Fathers of Confederation. Oliver Mowat became premier of Ontario, and Alexander Campbell a federal cabinet minister and Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. One early client was Eliza Grimason, an Irish immigrant then aged sixteen, who sought advice concerning a shop she and her husband wanted to buy. Grimason would become one of Macdonald&#x27;s richest and most loyal supporters, and may have also become his lover. Macdonald joined many local organisations, seeking to become well known in the town. He also sought out high-profile cases, representing accused child rapist William Brass. Brass was hanged for his crime, but Macdonald attracted positive press comments for the quality of his defence. According to one of his biographers, Richard Gwyn:
As a criminal lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed well beyond the narrow confines of the Kingston business community. He was operating now in the arena where he would spend by far the greatest part of his life – the court of public opinion. And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life.
===Military service===
All male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60 years of age were members of the Sedentary Militia, which was called into active duty during the Rebellions of 1837. Macdonald served as a private in Captain George Well&#x27;s Company of the Commercial Bank Guard.

Macdonald and the militia marched to Toronto to confront the rebels, and Sir Joseph Pope, Macdonald&#x27;s private secretary, recalled Macdonald&#x27;s account of his experience during the march:

The Bank Guard served on active duty in Toronto guarding the Commercial Bank of the Midland District on King Street. The company was present at the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern and Macdonald recalled in an 1887 letter to Sir James Gowan that: 
The Bank Guard was taken off active service on 17 December 1837, and returned to Kingston.

On 15 February 1838, Macdonald was appointed an ensign in the 3rd (East) Regiment of Frontenac Militia but did not take up the position, serving briefly as a private in the regiment, patrolling the area around Kingston. The town saw no real action during 1838 and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy. The Frontenac Militia regiments stayed on active duty in Kingston while the Battle of the Windmill occurred.

===Professional prominence, 1837–1843 ===

Although most of the trials resulting from the Upper Canada Rebellion took place in Toronto, Macdonald represented one of the defendants in the one trial to take place in Kingston. All the Kingston defendants were acquitted, and a local paper described Macdonald as &quot;one of the youngest barristers in the Province [who] is rapidly rising in his profession&quot;.

In late 1838, Macdonald agreed to advise one of a group of American raiders who had crossed the border to overthrow British rule in Canada. The raiders had been captured by government forces after the Battle of the Windmill near Prescott, Upper Canada. Public opinion was inflamed against the prisoners, as they were accused of mutilating the body of a dead Canadian lieutenant. Macdonald could not represent the prisoners, as they were tried by court-martial and civilian counsel had no standing. At the request of Kingston relatives of Daniel George, paymaster of the ill-fated invasion, Macdonald agreed to advise George, who, like the other prisoners, had to conduct his own defence. George was convicted and hanged. According to Macdonald biographer Donald Swainson, &quot;By 1838, Macdonald&#x27;s position was secure. He was a public figure, a popular young man, and a senior lawyer.&quot;

Macdonald continued to expand his practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. He became both a director of and a lawyer for the new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.

==Political rise, 1843–1864 ==
===Parliamentary advancement, 1843–1857 ===
On 29 March 1843, Macdonald was elected as alderman in Kingston&#x27;s Fourth Ward, with 156 votes against 43 for his opponent, Colonel Jackson. He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street.

The British Parliament had merged Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada in 1841. Kingston became the initial capital of the new province; Upper Canada and Lower Canada became known as Canada West and Canada East. In March 1844, Macdonald was asked by local businessmen to stand as Conservative candidate for Kingston in the upcoming legislative election. Macdonald followed the contemporary custom of supplying the voters with large quantities of alcohol. Votes were publicly declared in this election, and Macdonald defeated his opponent, Anthony Manahan, by 275 &quot;shouts&quot; to 42 when the election concluded on 15 October 1844. Macdonald was never an orator, and especially disliked the bombastic addresses of the time. Instead, he found a niche in becoming an expert on election law and parliamentary procedure.

In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but the illness recurred the following year, and she became an invalid. John took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. John returned to Canada after six months and Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846 and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.

Although he was often absent due to his wife&#x27;s illness, Macdonald was able to gain professional and political advancement. In 1846, he was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. The same year, he was offered the non-cabinet post of solicitor general, but declined it. In 1847, Macdonald became receiver general. Accepting the government post required Macdonald to give up his law firm income and spend most of his time in Montreal, away from Isabella. When elections were held in December 1848 and January 1849, Macdonald was easily reelected for Kingston, but the Conservatives lost seats and were forced to resign when the legislature reconvened in March 1848. Macdonald returned to Kingston when the legislature was not sitting, and Isabella joined him there in June. In August, their child died suddenly. In March 1850, Isabella Macdonald gave birth to another boy, Hugh John Macdonald, and his father wrote, &quot;We have got Johnny back again, almost his image.&quot; Macdonald began to drink heavily around this time, both in public and in private, which Patricia Phenix, who studied Macdonald&#x27;s private life, attributes to his family troubles.

The Liberals, or Grits, maintained power in the 1851 election but were soon divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a coalition government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Allan MacNab took power. Macdonald did much of the work of putting the government together and served as attorney general. The coalition, which came to power in 1854, became known as the Liberal-Conservatives (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, George-Étienne Cartier of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier&#x27;s 1873 death, he would be Macdonald&#x27;s political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives. Macdonald remained as attorney general when Étienne-Paschal Taché became premier.

===Colonial leader, 1858–1864 ===

In July 1857, Macdonald departed for Britain to promote Canadian government projects. On his return to Canada, he was appointed premier in place of the retiring Taché, just in time to lead the Conservatives in a general election. Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189 votes to 9 for John Shaw; other Conservatives did poorly in Canada West and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power. On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.

The Assembly had voted to move the seat of government permanently to Quebec City. Macdonald opposed this and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. He proposed that Queen Victoria decide which city should be Canada&#x27;s capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that she would not make the decision in isolation and was bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. His scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital. He privately asked the Colonial Office to ensure she would not respond for at least ten months, or until after the general election. In February 1858, her choice was announced to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of Ottawa became the capital.

On 28 July 1858, an opposition Canada East member proposed an address to the Queen informing her that Ottawa was an unsuitable place for a national capital. Macdonald&#x27;s Canada East party members crossed the floor to vote for the address, and the government was defeated. Macdonald resigned, and the governor general, Sir Edmund Walker Head, invited opposition leader George Brown to form a government. Under the law at that time, Brown and his ministers lost their seats in the Assembly by accepting their positions, and had to face by-elections. This gave Macdonald a majority pending the by-elections, and he promptly defeated the government. Head refused Brown&#x27;s request for a dissolution of the Assembly, and Brown and his ministers resigned. Head then asked Macdonald to form a government. The law allowed anyone who had held a ministerial position within the last thirty days to accept a new position without needing to face a by-election; Macdonald and his ministers accepted new positions, then completed what was dubbed the &quot;Double Shuffle&quot; by returning to their old posts. In an effort to give the appearance of fairness, Head insisted that Cartier be the titular premier, with Macdonald as his deputy.

In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Canada enjoyed a period of great prosperity, while the railroad and telegraph improved communications. According to Macdonald biographer Richard Gwyn, &quot;In short, Canadians began to become a single community.&quot; At the same time, the provincial government became increasingly difficult to manage. An act affecting both Canada East and Canada West required a &quot;double majority&quot;a majority of legislators from each of the two sections of the province. This led to increasing deadlock in the Assembly. The two sections each elected 65 legislators, even though Canada West had a larger population. One of Brown&#x27;s major demands was representation by population, which would lead to Canada West having more seats; this was bitterly opposed by Canada East.

The American Civil War led to fears in Canada and in Britain that once the U.S. had concluded its internal warfare, they would invade Canada again. Canada was sometimes a safe haven for Confederate Secret Service operations against the U.S.; many Canadian citizens and politicians were sympathetic to the Confederacy. This led to events such as the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair, the St. Albans Raid, and a failed attempt to burn down New York City. As attorney general of Canada West, Macdonald refused to prosecute Confederate operatives who were using Canada to launch attacks on U.S. soil across the border.

With Canadians fearing invasion from the U.S., the British asked that Canadians pay a part of the expense of defence, and a Militia Bill was introduced in the Assembly in 1862. The opposition objected to the expense, and Canada East representatives feared that French-Canadians would have to fight in a war they wanted no part in. Macdonald was drinking heavily and failed to provide much leadership on behalf of the bill. The government fell over the bill, and the Grits took over under the leadership of John Sandfield Macdonald (no relation to John A. Macdonald). The parties held an almost equal number of seats, with a handful of independents able to destroy any government. The new government fell in May 1863, but Head allowed a new election, which did little to change party standings. In December 1863, Canada West MP Albert Norton Richards accepted the post of solicitor general, and so had to face a by-election. John A. Macdonald campaigned against Richards personally, and Richards was defeated by a Conservative. The switch in seats cost the Grits their majority, and they resigned in March. John A. Macdonald returned to office with Taché as titular premier. The Taché-Macdonald government was defeated in June. The parties were deadlocked to such an extent that, according to Swainson, &quot;It was clear to everybody that the constitution of the Province of Canada was dead&quot;.

==Confederation of Canada, 1864–1867==
As his government had fallen again, Macdonald approached the new governor general, Lord Monck, to dissolve the legislature. Before Macdonald could act on this, Brown approached him through intermediaries; the Grit leader believed that the crisis gave the parties the opportunity to join together for constitutional reform. Brown had led a parliamentary committee on confederation among the British North American colonies, which had reported back just before the Taché-Macdonald government fell. Brown was more interested in representation by population; Macdonald&#x27;s priority was a federation that the other colonies could join. The two compromised and agreed that the new government would support the &quot;federative principle&quot;a conveniently elastic phrase. The discussions were not public knowledge and Macdonald stunned the Assembly by announcing that the dissolution was being postponed because of progress in negotiations with Brownthe two men were not only political rivals, but were known to hate each other.

The parties resolved their differences, joining in the Great Coalition, with only the Parti rouge of Canada East, led by Jean-Baptiste-Éric Dorion, remaining apart. A conference, called by the Colonial Office, was scheduled for 1 September 1864, in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island; the Maritimes were to consider a union. The Canadians obtained permission to send a delegationled by Macdonald, Cartier, and Brownto what became known as the Charlottetown Conference. At its conclusion, the Maritime delegations expressed a willingness to join a confederation if the details could be successfully negotiated.

In October 1864, delegates for Confederation met in Quebec City for the Quebec Conference, where they agreed to the Seventy-Two Resolutions, the basis of Canada&#x27;s government. The Great Coalition was endangered by Taché&#x27;s 1865 death; Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown felt that he had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau.

In 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada&#x27;s legislative assembly approved Confederation by 91 votes to 33. None of the Maritimes approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald and his colleagues financed pro-Confederation candidates in the New Brunswick general election, resulting in a pro-Confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, Nova Scotia&#x27;s premier, Charles Tupper, pushed a pro-Confederation resolution through that colony&#x27;s legislature. A final conference, to be held in London, was needed before the British Parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers. In December 1866, Macdonald both led the London Conference, winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and courted and married his second wife, Agnes Bernard. Bernard was the sister of Macdonald&#x27;s private secretary, Hewitt Bernard; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856. In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire to the chair he had fallen asleep in, but Macdonald refused to miss any sessions of the conference. In February, he married Agnes at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. On 8 March, the British North America Act, 1867, which would thereafter serve as the major part of Canada&#x27;s constitution, passed the House of Commons (it had previously passed the House of Lords). Queen Victoria gave the bill Royal Assent on 29 March 1867.

Macdonald had favoured the union coming into force on 15 July, fearing that the preparations would not be completed any earlier. The British favoured an earlier date and, on 22 May, it was announced that Canada would come into existence on 1 July. Lord Monck appointed Macdonald as the new nation&#x27;s first prime minister. With the birth of the new nation, Canada East and Canada West became separate provinces, known as Quebec and Ontario, respectively. Macdonald was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on that first observance of what came to be known as Dominion Day, later called Canada Day, on 1 July 1867.

==Prime Minister of Canada==

===First majority, 1867–1871===

Macdonald and his government faced immediate problems upon the formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening to withdraw from the union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. American and British opinion largely believed that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.

In August 1867, the new nation&#x27;s first general election was held; Macdonald&#x27;s party won easily, with strong support in both large provinces, and a majority from New Brunswick. By 1869, Nova Scotia had agreed to remain part of Canada after a promise of better financial termsthe first of many provinces to negotiate concessions from Ottawa. Pressure from London and Ottawa failed to gain the accession of Newfoundland, whose voters rejected a Confederation platform in a general election in October 1869.

In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It soon became apparent that Mary had ongoing developmental issues; she was never able to walk, nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, deputy minister of justice and Macdonald&#x27;s former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard&#x27;s widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.

Macdonald had once been tepid on the question of westward expansion of the Canadian provinces; as prime minister, he became a strong supporter of a bicoastal Canada. Immediately upon Confederation, he sent commissioners to London who in due course successfully negotiated the transfer of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory to Canada. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company received £300,000 () in compensation, and retained some trading posts as well as one-twentieth of the best farmland. Prior to the date of acquisition, the Canadian government faced unrest in the Red River Colony (today southeastern Manitoba, centred on Winnipeg). The local people, including the Métis, were fearful that rule would be imposed on them which did not take into account their interests, and rose in the Red River Rebellion led by Louis Riel. Unwilling to pay for a territory in insurrection, Macdonald had troops put down the uprising before the formal transfer; as a result of the unrest, the Red River Colony joined Confederation as the province of Manitoba, while the rest of the purchased lands became the North-West Territories.

Macdonald also wished to secure the colony of British Columbia. There was interest in the United States in bringing about the colony&#x27;s annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt that would have to be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald&#x27;s illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railway linking it to the eastern provinces within ten years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.

There were continuing disputes with the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission was appointed to settle outstanding matters between the British, the Canadians and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by Fenians raiding Canada from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post he was reluctant to accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the Treaty of Washington against a political firestorm.

===Second majority and Pacific Scandal, 1872–1873===
In the run-up to the 1872 election, Macdonald had yet to formulate a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. The greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.

In early 1872, Macdonald submitted the treaty for ratification, and it passed the Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September. Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8. The Liberals (as the Grits were coming to be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.

Macdonald had hoped to award the charter for the Canadian Pacific Railway in early 1872, but negotiations dragged on between the government and the financiers. Macdonald&#x27;s government awarded the Allan group the charter in late 1872. In 1873, when Parliament opened, Liberal MP Lucius Seth Huntington charged that government ministers had been bribed with large, undisclosed political contributions to award the charter. Documents soon came to light which substantiated what came to be known as the Pacific Scandal. The Allan-led financiers, who were secretly backed by the United States&#x27;s Northern Pacific Railway, had donated $179,000 to the Tory election funds, they had received the charter, and Opposition newspapers began to publish telegrams signed by government ministers requesting large sums from the railway interest at the time the charter was under consideration. Macdonald had taken $45,000 in contributions from the railway interest himself. Substantial sums went to Cartier, who waged an expensive fight to try to retain his seat in Montreal East (he was defeated, but was subsequently returned for the Manitoba seat of Provencher). During the campaign Cartier had fallen ill with Bright&#x27;s disease, which may have been causing his judgment to lapse; he died in May 1873 while seeking treatment in London.

Before Cartier&#x27;s death, Macdonald attempted to use delay to extricate the government. The Opposition responded by leaking documents to friendly newspapers. On 18 July, three papers published a telegram dated August 1872 from Macdonald requesting another $10,000 and promising &quot;it will be the last time of asking&quot;. Macdonald was able to get a prorogation of Parliament in August by appointing a Royal Commission to look into the matter, but when Parliament reconvened in late October, the Liberals, feeling Macdonald could be defeated over the issue, applied immense pressure to wavering members. On 3 November, Macdonald rose in the Commons to defend the government, and according to one of his biographer, P.B. Waite, he gave &quot;the speech of his life, and, in a sense, for his life&quot;. He began his speech at 9 p.m., looking frail and ill, an appearance which quickly improved. As he spoke, he consumed numerous glasses of gin and water. He denied that there had been a corrupt bargain, and stated that such contributions were common to both political parties. After five hours, Macdonald concluded,
I leave it with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the decision of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, and it is no vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.
Macdonald&#x27;s speech was seen as a personal triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the governor general, Lord Dufferin on 5 November, and resigned; Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the second prime minister of Canada. He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again.

On 6 November 1873, Macdonald offered his resignation as party leader to his caucus; it was refused. Mackenzie called an election for January 1874; the Conservatives were reduced to 70 seats out of the 206 in the Commons, giving Mackenzie a massive majority. The Conservatives bested the Liberals only in British Columbia; Mackenzie had called the terms by which the province had joined Confederation &quot;impossible&quot;. Macdonald was returned in Kingston but was unseated on an election contest when bribery was proven; he won the ensuing by-election by 17 votes. According to Swainson, most observers viewed Macdonald as finished in politics, &quot;a used-up and dishonoured man&quot;.

===Opposition, 1873–1878===
Macdonald was content to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in opposition and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John. One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald had come to believe that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry. The Panic of 1873 had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railway in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anywaythe slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.

By 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives had adopted protectionism as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches at a number of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald&#x27;s proposals were popular with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14 seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie&#x27;s Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters&#x27; verdict of 1874he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.

When Parliament convened in 1877, the Conservatives were confident and the Liberals defensive. After the Tories had a successful session in the early part of the year, another series of picnics commenced in the areas around Toronto. Macdonald even campaigned in Quebec, which he had rarely done, leaving speechmaking there to Cartier. More picnics followed in 1878, promoting proposals which would come to be collectively called the &quot;National Policy&quot;: high tariffs, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway (the Canadian Pacific Railway or CPR), rapid agricultural development of the West using the railway, and policies which would attract immigrants to Canada. These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lightheartedat one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects would go away if the Conservatives were elected.

The final days of the 3rd Canadian Parliament were marked by explosive conflict, as Macdonald and Tupper alleged that MP and railway financier Donald Smith had been allowed to build the Pembina branch of the CPR (connecting to American lines) as a reward for betraying the Conservatives during the Pacific Scandal. The altercation continued even after the Commons had been summoned to the Senate to hear the dissolution read, as Macdonald spoke the final words recorded in the 3rd Parliament: &quot;That fellow Smith is the biggest liar I ever saw!&quot;

The election was called for 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters tried to get him to run in the safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35 years, he stood there again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the election was to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.

===Third and fourth majorities, 1878–1887===
Part of the National Policy was implemented in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industryfinished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free. Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs for the remainder of his life.

In January 1879, Macdonald commissioned politician Nicholas Flood Davin to write a report regarding the industrial boarding-school system in the United States. Now known as the Davin Report, the &quot;Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds&quot; was submitted to Ottawa on 14 March 1879, providing the basis for the Canadian Indian residential school system. It made the case for a cooperative approach between the Canadian government and the church to implement the &quot;aggressive assimilation&quot; pursued by President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant. In 1883, Parliament approved $43,000 for three industrial schools and the first, Battleford Industrial School, opened on 1 December of that year. By 1900, there were 61 schools in operation. In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide.

By the 1880s, Macdonald was becoming frailer, but he maintained his political acuity. In 1883, he secured the &quot;Intoxicating Liquors Bill&quot; which took the regulation system away from the provinces, in part to stymie his foe Premier Mowat. In his own case, Macdonald took better control of his drinking and binges had ended. &quot;The great drinking-bouts, the gargantuan in sobriety&#x27;s of his middle years, were dwindling away now into memories.&quot; As the budget moved forward, Macdonald found that the railway was progressing well: although little money had been spent on the project under Mackenzie, several hundred miles of track had been built and nearly the entire route surveyed. In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by George Stephen, willing to undertake the CPR project. Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, but because of the ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith&#x27;s participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald. In 1880, the Dominion took over Britain&#x27;s remaining Arctic territories, which extended Canada to its present-day boundaries, with the exception of Newfoundland, which did not enter Confederation until 1949. Also in 1880, Canada sent its first diplomatic representative abroad, Sir Alexander Galt as High Commissioner to Britain. With good economic times, Macdonald and the Conservatives were returned with a slightly decreased majority in 1882. Macdonald was returned for the Ontario riding of Carleton.

The transcontinental railroad project was heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted of land along the route of the railroad, and $25 million from the government. In addition, the government had to spend $32 million on the construction of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially for a nation with only 4.1 million people in 1881. Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. The terrain in the Rocky Mountains was difficult and the route north of Lake Superior proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the muskeg. When Canadian guarantees of the CPR&#x27;s bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasurythe bill authorizing it passed the Senate just before the firm would have become insolvent.

The Northwest again saw unrest. Many of the Manitoban Métis had moved into the territories and negotiations between the Métis and the Government to settle grievances over land rights proved difficult. Riel, who had lived in exile in the United States since 1870, journeyed to Regina with the connivance of Macdonald&#x27;s government, who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with. Instead, the Métis rose the following year under Riel in the North-West Rebellion. Macdonald put down the rebellion with Canadian troops who were transported by rail, and Riel was captured, tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Macdonald refused to consider reprieving Riel, who was of uncertain mental health. The hanging of Riel was controversial, and alienated many Quebecers from the Conservatives and they were, like Riel, Catholic and culturally French Canadian; they soon realigned with the Liberals. Following the North-West Rebellion of 1885, Macdonald&#x27;s government implemented restrictions upon the movement of indigenous groups, requiring them to receive formal permission from an Indian Department Official in order to go off-reserve. The federal government under Macdonald sought to keep the indigenous ill-fed and dependent on government food supplies, a policy which has been blamed for many deaths.

The CPR was almost bankrupt, but Canada&#x27;s decision to deploy troops in response to the crisis showed that the railway was helpful to maintain the territory&#x27;s status as part of the British Empire, and the British Parliament provided money for its completion. On 7 November 1885, CPR manager William Van Horne wired Macdonald from Craigellachie, British Columbia, that the last spike had been driven, completing the railway. That same year, the Macdonald government enacted the &quot;Chinese Immigration Act, 1885&quot;. Macdonald told the House of Commons that, if the Chinese were not excluded from Canada, &quot;the Aryan character of the future of British America should be destroyed&quot;. In the summer of 1886, Macdonald travelled by rail to western Canada. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.

In 1886, another dispute arose over fishing rights with the United States. Americans fishermen had been using treaty provisions allowing them to land in Canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine inshore fishing. Several vessels were detained in Canadian ports, to the outrage of Americans, who demanded their release. Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the treaty provisions, to the dismay of the British, who were still responsible for external relations. The British government instructed the governor general, Lord Lansdowne, to reserve the bill for royal assent, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it. After considerable discussion, the British government allowed royal assent at the end of 1886, and indicated it would send a warship to protect the fisheries if no agreement was reached with the Americans.

===Fifth and sixth majorities, 1887–1891===
Fearing continued loss of political strength as poor economic times continued, Macdonald planned to hold an election by the end of 1886, but had not yet issued the writ when an Ontario provincial election was called by Liberal Ontario premier Oliver Mowat. The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll. Despite considerable campaigning by Macdonald, Mowat&#x27;s Liberals were reelected in Ontario and increased their majority. Macdonald dissolved the federal Parliament on 15 January 1887, for an election on 22 February. During the campaign, the Quebec provincial Liberals formed a government (four months after the October 1886 Quebec election), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City. Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned hard in the winter election, with Tupper (the new High Commissioner to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative votes in Nova Scotia. The Liberal leader, Edward Blake, ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Manitoba. The Tories also took a narrow majority of Quebec&#x27;s seats despite resentment over Riel&#x27;s hanging. Macdonald became MP for Kingston once again. Even the younger ministers, such as future prime minister John Thompson, who sometimes differed with Macdonald on policy, admitted Macdonald was an essential electoral asset for the Conservatives.

Blake resigned after the defeat and was replaced by Wilfrid Laurier. Under Laurier&#x27;s early leadership, the Liberals, who previously supported much of the National Policy, campaigned against it and called for &quot;unrestricted reciprocity&quot;, or free trade, with the United States. Macdonald was willing to see some reciprocity with the United States, but was reluctant to lower many tariffs. American advocates of what they dubbed &quot;commercial union&quot; saw it as a prelude to political union, and did not scruple to say so, causing additional controversy in Canada.
Macdonald called an election for 5 March 1891. The Liberals were heavily financed by American interests; the Conservatives drew much financial support from the CPR. The 76-year-old prime minister collapsed during the campaign, and conducted political activities from his brother-in-law&#x27;s house in Kingston. The Conservatives gained slightly in the popular vote, but their majority was reduced to 27. The parties broke even in the central part of the country but the Conservatives dominated in the Maritimes and Western Canada, leading Liberal MP Richard John Cartwright to claim that Macdonald&#x27;s majority was dependent on &quot;the shreds and patches of Confederation&quot;. After the election, Laurier and his Liberals grudgingly accepted the National Policy; when Laurier later became prime minister, he adopted it with only minor changes.

=== Death ===
In May 1891, Macdonald suffered a stroke which left him partially paralysed and unable to speak. His health continued to deteriorate and he died in the late evening of 6 June 1891. Thousands filed by his open casket in the Senate Chamber; his body was transported by funeral train to his hometown of Kingston, with crowds greeting the train at each stop. On arrival in Kingston, Macdonald lay in state in City Hall, wearing the uniform of an Imperial Privy Counsellor. He was buried in Cataraqui Cemetery in Kingston, his grave near that of his first wife, Isabella.

== Legacy and memorials ==

Macdonald served just under 19 years as prime minister, a length of service surpassed only by William Lyon Mackenzie King. In polls, Macdonald has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest prime ministers in Canadian history. No cities or political subdivisions are named for Macdonald (with the exception of a small Manitoba village), nor are there any massive monuments. A peak in the Rockies, Mount Macdonald ( 1887) at Rogers Pass, is named for him. In 2001, Parliament designated 11 January as Sir John A. Macdonald Day, but the day is not a federal holiday and generally passes unremarked. He appears on Canadian ten-dollar notes printed between 1971 and 2018. In 2015, the Royal Canadian Mint featured Macdonald&#x27;s face on the two-dollar coin, the toonie, to celebrate his 200th birthday. Macdonald&#x27;s name is also used in Ottawa&#x27;s Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport (renamed in 1993) and Ontario Highway 401 (the Macdonald–Cartier Freeway 1968). His name is being phased out on Ottawa&#x27;s Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway (River Parkway before 2012), being renamed to an indigenous term, Kichi Zibi Mikan. Macdonald also had a street named after him in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. This street was renamed miyo-wâhkôhtowin, a Cree word meaning good relations, on 7 December 2023. This was done as a response to Macdonald playing a significant role in developing the Indian residential school system.

A number of sites associated with Macdonald are preserved. His gravesite has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Bellevue House in Kingston, where the Macdonald family lived in the 1840s, is also a National Historic Site administered by Parks Canada, and has been restored to that time period. His Ottawa home, Earnscliffe, is the official residence of the British High Commissioner to Canada. Statues have been erected to Macdonald across Canada; one stands on Parliament Hill in Ottawa (by Louis-Philippe Hebert 1895). A statue of Macdonald stands atop a granite plinth originally intended for a statue of Queen Victoria in Toronto&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Park, looking south on University Avenue. Macdonald&#x27;s statue also stood in Kingston&#x27;s City Park; the Kingston Historical Society annually holds a memorial service in his honour. On 18 June 2021, following the discovery of 215 unmarked graves at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, the statue of Macdonald was removed from Kingston&#x27;s City Park after city council voted 12–1 in favour of its removal, and is set to be installed at Cataraqui Cemetery where Macdonald is buried. In 2018, a statue of Macdonald was removed from outside Victoria City Hall, as part of the city&#x27;s program for reconciliation with local First Nations. The Macdonald Monument in Montreal has been repeatedly vandalized, and on 29 August 2020, the statue in the monument was vandalized, toppled and decapitated. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the actions and said the city plans to restore the statue.

Macdonald&#x27;s biographers note his contribution to establishing Canada as a nation. Swainson suggests that Macdonald&#x27;s desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook and contributed immeasurably to its character. Gwyn said Macdonald&#x27;s accomplishments of Confederation and building the Canadian railroad were great, but he was also responsible for scandals and bad government policy for the execution of Riel and the head tax on Chinese workers. In 2017, the Canadian Historical Association had voted to remove Macdonald&#x27;s name from their prize for best scholarly book about Canadian history. Historian James Daschuk acknowledges Macdonald&#x27;s contributions as a founding figure of Canada, but states &quot;He built the country. But he built the country on the backs of the Indigenous people.&quot; A biographical online article about Macdonald was deleted from the Scottish government&#x27;s website in August 2018. A spokesperson for the Scottish government stated: &quot;We acknowledge controversy around Sir John A Macdonald&#x27;s legacy and the legitimate concerns expressed by Indigenous communities&quot;. On 5 July 2021, Canada&#x27;s national library, Library and Archives Canada, deleted its web page on Canada&#x27;s prime ministers, &quot;First Among Equals&quot;, calling it &quot;outdated and redundant&quot;.

<text>John George Diefenbaker ( ; September 18, 1895 – August 16, 1979) was a Canadian politician who served as the 13th prime minister of Canada, from 1957 to 1963. He was the only Progressive Conservative party leader between 1930 and 1979 to lead the party to an election victory, doing so three times, although only once with a majority of the seats in the House of Commons.

Diefenbaker was born in the small town of Neustadt in Southwestern Ontario. In 1903, his family migrated west to the portion of the North-West Territories that would soon become the province of Saskatchewan. He grew up in the province and was interested in politics from a young age. After service in World War I, Diefenbaker became a noted criminal defence lawyer. He contested elections through the 1920s and 1930s with little success until he was finally elected to the House of Commons in 1940.

Diefenbaker was repeatedly a candidate for the party leadership. He gained that position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the party to its first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a snap election and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his cabinet (Ellen Fairclough), as well as the first Indigenous member of the Senate (James Gladstone). During his six years as prime minister, his government obtained passage of the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; and granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In 1962, Diefenbaker&#x27;s government eliminated racial discrimination in immigration policy. In foreign policy, his stance against apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government&#x27;s downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered for his role in the 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project.

In the 1962 federal election, the Progressive Conservatives narrowly won a minority government before losing power altogether in 1963. Diefenbaker stayed on as party leader, becoming Opposition leader, but his second loss at the polls prompted opponents within the party to force him to a leadership convention in 1967. Diefenbaker stood for re-election as party leader at the last moment, but attracted only minimal support and withdrew. He remained in parliament until his death in 1979, two months after Joe Clark became the first Progressive Conservative prime minister since Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker ranks average in rankings of prime ministers of Canada.

== Early life ==

Diefenbaker was born on September 18, 1895, in Neustadt, Ontario, to William Thomas Diefenbaker and Mary Florence Diefenbaker, née Bannerman. His father was the son of German immigrants from Adersbach (near Sinsheim) in Baden; Mary Diefenbaker was of Scottish descent and Diefenbaker was Baptist. The family moved to several locations in Ontario in John&#x27;s early years. William Diefenbaker was a teacher, and had deep interests in history and politics, which he sought to inculcate in his students. He had remarkable success doing so; of the 28 students at his school near Toronto in 1903, four, including his son, John, served as Conservative MPs in the 19th Canadian Parliament beginning in 1940 (the others were Robert Henry McGregor, Joseph Henry Harris, and George Tustin).

The Diefenbaker family moved west in 1903, for William Diefenbaker to accept a position near Fort Carlton, then in the Northwest Territories (now in Saskatchewan). In 1906, William claimed a quarter-section, of undeveloped land near Borden, Saskatchewan. In February 1910, the Diefenbaker family moved to Saskatoon, the site of the University of Saskatchewan. William and Mary Diefenbaker felt that John and his brother Elmer would have greater educational opportunities in Saskatoon.

John Diefenbaker had been interested in politics from an early age and told his mother at the age of eight or nine that he would some day be prime minister. She told him that it was an impossible ambition, especially for a boy living on the prairies. She would live to be proved wrong. John claimed that his first contact with politics came in 1910, when he sold a newspaper to Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in Saskatoon to lay the cornerstone for the university&#x27;s first building. The present and future prime ministers conversed, and when giving his speech that afternoon, Laurier mentioned the newsboy, who had ended their conversation by saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t waste any more time on you, Prime Minister. I must get about my work.&quot; The authenticity of the meeting was questioned in the 21st century, with an author suggesting that it was invented by Diefenbaker during an election campaign.

In a 1977 interview with the CBC, Diefenbaker recalled he saw injustice first-hand in his youth against French Canadians, Indigenous Canadians and the Métis. He said, &quot;From my earliest days, I knew the meaning of discrimination. Many Canadians were virtually second-hand citizens because of their names and racial origin. Indeed, it seemed until the end of World War II that the only first-class Canadians were either of English or French descent. As a youth, l determined to devote myself to assuring that all Canadians, whatever their racial origin, were equal and declared myself to be a sworn enemy of discrimination.&quot;

After graduating from high school in Saskatoon in 1912, Diefenbaker entered the University of Saskatchewan. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1915, and his Master of Arts the following year.

Diefenbaker was commissioned a lieutenant into the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion, CEF, in May 1916. In September of that year, Diefenbaker was part of a contingent of 300 junior officers sent to Britain for pre-deployment training. Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that he was hit by a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in him being sent home as an invalid. Diefenbaker&#x27;s recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.

After leaving the military in 1917, Diefenbaker returned to Saskatchewan where he resumed his work as an articling student in law. He received his law degree in 1919, the first student to secure three degrees from the University of Saskatchewan. On June 30, 1919, he was called to the bar, and the following day, opened a small practice in the village of Wakaw, Saskatchewan.

== Barrister and candidate (1919–1940) ==
=== Wakaw days (1919–1924) ===
Although Wakaw had a population of only 400, it sat at the heart of a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King&#x27;s Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker&#x27;s research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.

Diefenbaker won the local people over through his success; in his first year in practice, he tried 62 jury trials, winning approximately half of his cases. He rarely called defence witnesses, thereby avoiding the possibility of rebuttal witnesses for the Crown, and securing the last word for himself. In late 1920, he was elected to the village council to serve a three-year term.

Diefenbaker would often spend weekends with his parents in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.

After four years in Wakaw, Diefenbaker so dominated the local legal practice that his competitor left town. On May 1, 1924, Diefenbaker moved to Prince Albert, leaving a law partner in charge of the Wakaw office.

=== Aspiring politician (1924–1929) ===
Since 1905, when Saskatchewan entered Confederation, the province had been dominated by the Liberal Party, which practised highly effective machine politics. Diefenbaker was fond of stating, in his later years, that the only protection a Conservative had in the province was that afforded by the game laws.

Diefenbaker&#x27;s father, William, was a Liberal; however, John Diefenbaker found himself attracted to the Conservative Party. Free trade was widely popular throughout Western Canada, but Diefenbaker was convinced by the Conservative position that free trade would make Canada an economic dependent of the United States. However, he did not speak publicly of his politics. Diefenbaker recalled in his memoirs that, in 1921, he had been elected as secretary of the Wakaw Liberal Association while absent in Saskatoon, and had returned to find the association&#x27;s records in his office. He promptly returned them to the association president. Diefenbaker also stated that he had been told that if he became a Liberal candidate, &quot;there was no position in the province which would not be open to him.&quot;

It was not until 1925 that Diefenbaker publicly came forward as a Conservative, a year in which both federal and Saskatchewan provincial elections were held. Journalist Peter C. Newman, in his best-selling account of the Diefenbaker years, suggested that this choice was made for practical, rather than political reasons, as Diefenbaker had little chance of defeating established politicians and securing the Liberal nomination for either the House of Commons or the Legislative Assembly. The provincial election took place in early June; Liberals would later claim that Diefenbaker had campaigned for their party in the election. On June 19, however, Diefenbaker addressed a Conservative organizing committee, and on August 6, was nominated as the party&#x27;s candidate for the federal riding of Prince Albert, a district in which the party&#x27;s last candidate had lost his election deposit. A nasty campaign ensued, in which Diefenbaker was called a &quot;Hun&quot; because of his German-derived surname. The 1925 federal election was held on October 29; he finished third behind the Liberal and Progressive Party candidates, losing his deposit.
The winning candidate, Charles McDonald, did not hold the seat long, resigning it to open a place for the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, who had been defeated in his Ontario riding. The Tories ran no candidate against King in the by-election on February 15, 1926, and he won easily. Although in the 1925 federal election, the Conservatives had won the greatest number of seats, King continued as prime minister with the support of the Progressives. Mackenzie King held office for several months until he finally resigned when the Governor General, Lord Byng, refused a dissolution. Conservative Party leader Arthur Meighen became prime minister, but was quickly defeated in the House of Commons, and Byng finally granted a dissolution of Parliament. Diefenbaker, who had been confirmed as Conservative candidate, stood against King in the 1926 election, a rare direct electoral contest between two individuals who had or would become prime minister. King triumphed easily over Diefenbaker, the Liberals won the federal election, and King regained his position as prime minister.

=== Perennial candidate (1929–1940) ===
Diefenbaker stood for the Legislative Assembly in the 1929 provincial election. He was defeated, but Saskatchewan Conservatives formed their first government, with help from smaller parties. As the defeated Conservative candidate for Prince Albert, he was given charge of political patronage there and was created a King&#x27;s Counsel. Three weeks after his electoral defeat, he married Saskatoon teacher Edna Brower.

Diefenbaker chose not to stand for the House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained a majority in the election, and party leader R. B. Bennett became prime minister. Diefenbaker continued a high-profile legal practice, and in 1933, ran for mayor of Prince Albert. He was defeated by 48 votes in an election in which over 2,000 ballots were cast.

In 1934, when the Crown prosecutor for Prince Albert resigned to become the Conservative Party&#x27;s legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did not stand in the 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as prime minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In the waning days of the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party president was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party&#x27;s vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.

Saskatchewan Conservatives eventually arranged a leadership convention for October 28, 1936. Eleven people were nominated, including Diefenbaker. The other ten candidates withdrew, and Diefenbaker won the position by default. Diefenbaker asked the federal party for $10,000 in financial support, but the funds were refused, and the Conservatives were shut out of the legislature in the 1938 provincial elections for the second consecutive time. Diefenbaker himself was defeated in the Arm River riding by 190 votes. With the province-wide Conservative vote having fallen to 12 percent, Diefenbaker offered his resignation to a post-election party meeting in Moose Jaw, but it was refused. Diefenbaker continued to run the provincial party out of his law office and paid the party&#x27;s debts from his own pocket.

Diefenbaker quietly sought the Conservative nomination for the federal riding of Lake Centre but was unwilling to risk a divisive intra-party squabble. In what Diefenbaker biographer Smith states &quot;appears to have been an elaborate and prearranged charade&quot;, Diefenbaker attended the nominating convention as keynote speaker, but withdrew when his name was proposed, stating a local man should be selected. The winner among the six remaining candidates, riding president W. B. Kelly, declined the nomination, urging the delegates to select Diefenbaker, which they promptly did. Mackenzie King called a general election for March 25, 1940. The incumbent in Lake Centre was Liberal John Frederick Johnston. Diefenbaker campaigned aggressively in Lake Centre, holding 63 rallies and seeking to appeal to members of all parties. On election day, he defeated Johnston by 280 votes on what was otherwise a disastrous day for the Conservatives, who won only 39 seats out of the 245 in the House of Commons—their lowest total since Confederation.

== Parliamentary rise (1940–1957) ==

=== Mackenzie King years (1940–1948) ===
Diefenbaker joined a shrunken and demoralized Conservative caucus in the House of Commons. The Conservative leader, Robert Manion, failed to win a place in the Commons in the election, which saw the Liberals take 181 seats. The Tories sought to be included in a wartime coalition government, but Mackenzie King refused. The House of Commons had only a slight role in the war effort; under the state of emergency, most business was accomplished through the Cabinet issuing Orders in Council.

Diefenbaker was appointed to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined the wartime rules which allowed arrest and detention without trial. On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his maiden speech in the House of Commons, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. In his memoirs, Diefenbaker wrote he waged an unsuccessful fight against the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians, but historians say that the fight against the internment never took place.

According to Diefenbaker&#x27;s biographer, Denis Smith, the Conservative MP quietly admired Mackenzie King for his political skills. However, Diefenbaker proved a gadfly and an annoyance to Mackenzie King. Angered by the words of Diefenbaker and fellow Conservative MP Howard Green in seeking to censure the government, the Prime Minister referred to Conservative MPs as &quot;a mob&quot;. When Diefenbaker accompanied two other Conservative leaders to a briefing by Mackenzie King on the war, the Prime Minister exploded at Diefenbaker (a constituent of his), &quot;What business do you have to be here? You strike me to the heart every time you speak.&quot;

The Conservatives elected a floor leader, and in 1941 approached former prime minister Meighen, who had been appointed as a senator by Bennett, about becoming party leader again. Meighen agreed, and resigned his Senate seat, but lost a by-election for an Ontario seat in the House of Commons. He remained as leader for several months, although he could not enter the chamber of the House of Commons. Meighen sought to move the Tories to the left, in order to undercut the Liberals and to take support away from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)). To that end, he sought to draft the Liberal-Progressive premier of Manitoba, John Bracken, to lead the Conservatives. Diefenbaker objected to what he saw as an attempt to rig the party&#x27;s choice of new leader and stood for the leadership himself at the party&#x27;s 1942 leadership convention. Bracken was elected on the second ballot; Diefenbaker finished a distant third in both polls. At Bracken&#x27;s request, the convention changed the party&#x27;s name to &quot;Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.&quot; Bracken chose not to seek entry to the House through a by-election, and when the Conservatives elected a new floor leader, Diefenbaker was defeated by one vote.

Bracken was elected to the Commons in the 1945 general election, and for the first time in five years the Tories had their party leader in the House of Commons. The Progressive Conservatives won 67 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 125, with smaller parties and independents winning 52 seats. Diefenbaker increased his majority to over 1,000 votes, and had the satisfaction of seeing Mackenzie King defeated in Prince Albert—albeit by a CCF candidate. The Prime Minister was returned in an Ontario by-election within months.

Diefenbaker staked out a position on the populist left of the PC party. Though most Canadians were content to look to Parliament for protection of civil liberties, Diefenbaker called for a Bill of Rights, calling it &quot;the only way to stop the march on the part of the government towards arbitrary power&quot;. He objected to the great powers used by the Mackenzie King government to attempt to root out Soviet spies after the war, such as imprisonment without trial, and complained about the government&#x27;s proclivity for letting its wartime powers become permanent.

=== Leadership contender (1948–1956) ===

In early 1948, Mackenzie King, now aged 73, announced his retirement; later that year Louis St. Laurent succeeded him. Although Bracken had nearly doubled the Tory representation in the House, prominent Tories were increasingly unhappy with his leadership and pressured him to stand down. These party bosses believed that Ontario Premier George A. Drew, who had won three successive provincial elections and had even made inroads in francophone ridings, was the man to lead the Progressive Conservatives to victory. When Bracken resigned on July 17, 1948, Diefenbaker announced his candidacy. The party&#x27;s backers, principally financiers headquartered on Toronto&#x27;s Bay Street, preferred Drew&#x27;s conservative political stances to Diefenbaker&#x27;s Western populism. Tory leaders packed the 1948 leadership convention in Ottawa in favour of Drew, appointing more than 300 delegates at-large. One cynical party member commented, &quot;Ghost delegates with ghost ballots, marked by the ghostly hidden hand of Bay Street, are going to pick George Drew, and he&#x27;ll deliver a ghost-written speech that&#x27;ll cheer us all up, as we march briskly into a political graveyard.&quot; Drew easily defeated Diefenbaker on the first ballot. St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and the Tories were decimated, falling to 41 seats, only two more than the party&#x27;s 1940 nadir. Despite intense efforts to make the Progressive Conservatives appeal to Quebecers, the party won only two seats in the province.

Newman argued that but for Diefenbaker&#x27;s many defeats, he would never have become prime minister:

If, as a neophyte lawyer, he had succeeded in winning the Prince Albert seat in the federal elections of 1925 or 1926, ... Diefenbaker would probably have been remembered only as an obscure minister in Bennett&#x27;s Depression cabinet ... If he had carried his home-town mayoralty in 1933, ... he&#x27;d probably not be remembered at all ... If he had succeeded in his bid for the national leadership in 1942, he might have taken the place of John Bracken on his six-year march to oblivion as leader of a party that had not changed itself enough to follow a Prairie radical ... [If he had defeated Drew in 1948, he] would have been free to flounder before the political strength of Louis St. Laurent in the 1949 and 1953 campaigns.

The governing Liberals repeatedly attempted to draw Diefenbaker&#x27;s seat out from under him. In 1948, Lake Centre was redistricted to remove areas which strongly supported Diefenbaker. In spite of that, he was returned in the 1949 election, the only PC member from Saskatchewan. In 1952, a redistricting committee dominated by Liberals abolished Lake Centre entirely, dividing its voters among three other ridings. Diefenbaker stated in his memoirs that he had considered retiring from the House; with Drew only a year older than he was, the Westerner saw little prospect of advancement and had received tempting offers from Ontario law firms. However, the gerrymandering so angered him that he decided to fight for a seat. Diefenbaker&#x27;s party had taken Prince Albert only once, in 1911, but he decided to stand in that riding for the 1953 election and was successful. He would hold that seat for the rest of his life. Even though Diefenbaker campaigned nationally for party candidates, the Progressive Conservatives gained little, rising to 51 seats as St. Laurent led the Liberals to a fifth successive majority. In addition to trying to secure his departure from Parliament, the government opened a home for unwed Indian mothers next door to Diefenbaker&#x27;s home in Prince Albert.

Diefenbaker continued practising law. In 1951, he gained national attention by accepting the &quot;Atherton&quot; case, in which a young telegraph operator had been accused of negligently causing a train crash by omitting crucial information from a message. Twenty-one people were killed, mostly Canadian troops bound for Korea. Diefenbaker paid $1,500 and sat a token bar examination to join the Law Society of British Columbia to take the case, and gained an acquittal, prejudicing the jury against the Crown prosecutor and pointing out a previous case in which interference had caused information to be lost in transmission.

In the mid-1940s Edna began to suffer mental illness and was placed in a private psychiatric hospital for a time. She later fell ill from leukemia and died in 1951. In 1953, Diefenbaker married Olive Palmer (formerly Olive Freeman), whom he had courted while living in Wakaw. Olive Diefenbaker became a great source of strength to her husband. There were no children born of either marriage. In 2013, claims were made that he fathered at least two sons out of wedlock, based a DNA test which, according to the test conductor, a 99.99% chance that the two individuals were related, with no other known commonality between them other than that Diefenbaker employed both mothers.

Diefenbaker won Prince Albert in 1953, even as the Tories suffered a second consecutive disastrous defeat under Drew. Speculation arose in the press that the leader might be pressured to step aside. Drew was determined to remain, however, and Diefenbaker was careful to avoid any action that might be seen as disloyal. However, Diefenbaker was never a member of the &quot;Five O&#x27;clock Club&quot; of Drew intimates who met the leader in his office for a drink and gossip each day. By 1955, there was a widespread feeling among Tories that Drew was not capable of leading the party to a victory. At the same time, the Liberals were in flux as the aging St. Laurent tired of politics. Drew was able to damage the government in a weeks-long battle over the TransCanada pipeline in 1956—the so-called Pipeline Debate—in which the government, in a hurry to obtain financing for the pipeline, imposed closure before the debate even began. The Tories and the CCF combined to obstruct business in the House for weeks before the Liberals were finally able to pass the measure. Diefenbaker played a relatively minor role in the Pipeline Debate, speaking only once.
=== Leader of the Opposition; 1957 election ===
By 1956, the Social Credit Party was becoming a potential rival to the Tories as Canada&#x27;s main right-wing party. Canadian journalist and author Bruce Hutchison discussed the state of the Tories in 1956:

When a party calling itself Conservative can think of nothing better than to outbid the Government&#x27;s election promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results ... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years ... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory.

In August 1956, Drew fell ill and many within the party urged him to step aside, feeling that the Progressive Conservatives needed vigorous leadership with an election likely within a year. He resigned in late September, and Diefenbaker immediately announced his candidacy for the leadership. A number of Progressive Conservative leaders, principally from the Ontario wing of the party, started a &quot;Stop Diefenbaker&quot; movement, and wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a possible candidate. When Smith declined, they could find no one of comparable stature to stand against Diefenbaker. The only serious competition to Diefenbaker came from Donald Fleming, who had finished third at the previous leadership convention, but his having repeatedly criticised Drew&#x27;s leadership ensured that the critical Ontario delegates would not back Fleming, all but destroying his chances of victory. At the leadership convention in Ottawa in December 1956, Diefenbaker won on the first ballot, and the dissidents reconciled themselves to his victory. After all, they reasoned, Diefenbaker was now 61 and unlikely to lead the party for more than one general election, an election they believed would be won by the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.

In January 1957, Diefenbaker took his place as Leader of the Official Opposition. In February, St. Laurent informed him that Parliament would be dissolved in April for an election on June 10. The Liberals submitted a budget in March; Diefenbaker attacked it for overly high taxes, failure to assist pensioners, and a lack of aid for the poorer provinces. Parliament was dissolved on April 12. St. Laurent was so confident of victory that he did not even bother to make recommendations to the Governor General to fill the 16 vacancies in the Senate.

Diefenbaker ran on a platform which concentrated on changes in domestic policies. He pledged to work with the provinces to reform the Senate. He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom. St. Laurent called the Tory platform &quot;a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance&quot;. Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more interested in seeing people than in talking to cameras. Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only real option was to re-elect St. Laurent.

Diefenbaker characterized the Tory program in a nationwide telecast on April 30:

It is a program ... for a united Canada, for one Canada, for Canada first, in every aspect of our political and public life, for the welfare of the average man and woman. That is my approach to public affairs and has been throughout my life ... A Canada, united from Coast to Coast, wherein there will be freedom for the individual, freedom of enterprise and where there will be a Government which, in all its actions, will remain the servant and not the master of the people.

The final Gallup poll before the election showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just before the election, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale the morning after the vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have attempted to form a government, however, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with the Progressive Conservatives, he would have likely faced a quick defeat at the Commons. St. Laurent instead resigned, making Diefenbaker prime minister.

=== Domestic events and policies ===

==== Minority government ====

When John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21, 1957, only one Progressive Conservative MP, Earl Rowe, had served in federal governmental office, for a brief period under Bennett in 1935. Rowe was no friend of Diefenbaker – he had briefly served as the party&#x27;s acting leader in-between Drew&#x27;s resignation and Diefenbaker&#x27;s election, and did not definitively rule himself out of running to succeed Drew permanently until a relatively late stage, contributing to Diefenbaker&#x27;s mistrust of him – and was given no place in his government. Diefenbaker appointed Ellen Fairclough as Secretary of State for Canada, the first woman to be appointed to a Cabinet post, and Michael Starr as Minister of Labour, the first Canadian of Ukrainian descent to serve in Cabinet.

As the Parliament buildings had been lent to the Universal Postal Union for its 14th congress, Diefenbaker was forced to wait until the fall to convene Parliament. However, the Cabinet approved measures that summer, including increased price supports for butter and turkeys, and raises for federal employees. Once the 23rd Canadian Parliament was opened on October 14 by Queen Elizabeth II – the first to be opened by any Canadian monarch – the government rapidly passed legislation, including tax cuts and increases in old age pensions. The Liberals were ineffective in opposition, with the party in the midst of a leadership race after St. Laurent&#x27;s resignation as party leader.

With the Conservatives leading in the polls, Diefenbaker wanted a new election, hopeful that his party would gain a majority of seats. The strong Liberal presence meant that the Governor General could refuse a dissolution request early in a parliament&#x27;s term and allow them to form government if Diefenbaker resigned. Diefenbaker sought a pretext for a new election.

Such an excuse presented itself when former Secretary of State for External Affairs Lester Pearson attended his first parliamentary session as Leader of the Opposition on January 20, 1958, four days after becoming the Liberal leader. In his first speech as leader, Pearson (recently returned from Oslo where he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize), moved an amendment to supply, and called, not for an election, but for the Progressive Conservatives to resign, allowing the Liberals to form a government. Pearson stated that the condition of the economy required &quot;a Government pledged to implement Liberal policies&quot;. Government MPs laughed at Pearson, as did members of the press who were present. Pearson later recorded in his memoirs that he knew that his &quot;first attack on the government had been a failure, indeed a fiasco&quot;. Diefenbaker spoke for two hours and three minutes, and devastated his Liberal opposition. He mocked Pearson, contrasting the party leader&#x27;s address at the Liberal leadership convention with his speech to the House:

On Thursday there was shrieking defiance, on the following Monday there is shrinking indecision ... The only reason that this motion is worded as it is[,] is that my honourable friends opposite quake when they think of what will happen if an election comes ... It is the resignation from responsibility of a great party.

Diefenbaker read from an internal report provided to the St. Laurent government in early 1957, warning that a recession was coming, and stated:

Across the way, Mr. Speaker, sit the purveyors of gloom who would endeavour for political purposes, to panic the Canadian people ... They had a warning ... Did they tell us that? No. Mr. Speaker, why did they not reveal this? Why did they not act when the House was sitting in January, February, March, and April? They had the information ... You concealed the facts, that is what you did.

According to the Minister of Finance, Donald Fleming, &quot;Pearson looked at first merry, then serious, then uncomfortable, then disturbed, and finally sick.&quot; Pearson recorded in his memoirs that the Prime Minister &quot;tore me to shreds&quot;. Prominent Liberal frontbencher Paul Martin called Diefenbaker&#x27;s response &quot;one of the greatest devastating speeches&quot; and &quot;Diefenbaker&#x27;s great hour&quot;. On February 1, Diefenbaker asked the Governor General, Vincent Massey, to dissolve Parliament, alleging that though St. Laurent had promised cooperation, Pearson had made it clear he would not follow his predecessor&#x27;s lead. Massey agreed to the dissolution, and Diefenbaker set an election date of March 31, 1958.

==== 1958 election ====
The 1958 election campaign saw a huge outpouring of public support for the Progressive Conservatives. At the opening campaign rally in Winnipeg on February 12 voters filled the hall until the doors had to be closed for safety reasons. They were promptly broken down by the crowd outside. At the rally, Diefenbaker called for &quot;[a] new vision. A new hope. A new soul for Canada.&quot; He pledged to open the Canadian North, to seek out its resources and make it a place for settlements. The conclusion to his speech expounded on what became known as &quot;The Vision&quot;,

This is the vision: One Canada. One Canada, where Canadians will have preserved to them the control of their own economic and political destiny. Sir John A. Macdonald saw a Canada from east to west: he opened the west. I see a new Canada—a Canada of the North. This is the vision!

Pierre Sévigny, who would be elected an MP in 1958, recalled the gathering, &quot;When he had finished that speech, as he was walking to the door, I saw people kneel and kiss his coat. Not one, but many. People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after.&quot; When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words &quot;Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!&quot; (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton &quot;thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy.&quot; Michael Starr remembered, &quot;That was the most fantastic election ... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed ... The halls would be filled with people and sitting there in the front would be the first Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work ... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces ... I don&#x27;t care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on.&quot;

Pearson and his Liberals faltered badly in the campaign. The Liberal Party leader tried to make an issue of the fact that Diefenbaker had called a winter election, generally disfavoured in Canada due to travel difficulties. Pearson&#x27;s objection cut little ice with voters, and served only to remind the electorate that the Liberals, at their convention, had called for an election. Pearson mocked Diefenbaker&#x27;s northern plans as &quot;igloo-to-igloo&quot; communications, and was assailed by the Prime Minister for being condescending. The Liberal leader spoke to small, quiet crowds, which quickly left the halls when he was done. By election day, Pearson had no illusions that he might win the election, and hoped only to salvage 100 seats. The Liberals would be limited to less than half of that.

On March 31, 1958, the Tories won what is still the largest majority (in terms of percentage of seats) in Canadian federal political history, winning 208 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 48, with the CCF winning 8 and Social Credit wiped out. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority of the votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Union Nationale&quot; political machine had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, &quot;Union Nationale&quot; boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery of his party behind the Tories.

==== Mandate (1958–1962) ====

An economic downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because of tax cuts instituted the previous year, the government&#x27;s budget predicted a small deficit for 1957–58 and a large one, $648 million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory Bond issue, which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker&#x27;s part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led to an increase in the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government&#x27;s efforts to respond to unemployment.

As a trial lawyer, and in opposition, Diefenbaker had long been concerned with civil liberties. On July 1, 1960, Dominion Day, he introduced the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; in Parliament. The bill rapidly passed and was proclaimed on August 10, fulfilling a lifetime goal of Diefenbaker&#x27;s, as he had begun drafting it as early as 1936. The document purported to guarantee fundamental freedoms, with special attention to the rights of the accused. However, as a mere piece of federal legislation, it could be amended by any other law, and civil liberties were to a large extent a matter of provincial, rather than federal, jurisdiction. One lawyer remarked that the document provided rights for all Canadians, &quot;so long as they don&#x27;t live in any of the provinces&quot;. Diefenbaker had appointed the first First Nations member of the Senate, James Gladstone, in January 1958, and in 1960, his government extended voting rights to all native people. In 1962, Diefenbaker&#x27;s government eliminated race discrimination clauses in immigration laws.

Diefenbaker pursued a &quot;One Canada&quot; policy, seeking equality of all Canadians. As part of that philosophy, he was unwilling to make special concessions to Quebec&#x27;s francophones. Thomas Van Dusen, who served as Diefenbaker&#x27;s executive assistant and wrote a book about him, characterized the leader&#x27;s views on this issue:

There must be no compromise with Canada&#x27;s existence as a nation. Opting out, two flags, two pension plans, associated states, Two Nations and all the other baggage of political dualism was ushering Quebec out of Confederation on the instalment plan. He could not accept any theory of two nations, however worded, because it would make of those neither French nor English second-class citizens.

Diefenbaker&#x27;s disinclination to make concessions to Quebec, along with the disintegration of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, the failure of the Tories to build an effective structure in Quebec, and Diefenbaker appointing few Quebeckers to his Cabinet (and none to senior positions), all led to an erosion of Progressive Conservative support in Quebec. Diefenbaker did recommend the appointment of the first French-Canadian governor general, Georges Vanier.

By mid-1961, differences in monetary policy led to open conflict with Bank of Canada Governor Coyne, who adhered to a tight money policy. Appointed by St. Laurent to a term expiring in December 1961, Coyne could only be dismissed before then by the passing of an Act of Parliament. Coyne defended his position by giving public speeches, to the dismay of the government. The Cabinet was also angered when it learned that Coyne and his board had passed amendments to the bank&#x27;s pension scheme which greatly increased Coyne&#x27;s pension, without publishing the amendments in the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot; as required by law. Negotiations between Minister of Finance Fleming and Coyne for the latter&#x27;s resignation broke down, with the governor making the dispute public, and Diefenbaker sought to dismiss Coyne by legislation. Diefenbaker was able to get legislation to dismiss Coyne through the House, but the Liberal-controlled Senate invited Coyne to testify before one of its committees. After giving the governor a platform against the government, the committee then chose to take no further action, adding its view that Coyne had done nothing wrong. Once he had the opportunity to testify (denied him in the Commons), Coyne resigned, keeping his increased pension, and the government was extensively criticized in the press.

By the time Diefenbaker called an election for June 18, 1962, the party had been damaged by loss of support in Quebec and in urban areas as voters grew disillusioned with Diefenbaker and the Tories. The PC campaign was hurt when the Bank of Canada was forced to devalue the Canadian dollar to  US cents; it had previously hovered in the range from 95 cents to par with the United States dollar. Privately printed satirical &quot;Diefenbucks&quot; swept the country. On election day, the Progressive Conservatives lost 92 seats, but were still able to form a minority government. The New Democratic Party (the successor to the CCF) and Social Credit held the balance of power in the new Parliament.

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Britain and the Commonwealth ====
Diefenbaker attended a meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports instead be spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain&#x27;s entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain&#x27;s initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.

Through 1959, the Diefenbaker government had a policy of not criticizing South Africa and its apartheid government. In this stance, Diefenbaker had the support of the Liberals but not that of CCF leader Hazen Argue. In 1960, however, the South Africans sought to maintain membership in the Commonwealth even if South African white voters chose to make the country a republic in a referendum scheduled for later that year. South Africa asked that year&#x27;s Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference to allow it to remain in the Commonwealth regardless of the result of the referendum. Diefenbaker privately expressed his distaste for apartheid to South African External Affairs Minister Eric Louw and urged him to give the black and coloured people of South Africa at least the minimal representation they had originally had. Louw, attending the conference as Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd recovered from an assassination attempt, refused. The conference resolved that an advance decision would be interfering in South Africa&#x27;s internal affairs.

On October 5, 1960, South Africa&#x27;s white voters decided to make the country a republic. At the Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in 1961, Verwoerd formally applied for South Africa to remain in the Commonwealth. The prime ministers were divided; Diefenbaker broke the deadlock by proposing that South Africa only be re-admitted if it joined other states in condemning apartheid in principle. Once it became clear that South Africa&#x27;s membership would be rejected, Verwoerd withdrew his country&#x27;s application to remain in the Commonwealth and left the group. According to Peter Newman, this was &quot;Diefenbaker&#x27;s most important contribution to international politics ... Diefenbaker flew home, a hero.&quot;

==== Policy towards the United States ====

===== Ike and John: the Eisenhower years =====
American officials were uncomfortable with Diefenbaker&#x27;s initial election, believing they had heard undertones of anti-Americanism in the campaign. After years of the Liberals, one U.S. State Department official noted, &quot;We&#x27;ll be dealing with an unknown quantity.&quot; U.S. officials viewed Diefenbaker&#x27;s 1958 landslide with disappointment; they knew and liked Pearson from his years in diplomacy and felt the Liberal Party leader would be more likely to institute pro-American policies. However, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower took pains to foster good relations with Diefenbaker. The two men found much in common, from Western farm backgrounds to a love of fishing, and Diefenbaker had an admiration for war leaders such as Eisenhower and Churchill. Diefenbaker wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I might add that President Eisenhower and I were from our first meeting on an &#x27;Ike–John&#x27; basis, and that we were as close as the nearest telephone.&quot; The Eisenhower–Diefenbaker relationship was sufficiently strong that the touchy Canadian Prime Minister was prepared to overlook slights. When Eisenhower addressed Parliament in October 1958, he downplayed trade concerns that Diefenbaker had publicly expressed. Diefenbaker said nothing and took Eisenhower fishing.

Diefenbaker had approved plans to join the United States in what became known as NORAD, an integrated air defence system, in mid-1957. Despite Liberal misgivings that Diefenbaker had committed Canada to the system before consulting either the Cabinet or Parliament, Pearson and his followers voted with the government to approve NORAD in June 1958.

In 1959, the Diefenbaker government cancelled the development and manufacture of the Avro CF-105 Arrow. The Arrow was a supersonic jet interceptor built by Avro Canada in Malton, Ontario, to defend Canada in the event of a Soviet attack. The interceptor had been under development since 1953, and had suffered from many cost overruns and complications. In 1955, the RCAF stated it would need only nine squadrons of Arrows, down from 20, as originally proposed. According to C. D. Howe, the former minister responsible for postwar reconstruction, the St. Laurent government had serious misgivings about continuing the Arrow program, and planned to discuss its termination after the 1957 election. In the run-up to the 1958 election, with three Tory-held seats at risk in the Malton area, the Diefenbaker government authorized further funding. Even though the first test flights of the Arrow were successful, the US government was unwilling to commit to a purchase of aircraft from Canada. In September 1958, Diefenbaker warned that the Arrow would come under complete review in six months. The company began seeking out other projects including a US-funded &quot;saucer&quot; program that became the VZ-9 Avrocar, and also mounted a public relations offensive urging that the Arrow go into full production. On February 20, 1959, the Cabinet decided to cancel the Avro Arrow, following an earlier decision to permit the United States to build two Bomarc missile bases in Canada. The company immediately dismissed its 14,000 employees, blaming Diefenbaker for the firings, though it rehired 2,500 employees to fulfill existing obligations.

Although Diefenbaker and Eisenhower had a strong relationship, by 1960 U.S. officials were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 presidential election, but when Nixon&#x27;s Democratic opponent, Senator John F. Kennedy, won the race, he sent Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked what had become of Diefenbaker&#x27;s note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect&#x27;s slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.

===== Bilateral antipathy: the Kennedy administration =====
Kennedy and Diefenbaker started off well, but matters soon worsened. When the two met in Washington on February 20, Kennedy impressed Diefenbaker, and the Prime Minister invited Kennedy to visit Ottawa. Kennedy, however, told his aides that he never wanted &quot;to see the boring son of a bitch again&quot;. The Ottawa visit began awkwardly. Kennedy accidentally left behind a briefing note suggesting he &quot;push&quot; Diefenbaker on several issues, including the decision to accept nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, which bitterly divided the Canadian Cabinet. Diefenbaker was also annoyed by Kennedy&#x27;s speech to Parliament, in which he urged Canada to join the OAS (which Diefenbaker had already rejected), and by the President spending most of his time talking to Leader of the Opposition Pearson at the formal dinner. Both Kennedy and his wife Jackie were bored by Diefenbaker&#x27;s Churchill anecdotes at lunch, stories that Jackie Kennedy later described as &quot;painful&quot;.

Diefenbaker was initially inclined to go along with Kennedy&#x27;s request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961 letter from Kennedy which urged this was leaked to the media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The Prime Minister was also influenced by a massive demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill. Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.

By 1962, the American government was becoming increasingly concerned at the lack of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant&#x27;s report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy, and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.

Kennedy was careful to avoid overt favouritism during the 1962 Canadian election campaign. Several times during the campaign, Diefenbaker stated that the Kennedy administration desired his defeat because he refused to &quot;bow down to Washington.&quot; After Diefenbaker was returned with a minority, Washington continued to press for acceptance of nuclear arms, but Diefenbaker, faced with a split between Defence Minister Douglas Harkness and External Affairs Minister Howard Green on the question, continued to stall, hoping that time and events would invite consensus.

When the Cuban Missile Crisis erupted in October 1962, Kennedy chose not to consult with Diefenbaker before deciding on what actions to take. The President sent former Ambassador Merchant to Ottawa to inform the Prime Minister as to the content of the speech that Kennedy was to make on television. Diefenbaker was upset at both the lack of consultation and the fact that he was given less than two hours advance word. He was angered again when the U.S. government released a statement stating that it had Canada&#x27;s full support. In a statement to the Commons, Diefenbaker proposed sending representatives of neutral nations to Cuba to verify the American allegations, which Washington took to mean that he was questioning Kennedy&#x27;s word. When American forces went to a heightened alert, DEFCON 3, Diefenbaker was slow to order Canadian forces to match it. Harkness and the Chiefs of Staff had Canadian forces clandestinely go to that alert status anyway, and Diefenbaker eventually authorized it. The crisis ended without war, and polls found that Canadians widely supported Kennedy&#x27;s actions. Diefenbaker was severely criticized in the media.

=== Downfall ===
On January 3, 1963, NATO Supreme Commander General Lauris Norstad visited Ottawa, in one of a series of visits to member nations prior to his retirement. At a news conference, Norstad stated that if Canada did not accept nuclear weapons, it would not be fulfilling its commitments to NATO. Newspapers across Canada criticized Diefenbaker, who was convinced the statement was part of a plot by Kennedy to bring down his government. Although the Liberals had been previously indecisive on the question of nuclear weapons, on January 12, Pearson made a speech stating that the government should live up to its commitments.

With the Cabinet still divided between adherents of Green and Harkness, Diefenbaker made a speech in the Commons on January 25 that Fleming (by then Minister of Justice) termed &quot;a model of obfuscation.&quot; Harkness was initially convinced that Diefenbaker was saying that he would support nuclear warheads in Canada. After talking to the press, he realized that his view of the speech was not universally shared, and he asked Diefenbaker for clarification. Diefenbaker, however, continued to try to avoid taking a firm position. On January 30, the U.S. State Department issued a press release suggesting that Diefenbaker had made misstatements in his Commons speech. For the first time ever, Canada recalled its ambassador to Washington as a diplomatic protest. Though all parties condemned the State Department action, the three parties outside the government demanded that Diefenbaker take a stand on the nuclear weapon issue.

The bitter divisions within the Cabinet continued, with Diefenbaker deliberating whether to call an election on the issue of American interference in Canadian politics. At least six Cabinet ministers favoured Diefenbaker&#x27;s ouster. Finally, at a dramatic Cabinet meeting on Sunday, February 3, Harkness told Diefenbaker that the Prime Minister no longer had the confidence of the Canadian people, and resigned. Diefenbaker asked ministers supporting him to stand, and when only about half did, stated that he was going to see the Governor General to resign, and that Fleming would be the next Prime Minister. Green called his Cabinet colleagues a &quot;nest of traitors,&quot; but eventually cooler heads prevailed, and Diefenbaker was urged to return and to fight the motion of non-confidence scheduled for the following day. Harkness, however, persisted in his resignation. Negotiations with the Social Credit Party, which had enough votes to save the government, failed, and the government fell, 142–111.

Two members of the government resigned the day after the government lost the vote. As the campaign opened, the Tories trailed in the polls by 15 points. To Pearson and his Liberals, the only question was how large a majority they would win. Peter Stursberg, who wrote two books about the Diefenbaker years, stated of that campaign:

For the old Diefenbaker was in full cry. All the agony of the disintegration of his government was gone, and he seemed to be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker&#x27;s finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.

Though the White House maintained public neutrality, Kennedy privately made it clear he desired a Liberal victory, and lent Lou Harris, his pollster to work for the Liberals again. On election day, April 8, 1963, the Liberals claimed 129 seats to the Tories&#x27; 95, five seats short of an absolute majority. Diefenbaker held to power for several days, until six Quebec Social Credit MPs signed a statement that Pearson should form the government. These votes would be enough to give Pearson support of a majority of the House of Commons, and Diefenbaker resigned. The six MPs repudiated the statement within days. Nonetheless, Pearson formed a government with the support of the NDP.

== Later years (1963–1979) ==
=== Return to opposition ===
Diefenbaker continued to lead the Progressive Conservatives, again as Leader of the Opposition. In November 1963, upon hearing of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, the Tory leader addressed the Commons, stating, &quot;A beacon of freedom has gone. Whatever the disagreement, to me he stood as the embodiment of freedom, not only in his own country, but throughout the world.&quot; In the 1964 Great Canadian Flag Debate, Diefenbaker led the unsuccessful opposition to the Maple Leaf flag, which the Liberals pushed for after the rejection of Pearson&#x27;s preferred design showing three maple leaves. Diefenbaker preferred the existing Canadian Red Ensign or another design showing symbols of the nation&#x27;s heritage. He dismissed the adopted design, with a single red maple leaf and two red bars, as &quot;a flag that Peruvians might salute&quot;, a reference to Peru&#x27;s red-white-red tricolour. At the request of Quebec Tory Léon Balcer, who feared devastating PC losses in the province at the next election, Pearson imposed closure, and the bill passed with the majority singing &quot;O Canada&quot; as Diefenbaker led the dissenters in &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.

In 1966, the Liberals began to make an issue of the Munsinger affair—two officials of the Diefenbaker government had slept with a woman suspected of being a Soviet spy. In what Diefenbaker saw as a partisan attack, Pearson established a one-man Royal Commission, which, according to Diefenbaker biographer Smith, indulged in &quot;three months of reckless political inquisition&quot;. By the time the commission issued its report, Diefenbaker and other former ministers had long since withdrawn their counsel from the proceedings. The report faulted Diefenbaker for not dismissing the ministers in question, but found no actual security breach.

There were calls for Diefenbaker&#x27;s retirement, especially from the Bay Street wing of the party as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to remove him without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly at the expense of the smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.

In the absence of a formal leadership review process, Camp was able to stage a de facto review by running for re-election as party president on the platform of holding a leadership convention within a year. His campaign at the Tories&#x27; 1966 convention occurred amidst allegations of vote rigging, violence, and seating arrangements designed to ensure that when Diefenbaker addressed the delegates, television viewers would see unmoved delegates in the first ten rows. Other Camp supporters tried to shout Diefenbaker down. Camp was successful in being re-elected thereby forcing a leadership convention for 1967. Diefenbaker initially made no announcement as to whether he would stand, but angered by a resolution at the party&#x27;s policy conference which spoke of &quot;deux nations&quot; or &quot;two founding peoples&quot; (as opposed to Diefenbaker&#x27;s &quot;One Canada&quot;), decided to seek to retain his leadership. Although Diefenbaker entered at the last minute to stand as a candidate for the leadership, he finished fifth on each of the first three ballots, and withdrew from the contest, which was won by Nova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield.

Diefenbaker addressed the delegates before Stanfield spoke:

My course has come to an end. I have fought your battles, and you have given me that loyalty that led us to victory more often than the party has ever had since the days of Sir John A. Macdonald. In my retiring, I have nothing to withdraw in my desire to see Canada, my country and your country, one nation.

=== Final years and death ===
Diefenbaker was embittered by his loss of the party leadership. Pearson announced his retirement in December 1967, and Diefenbaker forged a wary relationship of mutual respect with Pearson&#x27;s successor, Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau called a general election for June 1968; Stanfield asked Diefenbaker to join him at a rally in Saskatoon, which Diefenbaker refused, although the two appeared at hastily arranged photo opportunities. Trudeau obtained the majority against Stanfield that Pearson had never been able to obtain against Diefenbaker, as the PC party lost 25 seats, 20 of them in the West. The former prime minister, though stating, &quot;The Conservative Party has suffered a calamitous disaster&quot; in a CBC interview, could not conceal his delight at Stanfield&#x27;s humiliation, and especially gloated at the defeat of Camp, who made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the Commons. Diefenbaker was easily returned for Prince Albert.

Although Stanfield worked to try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved difficult to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield&#x27;s position on the Official Languages bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader&#x27;s will or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson died of cancer in 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker shook his head and said only, &quot;He shouldn&#x27;t have won the Nobel Prize.&quot;

By 1972, Diefenbaker had grown disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year&#x27;s election. Diefenbaker was re-elected comfortably in his home riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of matching the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield had been denied power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former prime minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.

In the 1976 New Year Honours, Diefenbaker was created a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, an honour bestowed as the personal gift of the Sovereign. After a long illness, Olive Diefenbaker died on December 22, a loss which plunged Diefenbaker into despair.

Joe Clark succeeded Stanfield as party leader in 1976, but as Clark had supported the leadership review, Diefenbaker held a grudge against him. Diefenbaker had supported Claude Wagner for leader, but when Clark won, stated that Clark would make &quot;a remarkable leader of this party&quot;. However, Diefenbaker repeatedly criticized his party leader, to such an extent that Stanfield publicly asked Diefenbaker &quot;to stop sticking a knife into Mr. Clark&quot;—a request Diefenbaker did not agree to. According to columnist Charles Lynch, Diefenbaker regarded Clark as an upstart and a pipsqueak.

In 1978, Diefenbaker announced that he would stand in one more election, and under the slogan &quot;Diefenbaker—Now More Than Ever&quot;, weathered a campaign the following year during which he apparently suffered a mild stroke, although the media were told he was bedridden with influenza. In the May election Diefenbaker defeated NDP candidate Stan Hovdebo (who, after Diefenbaker&#x27;s death, would win the seat in a by-election) by 4,000 votes. Clark had defeated Trudeau, though only gaining a minority government, and Diefenbaker returned to Ottawa to witness the swearing-in, still unreconciled to his old opponents among Clark&#x27;s ministers. Two months later, Diefenbaker died of a heart attack in his study at age 83.

Diefenbaker had extensively planned his funeral in consultation with government officials. He lay in state in the Hall of Honour in Parliament for two and a half days; 10,000 Canadians passed by his casket. The Maple Leaf Flag on the casket was partially obscured by the Red Ensign. After the service, his body was taken by train on a slow journey to its final destination, Saskatoon; along the route, many Canadians lined the tracks to watch the funeral train pass. In Winnipeg, an estimated 10,000 people waited at midnight in a one-kilometre line to file past the casket which made the trip draped in a Canadian flag and Diefenbaker&#x27;s beloved Red Ensign. In Prince Albert, thousands of those he had represented filled the square in front of the railroad station to salute the only man from Saskatchewan ever to become prime minister. His coffin was accompanied by that of his wife Olive, disinterred from temporary burial in Ottawa. Prime Minister Clark delivered the eulogy, paying tribute to &quot;an indomitable man, born to a minority group, raised in a minority region, leader of a minority party, who went on to change the very nature of his country, and change it forever&quot;. John and Olive Diefenbaker rest outside the Diefenbaker Centre, built to house his papers, on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan.

== Legacy ==

Some of Diefenbaker&#x27;s policies did not survive the 16 years of Liberal government that followed his fall. This was especially true in the realm of foreign affairs: &quot;By the time Diefenbaker left office,&quot; according to Canadian historian Robert Bothwell, &quot;his conduct of foreign policy was reviled by an important and growing number of Canadians, while his relations with both the Americans and the British were disastrous.&quot; By the end of 1963, the first of the Bomarc warheads entered Canada, where they remained until the last were finally phased out during John Turner&#x27;s brief government in 1984. Diefenbaker&#x27;s decision to have Canada remain outside the OAS was not reversed by Pearson, and it was not until 1989, under the Tory government of Brian Mulroney, that Canada joined.
Historian Conrad Black writes that Diefenbaker:

 was not a successful prime minister; he was a jumble of attitudes but had little in the way of policy, was a disorganized administrator, and was inconsistent, indecisive, and not infrequently irrational. But he was very formidable; a deadly campaigner, an idiosyncratic but often galvanizing public speaker, a brilliant parliamentarian, and a man of many fine qualities. He was absolutely honest financially, a passionate supporter of the average and the underprivileged and disadvantaged person, a fierce opponent of any racial or religious or socioeconomic discrimination ... 

However, some defining features of modern Canada can be traced back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker&#x27;s Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signaled the change in Canadian political culture that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which came into force after his death. Canadian philosopher George Grant saw Diefenbaker&#x27;s career as emblematic of the broader trajectory of Canadian national identity:Diefenbaker&#x27;s confusions and inconsistencies are to be seen as essential to the Canadian fate. His administration was not an aberration from which Canada will recover under the sensible rule of the established classes. It was a bewildered attempt to find policies that were adequate to its noble cause. The 1957 election was the Canadian people&#x27;s last gasp of nationalism. Diefenbaker&#x27;s government was the strident swansong of that hope.Diefenbaker has had several locations named in his honour, some before his 1979 death (particularly in his home province of Saskatchewan, including Lake Diefenbaker, the largest lake in Southern Saskatchewan, and the Diefenbaker Bridge in Prince Albert), others after (in 1993, Saskatoon renamed its airport the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport). The city of Prince Albert continues to maintain the house he resided in from 1947 to 1975 as a public museum known as Diefenbaker House; it was designated a National Historic Site in 2018.

Diefenbaker reinvigorated a moribund party system in Canada. Clark and Mulroney, two men who, as students, worked on and were inspired by his 1957 triumph, became the only other Progressive Conservatives to lead the party to election triumphs. Diefenbaker&#x27;s biographer, Denis Smith, wrote of him, &quot;In politics he had little more than two years of success in the midst of failure and frustration, but he retained a core of deeply committed loyalists to the end of his life and beyond. The federal Conservative Party that he had revived remained dominant in the prairie provinces for 25 years after he left the leadership.&quot; The Harper government, believing that Tory prime ministers have been given short shrift in the naming of Canadian places and institutions, named the former Ottawa City Hall, now a federal office building, the John G. Diefenbaker Building. It also gave Diefenbaker&#x27;s name to a human rights award and an icebreaking vessel. Harper often invoked Diefenbaker&#x27;s northern vision in his speeches.

Conservative Senator Marjory LeBreton worked in Diefenbaker&#x27;s office during his second time as Opposition Leader, and has said of him, &quot;He brought a lot of firsts to Canada, but a lot of it has been air-brushed from history by those who followed.&quot; Historian Michael Bliss, who published a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers, wrote of Diefenbaker:

From the distance of our times, Diefenbaker&#x27;s role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced in the form of significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values ... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.

<doc id="15916" wikidata="Q155407" url="?curid=15916" title="Jean-Michel Basquiat">
<text>Jean-Michel Basquiat (; December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist who rose to success during the 1980s as part of the Neo-expressionism movement.

Basquiat first achieved notoriety in the late 1970s as part of the graffiti duo SAMO, alongside Al Diaz, writing enigmatic epigrams all over Manhattan, particularly in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop culture. By the early 1980s, his paintings were being exhibited in galleries and museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part in Documenta in Kassel, Germany. At 22, he became one of the youngest to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial in New York. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his artwork in 1992.

Basquiat&#x27;s art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. He used social commentary in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of racism.

Since his death at the age of 27 in 1988, Basquiat&#x27;s work has steadily increased in value. In 2017, &quot;Untitled&quot;, a 1982 painting depicting a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, sold for a record-breaking $110.5 million, becoming one of the most expensive paintings ever purchased.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1960–1977===
Basquiat was born on December 22, 1960, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, New York City, the second of four children to Matilde Basquiat (née Andrades, 1934–2008) and Gérard Basquiat (1930–2013). He had an older brother, Max, who died shortly before his birth, and two younger sisters, Lisane (b. 1964) and Jeanine (b. 1967). His father was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and his mother was born in Brooklyn to Puerto Rican parents. He was raised Catholic.

Matilde instilled a love for art in her young son by taking him to local art museums and enrolling him as a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Basquiat was a precocious child who learned to read and write by the age of four. His mother encouraged her son&#x27;s artistic talent and he often tried to draw his favorite cartoons. In 1967, he started attending Saint Ann&#x27;s School, a private school. There he met his friend Marc Prozzo and together they created a children&#x27;s book, written by Basquiat at the age of seven and illustrated by Prozzo.

In 1968, at the age of seven, Basquiat was hit by a car while playing in the street. His arm was broken and he suffered several internal injuries, which required a splenectomy. While he was hospitalized, his mother brought him a copy of &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; to keep him occupied. After his parents separated that year, Basquiat and his sisters were raised by their father. His mother was admitted to a psychiatric hospital when he was ten and thereafter spent her life in and out of institutions. By the age of eleven, Basquiat was fluent in French, Spanish and English, and an avid reader of all three languages.

Basquiat&#x27;s family resided in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Boerum Hill and then in 1974, moved to Miramar, Puerto Rico. When they returned to Brooklyn in 1976, Basquiat attended Edward R. Murrow High School. He struggled to deal with his mother&#x27;s instability and rebelled as a teenager. He ran away from home at 15 when his father caught him smoking cannabis in his room. He slept on park benches at Washington Square Park and took LSD. Eventually, his father spotted him with a shaved head and called the police to bring him home.

In the 10th grade, he enrolled at City-As-School, an alternative high school in Manhattan, home to many artistic students who found conventional schooling difficult. He would skip school with his friends, but still received encouragement from his teachers, and began to write and illustrate for the school newspaper. He developed the character SAMO to endorse a faux religion. The saying &quot;SAMO&quot; had started as a private joke between Basquiat and his schoolmate Al Diaz, as an abbreviation for the phrase &quot;Same old shit.&quot; They drew a series of cartoons for their school paper before and after using SAMO©.

===Street art and Gray: 1978–1980===
 In May 1978, Basquiat and Diaz began spray painting graffiti on buildings in Lower Manhattan. Working under the pseudonym SAMO, they inscribed poetic and satirical advertising slogans such as &quot;SAMO© AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD.&quot; In June 1978, Basquiat was expelled from City-As-School for pieing the principal. At 17, his father kicked him out of the house when he decided to drop out of school. He worked for the Unique Clothing Warehouse in NoHo while continuing to create graffiti at night. On December 11, 1978, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; published an article about the SAMO graffiti.

In 1979, Basquiat appeared on the live public-access television show &quot;TV Party&quot; hosted by Glenn O&#x27;Brien. Basquiat and O&#x27;Brien formed a friendship and he made regular appearances on the show over the next few years. Eventually, he began spending time writing graffiti around the School of Visual Arts, where he befriended students John Sex, Kenny Scharf, and Keith Haring.

In April 1979, Basquiat met Michael Holman at the Canal Zone Party and they founded the noise rock band Test Pattern, which was later renamed Gray. Other members of Gray included Shannon Dawson, Nick Taylor, Wayne Clifford and Vincent Gallo. They performed at nightclubs such as Max&#x27;s Kansas City, CBGB, Hurrah and the Mudd Club.

Around this time, Basquiat lived in the East Village with his friend Alexis Adler, a Barnard biology graduate. He often copied diagrams of chemical compounds borrowed from Adler&#x27;s science textbooks. She documented Basquiat&#x27;s creative explorations as he transformed the floors, walls, doors and furniture into his artworks. He also made postcards with his friend Jennifer Stein. While selling postcards in SoHo, Basquiat spotted Andy Warhol at W.P.A. restaurant with art critic Henry Geldzahler. He sold Warhol a postcard titled &quot;Stupid Games, Bad Ideas&quot;.

In October 1979, at Arleen Schloss&#x27;s open space called A&#x27;s, Basquiat showed his SAMO montages using color Xerox copies of his works. Schloss allowed Basquiat to use the space to create his &quot;MAN MADE&quot; clothing, which were painted upcycled garments. In November 1979, costume designer Patricia Field carried his clothing line in her upscale boutique on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. Field also displayed his sculptures in the store window.

When Basquiat and Diaz had a falling out, he inscribed &quot;SAMO IS DEAD&quot; on the walls of SoHo buildings in 1980. In June 1980, he appeared in &quot;High Times&quot; magazine, his first national publication, as part of an article titled &quot;Graffiti &#x27;80: The State of the Outlaw Art&quot; by Glenn O&#x27;Brien. Later that year, he began filming O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s independent film &quot;Downtown 81&quot; (2000), originally titled &quot;New York Beat,&quot; which featured some of Gray&#x27;s recordings on its soundtrack.

===Rise to fame and success: 1980–1986===
In June 1980, Basquiat participated in &quot;The Times Square Show&quot;, a multi-artist exhibition sponsored by Collaborative Projects Incorporated (Colab) and Fashion Moda. He was noticed by various critics and curators, including Jeffrey Deitch, who mentioned him in an article titled &quot;Report from Times Square&quot; in the September 1980 issue of &quot;Art in America&quot;. In February 1981, Basquiat participated in the &quot;New York/New Wave&quot; exhibition, curated by Diego Cortez at New York&#x27;s P.S.1. Italian artist Sandro Chia recommended Basquiat&#x27;s work to Italian dealer Emilio Mazzoli, who promptly bought 10 paintings for Basquiat to have a show at his gallery in Modena, Italy in May 1981. In December 1981, art critic Rene Ricard published &quot;The Radiant Child&quot; in &quot;Artforum&quot; magazine, the first extensive article on Basquiat. During this period, Basquiat painted many pieces on objects he found in the streets, such as discarded doors.

Basquiat sold his first painting, &quot;Cadillac Moon&quot; (1981), to Debbie Harry, lead singer of the punk rock band Blondie, for $200 after they had filmed &quot;Downtown 81&quot; together. He also appeared as a disc jockey in the 1981 Blondie music video &quot;Rapture&quot;, a role originally intended for Grandmaster Flash. At the time, Basquiat was living with his girlfriend, Suzanne Mallouk, who financially supported him as a waitress.

In September 1981, art dealer Annina Nosei invited Basquiat to join her gallery at the suggestion of Sandro Chia. Soon after, he participated in her group show &quot;Public Address&quot;. She provided him with materials and a space to work in the basement of her gallery. In 1982, Nosei arranged for him to move into a loft, which also served as a studio at 101 Crosby Street in SoHo. He had his first American one-man show at the Annina Nosei Gallery in March 1982. He also painted in Modena for his second Italian exhibition in March 1982. With Basquiat saying he felt exploited, that show was canceled because he was expected to make eight paintings in one week.

By the summer of 1982, Basquiat had left the Annina Nosei Gallery, and gallerist Bruno Bischofberger became his worldwide art dealer. In June 1982, at 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part in Documenta in Kassel, Germany. His works were exhibited alongside Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, Cy Twombly, and Andy Warhol. Bischofberger gave Basquiat a one-man show at his Zurich gallery in September 1982, and arranged for him to meet Warhol for lunch on October 4, 1982. Warhol recalled, &quot;I took a Polaroid and he went home and within two hours a painting was back, still wet, of him and me together.&quot; The painting, &quot;Dos Cabezas&quot; (1982), ignited a friendship between them. Basquiat was photographed by James Van Der Zee for an interview with Henry Geldzahler published in the January 1983 issue of Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine.

In November 1982, Basquiat&#x27;s solo exhibition opened at the Fun Gallery in the East Village. Among the works exhibited were &quot;A Panel of Experts&quot; (1982) and &quot;Equals Pi&quot; (1982). In early December 1982, Basquiat began working at the Market Street studio space art dealer Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice Beach, California home. In Los Angeles, he frequented the Whisky a Go Go and Tail o&#x27; the Pup with his friend artist George Condo. There, he commenced a series of paintings for a March 1983 show, his second at the Gagosian Gallery in West Hollywood. He was accompanied by his girlfriend, then-unknown singer Madonna. Gagosian recalled: &quot;Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and we were having a lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, &#x27;My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.&#x27; ... So I said, &#x27;Well, what&#x27;s she like?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Her name is Madonna and she&#x27;s going to be &quot;huge&quot;.&#x27; I&#x27;ll never forget that he said that.&quot;

Basquiat took considerable interest in the work that artist Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood. He visited him on several occasions and found inspiration in his accomplishments. While in Los Angeles, Basquiat painted &quot;Hollywood Africans&quot; (1983), which portrays him with graffiti artists Toxic and Rammellzee. He often painted portraits of other graffiti artists—and sometimes collaborators—in works such as &quot;Portrait of A-One A.K.A. King&quot; (1982), &quot;Toxic&quot; (1984), and &quot;ERO&quot; (1984). In 1983, he produced the hip-hop record &quot;Beat Bop&quot; featuring Rammellzee and rapper K-Rob. It was pressed in limited quantities on his Tartown Inc. imprint. He created the cover art for the single, making it highly desirable among both record and art collectors.
In March 1983, at 22 years old, Basquiat became one of the youngest artists to participate in the Whitney Biennial exhibition of contemporary art. Paige Powell, an associate publisher for &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, organized a show of his work at her friend&#x27;s New York apartment in April 1983. Shortly after, he began a relationship with Powell, who was instrumental in fostering his friendship with Warhol. In August 1983, Basquiat moved into a loft owned by Warhol at 57 Great Jones Street in NoHo, which also served as a studio.

In the summer of 1983, Basquiat invited Lee Jaffe, a former musician in Bob Marley&#x27;s band, to join him on a trip throughout Asia and Europe. On his return to New York, he was deeply affected by the death of Michael Stewart, an aspiring black artist in the downtown club scene who was killed by transit police in September 1983. He painted &quot;Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart)&quot; (1983) in response to the incident. He also participated in a Christmas benefit with various New York artists for the family of Michael Stewart in 1983.

Having joined the Mary Boone&#x27;s SoHo gallery in 1983, Basquiat had his first show there in May 1984. A large number of photographs depict a collaboration between Warhol and Basquiat in 1984 and 1985. When they collaborated, Warhol would start with something very concrete or a recognizable image and then Basquiat defaced it in his animated style. They made an homage to the 1984 Summer Olympics with &quot;Olympics&quot; (1984). Other collaborations include &quot;Taxi, 45th/Broadway&quot; (1984–85) and &quot;Zenith&quot; (1985). Their joint exhibition, &quot;Paintings&quot;, at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery, caused a rift in their friendship after it was panned by critics, and Basquiat was called Warhol&#x27;s &quot;mascot&quot;.

Basquiat often painted in expensive Armani suits and would appear in public in the same paint-splattered clothes. He was a regular at the Area nightclub, where he sometimes worked the turntables as a DJ for fun. He also painted murals for the Palladium nightclub in New York City. His swift rise to fame was covered in the media. He appeared on the cover of the February 10, 1985, issue of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in a feature titled &quot;New Art, New Money: The Marketing of an American Artist&quot;. His work appeared in &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot;, and he was interviewed for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Art Break&quot; segment. In 1985, he walked the runway for the Comme des Garçons Spring fashion show in New York.

In the mid-1980s, Basquiat was earning $1.4 million a year and he was receiving lump sums of $40,000 from art dealers. Despite his success, his emotional instability continued to haunt him. &quot;The more money Basquiat made, the more paranoid and deeply involved with drugs he became,&quot; wrote journalist Michael Shnayerson. Basquiat&#x27;s cocaine use became so excessive that he blew a hole in his nasal septum. A friend claimed that Basquiat confessed he was on heroin in late 1980. Many of his peers speculated that his drug use was a means of coping with the demands of his newfound fame, the exploitative nature of the art industry, and the pressures of being a black man in the white-dominated art world.

For what would be his last exhibition on the West Coast, Basquiat returned to Los Angeles for his show at the Gagosian Gallery in January 1986. In February 1986, Basquiat traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for an exhibition of his drawings at Fay Gold Gallery. That month, he participated in Limelight&#x27;s Art Against Apartheid benefit. In the summer, he had a solo exhibition at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg. He was also invited to walk the runway for Rei Kawakubo again, this time at the Comme des Garçons Homme Plus fashion show in Paris. In October 1986, Basquiat flew to Ivory Coast for an exhibition of his work organized by Bruno Bischofberger at the French Cultural Institute in Abidjan. He was accompanied by his girlfriend Jennifer Goode, who worked at his frequent hangout, Area nightclub. In November 1986, at 25 years old, Basquiat became the youngest artist given an exhibition at Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hanover, Germany.

=== Final years and death: 1986–1988 ===
During their relationship, Goode began snorting heroin with Basquiat since drugs were at her disposal. She said: &quot;He didn&#x27;t push it on me, but it was just there and I was so naïve.&quot; In late 1986, she successfully got herself and Basquiat into a methadone program in Manhattan, but he quit after three weeks. According to Goode, he did not start injecting heroin until after she ended their relationship. In the last 18 months of his life, Basquiat became something of a recluse. His continued drug use is thought to have been a way of coping after the death of his friend Andy Warhol in February 1987.

In 1987, Basquiat had exhibitions at Galerie Daniel Templon in Paris, the Akira Ikeda Gallery in Tokyo, and the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York. Allen Ginsberg photographed Basquiat at the Shafrazi gallery attending William Burroughs ‘Shotgun Artshow’ on December 17th, 1987. He designed a Ferris wheel for André Heller&#x27;s &quot;Luna Luna&quot;, an ephemeral amusement park in Hamburg from June to August 1987 with rides designed by renowned contemporary artists.

In January 1988, Basquiat traveled to Paris for his exhibition at the Yvon Lambert Gallery and to Düsseldorf for an exhibition at the Hans Mayer Gallery. While in Paris, he befriended Ivorian artist Ouattara Watts. They made plans to travel together to Watts&#x27; birthplace, Korhogo, that summer. Following his exhibition at the Vrej Baghoomian Gallery in New York in April 1988, Basquiat traveled to Maui in June to withdraw from drug use. After returning to New York in July, Basquiat ran into Keith Haring on Broadway, who stated that this last encounter was the only time Basquiat ever discussed his drug problem with him. Glenn O&#x27;Brien also recalled Basquiat calling him and telling him he was &quot;feeling really good.&quot;

Despite attempts at sobriety, Basquiat died at the age of 27 of a heroin overdose at his home on Great Jones Street in Manhattan on August 12, 1988. He had been found unresponsive in his bedroom by his girlfriend Kelle Inman and was taken to Cabrini Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
Basquiat is buried at Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery. A private funeral was held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on August 17, 1988. The funeral was attended by immediate family and close friends, including Keith Haring, Francesco Clemente, Glenn O&#x27;Brien, and Basquiat&#x27;s former girlfriend Paige Powell. Art dealer Jeffrey Deitch delivered a eulogy.

A public memorial was held at Saint Peter&#x27;s Church on November 3, 1988. Among the speakers was Ingrid Sischy, who as the editor of &quot;Artforum&quot; got to know Basquiat well and commissioned a number of articles that introduced his work to the wider world. Basquiat&#x27;s former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk recited sections of A. R. Penck&#x27;s &quot;Poem for Basquiat&quot; and his friend Fab 5 Freddy read a poem by Langston Hughes. The 300 guests included musicians John Lurie and Arto Lindsay, Keith Haring, poet David Shapiro, Glenn O&#x27;Brien, and members of Basquiat&#x27;s former band Gray.

In memory of the late artist, Keith Haring created the painting &quot;A Pile of Crowns for Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot;. In the obituary Haring wrote for &quot;Vogue&quot;, he stated: &quot;He truly created a lifetime of works in ten years. Greedily, we wonder what else he might have created, what masterpieces we have been cheated out of by his death, but the fact is that he has created enough work to intrigue generations to come. Only now will people begin to understand the magnitude of his contribution.&quot;

==Artistry==
Art critic Franklin Sirmans analyzed that Basquiat appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. His social commentary were acutely political and direct in their criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle. He also explored artistic legacies from wide sources, including an interrogation of the classical tradition. Art historian Fred Hoffman hypothesizes that the underlying of Basquiat&#x27;s self-identification as an artist was his &quot;innate capacity to function as something like an oracle, distilling his perceptions of the outside world down to their essence and, in turn, projecting them outward through his creative act&quot;, and that his art focused on recurrent &quot;suggestive dichotomies&quot; such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience.
Before his career as a painter began, Basquiat produced punk-inspired postcards for sale on the street, and became known for his political–poetical graffiti under the name of SAMO. He often drew on random objects and surfaces, including other people&#x27;s clothing. The conjunction of various media is an integral element of his art. His paintings are typically covered with codes of all kinds: words, letters, numerals, pictograms, logos, map symbols, and diagrams.

Basquiat primarily used texts as reference sources. A few of the books he used were &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Henry Dreyfuss&#x27; &quot;Symbol Sourcebook&quot;, &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; published by Reynal &amp; Company, and Burchard Brentjes&#x27; &quot;African Rock Art&quot;, &quot;Flash of the Spirit&quot; by Robert Farris Thompson.

A middle period from late 1982 to 1985 featured multi-panel paintings and individual canvases with exposed stretcher bars, the surface dense with writing, collage and imagery. The years 1984 to 1985 were also the period of the Basquiat–Warhol collaborations.

=== Drawings ===
In his short but prolific career, Basquiat produced around 1,500 drawings, around 600 paintings, and many sculpture and mixed media works. He drew constantly and often used objects around him as surfaces when paper was not immediately at hand. Since childhood, he produced cartoon-inspired drawings when encouraged by his mother&#x27;s interest in art, and drawing became a part of his expression as an artist. He drew in many different media, most commonly ink, pencil, felt-tip or marker, and oil-stick. He sometimes used Xerox copies of fragments of his drawings to paste onto the canvases of larger paintings.

The first public showing of Basquiat&#x27;s paintings and drawings was in 1981 at the MoMA PS1 &quot;New York/New Wave&quot; exhibition. Rene Ricard&#x27;s article &quot;Radiant Child&quot; in &quot;Artforum&quot; magazine brought Basquiat to the attention of the art world. Basquiat immortalized Ricard in two drawings, &quot;Untitled (Axe/Rene)&quot; (1984) and &quot;René Ricard&quot; (1984).

A poet as well as an artist, words featured heavily in his drawings and paintings, with direct references to racism, slavery, the people and street scene of 1980s New York, black historical figures, famous musicians, and athletes, as his notebooks and many important drawings demonstrate. Often Basquiat&#x27;s drawings were untitled, and as such, to differentiate works, a word written within the drawing is commonly in parentheses after &quot;Untitled&quot;. After Basquiat died, his estate was controlled by his father Gérard Basquiat, who also oversaw the committee that authenticated artworks, and operated from 1994 to 2012 to review over 2000 works, the majority of which were drawings.

===Heroes and saints===
A prominent theme in Basquiat&#x27;s work is the portrayal of historically prominent black figures, who were identified as heroes and saints. His early works often featured the iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in his specially chosen pantheon. &quot;Jean-Michel&#x27;s crown has three peaks, for his three royal lineages: the poet, the musician, the great boxing champion. Jean measured his skill against all he deemed strong, without prejudice as to their taste or age,&quot; said his friend and artist Francesco Clemente. Reviewing Basquiat&#x27;s show at the Bilbao Guggenheim, &quot;Art Daily&quot; noted that &quot;Basquiat&#x27;s crown is a changeable symbol: at times a halo and at others a crown of thorns, emphasizing the martyrdom that often goes hand in hand with sainthood. For Basquiat, these heroes and saints are warriors, occasionally rendered triumphant with arms raised in victory.&quot;

Basquiat was particularly a fan of bebop and cited saxophonist Charlie Parker as a hero. He frequently referenced Parker and other jazz musicians in paintings such as &quot;Charles the First&quot; (1982) and &quot;Horn Players&quot; (1983), and &quot;King Zulu&quot; (1986). &quot;Basquiat looked to jazz music for inspiration and for instruction, much in the same way that he looked to the modern masters of painting,&quot; said art historian Jordana Moore Saggese.

=== Death and Marginalization ===
In his exploration of death and marginalization, Basquiat’s portrayal of dismembered black bodies serves as a radical commentary on the trauma of displacement and the alienation experienced by African Americans. His depiction of anatomical parts, such as exposed internal organs and skeletal structures, mirrors the violent fragmentation of black identity under systemic racism. Basquiat’s repeated use of skulls and corpses underscores the existential anxiety of blackness in a society that dehumanizes and objectifies the black body.

A major reference source used by Basquiat throughout his career was the book &quot;Gray&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, which his mother had given him while he was in the hospital when he was seven. It remained influential in his depictions of human anatomy, and in its mixture of image and text as seen in &quot;Flesh and Spirit&quot; (1982–83). Art historian Olivier Berggruen situates in Basquiat&#x27;s anatomical screen prints &quot;Anatomy&quot; (1982) an assertion of vulnerability, one which &quot;creates an aesthetic of the body as damaged, scarred, fragmented, incomplete, or torn apart, once the organic whole has disappeared. Paradoxically, it is the very act of creating these representations that conjures a positive corporeal valence between the artist and his sense of self or identity.&quot;

Heads and skulls are significant focal points of many of Basquiat&#x27;s most seminal works. Heads in works like &quot;Untitled (Two Heads on Gold)&quot; (1982) and &quot;Philistines&quot; (1982) are reminiscent of African masks, suggesting a cultural reclamation. The skulls allude to Haitian Vodou, which is filled with skull symbolism; the paintings &quot;Red Skull&quot; (1982) and &quot;Untitled&quot; (1982) can be seen as primary examples. In reference to the potent image depicted in &quot;Untitled (Skull)&quot; (1981&quot;)&quot;, art historian Fred Hoffman writes that Basquiat was likely &quot;caught off guard, possibly even frightened, by the power and energy emanating from this unexpected image.&quot; Further investigation by Hoffman in his book &quot;The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot; reveals a deeper interest in the artist&#x27;s fascination with heads that proves an evolution in the artist&#x27;s oeuvre from one of raw power to one of more refined cognizance.

===Heritage===
Basquiat&#x27;s diverse cultural heritage was one of his many sources of inspiration. He often incorporated Spanish words into his artworks like &quot;Untitled (Pollo Frito)&quot; (1982) and &quot;Sabado por la Noche&quot; (1984). Basquiat&#x27;s &quot;La Hara&quot; (1981), a menacing portrait of a white police officer, combines the Nuyorican slang term for police (la jara) and the Irish surname O&#x27;Hara. The black-hatted figure that appears in his paintings &quot;The Guilt of Gold Teeth&quot; (1982) and &quot;Despues De Un Pun&quot; (1987) is believed to represent Baron Samedi, the spirit of death and resurrection in Haitian Vodou.

Basquiat has various works deriving from African-American history, namely &quot;Slave Auction&quot; (1982), &quot;Undiscovered Genius of the Mississippi Delta&quot; (1983), &quot;El Gran Espectaculo (The Nile)&quot; (1983), and &quot;Jim Crow&quot; (1986). Another painting, &quot;Irony of Negro Policeman&quot; (1981), illustrates how African-Americans have been controlled by a predominantly white society. Basquiat sought to portray that African-Americans have become complicit with the &quot;institutionalized forms of whiteness and corrupt white regimes of power&quot; years after the Jim Crow era had ended. This concept has been reiterated in additional Basquiat works, including &quot;Created Equal&quot; (1984).

In the essay &quot;Lost in Translation: Jean-Michel in the (Re)Mix,&quot; Kellie Jones posits that Basquiat&#x27;s &quot;mischievous, complex, and neologistic side, with regard to the fashioning of modernity and the influence and effluence of black culture&quot; are often elided by critics and viewers, and thus &quot;lost in translation.&quot;

=== Blackness, Identity, and Aesthetics ===
Basquiat’s artwork stands at the intersection of blackness, identity, and aesthetics, grappling with complex questions of representation and self-reflexivity. His work disrupts the boundaries of high art, redefining the aesthetics of black identity through distinctive use of symbols, language, and visual style. Basquiat&#x27;s engagement with black identity is inseparable from his exploration of a commodified American Africanism. His oeuvre, which includes graffiti under the moniker &quot;SAMO©,&quot; critiques mainstream racial representations and constructs a fluid African American identity. Through his &quot;economies of accumulation,&quot; Basquiat challenges the simplified constructions of blackness, rejecting the essentialist narratives imposed by the art world. His art incorporates motifs that signify historical and modern racial struggles, rendering the African American experience as both a subject of critique and aesthetic innovation.

Basquiat’s artwork serves as a method of identity formation, navigating the ontological and aesthetic challenges posed by blackness. His depictions of the black body resist reductive racial representations, instead offering a vibrant, complex subjectivity that reclaims blackness from its &quot;aesthetic colonization&quot;. Basquat&#x27;s use of graffiti and street art, often marginalized within the traditional art world, communicates stories of resistance and identity that resonate with the broader African diaspora.

Moreover, Basquiat&#x27;s artworks evoke a historical and political consciousness, often referencing figures from both the African American cultural pantheon and Western scientific history. His 1983 piece &quot;Untitled (Charles Darwin)&quot; juxtaposes the legacy of evolutionary science with broader themes of marginality, connecting the legacies of Darwin, Huxley, and Mendel to the commodification of blackness and the manipulation of scientific discourse for socio-political ends. This interplay between science and art highlights how Basquiat critiques both racial and intellectual histories, revealing their entanglement in narratives of oppression and commodification.

Finally, Basquiat’s relationship with hip-hop culture further enriches his aesthetic of blackness. His collaborations with artists from the hip-hop generation, such as Fab 5 Freddy and Lady Pink, emphasize the fusion of neo-expressionism with the rhythmic, improvisational qualities of hip-hop. This synthesis of art and music positions Basquiat as a figure who not only represented blackness but actively participated in shaping its cultural expression during the 1980s. His works, much like the art of graffiti, blur the lines between high art and street culture, reinforcing the legitimacy of non-traditional forms of black expression.

==Reception==
Shortly after his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; indicated that Basquiat was &quot;the most famous of only a small number of young black artists who have achieved national recognition.&quot; Art critic Bonnie Rosenberg wrote that Basquiat experienced a good taste of fame in his last years when he was a &quot;critically embraced and popularly celebrated artistic phenomenon&quot;; and that some people focused on the &quot;superficial exoticism of his work&quot;, missing the fact that it &quot;held important connections to expressive precursors.&quot;

Traditionally, the interpretation of Basquiat&#x27;s works at the visual level comes from the subdued emotional tone of what they represent compared to what is actually depicted. For example, the figures in his paintings, as stated by writer Stephen Metcalf, &quot;are shown frontally, with little or no depth of field, and nerves and organs are exposed, as in an anatomy textbook. Are these creatures dead and being clinically dissected, one wonders, or alive and in immense pain?&quot; Writer Olivia Laing noted that &quot;words jumped out at him, from the back of cereal boxes or subway ads, and he stayed alert to their subversive properties, their double and hidden meaning.&quot;

A second recurrent reference to Basquiat&#x27;s aesthetics comes from the artist&#x27;s intention to share, in the words of gallerist Niru Ratnam, a &quot;highly individualistic, expressive view of the world&quot;. Art historian Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo believes Basquiat&#x27;s work inspires people to &quot;paint like a child, don&#x27;t paint what is in the surface but what you are re-creating inside. Musician David Bowie, who was a collector of Basquiat&#x27;s works, stated that &quot;he seemed to digest the frenetic flow of passing image and experience, put them through some kind of internal reorganization and dress the canvas with this resultant network of chance.&quot;

Art critics have also compared Basquiat&#x27;s work to the emergence of hip-hop during the same era. &quot;Basquiat&#x27;s art—like the best hip-hop—takes apart and reassembles the work that came before it&quot;, said art critic Franklin Sirmans in a 2005 essay, &quot;In the Cipher: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Culture&quot;.

Art critic Rene Ricard wrote in his 1981 article &quot;The Radiant Child&quot;:I&#x27;m always amazed at how people come up with things. Like Jean-Michel. How did he come up with the words he puts all over everything, his way of making a point without overstating the case, using one or two words he reveals a political acuity, gets the viewer going in the direction he wants, the illusion of the bombed-over wall. One or two words containing a full body. One or two words on a Jean-Michel contain the entire history of graffiti. What he incorporates into his pictures, whether found or made, is specific and selective. He has a perfect idea of what he&#x27;s getting across, using everything that collates to his vision.Curator Marc Mayer wrote in the 2005 essay &quot;Basquiat in History&quot;:Basquiat speaks articulately while dodging the full impact of clarity like a matador. We can read his pictures without strenuous effort—the words, the images, the colors and the construction—but we cannot quite fathom the point they belabor. Keeping us in this state of half-knowing, of mystery-within-familiarity, had been the core technique of his brand of communication since his adolescent days as the graffiti poet SAMO. To enjoy them, we are not meant to analyze the pictures too carefully. Quantifying the encyclopedic breadth of his research certainly results in an interesting inventory, but the sum cannot adequately explain his pictures, which requires an effort outside the purview of iconography ... he painted a calculated incoherence, calibrating the mystery of what such apparently meaning-laden pictures might ultimately mean.

In the 1980s, art critic Robert Hughes dismissed Basquiat&#x27;s work as absurd. He attributed the Basquiat phenomenon to be a mixture of hype, overproduction, and a greedy art market.

In a 1997 review for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, art critic Hilton Kramer begins by stating that Basquiat had no idea what the word &quot;quality&quot; meant. He relentlessly criticized Basquiat as a &quot;talentless hustler&quot; and &quot;street-smart but otherwise invincibly ignorant&quot;, arguing that he &quot;used his youth, his looks, his skin colour and his abundant sex appeal to win an overnight fame that proved to be his undoing&quot; and that art dealers of the time were &quot;as ignorant about art as Basquiat himself.&quot; In saying that Basquiat&#x27;s work never rose above &quot;that lowly artistic station&quot; of graffiti &quot;even when his paintings were fetching enormous prices&quot;, Kramer argued that graffiti art &quot;acquired a cult status in certain New York art circles.&quot; He further opined, &quot;As a result of the campaign waged by these art-world entrepreneurs on Basquiat&#x27;s behalf—and their own, of course—there was never any doubt that the museums, the collectors and the media would fall into line&quot; when talking about the marketing of Basquiat&#x27;s name.

==Exhibitions==
Basquiat&#x27;s first public exhibition was at &quot;The Times Square Show&quot; in New York in June 1980. In May 1981, he had his first solo exhibition at Galleria d&#x27;Arte Emilio Mazzoli in Modena. In late 1981, he joined the Annina Nosei Gallery in New York, where he had his first American one-man show from March 6 to April 1, 1982. In 1982, he also had shows at the Gagosian Gallery in West Hollywood, Galerie Bruno Bischofberger in Zurich, and the Fun Gallery in the East Village. Major exhibitions of his work have included &quot;Jean-Michel Basquiat: Paintings 1981–1984&quot; at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh in 1984, which traveled to the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London; Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam in 1985. In 1985, the University Art Museum, Berkeley hosted Basquiat&#x27;s first solo American museum exhibition. His work was showcased at Kestner-Gesellschaft, Hannover in 1987 and 1989.

The first retrospective of his work was held by the Baghoomian Gallery in New York from October to November 1989. His first museum retrospective, &quot;Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot;, was at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York from October 1992 to February 1993. The show was sponsored by AT&amp;T, MTV and Basquiat&#x27;s former girlfriend Madonna. It subsequently traveled to the Menil Collection in Texas; the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa; and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Alabama, from 1993 to 1994. The exhibition&#x27;s catalog was edited by Richard Marshall and included several essays from different perspectives. In 1996, Madonna sponsored an exhibition of his work at the Serpentine Gallery in London.

In March 2005, the retrospective &quot;Basquiat&quot; was mounted by the Brooklyn Museum in New York. It traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. From October 2006 to January 2007, the first Basquiat exhibition in Puerto Rico was held at the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico, produced by ArtPremium, Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici. In 2016, the Brooklyn Museum organized and presented &quot;Basquiat: The Unknown Notebooks&quot;, the first major viewing of Basquiat&#x27;s sketches, poetry, notetaking, and overall artist&#x27;s book practice. The show traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami later on. A monograph featuring essays by Pérez Art Museum Miami executive director, the art historian Franklin Sirmans and Henry Louis Gates, was published in the occasion of this exhibition

Basquiat remains an important source of inspiration for a younger generation of contemporary artists all over the world, such as Rita Ackermann and Kader Attia—as shown, for example, at the exhibition &quot;Street and Studio: From Basquiat to Séripop&quot; co-curated by Cathérine Hug and Thomas Mießgang and previously exhibited at Kunsthalle Wien, Austria, in 2010. &quot;Basquiat and the Bayou&quot;, a 2014 show presented by the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans, focused on the artist&#x27;s works with themes of the American South. The Brooklyn Museum exhibited &quot;Basquiat: The Unknown Notebooks&quot; in 2015. In 2017, &quot;Basquiat Before Basquiat: East 12th Street, 1979–1980&quot; exhibited as Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, which displayed works created during the year Basquiat lived with his friend Alexis Adler. Later that year, the Barbican Centre in London exhibited &quot;Basquiat: Boom for Real&quot;.

In 2019, the Brant Foundation in New York, hosted an extensive exhibition of Basquiat&#x27;s works with free admission. All 50,000 tickets were claimed before the exhibition opened, so additional tickets were released. In June 2019, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York presented &quot;Basquiat&#x27;s &quot;Defacement&quot;: The Untold Story&quot;. Later that year, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne opened the exhibition &quot;Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat: Crossing Lines&quot;. In 2020, the Lotte Museum of Art mounted the first major exhibition of Jean-Michel Basquiat in Seoul. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston exhibited &quot;Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation&quot; from October 2020 to July 2021.

Basquiat&#x27;s family curated &quot;Jean-Michel Basquiat: King Pleasure&quot;, an immersive exhibition with over 200 never-before-seen and rarely shown works. King Pleasure debuted at the Starrett-Lehigh Building in Chelsea, New York in April 2022. In March 2023, the exhibition traveled to the Grand LA in Los Angeles. 

In 2022, the Albertina presented the first museum retrospective of Basquiat&#x27;s work in Austria. The exhibition &quot;Seeing Loud: Basquiat and Music&quot; was mounted at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 2022. In 2023, the show traveled to Paris as &quot;Basquiat Soundtracks&quot; at the Philharmonie de Paris. Later that year, the Brant Foundation held the exhibition &quot;Basquiat X Warhol&quot; at their East Village location.

In 2024, the gallery Hauser &amp; Wirth presented &quot;Jean-Michel Basquiat. Engadin&quot;, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s first solo exhibition dedicated to the paintings he created in and inspired by his visits to Switzerland at Hauser &amp; Wirth&#x27;s St. Moritz gallery.

==Art market==
Basquiat sold his first painting to singer Debbie Harry for $200 in 1981. Advised by Italian artist Sandro Chia, gallerist Emilio Mazzoli purchased ten of Basquiat&#x27;s works for $10,000 and held an exhibition at his gallery in Modena in May 1981. Spurred by the Neo-expressionism art boom, his work was in great demand by 1982, which is considered his most valuable year. A majority of his highest-selling paintings at auction date to 1982. Recalling that year, Basquiat said, &quot;I had some money; I made the best paintings ever.&quot; His paintings were priced at $5,000 to $10,000 in 1983—lowered from the range of $10,000 to $15,000 when he joined Mary Boone&#x27;s gallery to reflect what she felt was consistent with those of other artists in her gallery. In 1984, it was reported that in two years his work appreciated in value by 500%. In the mid-1980s, Basquiat was earning $1.4 million a year as an artist. By 1985, his paintings were selling for $10,000 to $25,000 each. Basquiat&#x27;s rise to fame in the international art market landed him on the cover of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 1985, which was unprecedented for a young African-American artist.

Since Basquiat&#x27;s death in 1988, the market for his work has developed steadily—in line with overall art market trends—with a dramatic peak in 2007 when, at the height of the art market boom, the global auction volume for his work was over $115 million. Brett Gorvy, deputy chairman of Christie&#x27;s, is quoted describing Basquiat&#x27;s market as &quot;two-tiered ... The most coveted material is rare, generally dating from the best period, 1981–83.&quot; Until 2002, the highest amount paid for an original work of Basquiat&#x27;s was $3.3 million for &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (1982), sold at Christie&#x27;s in 1998. In 2002, Basquiat&#x27;s &quot;Profit I&quot; (1982) was sold at Christie&#x27;s by drummer Lars Ulrich of the heavy metal band Metallica for $5.5 million. The proceedings of the auction were documented in the 2004 film &quot;&quot;.

In June 2002, New York artist Alfredo Martinez was charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with attempting to deceive two art dealers by selling them $185,000 worth of fake Basquiat drawings. The charges against Martinez, which landed him in Manhattan&#x27;s Metropolitan Correction Center for 21 months, involved a scheme to sell drawings he copied from authentic artworks, accompanied by forged certificates of authenticity. Martinez claimed he got away with selling fake Basquiat drawings for 18 years.

In 2007, Basquiat&#x27;s painting &quot;Hannibal&quot; (1982) was seized by federal authorities as part of an embezzlement scheme by convicted Brazilian money launderer and former banker Edemar Cid Ferreira. Ferreira had purchased the painting with illegally acquired funds while he controlled Banco Santos in Brazil. It was shipped to a Manhattan warehouse, via the Netherlands, with a false shipping invoice stating it was worth $100. The painting was later sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $13.1 million.

Between 2007 and 2012, the price of Basquiat&#x27;s work continued to steadily increase up to $16.3 million. 

The sale of &quot;Untitled&quot; (1981) for $20.1 million in 2012 elevated his market to a new stratosphere. Soon other works in his oeuvre outpaced that record. Another work, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1981), depicting a fisherman, sold for $26.4 million in 2012. In 2013, &quot;Dustheads&quot; (1982) sold for $48.8 million at Christie&#x27;s. 

In 2016, Basquiat&#x27;s work &quot;Air Power&quot;, part of David Bowie&#x27;s art collection, was sold at auction for nearly $9 million.

Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa purchased &quot;Untitled&quot; (1982), depicting a devil-like figure, for $57.3 million at Christie&#x27;s in 2017. He sold the painting for $85 million at Phillips in 2022. Maezawa also purchased Basquiat&#x27;s &quot;Untitled&quot; (1982), a powerful depiction of a black skull with red and yellow rivulets, for a record-setting $110.5 million in May 2017. It is the second highest price ever paid at an auction for artwork by an American artist.

In 2018, &quot;Flexible&quot; (1984) sold for $45.3 million, becoming Basquiat&#x27;s first post-1983 painting to surpass the $20 million mark. In June 2020, &quot;Untitled (Head)&quot; (1982), sold for $15.2 million; a record for a Sotheby&#x27;s online sale and a record for a Basquiat work on paper. In July 2020, Loïc Gouzer&#x27;s Fair Warning app announced that an untitled drawing on paper sold for $10.8 million, which is a record high for an in-app purchase. Earlier that year, American businessman Ken Griffin purchased &quot;Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump&quot; (1982) for upwards of $100 million from art collector Peter Brant. In March 2021, &quot;Warrior&quot; (1982) sold for $41.8 million at Christie&#x27;s in Hong Kong, which is the most expensive Western work of art sold at auction in Asia. In May 2021, &quot;In This Case&quot; (1983) sold for $93.1 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York. Later that year, &quot;Donut Revenge&quot; (1982) sold for $20.9 million at Christie&#x27;s in Hong Kong. In 2022, &quot;Sugar Ray Robinson&quot; (1982) sold for $32.6 million at Christie&#x27;s in New York. In 2023, &quot;El Gran Espectaculo (The Nile)&quot; (1983) sold for $67.1 million at Christie&#x27;s, and &quot;Self-Portrait as a Heel (Part Two)&quot; (1982) sold for $42 million at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York.

=== Forgeries ===
In 1994, three paintings displayed as Basquiats at the FIAC were revealed to be fakes. In 2007 Christie&#x27;s was sued in Manhattan Supreme Court for allegedly selling a fake Basquiat. Christie&#x27;s rejected the charge but the suit proceeded. In 2020 a Los Angeles man, Philip Bennet Righter, plead guilty to art fraud after trying to sell forged paintings by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Also in 2020, in France, an exhibition of drawings attributed to Basquiat at the Volcano gallery in Nuits-Saint-Georges was disputed. 

In February 2022, the Orlando Museum of Art mounted the controversial exhibition &quot;Heroes &amp; Monsters&quot;, which consisted of 25 cardboard works that were claimed to have been sold by Basquiat directly to screenwriter Thad Mumford in 1982, and then placed in storage, where they remained until being rediscovered in 2012. The paintings were seized in a raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in June 2022. &quot;The New York Times&quot; obtained an affidavit that revealed Mumford signed a declaration in the presence of federal agents stating that &quot;at no time in the 1980s or any other time did I meet with Jean-Michel Basquiat, and at no time did I acquire or purchase any paintings from him.&quot; Los Angeles auctioneer Michael Barzman confessed to creating a suite of 25 Basquiat forgeries that wound up at the Orlando Museum of Art and was sentenced to community service and probation.

In 2023, Florida art dealer Daniel Elie Bouaziz was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for a money laundering scheme to sell counterfeit contemporary artworks, including pieces purportedly by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, and Banksy. 

===Authentication committee===
The authentication committee of the estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat was formed by the Robert Miller Gallery, the gallery that was assigned to handle Basquiat&#x27;s estate after his death, in part to wage battle against the growing number of fakes and forgeries in the Basquiat market. The cost of the committee&#x27;s opinion was $100. The committee was headed by Basquiat&#x27;s father Gérard Basquiat. Members varied depending on who was available at the time when a piece was being authenticated, but they have included the curators and gallerists Diego Cortez, Jeffrey Deitch, Annina Nosei, John Cheim, Richard Marshall, Fred Hoffman, and publisher Larry Warsh.

In 2008, the authentication committee was sued by collector Gerard De Geer, who claimed the committee breached its contract by refusing to offer an opinion on the authenticity of the painting &quot;Fuego Flores&quot; (1983). After the lawsuit was dismissed, the committee ruled the work genuine. In January 2012, the committee announced that after eighteen years it would dissolve in September of that year and no longer consider applications.

== Sexuality ==
Basquiat had romantic relationships with many women, including singer Madonna. Although he never publicly identified as bisexual, a few of his friends have stated that he had sexual relationships with men. Basquiat&#x27;s former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk described his sexual interest as &quot;not monochromatic. It did not rely on visual stimulation, such as a pretty girl. It was a very rich multichromatic sexuality. He was attracted to people for all different reasons. They could be boys, girls, thin, fat, pretty, ugly ... He was attracted to intelligence more than anything and to pain.&quot;

Biographer Phoebe Hoban wrote on Basquiat&#x27;s first sexual experiences, which were with men. When Basquiat was a minor in Puerto Rico he was orally raped by a barber dressed in drag, then he got involved with a deejay. Art critic Rene Ricard, who helped launch Basquiat&#x27;s career, said that Basquiat was into everything and had &quot;turned tricks&quot; in Condado when he lived in Puerto Rico. As a teenager, Basquiat told a friend that he worked as a prostitute on 42nd Street in Manhattan when he ran away from home. Andy Warhol said Basquiat had refused to go with him and Keith Haring to Rounds, a gay hustler bar, because it brought back bad memories of when he was hustling.

==Legacy==
Basquiat&#x27;s estate was administered by his father, Gerard Basquiat, until his passing in 2013. It is now run by his sisters, Jeanine Heriveaux and Lisane Basquiat. His work had a significant impact on the street art and hip hop scene, and has been noted as an influence on a range of contemporary artists including Banksy, Shepard Fairey, and Halim Flowers.

In 2015, Basquiat was featured on the cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Art and Artists Special Edition. In 2016, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation placed a plaque commemorating Basquiat&#x27;s life outside his former residence at 57 Great Jones Street in Manhattan. In 2017, Basquiat was posthumously awarded the key to the city of Brooklyn by Borough President Eric Adams and honored on the Celebrity Path at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

Before the exhibition &quot;Basquiat: Boom for Real&quot; at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre in 2017, graffiti artist Banksy created two murals inspired by Basquiat on the walls of the Barbican. The first mural depicts Basquiat&#x27;s painting &quot;Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump&quot; (1982) being searched by two police officers. The second mural depicts a carousel with the carriages replaced with Basquiat&#x27;s signature crown motif.

In 2018, a public square in the 13th arrondissement of Paris was named Place Jean-Michel Basquiat in his memory. For the 2020–21 NBA season, the Brooklyn Nets honored Basquiat with their City Edition uniform and a court design inspired by his art. In 2021, the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation funded a Basquiat educational arts program developed in partnership between the Brooklyn Nets, the New York City Department of Education and the Fund for Public Schools. The Nets used a white version of the Basquiat City Edition uniform for the 2022–23 NBA season.

=== Fashion ===
In 2007, Basquiat was listed among &quot;GQ&quot;″s 50 Most Stylish Men of the Past 50 Years. Basquiat often painted in expensive Armani suits and he did a photo shoot for Issey Miyake. Comme des Garçons was one of his favorite brands; he was a model for the Spring 1986 fashion show in New York and the Homme Plus Spring/Summer 1987 fashion show in Paris. To commemorate Basquiat&#x27;s runway appearances, Comme des Garçons featured his prints in the brand&#x27;s Fall/Winter 2018 collection. In 2015, Basquiat was featured on the cover of &quot;&quot; Men&#x27;s Style issue.

Valentino&#x27;s Fall/Winter 2006 collection paid homage to Basquiat. Sean John created a capsule collection for the 30th anniversary of Basquiat&#x27;s death in 2018. Apparel and accessories companies that have featured Basquiat&#x27;s work include Uniqlo, Urban Outfitters, Supreme, Herschel Supply Co., Alice + Olivia, Olympia Le-Tan, DAEM, Coach New York, and Saint Laurent. Footwear companies such as Dr. Martens, Reebok, and Vivobarefoot have also collaborated with Basquiat&#x27;s estate.

In 2021, luxury jewelry company Tiffany &amp; Co. partnered with American singer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z to promote the company&#x27;s &quot;About Love&quot; campaign. The campaign incorporated Tiffany&#x27;s recently acquired painting, &quot;Equals Pi&quot; (1982), by Basquiat. The painting heavily features a color close to the company&#x27;s signature robin egg blue.The campaign was met with criticism from the artist&#x27;s friends and colleagues. Many colleagues and friends of Jay Z have stated during interviews that Jay Z took inspiration in his modern look from Jean-Michel Basquiat. Most notably his hairstyles and clothing. 

In 2022, Basquiat&#x27;s estate partnered with Black Fashion Fair for a limited-run capsule collection, which was on view at the exhibition &quot;Jean-Michel Basquiat: King Pleasure&quot; in New York City.

=== Film, television and theater ===
Basquiat starred in &quot;Downtown 81&quot;, a &quot;vérité&quot; movie written by Glenn O&#x27;Brien and shot by Edo Bertoglio in 1980–81, but not released until 2000. 

&quot;Without Walls: Shooting Star&quot;, a British documentary by Geoff Dunlop on Basquiat&#x27;s life, aired on Channel 4 in 1990. In 1996, painter Julian Schnabel made his filmmaking debut with the biopic &quot;Basquiat&quot;. It stars Jeffrey Wright as Basquiat and David Bowie as Andy Warhol.

&quot;Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child&quot;, a documentary film directed by Tamra Davis, premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and was shown on the PBS series &quot;Independent Lens&quot; in 2011. Sara Driver directed the documentary film &quot;Boom for Real: The Late Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot;, which premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2018, PBS aired the documentary &quot;&quot; as part of the &quot;American Masters&quot; series.

In 2022, it was reported that actor Kelvin Harrison Jr. will star as Basquiat in an upcoming biopic titled &quot;Samo Lives&quot;, which will be written, directed and produced by Julius Onah. It was also announced that actor Stephan James will star and co-produce a limited series about Basquiat.

In 2022, &quot;The Collaboration,&quot; a play by Anthony McCarten about Basquiat and Warhol debuted at London&#x27;s Young Vic Theatre with Jeremy Pope portraying Basquiat, and Paul Bettany as Warhol. The play then moved to Broadway, for a limited run from December 2022 through March 2023, again starring Bettany and Pope, produced by the Manhattan Theatre Club. The pair have also reprised their roles in a film version.

Roger Guenveur Smith wrote, directed, and performed the solo show &quot;In Honor of Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot;, a tribute to Basquiat, whom he was friends with.

=== Literature ===

In 1991, poet Kevin Young published the book &quot;To Repel Ghosts&quot;, a compendium of 117 poems relating to Basquiat&#x27;s life, individual paintings, and social themes found in the artist&#x27;s work. He published a &quot;remix&quot; of the book in 2005. In 1993, a children&#x27;s book was released titled &quot;Life Doesn&#x27;t Frighten Me&quot;, which combines a poem written by Maya Angelou with art made by Basquiat.

In 1998, journalist Phoebe Hoban published the unauthorized biography &quot;&quot;. In 2000, author Jennifer Clement wrote the memoir &quot;Widow Basquiat: A Love Story&quot;, based on the narratives told to her by Basquiat&#x27;s former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk.

In 2005, poet M. K. Asante published the poem &quot;SAMO&quot;, dedicated to Basquiat, in his book &quot;Beautiful. And Ugly Too&quot;. The children&#x27;s book &quot;Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat&quot;, written and illustrated by Javaka Steptoe, was released in 2016. The picture book won the Caldecott Medal in 2017. In 2019, illustrator Paolo Parisi wrote the graphic novel &quot;Basquiat: A Graphic Novel&quot;, following Basquiat&#x27;s journey from street-art legend SAMO to international art-scene darling, up until his death.

=== Music ===
Shortly after Basquiat&#x27;s death, guitarist Vernon Reid of the funk metal band Living Colour wrote a song called &quot;Desperate People&quot;, released on their album &quot;Vivid&quot;. The song primarily addresses the drug scene of New York at that time. Reid was inspired to write the song after receiving a phone call from Greg Tate informing him of Basquiat&#x27;s death.

In August 2014, Revelation 13:18 released the single &quot;Old School&quot; featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat, along with the self-titled album &quot;Revelation 13:18 x Basquiat&quot;. The release date of &quot;Old School&quot; coincided with the anniversary of Basquiat&#x27;s death. In 2020, New York rock band the Strokes used Basquiat&#x27;s painting &quot;Bird on Money&quot; (1981) as the cover art for their album &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;.

<text>Lieutenant-General John Graves Simcoe (25 February 1752 – 26 October 1806) was a British army officer, politician and colonial administrator who served as the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada from 1791 until 1796. He founded York, which is now known as Toronto, and was instrumental in introducing institutions such as courts of law, trial by jury, English common law, freehold land tenure, and also in the abolition of slavery in Upper Canada.

His long-term goal was the development of Upper Canada (Ontario) as a model community built on aristocratic and conservative principles, designed to demonstrate the superiority of those principles to the republicanism of the United States. His energetic efforts were only partially successful in establishing a local gentry, a thriving Church of England, and an anti-American coalition with select indigenous nations. He is seen by many Canadians as a founding figure in Canadian history, especially by those in Southern Ontario. He is commemorated in Toronto with Simcoe Day.

==Early life==
Simcoe was the only surviving son of Cornishman John (1710–1759) and Katherine Simcoe (died 1767). His parents had four children, but he was the only one to live past childhood; Percy drowned in 1764, while Paulet William and John William died as infants. His father was a captain in the Royal Navy who commanded the 60-gun HMS &quot;Pembroke&quot; during the siege of Louisbourg, with James Cook as his sailing master. He died of pneumonia on 15 May 1759 on board his ship in the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River a few months prior to the siege of Quebec, and was buried at sea. The family then moved to his mother&#x27;s parental home in Exeter. His paternal grandparents were William and Mary (née Hutchinson) Simcoe.

He was educated at Exeter Grammar School and Eton College. He spent a year at Merton College, Oxford; he was then admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but decided to follow the military career for which his father had intended him. He was initiated into Freemasonry in Union Lodge, Exeter, on 2 November 1773.

==Military career in American Revolutionary War==
In 1770, Simcoe entered the British Army as an ensign in the 35th Regiment of Foot, and his unit was dispatched to the Thirteen Colonies. Later, he saw action in the American Revolutionary War during the siege of Boston. After the siege, in July 1776, he was promoted captain in the 40th Regiment of Foot. He saw action with the grenadier company of the 40th Foot in the New York and New Jersey campaign and the Philadelphia campaign. Simcoe commanded the 40th&#x27;s Grenadiers at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, where he was wounded. Legend has it that Simcoe ordered his men at Brandywine not to fire upon three fleeing rebels, among whom was George Washington.

In 1777, Simcoe sought to form a Loyalist regiment of free blacks from Boston but instead was offered the command of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers formed on Staten Island on 15 October 1777. It was a well-trained light infantry unit comprising 11 companies of 30 men -- 1 grenadier, and 1 hussar, and the rest light infantry. The Queen&#x27;s Rangers saw extensive action during the Philadelphia campaign, including a successful surprise attack (planned and executed by Simcoe) at the Battle of Crooked Billet.

In 1778, Simcoe led an attack on Judge William Hancock&#x27;s house during a foraging expedition opposed by Patriot militia. Hancock was also killed, although he was not with the Americans. The attack took place at night and with bayonets. On 28 June of that year, Simcoe and his Queen&#x27;s Rangers took part in the Battle of Monmouth, in and near Freehold, New Jersey.

On 31 August 1778, Lieut. Col. Simcoe earned a victory over Daniel Nimham&#x27;s Native American force serving under the Continental Army as the Stockbridge Militia in the Battle of Kingsbridge (also known as the “Stockbridge Massacre”). The skirmish had been planned by Simcoe for an earlier ambush by the same unit, and took place in what today is Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, New York. The battlefield is recognized as the Indian Field there.

On 26 October 1779, Simcoe and 80 men launched an attack on central New Jersey from southern Staten Island known as Simcoe&#x27;s Raid, from what is known today as the Conference House, resulting in the burning of Patriot supplies inside a Dutch Reformed Church in Finderne, including hay and grain; the release of Loyalist prisoners from the Somerset County Courthouse; and Simcoe&#x27;s capture by Armand Tuffin de La Rouërie. Simcoe was released at the end of 1779 and rejoined his unit in Virginia. He participated in the Raid on Richmond with Benedict Arnold in January 1781 and was involved in a skirmish near Williamsburg and was at the siege of Yorktown. He was invalided back to England in December of that year as a lieutenant-colonel, having been promoted in March 1782.

Simcoe wrote a book on his experiences with the Queen&#x27;s Rangers, titled &quot;A Journal of the Operations of the royal Queen&#x27;s Rangers from the end of the year 1777 to the conclusion of the late American War&quot;, which was published in 1787. He served briefly as Inspector General of Recruitment for the British Army, from 1789 until his departure for Upper Canada two years later.

==Marriage and family==
Simcoe convalesced at the Devon home of his godfather, Admiral Samuel Graves. In 1782, Simcoe married Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim, his godfather&#x27;s ward. Elizabeth was a wealthy heiress, who acquired a estate at Honiton in Devon and built Wolford Lodge. Wolford was the Simcoe family seat until 1923.

The Simcoes had five daughters before their posting in Canada. Son Francis was born in 1791. Their Canadian-born daughter, Katherine, died in infancy in York. She is buried in the Victoria Square Memorial Park on Portland Avenue, Toronto. Francis returned with his father to England when his tenure expired and joined the army. He was killed in an infantry charge during the Peninsular War in 1812.

Son Henry Addington Simcoe became an English theologian.

==Member of Parliament==
Simcoe entered politics in 1790. He was elected Member of Parliament for St Mawes in Cornwall, as a supporter of the government (led by William Pitt the Younger). As MP, he proposed raising a militia force like the Queen&#x27;s Rangers. He also proposed to lead an invasion of Spain. But instead he was to be made lieutenant governor of the new loyalist province of Upper Canada. He resigned from Parliament in 1792 on taking up his new post.

==Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada==
The Constitutional Act 1791 divided Canada into the Provinces of Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec). The Act established separate governments and legislative assemblies for each province. Lower Canada was the French-speaking eastern portion, which retained the French civil law and protections for the Roman Catholic Church established when Britain took over the area after its defeat of the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Upper Canada was the western area, newly settled after the American Revolutionary War. The settlers were mostly English speakers, including Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies, and also the Six Nations of the Iroquois, who had been British allies during the war. The Crown had purchased land from the Mississauga and other First Nations to give the Loyalists land grants in partial compensation for property lost in the United States, and to help them set up new communities and develop this territory.

Simcoe was appointed Lieutenant-Governor on 12 September 1791, and left for Canada with his wife Elizabeth and daughter Sophia, leaving three daughters behind in England with their aunt. They left England in September and arrived in Canada on 11 November. Due to severe weather, the Simcoes spent the winter in Quebec City. Simcoe finally reached Kingston, Upper Canada, on 24 June 1792.

In a proclamation on 16 July 1792, he renamed several islands at the mouth of the archipelago at the head of the St. Lawrence river to commemorate the British generals of the Seven Years&#x27; War (Amherst Island,
Carleton Island, Gage Island, Wolfe Island, and Howe Island).

Under the Constitutional Act, the provincial government consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor, an appointed Executive Council and Legislative Council, and an elected Legislative Assembly. The first meeting of the nine-member Legislative Council and sixteen-member Legislative Assembly took place at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) on 17 September 1792.

Following Simcoe&#x27;s work precipitated by the Chloe Cooley incident, the Assembly passed the &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot; in 1793, the first legislation to limit slavery in the British Empire; the English colonists of Upper Canada took pride in this distinction with respect to the French-Canadian populace of Lower Canada. The Upper Canadians valued their common law legal system, as opposed to the civil law of Quebec, which had chafed them ever since 1763. This was one of the primary reasons for the partition of 1791. Simcoe collaborated extensively with his Attorney-General John White on the file.

However, this Act did not free anybody directly, and slaves continued to be held across Upper Canada. The Crown abolished slavery throughout the British Empire, including Upper Canada, in 1834.

Simcoe&#x27;s priority was the Northwest Indian War between the United States and the &quot;Western Confederacy&quot; of Native Americans west of the Appalachian Mountains and south of the Great Lakes (the Shawnee, Miami, Wyandot, and other tribes). This conflict had begun in 1785, and was still raging when Simcoe arrived in 1792. Simcoe had hoped to form an Indian barrier state between the two countries, even though he distrusted Joseph Brant, the main Indian leader. Simcoe rejected the section of the Treaty of Paris (1783) which awarded that area to the US, on the grounds that American actions had nullified the treaty. However, the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1793. The government in London decided to seek good terms with the United States. Simcoe was instructed to avoid giving the US reason to mistrust Britain but, at the same time, to keep the Natives on both sides of the border friendly to Britain. The Indians asked for British military support, which was initially refused, but in 1794 Britain supplied the Indians with rifles and ammunition.

In February 1794, the governor general, Lord Dorchester, expecting the US to ally with France, said that war was likely to break out between the US and Britain before the year was out. This encouraged the Indians in their war. Dorchester ordered Simcoe to rally the Indians and arm British vessels on the Great Lakes. He also built Fort Miami (present-day Maumee, Ohio) to supply the Indians. Simcoe expelled Americans from a settlement on the southern shore of Lake Erie which had threatened British control of the lake. US President Washington denounced the &quot;irregular and high-handed proceeding of Mr. Simcoe.&quot; While Dorchester planned for a defensive war, Simcoe urged London to declare war: &quot;Upper Canada is not to be defended by remaining within the boundary line.&quot; Dorchester was officially reprimanded by the Crown for his strong speech against the Americans in 1794.

Simcoe realised that Newark made an unsuitable capital because it was on the Canada–US border and subject to attack. He proposed moving the capital to a more defensible position, in the middle of Upper Canada&#x27;s southwestern peninsula between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. He named the new location London, and renamed the river there the Thames in anticipation of the change. Dorchester rejected this proposal, but accepted Simcoe&#x27;s second choice, the present site of Toronto. Simcoe moved the capital there in 1793, and renamed the settlement York after Frederick, Duke of York, King George III&#x27;s second son. The town was severely underdeveloped at the time of its founding so he brought with him politicians, builders, Nova Scotia timber men, and Englishmen skilled in whipsawing and cutting joists and rafters.

Simcoe began construction of two roads through Upper Canada, for defence and to encourage settlement and trade. Yonge Street (named after British Minister of War Sir George Yonge) ran north–south from York to Lake Simcoe. Soldiers of the Queen&#x27;s Rangers began cutting the road in August 1793, reaching Holland Landing in 1796. Dundas Street (named for Colonial Secretary Henry Dundas) ran east–west, between York and London.

The Northwest Indian War ended after the United States defeated the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. They made peace under the Treaty of Greenville. While still at war with France, Britain could not afford to antagonise the US in the Jay Treaty of 1794, and agreed to withdraw north of the Great Lakes, as agreed in the Treaty of Paris. Simcoe evacuated the frontier forts.

==Later career==
In 1794, Simcoe was appointed to the rank of major general. In July 1796, poor health (gout and neuralgia) forced him to return to Britain. He was unable to return to Upper Canada and resigned his office in 1798.

From October 1796 until March 1797, Simcoe briefly served as the commander of the British expeditionary force which was dispatched to captured the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which was in the midst of the Haitian Revolution. After assuming control of the British forces in Saint-Domingue, Simcoe was attacked by troops under the command of Black general Toussaint Louverture, who at the time was fighting for the French Republic. An assault on the British-held town of Saint-Marc was repulsed, though Louverture&#x27;s forces captured Mirebalais and the Central Plateau. Simcoe was eventually replaced as leader of the expeditionary force in March.

Simcoe was appointed colonel of the 81st Foot in 1798, but exchanged the position for the 22nd Foot less than six months later.

Simcoe was appointed commander in chief in India in 1806, but he fell ill on his way there. He returned to England, where he died. He was buried in Wolford Chapel on the Simcoe family estate near Honiton, Devon. The Ontario Heritage Foundation acquired title to the chapel in 1982.

Many of Simcoe&#x27;s personal effects including his sword, sabre, and walking cane, may be viewed by appointment at the Archives of Ontario in Toronto. Elizabeth Simcoe&#x27;s personal effects and hundreds of her watercolour paintings are also available there.

==Legacy==

* In the winter of 1779, the first known Valentine&#x27;s Day letter in America was given by then Lieutenant Colonel John Simcoe to Sarah &#x27;Sally&#x27; Townsend.
* Simcoe Street in Oyster Bay, New York is named after him for his destruction of a vast apple orchard and reconstruction of a hill fort on the site.
* Act Against Slavery passed in 1793, leading to the abolition of slavery in Upper Canada by 1810. It was superseded by the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 that abolished slavery across the British Empire.
* Simcoe named London, Ontario and the River Thames in Upper Canada.
* He named Lake Simcoe and Simcoe County to the west and north of Lake Simcoe in honour of his father.
* Simcoe named his summer home Castle Frank for his first son Francis Gwillim, who was preceded by eight daughters. (It is in what is now named Rosedale, a neighbourhood in downtown Toronto.)
* The Ontario Heritage Foundation placed a plaque in Exeter&#x27;s cathedral precinct to commemorate his life.
* Simcoe&#x27;s regiment is still called the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers, now an armoured reconnaissance regiment of the Canadian Forces reserves.

Many places in Canada were named in honour of Simcoe:
* The town of Simcoe in southwestern Ontario
* The Simcoe Fairgrounds in Simcoe
* Civic Holiday, a statutory holiday celebrated throughout Canada under a variety of names by region, was established in honour of Simcoe by the Toronto City Council in 1869. Other Ontario municipalities and then other provinces soon took up the holiday as well, leading to its Canada-wide status, but without any attribution to Simcoe. In 1965, the Toronto City Council declared the holiday would henceforth be known as Simcoe Day within Toronto. Attempts have been made to have the official provincial name—still Civic Holiday—amended, but none have succeeded.
* Governor Simcoe Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario
* Governor Simcoe Public School. Grades K – 8, in London, Ontario. The now closed and demolished school was located at the corner of Simcoe and Clarence Streets.
* Three parallel streets in downtown Toronto, John Street, Graves Street, and Simcoe Street, are all located near the fort where Simcoe lived during his early years in York and were named for him. Graves Street was later renamed Duncan Street.
* Simcoe Street, Simcoe Street United Church, and Simcoe Hall Settlement House in Oshawa.
* Simcoe Street in New Westminster and Simcoe Park was named by Colonel Moody in reference to the surveying of the area after the city of Toronto.
* Simcoe Street, Simcoe Street School and the Simcoe Street School Tigers Bantam Baseball Team of Niagara Falls
* Simcoe Island, located near Kingston, Ontario
* Simcoe Hall, located on the St. George campus of the University of Toronto
* John Graves Simcoe Armoury, located on Industrial Parkway in Aurora, Ontario
* Governors Road, a named section of Ontario Highway 99 running between Dundas, Ontario and Paris, Ontario

Two places have been named for Simcoe with the title &quot;Lord&quot;, even though Simcoe was never a Lord in his lifetime:
* Lord Simcoe Drive in Brampton, Ontario
* Lord Simcoe Hotel, which operated from 1956 to 1981

Captain John Kennaway Simcoe, the last member of the Simcoe family, died without issue in 1891 and was survived by his widow beyond 1911.

===In popular culture===
A fictionalised version of John Graves Simcoe is a primary antagonist in the 2014–2017 AMC drama &quot;&quot;, portrayed by Samuel Roukin. He is portrayed in the series as a cruel and ruthless sociopath.

Despite the strong fictionalisation of the namesake TV-show character, several biographical aspects of the latter&#x27;s historical counterpart appear to have been adapted for and transferred onto the fictional character Edmund Hewlett. For instance, Hewlett&#x27;s romantic ambitions regarding Anna Strong in the series resemble Simcoe&#x27;s courtship of Sarah Townsend, sister of Culper Ring spy Robert Townsend, for whom he wrote a poem that is thought to be the first verifiable valentine on the North American continent. It is presumed that Townsend, much like the fictionalised portrayal of Anna Strong on &quot;Turn&quot;, may have gathered and passed on intelligence gleaned from her unsuspecting suitor to the Culper Ring.

Similarly, Hewlett&#x27;s close bond with his horse Bucephalus (presumably named after Bucephalus, the horse of Alexander the Great) which overarches all four seasons, appears to have been inspired by history: in 1783, John Graves Simcoe sent a series of letters to New York in order to find the horse he had ridden on campaign, Salem. Salem was located and Simcoe subsequently paid the considerable sum of £40 to have him shipped to England and thus returned to him. Shortly before his departure to Upper Canada almost a decade later, it is reported he was greatly concerned for Salem&#x27;s welfare in his absence, therefore making arrangements for the latter&#x27;s care and upkeep.

<text>John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838April 26, 1865) was an American stage actor who assassinated United States president Abraham Lincoln at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. A member of the prominent 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland, he was a noted actor who was also a Confederate sympathizer; denouncing President Lincoln, he lamented the then-recent abolition of slavery in the United States.

Originally, Booth and his small group of conspirators had plotted to kidnap Lincoln to aid the Confederate cause. They later decided to murder him, as well as Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward. Although the Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E. Lee, had surrendered to the Union Army four days earlier, Booth believed that the American Civil War remained unresolved because the Army of Tennessee of General Joseph E. Johnston continued fighting.

Booth shot President Lincoln once in the back of the head. Lincoln&#x27;s death the next morning completed Booth&#x27;s piece of the plot. Seward, severely wounded, recovered, whereas Vice President Johnson was never attacked. Booth fled on horseback to Southern Maryland; twelve days later, at a farm in rural Northern Virginia, he was tracked down sheltered in a barn. Booth&#x27;s companion David Herold surrendered, but Booth maintained a stand-off. After the authorities set the barn ablaze, Union soldier Boston Corbett fatally shot him in the neck. Paralyzed, he died a few hours later. Of the eight conspirators later convicted, four were soon hanged.

==Background and early life==
Booth&#x27;s parents were noted British Shakespearean actor Junius Brutus Booth and his mistress, Mary Ann Holmes, who moved to the United States from England in June 1821. They purchased a farm near Bel Air, Maryland, where John Wilkes Booth was born in a four-room log house on May 10, 1838, the ninth of ten children. He was named after English radical politician John Wilkes, a distant relative. Thirty years after he had absconded across the Atlantic Ocean, Junius&#x27; wife Adelaide Delannoy Booth was granted a divorce in 1851 on grounds of adultery, and Holmes legally wed Junius on May 10, 1851, John Wilkes&#x27; 13th birthday. Nora Titone suggests in her book &quot;My Thoughts Be Bloody&quot; (2010) that the shame and ambition of Junius Brutus Booth&#x27;s actor sons Edwin and John Wilkes eventually spurred them to strive for achievement and acclaim as rivals—Edwin as a Unionist and John Wilkes as the assassin of Abraham Lincoln.

Booth&#x27;s father built Tudor Hall on the Harford County property as the family&#x27;s summer home in 1851, while also maintaining a winter residence on Exeter Street in Baltimore. The Booth family was listed as living in Baltimore in the 1850 census.
As a boy, Booth was athletic and popular, and he became skilled at horsemanship and fencing. He attended the Bel Air Academy and was an indifferent student whom the headmaster thought was &quot;not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him.&quot; In 1850–1851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy&#x27;s Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland. At the Milton school, students recited classical works by such authors as Cicero, Herodotus, and Tacitus. Students at St. Timothy&#x27;s wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline. Booth left school at 14 after his father&#x27;s death.

While attending the Milton Boarding School, Booth met a Romani fortune-teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny, telling him that he would have a grand but short life, doomed to die young and &quot;meeting a bad end&quot;. His sister recalled that he wrote down the palm-reader&#x27;s prediction, showed it to his family and others, and often discussed its portents in moments of melancholy.

By age 16, Booth was interested in the theater and in politics, and he became a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis, the anti-immigrant party&#x27;s candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections. Booth aspired to follow in the footsteps of his father and his actor brothers Edwin and Junius Brutus Jr. He began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare.

==Theatrical career==
===1850s===

Booth made his stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855, in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in &quot;Richard III&quot; at Baltimore&#x27;s Charles Street Theatre. The audience jeered at him when he missed some of his lines. He also began acting at Baltimore&#x27;s Holliday Street Theater, owned by John T. Ford, where the Booths had performed frequently. In 1857 he joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, where he played for a full season. At his request, he was billed as &quot;J. B. Wilkes&quot;, a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison with other members of his famous thespian family. Jim Bishop wrote that Booth &quot;developed into an outrageous scene stealer, but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him.&quot; In February 1858, he played in &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; at the Arch Street Theatre. On opening night, he experienced stage fright and stumbled over one of his lines. Instead of introducing himself by saying, &quot;Madame, I am Petruchio Pandolfo&quot;, he stammered, &quot;Madame, I am Pondolfio Pet—Pedolfio Pat—Pantuchio Ped—dammit! Who am I?&quot;, causing the audience to roar with laughter.

Later that year, Booth played the part of Mohegan Indian Chief Uncas in a play staged in Petersburg, Virginia, and then became a stock company actor at the Richmond Theatre (known then as the Marshall Theatre) in Virginia which was co-managed by George Kunkel, John T. Ford, and Thomas L. Moxley. There he became increasingly popular with audiences for his energetic performances. On October 5, 1858, he played the part of Horatio in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, alongside his older brother Edwin in the title role. Afterward, Edwin led him to the theater&#x27;s footlights and said to the audience, &quot;I think he&#x27;s done well, don&#x27;t you?&quot; In response, the audience applauded loudly and cried, &quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; In all, Booth performed in 83 plays in 1858. Booth said that, of all Shakespearean characters, his favorite role was Brutus, the slayer of a tyrant.
Some critics called Booth &quot;the handsomest man in America&quot; and a &quot;natural genius&quot;, and noted his having an &quot;astonishing memory&quot;; others were mixed in their estimation of his acting. He stood tall, had jet-black hair, and was lean and athletic. Noted Civil War reporter George Alfred Townsend described him as a &quot;muscular, perfect man&quot; with &quot;curling hair, like a Corinthian capital&quot;. Booth&#x27;s stage performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical, with him leaping upon the stage and gesturing with passion. He was an excellent swordsman, although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword.

Historian Benjamin Platt Thomas wrote that Booth &quot;won celebrity with theater-goers by his romantic personal attraction&quot;, and that he was &quot;too impatient for hard study&quot; and his &quot;brilliant talents had failed of full development.&quot; Author Gene Smith wrote that Booth&#x27;s acting may not have been as precise as his brother Edwin&#x27;s, but his strikingly handsome appearance enthralled women. As the 1850s drew to a close, Booth was becoming wealthy as an actor, earning $20,000 a year ().

===1860s===
Booth embarked on his first national tour as a leading actor after finishing the 1859–1860 theatre season in Richmond, Virginia. He engaged Philadelphia attorney Matthew Canning to serve as his agent. By mid-1860, he was playing in such cities as New York; Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; St. Louis; Columbus, Georgia; Montgomery, Alabama; and New Orleans. Poet and journalist Walt Whitman said of Booth&#x27;s acting, &quot;He would have flashes, passages, I thought of real genius.&quot; The &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; drama critic said, &quot;Without having [his brother] Edwin&#x27;s culture and grace, Mr. Booth has far more action, more life, and, we are inclined to think, more natural genius.&quot; In October 1860, while performing in Columbus, Georgia, Booth was shot accidentally in his hotel, leaving a wound some thought would end his life.
When the Civil War began on April 12, 1861, Booth was starring in Albany, New York. He was outspoken in his admiration for the South&#x27;s secession, publicly calling it &quot;heroic.&quot; This so enraged local citizens that they demanded that he be banned from the stage for making &quot;treasonable statements&quot;. Albany&#x27;s drama critics were kinder, giving him rave reviews. One called him a genius, praising his acting for &quot;never fail[ing] to delight with his masterly impressions.&quot; As the Civil War raged across the divided land in 1862, Booth appeared mostly in Union and border states. In January, he played the title role in &quot;Richard III&quot; in St. Louis and then made his Chicago debut. In March, he made his first acting appearance in New York City. In May 1862, he made his Boston debut, playing nightly at the Boston Museum in &quot;Richard III&quot; (May 12, 15 and 23), &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (May 13), &quot;The Robbers&quot; (May 14 and 21), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (May 16), &quot;The Apostate&quot; (May 19), &quot;The Stranger&quot; (May 20), and &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot; (May 22). Following his performance of &quot;Richard III&quot; on May 12, the Boston &quot;Transcript&quot;&#x27;s review the next day called Booth &quot;the most promising young actor on the American stage&quot;.

Starting in January 1863, he returned to the Boston Museum for a series of plays, including the role of villain Duke Pescara in &quot;The Apostate&quot;, that won him acclaim from audiences and critics. Back in Washington in April, he played the title roles in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Richard III,&quot; one of his favorites. He was billed as &quot;The Pride of the American People, A Star of the First Magnitude&quot;, and the critics were equally enthusiastic. The &quot;National Republican&quot; drama critic said that Booth &quot;took the hearts of the audience by storm&quot; and termed his performance &quot;a complete triumph&quot;. At the beginning of July 1863, Booth finished the acting season at Cleveland&#x27;s Academy of Music, as the Battle of Gettysburg raged in Pennsylvania. Between September and November 1863, Booth played a hectic schedule in the northeastern United States, appearing in Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut. Every day he received fan mail from infatuated women.

Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford&#x27;s Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth was one of the first leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby&#x27;s &quot;The Marble Heart&quot;. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek sculptor in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln&#x27;s direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln&#x27;s sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you.&quot; The president replied, &quot;He does look pretty sharp at me, doesn&#x27;t he?&quot; On another occasion, Lincoln&#x27;s son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.
On November 25, 1864, Booth performed for the only time with his brothers Edwin and Junius in a single engagement production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. He played Mark Antony and his brother Edwin had the larger role of Brutus in a performance acclaimed as &quot;the greatest theatrical event in New York history.&quot; The proceeds went towards a statue of William Shakespeare for Central Park, which still stands today (2019). In January 1865, he acted in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in Washington, again garnering rave reviews. The &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; called Booth&#x27;s Romeo &quot;the most satisfactory of all renderings of that fine character&quot;, especially praising the death scene. Booth made the final appearance of his acting career at Ford&#x27;s on March 18, 1865, when he again played Duke Pescara in &quot;The Apostate.&quot;

==Business ventures==
Booth invested some of his growing wealth in various enterprises during the early 1860s, including land speculation in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay section. He also started a business partnership with John A. Ellsler, manager of the Cleveland Academy of Music, and with Thomas Mears to develop oil wells in northwestern Pennsylvania, where the Pennsylvania oil rush had started in August 1859, following Edwin Drake&#x27;s discovery of oil there, initially calling their venture Dramatic Oil but later renaming it Fuller Farm Oil. The partners invested in a site along the Allegheny River at Franklin, Pennsylvania in late 1863 for drilling. By early 1864, they had a producing deep oil well named Wilhelmina for Mears&#x27; wife, yielding 25 barrels (4 kL) of crude oil daily, then considered a good yield. The Fuller Farm Oil company was selling shares with a prospectus featuring the well-known actor&#x27;s celebrity status as &quot;Mr. J. Wilkes Booth, a successful and intelligent operator in oil lands&quot;. The partners were impatient to increase the well&#x27;s output and attempted the use of explosives, which wrecked the well and ended production.

Booth was already growing more obsessed with the South&#x27;s worsening situation in the Civil War and angered at Lincoln&#x27;s re-election. He withdrew from the oil business on November 27, 1864, with a substantial loss of his $6,000 investment ($ today).

==Civil War years==
Booth was strongly opposed to the abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the United States. He attended the hanging of abolitionist leader John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for treason, murder, and inciting a slave insurrection, charges resulting from his raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia). Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he read in a newspaper about Brown&#x27;s upcoming execution. So as to gain access that the public would not have, he donned a borrowed uniform of the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500 men traveling to Charles Town for Brown&#x27;s hanging, to guard against a possible attempt to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown&#x27;s fate, although he admired the condemned man&#x27;s bravery in facing death stoically.

Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently never delivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually eleven Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth&#x27;s native Maryland, some of the slaveholding portion of the population favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53–13) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against Southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland&#x27;s demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C., exposed, and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature&#x27;s intention. Lincoln suspended the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and imposed martial law in Baltimore and other portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Fort McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in &quot;&quot;, that Lincoln&#x27;s suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in Maryland was unconstitutional.

As a popular actor in the 1860s, Booth continued to travel extensively to perform in the North and South, and as far west as New Orleans. According to his sister Asia, Booth confided to her that he also used his position to smuggle the anti-malarial drug quinine, which was crucial to the lives of residents of the Gulf coast, to the South during his travels there, since it was in short supply due to the Northern blockade.
Booth was pro-Confederate, but his family was divided, like many Marylanders. He was outspoken in his love of the South, and equally outspoken in his hatred of Lincoln. As the Civil War went on, Booth increasingly quarreled with his brother Edwin, who declined to make stage appearances in the South and refused to listen to John Wilkes&#x27; fiercely partisan denunciations of the North and Lincoln. In early 1863, Booth was arrested in St. Louis while on a theatre tour, when he was heard saying that he &quot;wished the President and the whole damned government would go to hell&quot;. He was charged with making &quot;treasonous&quot; remarks against the government, but was released when he took an oath of allegiance to the Union and paid a substantial fine.

Booth is alleged to have been a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret society whose initial objective was to acquire territories as slave states.

In February 1865, Booth became infatuated with Lucy Lambert Hale, the daughter of U.S. Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire, and they became secretly engaged when Booth received his mother&#x27;s blessing for their marriage plans. &quot;You have so often been dead in love,&quot; his mother counseled Booth in a letter, &quot;be well assured she is really and truly devoted to you.&quot; Booth composed a handwritten Valentine card for his fiancée on February 13, expressing his &quot;adoration&quot;. She was unaware of Booth&#x27;s deep antipathy towards Lincoln.

===Plot to kidnap Lincoln===
As the 1864 presidential election drew near, the Confederacy&#x27;s prospects for victory were ebbing, and the tide of war increasingly favored the North. The likelihood of Lincoln&#x27;s re-election filled Booth with rage towards the president, whom Booth blamed for the war and all of the South&#x27;s troubles. Booth had promised his mother at the outbreak of war that he would not enlist as a soldier, but he increasingly chafed at not fighting for the South, writing in a letter to her, &quot;I have begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence.&quot; He began to formulate plans to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the Old Soldiers Home, from the White House, and to smuggle him across the Potomac River and into Richmond, Virginia. Once in Confederate hands, Lincoln would be exchanged for Confederate Army prisoners of war held in Northern prisons and, Booth reasoned, bring the war to an end by emboldening opposition to the war in the North or forcing Union recognition of the Confederate government.

Throughout the Civil War, the Confederacy maintained a network of underground operators in southern Maryland, particularly Charles and St. Mary&#x27;s Counties, smuggling recruits across the Potomac River into Virginia and relaying messages for Confederate agents as far north as Canada. Booth recruited his friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O&#x27;Laughlen as accomplices. They met often at the house of Confederate sympathizer Maggie Branson at 16 North Eutaw Street in Baltimore. He also met with several well-known Confederate sympathizers at The Parker House in Boston.
In October, Booth made an unexplained trip to Montreal, which was a center of clandestine Confederate activity. He spent ten days in the city, staying for a time at St. Lawrence Hall, a rendezvous for the Confederate Secret Service, and meeting several Confederate agents there. No conclusive proof has linked Booth&#x27;s kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving the leadership of the Confederate government, but historian David Herbert Donald states that &quot;at least at the lower levels of the Southern secret service, the abduction of the Union President was under consideration.&quot; Historian Thomas Goodrich concludes that Booth entered the Confederate Secret Service as a spy and courier.

Lincoln won a landslide re-election in early November 1864, on a platform that advocated abolishing slavery altogether, by Constitutional amendment. Booth, meanwhile, devoted increased energy and money to his kidnapping plot. He assembled a loose-knit band of Confederate sympathizers, including David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Powell (also known as Lewis Payne or Paine), and rebel agent John Surratt. They began to meet routinely at the boarding house of Surratt&#x27;s mother, Mary Surratt.

By this time, John was arguing vehemently with his older, pro-Union brother Edwin about Lincoln and the war, and Edwin finally told him that he was no longer welcome at his New York home. Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia. &quot;That man&#x27;s appearance, his pedigree, his coarse low jokes and anecdotes, his vulgar similes, and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds. He is made the tool of the North, to crush out slavery.&quot; Asia recalled that he decried Lincoln&#x27;s re-election, &quot;making himself a king&quot;, and that he went on &quot;wild tirades&quot; in 1865, as the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat became more certain.

Booth attended Lincoln&#x27;s second inauguration on March 4 as the guest of his secret fiancée Lucy Hale. In the crowd below were Powell, Atzerodt, and Herold. There was no attempt to assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration. Later, Booth remarked about his &quot;excellent chance...to kill the President, if I had wished&quot;. On March 17, he learned that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play &quot;Still Waters Run Deep&quot; at a hospital near the Soldier&#x27;s Home. He assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier&#x27;s Home in hope of kidnapping Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president did not appear. Booth later learned that Lincoln had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington — where Booth was staying.

==Assassination of Lincoln==
On April 11, 1865, Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window. During the speech, Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting suffrage to former slaves; infuriated, Booth vowed to kill him and allegedly declared that it would be the last speech that Lincoln would ever make.

On April 12, 1865, Booth heard the news that Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt&#x27;s house, that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot;. Weichmann did not understand the reference; &quot;Venice Preserv&#x27;d&quot; is about an assassination plot. Booth&#x27;s scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army&#x27;s capture of Richmond and Lee&#x27;s surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.

On the morning of Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Booth went to Ford&#x27;s Theatre to get his mail. While there, he was told by John Ford&#x27;s brother that the president and his wife Mary Todd Lincoln would be attending the play &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Ford&#x27;s Theatre that evening, accompanied by General Ulysses S. Grant and his wife. He immediately set about making plans for the assassination, which included making arrangements with livery stable owner James W. Pumphrey for a getaway horse and an escape route. Later that night, at 8:45 pm, Booth informed Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln. He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State William H. Seward and Atzerodt to do so to Vice President Andrew Johnson. Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia.

Historian Michael W. Kauffman wrote that, by targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the presidency, Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion. In 1865, however, the second presidential successor would have been the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, Lafayette S. Foster, rather than Secretary Seward. The possibility of assassinating the Union Army&#x27;s commanding general as well was foiled when Grant declined the theatre invitation at his wife&#x27;s insistence. Instead, the Grants departed Washington by train that evening for a visit to relatives in New Jersey. Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war if one Confederate army remained in the field or, failing that, would avenge the South&#x27;s defeat.

Booth had free access to all parts of Ford&#x27;s Theatre as a famous and popular actor who had frequently performed there and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. Many believe that Booth had bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day, so that he could observe the box&#x27;s occupants and verify that the president had made it to the play. However, an April 1962 letter from Frank Ford, son of the theatre manager Harry Clay Ford, to George Olszewski, a National Park Service historian, states that &quot;Booth did not bore the hole in the door leading to the box [...]. The hole was bored by my father ... [to] allow the guard ... to look into the box&quot;.

After spending time at the saloon during intermission, Booth entered Ford&#x27;s Theatre one last time at 10:10 pm. In the theater, he slipped into Lincoln&#x27;s box at around 10:14 p.m. as the play progressed and shot the president in the back of the head with a .41 caliber Deringer pistol. Booth&#x27;s escape was almost thwarted by Major Henry Rathbone, who was in the presidential box with Mary Todd Lincoln. Booth stabbed Rathbone when the startled officer lunged at him. Rathbone&#x27;s fiancée Clara Harris was also in the box but was not harmed.

Booth then jumped from the president&#x27;s box to the stage, where he raised his knife and shouted &quot;&quot;—Latin for &quot;Thus always to tyrants&quot;, attributed to Brutus at Caesar&#x27;s assassination, also having been adopted as the state motto of Virginia, and mentioned in the new &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;, future anthem of Booth&#x27;s Maryland. According to some accounts, Booth added, &quot;I have done it, the South is avenged!&quot; Some witnesses reported that Booth fractured or otherwise injured his leg when his spur snagged a decorative U.S. Treasury Guard flag while leaping to the stage. Historian Michael W. Kauffman questioned this legend in his book &quot;American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies&quot;, writing that eyewitness accounts of Booth&#x27;s hurried stage exit made it unlikely that his leg was broken then. Kauffman contends that Booth was injured later that night during his flight to escape when his horse tripped and fell on him, calling Booth&#x27;s claim to the contrary an exaggeration to portray his own actions as heroic.

Booth was the only one of the assassins to succeed. Powell was able to stab Seward, who was bedridden as a result of an earlier carriage accident; Seward was seriously wounded but survived. Atzerodt lost his nerve and spent the evening drinking, never making an attempt to kill Johnson.

==Reaction and pursuit==

Booth fled Ford&#x27;s Theatre by a stage door to the alley, where his getaway horse was held for him by Joseph &quot;Peanuts&quot; Burroughs. The owner of the horse had warned Booth that the horse was high-spirited and would break halter if left unattended. Booth had left the horse with Edmund Spangler and Spangler arranged for Burroughs to hold it.

Booth rode into southern Maryland, accompanied by David Herold, having planned his escape route to take advantage of the sparsely settled area&#x27;s lack of telegraphs and railroads, along with its predominantly Confederate sympathies. He thought that the area&#x27;s dense forests and the swampy terrain of Zekiah Swamp made it ideal for an escape route into rural Virginia. At midnight, Booth and Herold arrived at Surratt&#x27;s Tavern on the Brandywine Pike, from Washington, where they had stored guns and equipment earlier in the year as part of the kidnap plot.

The duo then continued southward, stopping before dawn on April 15 for treatment of Booth&#x27;s injured leg at the home of Dr. Samuel Mudd in St. Catharine, from Washington. Mudd later said that Booth told him the injury occurred when his horse fell. The next day, Booth and Herold arrived at the home of Samuel Cox around 4 am. As the two fugitives hid in the woods nearby, Cox contacted Thomas A. Jones, his foster brother and a Confederate agent in charge of spy operations in the southern Maryland area since 1862. The War Department advertised a $100,000 reward ($ in 2025 USD) by order of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his accomplices, and Federal troops were dispatched to search southern Maryland extensively, following tips reported by Federal intelligence agents to Colonel Lafayette C. Baker.
Federal troops combed the rural area&#x27;s woods and swamps for Booth in the days following the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin&#x27;s lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day&#x27;s funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol&#x27;s lawn. Prominent African American abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an &quot;unspeakable calamity&quot;. Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin&#x27;s identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an &quot;accursed devil&quot;, &quot;monster&quot;, &quot;madman&quot;, and a &quot;wretched fiend&quot;. Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: &quot;Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily.&quot; Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston called Booth&#x27;s act &quot;a disgrace to the age&quot;. Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln&#x27;s death by Booth&#x27;s hand.

Not all were grief-stricken. In New York City, a man was attacked by an enraged crowd when he shouted, &quot;It served Old Abe right!&quot; after hearing the news of Lincoln&#x27;s death. Elsewhere in the South, Lincoln was hated in death as in life, and Booth was viewed as a hero as many rejoiced at news of his deed. Other Southerners feared that a vengeful North would exact a terrible retribution upon the defeated former Confederate states. &quot;Instead of being a great Southern hero, his deed was considered the worst possible tragedy that could have befallen the South as well as the North&quot;, writes Kunhardt.

Booth continued hiding in the Maryland woods, waiting for an opportunity to cross the Potomac River into Virginia. He read the accounts of national mourning reported in the newspapers brought to him by Jones each day. By April 20, he was aware that some of his co-conspirators had already been arrested: Mary Surratt, Powell (or Paine), Arnold, and O&#x27;Laughlen. Booth was surprised to find little public sympathy for his action, especially from those anti-Lincoln newspapers that had previously excoriated the president in life. News of the assassination reached the far corners of the nation, and indignation was aroused against Lincoln&#x27;s critics, whom many blamed for encouraging Booth to act. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; editorialized:

Booth wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21, as he awaited nightfall before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia:

That same day, the nine-car funeral train bearing Lincoln&#x27;s body departed Washington on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, arriving at Baltimore&#x27;s Camden Station at 10 am, the first stop on a 13-day journey to Springfield, Illinois, its final destination. The funeral train slowly made its way westward through seven states, stopping en route at Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Trenton, New York, Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis during the following days. About 7 million people lined the railroad tracks along the route, holding aloft signs with legends such as &quot;We mourn our loss&quot;, &quot;He lives in the hearts of his people&quot;, and &quot;[t]he darkest hour in history&quot;.
In the cities where the train stopped, 1.5 million people viewed Lincoln in his coffin. Aboard the train was Chauncey Depew, a New York politician and later president of the New York Central Railroad, who said, &quot;As we sped over the rails at night, the scene was the most pathetic ever witnessed. At every crossroads the glare of innumerable torches illuminated the whole population, kneeling on the ground.&quot; Dorothy Kunhardt called the funeral train&#x27;s journey &quot;the mightiest outpouring of national grief the world had yet seen.&quot;

Mourners were viewing Lincoln&#x27;s remains when the funeral train steamed into Harrisburg at 8:20 pm, while Booth and Herold were provided with a boat and compass by Jones to cross the Potomac at night on April 21. Instead of reaching Virginia, they mistakenly navigated upriver to a bend in the broad Potomac River, coming ashore again in Maryland on April 22. The 23-year-old Herold knew the area well, having frequently hunted there, and recognized a nearby farm as belonging to a Confederate sympathizer. The farmer led them to his son-in-law, Col. John J. Hughes, who provided the fugitives with food and a hideout until nightfall, for a second attempt to row across the river to Virginia. Booth wrote in his diary:

The pair finally reached the Virginia shore near Machodoc Creek before dawn on April 23. There, they made contact with Thomas Harbin, whom Booth had previously brought into his erstwhile kidnapping plot. Harbin took Booth and Herold to another Confederate agent in the area named William Bryant who supplied them with horses.

While Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train was in New York City on April 24, Lieutenant Edward P. Doherty was dispatched from Washington at 2 p.m. with a detachment of 26 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment to capture Booth in Virginia, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Everton Conger, an intelligence officer assigned by Lafayette Baker. The detachment steamed down the Potomac River on the boat &quot;John S. Ide&quot;, landing at Belle Plain, Virginia, at 10 pm. The pursuers crossed the Rappahannock River and tracked Booth and Herold to Richard H. Garrett&#x27;s farm, about south of Port Royal, Virginia. Booth and Herold had been led to the farm on April 24 by William S. Jett, a former private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry, whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock. The Garretts were unaware of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination; Booth was introduced to them as &quot;James W. Boyd&quot;, a Confederate soldier, they were told, who had been wounded in the Siege of Petersburg and was returning home.

Garrett&#x27;s 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness to the event. In later years, he became a Baptist minister and widely lectured on the events of Booth&#x27;s demise at his family&#x27;s farm. In 1921, Garrett&#x27;s lecture was published in the &quot;Confederate Veteran&quot; as the &quot;True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth.&quot; According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts&#x27; farm, located on the road to, and close to, Bowling Green, around 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased with the collapse of the Confederacy, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston&#x27;s army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth&#x27;s attempt to save the Confederacy by Lincoln&#x27;s assassination had failed. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln&#x27;s death and the substantial reward for Booth&#x27;s capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest&#x27;s true identity, one of the older Garrett sons offered that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett&#x27;s account, &quot;Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett&#x27;s farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him.&quot;

==Death==
Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth&#x27;s location at the Garrett farm. Before dawn on April 26, the soldiers caught up with the fugitives, who were hiding in Garrett&#x27;s tobacco barn. David Herold surrendered, but Booth refused Conger&#x27;s demand to surrender, saying, &quot;I prefer to come out and fight.&quot; The soldiers then set the barn on fire. As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn, Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him. According to Corbett&#x27;s later account, he fired at Booth because the fugitive &quot;raised his pistol to shoot&quot; at them. Conger&#x27;s report to Stanton stated that Corbett shot Booth &quot;without order, pretext or excuse&quot;, and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive. Booth, fatally wounded in the neck, was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett&#x27;s farmhouse, where he died three hours later, aged 26. The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord, paralyzing him. In his dying moments, he reportedly whispered, &quot;Tell my mother I died for my country.&quot; Asking that his hands be raised to his face so that he could see them, Booth uttered his last words, &quot;Useless, useless&quot;, and as dawn was breaking he died of asphyxiation as a result of his wounds. In Booth&#x27;s pockets were found a compass, a candle, pictures of five women (actresses Alice Grey, Helen Western, Effie Germon, Fannie Brown, and Booth&#x27;s fiancée Lucy Hale), and his diary, where he had written of Lincoln&#x27;s death, &quot;Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.&quot;

Shortly after Booth&#x27;s death, his brother Edwin wrote to his sister Asia, &quot;Think no more of him as your brother; he is dead to us now, as he soon must be to all the world, but imagine the boy you loved to be in that better part of his spirit, in another world.&quot; Asia also had in her possession a sealed letter that Booth had given her in January 1865 for safekeeping, only to be opened upon his death. In the letter, Booth had written:

Booth&#x27;s letter was seized by Federal troops, along with other family papers at Asia&#x27;s house, and published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; while the manhunt was still underway. It explained his reasons for plotting against Lincoln. In it he decried Lincoln&#x27;s war policy as one of &quot;total annihilation&quot;, and said:

==Aftermath==

Booth&#x27;s body was shrouded in a blanket and tied to the side of an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS &quot;Montauk&quot; and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth&#x27;s by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used to make sure that the man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.
Three vertebrae were removed during the autopsy to enable physicians to remove the bullet. These bones were later put on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. The body was then buried in a storage room at the Arsenal Penitentiary in 1865, and later moved to a warehouse at the Washington Arsenal on October 1, 1867. In 1869, the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family, where they were buried in the family plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, after a burial ceremony conducted by Fleming James, minister of Christ Episcopal Church, in the presence of more than 40 people. Russell Conwell visited homes in the vanquished former Confederate states during this time, and he found that hatred of Lincoln still smoldered. &quot;Photographs of Wilkes Booth, with the last words of great martyrs printed upon its borders...adorn their drawing rooms&quot;.

Eight others implicated in Lincoln&#x27;s assassination were tried by a military tribunal in Washington, D.C., and found guilty on June 30, 1865. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7, 1865. Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O&#x27;Laughlen were sentenced to life imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in Florida&#x27;s isolated Dry Tortugas. Edmund Spangler was given a six-year term in prison. O&#x27;Laughlen died in a yellow fever epidemic there in 1867. The others were eventually pardoned in February 1869 by President Andrew Johnson.

Forty years later, when the centenary of Lincoln&#x27;s birth was celebrated in 1909, a border state official reflected on Booth&#x27;s assassination of Lincoln: &quot;Confederate veterans held public services and gave public expression to the sentiment, that &#x27;had Lincoln lived&#x27; the days of Reconstruction might have been softened and the era of good feeling ushered in earlier.&quot; The majority of Northerners viewed Booth as a madman or monster who murdered the savior of the Union, while in the South, many cursed Booth for bringing upon them the harsh revenge of an incensed North instead of the reconciliation promised by Lincoln. A century later, Goodrich concluded in 2005, &quot;For millions of people, particularly in the South, it would be decades before the impact of the Lincoln assassination began to release its terrible hold on their lives&quot;.

===Theories of Booth&#x27;s motivation===
Author Francis Wilson was 11 years old at the time of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. He wrote an epitaph of Booth in his 1929 book &quot;John Wilkes Booth&quot;: &quot;In the terrible deed he committed, he was actuated by no thought of monetary gain, but by a self-sacrificing, albeit wholly fanatical devotion to a cause he thought supreme.&quot; Others have seen more selfish motives, such as shame, ambition, and sibling rivalry for achievement and fame.

===Theories of Booth&#x27;s escape===

In 1907, Finis L. Bates wrote &quot;Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth&quot;, contending that a Booth look-alike was mistakenly killed at the Garrett farm while Booth eluded his pursuers. Booth, said Bates, assumed the pseudonym &quot;John St. Helen&quot; and settled on the Paluxy River near Glen Rose, Texas, and later moved to Granbury, Texas. He fell gravely ill and made a deathbed confession that he was the fugitive assassin, but he then recovered and fled, eventually committing suicide in 1903 in Enid, Oklahoma, under the alias &quot;David E. George&quot;. By 1913, more than 70,000 copies of the book had been sold, and Bates exhibited St. Helen&#x27;s mummified body in carnival sideshows.
In response, the Maryland Historical Society published an account in 1913 by Baltimore mayor William M. Pegram, who had viewed Booth&#x27;s remains upon the casket&#x27;s arrival at the Weaver funeral home in Baltimore on February 18, 1869, for burial at Green Mount Cemetery. Pegram had known Booth well as a young man; he submitted a sworn statement that the body which he had seen in 1869 was Booth&#x27;s. Others positively identified this body as Booth at the funeral home, including Booth&#x27;s mother, brother, and sister, along with his dentist and other Baltimore acquaintances. In 1911, &quot;The New York Times&quot; had published an account by their reporter detailing the burial of Booth&#x27;s body at the cemetery and those who were witnesses. The rumor periodically revived, as in the 1920s when a corpse was exhibited on a national tour by a carnival promoter and advertised as the &quot;Man Who Shot Lincoln&quot;. According to a 1938 article in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the exhibitor said that he obtained St. Helen&#x27;s corpse from Bates&#x27; widow.

&quot;The Lincoln Conspiracy&quot; (1977) contended that there was a government plot to conceal Booth&#x27;s escape, reviving interest in the story and prompting the display of St. Helen&#x27;s mummified body in Chicago that year. The book sold more than one million copies and was made into a feature film called &quot;The Lincoln Conspiracy&quot; which was theatrically released later that year. The 1998 book &quot;The Curse of Cain: The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth&quot; contended that Booth had escaped, sought refuge in Japan, and eventually returned to the United States.

In 1994, two historians together with several descendants sought a court order for the exhumation of Booth&#x27;s body at Green Mount Cemetery which was, according to their lawyer, &quot;intended to prove or disprove longstanding theories on Booth&#x27;s escape&quot; by conducting a photo-superimposition analysis. The application was blocked by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan, who cited, among other things, &quot;the unreliability of petitioners&#x27; less-than-convincing escape/cover-up theory&quot; as a major factor in his decision. The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling.

In December 2010, descendants of Edwin Booth reported that they obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor&#x27;s body to obtain DNA samples to compare with a sample of his brother John&#x27;s DNA to refute the rumor that John had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin&#x27;s body. The family hoped to obtain samples of John Wilkes&#x27;s DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokesperson Carol Johnson announced that the family&#x27;s request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.

<text>James Danforth Quayle (; born February 4, 1947) is an American retired politician who served as the 44th vice president of the United States from 1989 to 1993 under President George H. W. Bush. A member of the Republican Party, Quayle represented Indiana in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1977 to 1981 and in the U.S. Senate from 1981 to 1989.

A native of Indianapolis, Quayle spent most of his childhood in Paradise Valley, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. He married Marilyn Tucker in 1972 and obtained his J.D. degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law in 1974. He and Marilyn practiced law in Huntington, Indiana, before his election to the United States House of Representatives in 1976. In 1980, he was elected to the U.S. Senate.

In 1988, incumbent vice president and Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush chose Quayle as his running mate. His vice presidential debate against Lloyd Bentsen was notable for Bentsen&#x27;s &quot;Senator, you&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy&quot; quip. The Bush–Quayle ticket defeated the Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and Bentsen, and Quayle succeeded Bush as vice president in January 1989. During his tenure, Quayle made official visits to 47 countries and was appointed chairman of the National Space Council. As vice president, he developed a reputation for making comments that some media outlets perceived to be gaffes. He secured re-nomination for vice president in 1992, but was defeated by the Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

In 1994, Quayle published his memoir, &quot;Standing Firm&quot;. He declined to run for president in 1996 because of phlebitis. He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but withdrew his campaign early on and supported the eventual nominee, George W. Bush. He joined Cerberus Capital Management, a private-equity firm, in 1999. Since leaving office, Quayle has remained active in the Republican Party, including making presidential endorsements in 2000, 2012, 2016, and 2020.

==Early life, education, and career==
Quayle was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Martha Corinne (née Pulliam) and James Cline Quayle. He has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as &quot;James Danforth Quayle III&quot;. In his memoir he points out that his birth name was simply James Danforth Quayle. The name Quayle originates from the Isle of Man, where his great-grandfather was born.

His maternal grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, was a wealthy and influential publishing magnate who founded Central Newspapers, Inc., and owned more than a dozen major newspapers, such as &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; and &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;. James C. Quayle moved his family to Arizona in 1955 to run a branch of the family&#x27;s publishing empire.

After spending much of his youth in Arizona, Quayle returned to his native Indiana and graduated from Huntington North High School in Huntington in 1965. He then matriculated at DePauw University, where he received his B.A. degree in political science in 1969, was the captain of the university golf team and a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon (Psi Phi chapter).

After graduation, Quayle joined the Indiana National Guard and served from 1969 to 1975, reaching the rank of sergeant; his joining meant that he was not subject to the draft. In 1970, while serving in the Guard, Quayle enrolled at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He was admitted under a program for students who could demonstrate &quot;special factors&quot; as his grades did not meet the regular admission standards. In 1974, Quayle earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. At Indiana University, he met his future wife, Marilyn, who was taking night classes at the same law school at the time.

Quayle became an investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Indiana Attorney General in July 1971. Later that year, he became an administrative assistant to Governor Edgar Whitcomb. From 1973 to 1974, he was the Director of the Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue. After graduating from law school in 1974, Quayle worked as associate publisher of his family&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Huntington Herald-Press&quot;.

==Congressional tenure==

In 1976, Quayle was elected to the House of Representatives from Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district, defeating eight-term incumbent Democrat J. Edward Roush by a 55%-to-45% margin. He was reelected in 1978, 64% to 34%.

In November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan of California invited Quayle to accompany him on a delegation to investigate unsafe conditions at the Jonestown settlement in Guyana, but Quayle was unable to participate. The decision likely saved Quayle&#x27;s life, because Ryan and his entourage were subsequently murdered at the airstrip in Jonestown as the party tried to escape the massacre.

In 1980, at age 33, Quayle became the youngest person ever elected to the Senate from the state of Indiana, defeating three-term incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh with 54% of the vote. Making Indiana political history again, Quayle was reelected to the Senate in 1986 with the largest margin ever achieved to that date by a candidate in a statewide Indiana race, taking 61% of the vote against his Democratic opponent, Jill Long.

In 1986, Quayle was criticized for championing the cause of Daniel Anthony Manion, a candidate for a federal appellate judgeship, who was in law school one year ahead of Quayle. The American Bar Association had evaluated Manion as &quot;qualified/unqualified&quot;, its lower passing grade. Manion was nominated for the Seventh Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan on February 21, 1986, and confirmed by the Senate on June 26, 1986.

==Vice presidency (1989–1993)==

===1988 campaign===

On August 16, 1988, at the Republican convention in New Orleans, Louisiana, George H. W. Bush chose Quayle to be his running mate in the 1988 United States presidential election. The choice immediately became controversial. Outgoing President Reagan praised Quayle for his &quot;energy and enthusiasm&quot;. Press coverage of the convention was dominated by questions about &quot;the three Quayle problems&quot;. The questions involved his military service, a golf holiday in Florida where he and several other politicians shared a house with lobbyist Paula Parkinson, and whether he had enough experience to be vice president. Quayle seemed at times rattled and at other times uncertain or evasive as he responded to questions. Delegates to the convention generally blamed television and newspapers for the focus on Quayle&#x27;s problems, but Bush&#x27;s staff said they thought Quayle had mishandled the questions about his military record, leaving questions dangling. Although Bush was trailing by up to 15 points in public opinion polls taken before the convention, in August the Bush–Quayle ticket took the lead, which it did not relinquish for the rest of the campaign.

In the October 1988 vice-presidential debate, Quayle debated Democratic candidate Lloyd Bentsen. During the debate, Quayle&#x27;s strategy was to criticize Dukakis as too liberal. When the debate turned to Quayle&#x27;s relatively limited experience in public life, he compared the length of his congressional service (12 years) with that of President John F. Kennedy (14 years); Kennedy had less experience than his rivals during the 1960 presidential nomination. It was a factual comparison, although Quayle&#x27;s advisers cautioned beforehand that it could be used against him. Bentsen&#x27;s response—&quot;I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you&#x27;re no Jack Kennedy&quot;—subsequently became a part of the political lexicon.

The Bush–Quayle ticket won the November election by a 53–46 percent margin, sweeping 40 states and capturing 426 electoral votes. He was sworn in on January 20, 1989. Quayle cast no tie-breaking votes as president of the Senate, becoming only the second vice-president (after Charles W. Fairbanks) not to do so while serving a complete term.

===Tenure===

During his vice presidency, Quayle made official trips to 47 countries. Bush named Quayle head of the Council on Competitiveness and the first chairman of the National Space Council. As head of the NSC he called for greater efforts to protect Earth against the danger of potential asteroid impacts.

After a briefing by Lt. General Daniel O. Graham, (USA Ret.), Max Hunter, and Jerry Pournelle, Quayle sponsored the development of an experimental Single Stage to Orbit X-Program, which resulted in the building of the McDonnell Douglas DC-X.
Quayle has since described the vice presidency as &quot;an awkward office. You&#x27;re president of the Senate. You&#x27;re not even officially part of the executive branch—you&#x27;re part of the legislative branch. You&#x27;re paid by the Senate, not by the executive branch. And it&#x27;s the president&#x27;s agenda. It&#x27;s not your agenda. You&#x27;re going to disagree from time to time, but you salute and carry out the orders the best you can&quot;.

====&quot;Murphy Brown&quot;====

On May 19, 1992, Quayle gave a speech titled &quot;&quot; to the Commonwealth Club of California on the subject of the Los Angeles riots. In the speech he blamed the violence on a decay of moral values and family structure in American society. In an aside, he cited the single mother title character in the television program &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; as an example of how popular culture contributes to this &quot;poverty of values&quot;, saying, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown—a character who supposedly epitomizes today&#x27;s intelligent, highly paid, professional woman—mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a child alone, and calling it just another &#x27;lifestyle choice&#x27;.&quot;

The &quot;Murphy Brown speech&quot; became one of the most memorable of the 1992 campaign. Long after the outcry had ended, the comment continued to have an effect on U.S. politics. Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of marriage, said that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown &quot;kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the &#x27;collapse of the family. In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, said &quot;I never have really said much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did.&quot; Others interpreted it differently; singer Tanya Tucker was widely quoted as saying &quot;Who the hell is Dan Quayle to come after single mothers?&quot;

====Perceived gaffes====

Throughout his time as vice president, Quayle was characterized by some media outlets and journalists as being unprepared for the position. Given his position, his comments were heavily scrutinized for factual and grammatical errors. Contributing to this perception of Quayle was his tendency to make public statements that were either impossible (&quot;I have made good judgments in the past. I have made good judgments in the future&quot;), self-contradictory (&quot;I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and democracy, but that could change&quot;), self-contradictory and confused (&quot;The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation&#x27;s history. ... No, not our nation&#x27;s, but in World War II. I mean, we all lived in this century. I didn&#x27;t live in this century, but in this century&#x27;s history&quot;), or just confused (such as the comments he made in a May 1989 address to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF). Commenting on the UNCF&#x27;s slogan—which is &quot;a mind is a terrible thing to waste&quot;—Quayle said, &quot;You take the UNCF model that what a waste it is to lose one&#x27;s mind or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is&quot;).

On June 15, 1992, Quayle altered 12-year-old student William Figueroa&#x27;s correct spelling of &quot;potato&quot; to &quot;potatoe&quot; at the Muñoz Rivera Elementary School spelling bee in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the subject of widespread ridicule for his error. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Quayle&#x27;s memoirs, he was relying on cards provided by the school, which Quayle says included the misspelling. Quayle said he was uncomfortable with the version he gave, but did so because he decided to trust the school&#x27;s incorrect written materials instead of his own judgment.

===1992 campaign===

In the 1992 election, Bush and Quayle were challenged in their bid for reelection by the Democratic ticket of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton and Tennessee Senator Al Gore and the independent ticket of Texas businessman Ross Perot and retired Vice Admiral James Stockdale.

As Bush lagged in the polls in the weeks preceding the August 1992 Republican National Convention, some Republican strategists (led by Secretary of State James Baker) viewed Quayle as a liability to the ticket and pushed for his replacement. Quayle ultimately survived the challenge and secured renomination.

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Quayle told the news media that he believed homosexuality was a choice, and &quot;the wrong choice&quot;.

Quayle faced off against Gore and Stockdale in the vice presidential debate on October 13, 1992. He attempted to avoid the one-sided outcome of his debate with Bentsen four years earlier by staying on the offensive. Quayle criticized Gore&#x27;s book &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot; with specific page references, though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group FAIR for inaccuracy. In Quayle&#x27;s closing argument, he sharply asked voters, &quot;Do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth?&quot; and &quot;Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?&quot; Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused. Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayle&#x27;s performance, and his camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater, but post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore or Quayle had won. It ultimately proved to be a minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quayle lost, 168 electoral votes to 370.

==Post–vice presidency (1993–present)==
===Initial activities===
In 1993, Quayle became the trustee of the Hudson Institute. From 1993 to January 1999, he served on the board of Central Newspapers, Inc., and from 1995 until January 1999, he headed the Campaign America political action committee.

Quayle authored a 1994 memoir, &quot;Standing Firm&quot;, which became a bestseller. Quayle&#x27;s second book, &quot;The American Family: Discovering the Values That Make Us Strong&quot;, was co-authored with Diane Medved and published in 1996. He later published his third book &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot;, in 1999.

Quayle moved to Arizona in 1996. He considered but decided against running for governor of Indiana in 1996, and decided against running for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, citing health problems related to phlebitis.

In 1997 and 1998, Quayle was a &quot;distinguished visiting professor of international studies&quot; at the Thunderbird School of Global Management.

===2000 presidential campaign===

During a January 1999 appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Quayle said he would run for president in 2000. On January 28, 1999, he officially created an exploratory committee. On April 14, 1999, at a rally held at his alma mater Huntington North High School&#x27;s gymnasium, Quayle officially launched his campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. In July 1999, he published his book &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot;.

During campaign appearances, Quayle criticized fellow candidate George W. Bush. Early on, he criticized Bush&#x27;s use of the term &quot;compassionate conservative&quot;.

Quayle finished eighth in the August 1999 Ames Straw Poll. He withdrew from the race the next month and supported Bush.

===Subsequent activities===
Quayle, then working as an investment banker in Phoenix, was mentioned as a candidate for governor of Arizona before the 2002 election, but declined to run.

Quayle attended the second inauguration of George W. Bush in 2005 and the first inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009.

On January 31, 2011, Quayle wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to commute Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s sentence.

In December 2011, Quayle endorsed Mitt Romney for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

In the 2016 presidential election, Quayle endorsed Jeb Bush. After Bush failed to win the nomination, Quayle endorsed Donald Trump; he was later seen visiting with Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan before Trump&#x27;s inauguration.

The Dan Quayle Center and Museum, in Huntington, Indiana, features information on Quayle and all U.S. vice presidents.

Quayle is an Honorary Trustee Emeritus of the Hudson Institute and president of Quayle and Associates. He has also been a member of the board of directors of Heckmann Corporation, a water-sector company, since the company&#x27;s inception and serves as chair of the company&#x27;s Compensation and Nominating &amp; Governance Committees. Quayle is a director of Aozora Bank, based in Tokyo, Japan. He has also been on the boards of directors of other companies, including K2 Sports, AmTran Inc., Central Newspapers Inc., BTC Inc. and Carvana Co.

According to the book &quot;Peril&quot;, by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, Quayle played a central role in advising his fellow Hoosier and Vice President Mike Pence to certify the 2020 United States presidential election as per the Senate rules, rather than cooperate with a plan by then-president Donald Trump that sought to overturn the election. Quayle attended President Joe Biden&#x27;s inauguration on January 20, 2021.

Quayle attended President Donald Trump&#x27;s second inauguration on January 20, 2025.

===Cerberus Capital Management===
In 1999, Quayle joined Cerberus Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar private-equity firm, where he serves as chair of the company&#x27;s Global Investments division. As chair of the international advisory board of Cerberus Capital Management, he recruited former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, who would have been installed as chair if Cerberus had acquired Air Canada.

In early 2014, Quayle traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, in an attempt to speed approval for a deal in which Cerberus acquired nearly £1.3 billion in Northern Ireland loans from the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s National Asset Management Agency. The Irish government is investigating the deal, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York are investigating Quayle&#x27;s involvement as a potentially &quot;very serious&quot; misuse of the vice president&#x27;s office. As of December 2018, Quayle served as chair of Global Investments at Cerberus.

==Personal life==

Quayle lives with his wife, Marilyn Quayle, in Paradise Valley, Arizona. They married in November 1972 and have three children: Tucker, Benjamin, and Corinne. Benjamin Quayle served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013, representing Arizona&#x27;s 3rd congressional district.

== Indiana National Guard controversy ==
Since the 1988 United States elections, Quayle has been the subject of controversy regarding his service in the Indiana National Guard from 1969 to 1975. Many of Quayle&#x27;s political opponents, media outlets, and Vietnam veterans have speculated that Quayle joined the Indiana National Guard as a means to avoid the draft or to avoid being deployed to Vietnam. In August 1988, Quayle denied the accusations. Quayle&#x27;s draft controversy received renewed attention during the 1992 United States elections after Democratic nominee Bill Clinton was accused of similar draft dodging measures. In September 1992, Quayle acknowledged that joining the Indiana National Guard cut his risks of being deployed to Vietnam, although he defended his decision. In a 1992 interview with NBC&#x27;s Meet the Press, Quayle was pressed on whether his main motivation was to avoid being sent to fight in Vietnam. Quayle stated that he had preferences for joining the reserves, and that he never asked for preferential treatment. Quayle also noted that had his unit been called, he would have deployed, stating:Of course you had much less chance to go to Vietnam, but my unit could have been called up to go to Vietnam. And had it been called up, I would have gone.In a resurfaced 1989 interview with David Hoffman, filmmaker and Vietnam veteran Oliver Stone commented on Quayle and made contrasts between him and then-Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey, noting:I&#x27;m hopeful of people like Bob Kerrey, for example, [the] governor of Nebraska, would be a presidential candidate. He&#x27;s about forty-two and lost a leg in Vietnam. [He&#x27;s a] very bright man, compassionate, he&#x27;s been there. I think he&#x27;d make a fine president. Against him would be a guy like Dan Quayle, who is also about the same age, early forties—a heartbeat away from the presidency—a man who has never really suffered pain—a man who went to the National Guard to avoid Vietnam, and yet he&#x27;s one who always calls for military intervention in Central America, with other people&#x27;s bodies. You have that hypocrisy at work.

<text>Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100BC – 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. A member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war and subsequently became dictator from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.

In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass political power were opposed by many in the Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the private support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, which greatly extended Roman territory. During this time, he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the river Rhine. These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey. The alliance between Caesar and Pompey slowly broke down and, by 50 BC, Pompey had realigned himself with the Senate. With his command expiring and the Gallic Wars largely concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. In early January 49 BC, Caesar openly defied the Senate by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army. This began Caesar&#x27;s civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near-unchallenged power and influence in 45 BC.

After assuming control of government and pardoning many of his enemies, Caesar set upon vigorous reform and building programme. He created the Julian calendar to replace the republican lunisolar calendar, reduced the size of the grain dole, settled his veterans in new overseas colonies, greatly increased the size of the Senate, and extended citizenship to communities in Spain and what is now northern Italy. In early 44 BC, he was proclaimed &quot;dictator for life&quot; (). Fearful of his power, domination of the state, and the possibility that he might make himself king, a group of senators led by Brutus and Cassius assassinated Caesar on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar&#x27;s great-nephew and adoptive heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents thirteen years later. Octavian then set about solidifying his power, transforming the Republic into the Roman Empire.

Caesar was an accomplished author and historian; much of his life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns. Other contemporary sources include the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. Later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also important sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history. His cognomen was subsequently adopted as a synonym for &quot;emperor&quot;; the title &quot;Caesar&quot; was used throughout the Roman Empire, giving rise to modern descendants such as Kaiser and Tsar. He has frequently appeared in literary and artistic works.

==Early life and career==
Gaius Julius Caesar was born into a patrician family, the , on 12 July 100 BC. The family claimed to have immigrated to Rome from Alba Longa during the seventh century BC after the third king of Rome, Tullus Hostilius, took and destroyed their city. The family also claimed descent from Julus, the son of Aeneas and founder of Alba Longa. Given that Aeneas was a son of Venus, this made the clan divine. This genealogy had not yet taken its final form by the first century, but the clan&#x27;s claimed descent from Venus was well established in public consciousness. There is no evidence that Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section; such operations entailed the death of the mother, but Caesar&#x27;s mother lived for decades after his birth and no ancient sources record any difficulty with the birth.

Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential during the middle republic. The first person known to have had the cognomen &quot;Caesar&quot; was a praetor in 208 BC during the Second Punic War. The family&#x27;s first consul was in 157 BC, though their political fortunes had recovered in the early first century, producing two consuls in 91 and 90 BC. Caesar&#x27;s homonymous father was moderately successful politically. He married Aurelia, a member of the politically influential Aurelii Cottae, producing – along with Caesar – two daughters. Buoyed by his own marriage and the marriage of his sister to the extremely influential Gaius Marius, he also served on the Saturninian land commission in 103 BC and was elected praetor some time between 92 and 85 BC; he served as proconsular governor of Asia for two years, likely 91–90 BC.

=== Life under Sulla and military service ===
Caesar&#x27;s father did not seek a consulship during the domination of Lucius Cornelius Cinna and instead chose retirement. During Cinna&#x27;s dominance, Caesar was named as &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; (a priest of Jupiter) which led to his marriage to Cinna&#x27;s daughter, Cornelia. The religious taboos of the priesthood would have forced Caesar to forgo a political career; the appointment – one of the highest non-political honours – indicates that there were few expectations of a major career for Caesar. In early 84 BC, Caesar&#x27;s father died suddenly. After Sulla&#x27;s victory in the civil war (82 BC), Cinna&#x27;s &quot;acta&quot; were annulled. Sulla consequently ordered Caesar to abdicate and divorce Cinna&#x27;s daughter. Caesar refused, implicitly questioning the legitimacy of Sulla&#x27;s annulment. Sulla may have put Caesar on the proscription lists, though scholars are mixed. Caesar then went into hiding before his relatives and contacts among the Vestal Virgins were able to intercede on his behalf. They then reached a compromise where Caesar would resign his priesthood but keep his wife and chattels; Sulla&#x27;s alleged remark he saw &quot;in [Caesar] many Mariuses&quot; is apocryphal.

Caesar then left Italy to serve in the staff of the governor of Asia, Marcus Minucius Thermus. While there, he travelled to Bithynia to collect naval reinforcements and stayed some time as a guest of the king, Nicomedes IV, though later invective connected Caesar to a homosexual relation with the monarch. He then served at the Siege of Mytilene where he won the civic crown for saving the life of a fellow citizen in battle. The privileges of the crown – the Senate was supposed to stand on a holder&#x27;s entrance and holders were permitted to wear the crown at public occasions – whetted Caesar&#x27;s appetite for honours. After the capture of Mytilene, Caesar transferred to the staff of Publius Servilius Vatia in Cilicia before learning of Sulla&#x27;s death in 78 BC and returning home immediately. He was alleged to have wanted to join in on the consul Lepidus&#x27; revolt that year but this is likely literary embellishment of Caesar&#x27;s desire for tyranny from a young age.

Afterward, Caesar attacked some of the Sullan aristocracy in the courts but was unsuccessful in his attempted prosecution of Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella in 77 BC, who had recently returned from a proconsulship in Macedonia. Going after a less well-connected senator, he was successful the next year in prosecuting Gaius Antonius Hybrida (later consul in 63 BC) for profiteering from the proscriptions but was forestalled when a tribune interceded on Antonius&#x27; behalf. After these oratorical attempts, Caesar left Rome for Rhodes seeking the tutelage of the rhetorician Apollonius Molon. While travelling, he was intercepted and ransomed by pirates in a story that was later much embellished. According to Plutarch and Suetonius, he was freed after paying a ransom of fifty talents and responded by returning with a fleet to capture and execute the pirates. The recorded sum for the ransom is literary embellishment and it is more likely that the pirates were sold into slavery per Velleius Paterculus. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War over the winter of 75 and 74 BC; Caesar is alleged to have gone around collecting troops in the province at the locals&#x27; expense and leading them successfully against Mithridates&#x27; forces.

=== Entrance to politics ===
While absent from Rome, in 73 BC, Caesar was co-opted into the pontifices in place of his deceased relative Gaius Aurelius Cotta. The promotion marked him as a well-accepted member of the aristocracy with great future prospects in his political career. Caesar decided to return shortly thereafter and on his return was elected one of the military tribunes for 71 BC. There is no evidence that Caesar served in war – even though the war on Spartacus was on-going – during his term; he did, however, agitate for the removal of Sulla&#x27;s disabilities on the plebeian tribunate and for those who supported Lepidus&#x27; revolt to be pardoned. These advocacies were common and uncontroversial. The next year, 70 BC, Pompey and Crassus were consuls and brought legislation restoring the plebeian tribunate&#x27;s rights; one of the tribunes, with Caesar supporting, then brought legislation pardoning the Lepidan exiles.

For his quaestorship in 69 BC, Caesar was allotted to serve under Gaius Antistius Vetus in Hispania Ulterior. His election also gave him a lifetime seat in the Senate. However, before he left, his aunt Julia, the widow of Marius died and, soon afterwards, his wife Cornelia died shortly after bearing his only legitimate child, Julia. He gave eulogies for both at public funerals. During Julia&#x27;s funeral, Caesar displayed the images of his aunt&#x27;s husband Marius, whose memory had been suppressed after Sulla&#x27;s victory in the civil war. Some of the Sullan nobles – including Quintus Lutatius Catulus – who had suffered under the Marian regime objected, but by this point depictions of husbands in aristocratic women&#x27;s funerary processions was common. Contra Plutarch, Caesar&#x27;s action here was likely in keeping with a political trend for reconciliation and normalisation rather than a display of renewed factionalism. Caesar quickly remarried, taking the hand of Sulla&#x27;s granddaughter Pompeia.

=== Aedileship and election as &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; ===
For much of this period, Caesar was one of Pompey&#x27;s supporters. Caesar joined with Pompey in the late 70s to support restoration of tribunician rights; his support for the law recalling the Lepidan exiles may have been related to the same tribune&#x27;s bill to grant lands to Pompey&#x27;s veterans. Caesar also supported the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot; in 67 BC granting Pompey an extraordinary command against piracy in the Mediterranean and also supported the &quot;lex Manilia&quot; in 66 BC to reassign the Third Mithridatic War from its then-commander Lucullus to Pompey.
Four years after his aunt Julia&#x27;s funeral, in 65 BC, Caesar served as curule aedile and staged lavish games that won him further attention and popular support. He also restored the trophies won by Marius, and taken down by Sulla, over Jugurtha and the Cimbri. According to Plutarch&#x27;s narrative, the trophies were restored overnight to the applause and tears of joy of the onlookers; however, any sudden and secret restoration of this sort would not have been possible – architects, restorers, and other workmen would have to have been hired and paid for – nor would it have been likely that the work could have been done in a single night. It is more likely that Caesar was merely restoring his family&#x27;s public monuments – consistent with standard aristocratic practice and the virtue of – and, over objections from Catulus, these actions were broadly supported by the Senate.

In 63 BC, Caesar stood for the praetorship and also for the post of , who was the head of the College of Pontiffs and the highest ranking state religious official. In the pontifical election before the tribes, Caesar faced two influential senators: Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Publius Servilius Isauricus. Caesar came out victorious. Many scholars have expressed astonishment that Caesar&#x27;s candidacy was taken seriously, but this was not without historical precedent. Ancient sources allege that Caesar paid huge bribes or was shamelessly ingratiating; that no charge was ever laid alleging this implies that bribery alone is insufficient to explain his victory. If bribes or other monies were needed, they may have been underwritten by Pompey, whom Caesar at this time supported and who opposed Catulus&#x27; candidacy.

Many sources also assert that Caesar supported the land reform proposals brought that year by plebeian tribune Publius Servilius Rullus, however, there are no ancient sources so attesting. Caesar also engaged in a collateral manner in the trial of Gaius Rabirius by one of the plebeian tribunes – Titus Labienus – for the murder of Saturninus in accordance with a senatus consultum ultimum some forty years earlier. The most famous event of the year was the Catilinarian conspiracy. While some of Caesar&#x27;s enemies, including Catulus, alleged that he participated in the conspiracy, the chance that he was a participant is extremely small.

=== Praetorship ===
Caesar won his election to the praetorship in 63 BC easily and, as one of the praetor-elects, spoke out that December in the Senate against executing certain citizens who had been arrested in the city conspiring with Gauls in furtherance of the conspiracy. Caesar&#x27;s proposal at the time is not entirely clear. The earlier sources assert that he advocated life imprisonment without trial; the later sources assert he instead wanted the conspirators imprisoned pending trial. Most accounts agree that Caesar supported confiscation of the conspirators&#x27; property. Caesar likely advocated the former, which was a compromise position that would place the Senate within the bounds of the , and was initially successful in swaying the body; a later intervention by Cato, however, swayed the Senate at the end for execution.

During his year as praetor, Caesar first attempted to deprive his enemy Catulus of the honour of completing the rebuilt Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, accusing him of embezzling funds, and threatening to bring legislation to reassign it to Pompey. This proposal was quickly dropped amid near-universal opposition. He then supported the attempt by plebeian tribune Metellus Nepos to transfer the command against Catiline from the consul of 63, Gaius Antonius Hybrida, to Pompey. After a violent meeting of the comitia tributa in the forum, where Metellus came into fisticuffs with his tribunician colleagues Cato and Quintus Minucius Thermus, the Senate passed a decree against Metellus – Suetonius claims that both Nepos and Caesar were deposed from their magistracies; this would have been a constitutional impossibility – which led Caesar to distance himself from the proposals: hopes for a provincial command and need to repair relations with the aristocracy took priority. He also was engaged in the Bona Dea affair, where Publius Clodius Pulcher sneaked into Caesar&#x27;s house sacrilegiously during a female religious observance; Caesar avoided any part of the affair by divorcing his wife immediately – claiming that his wife needed to be &quot;above suspicion&quot; – but there is no indication that Caesar supported Clodius in any way.

After his praetorship, Caesar was appointed to govern Hispania Ulterior &quot;pro consule&quot;. Deeply indebted from his campaigns for the praetorship and for the pontificate, Caesar required military victory beyond the normal provincial extortion to pay them off. He campaigned against the Callaeci and Lusitani and seized the Callaeci capital in northwestern Spain, bringing Roman troops to the Atlantic and seizing enough plunder to pay his debts. Claiming to have completed the peninsula&#x27;s conquest, he made for home after having been hailed . When he arrived home in the summer of 60 BC, he was then forced to choose between a triumph and election to the consulship: either he could remain outside the (Rome&#x27;s sacred boundary) awaiting a triumph or cross the boundary, giving up his command and triumph, to make a declaration of consular candidacy. Attempts to waive the requirement for the declaration to be made in person were filibustered in the Senate by Caesar&#x27;s enemy Cato, even though the Senate seemed to support the exception. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.

== First consulship and the Gallic Wars ==
Caesar stood for the consulship of 59 BC along with two other candidates. His political position at the time was strong: he had supporters among the families which had supported Marius or Cinna; his connection with the Sullan aristocracy was good; his support of Pompey had won him support in turn. His support for reconciliation in continuing aftershocks of the civil war was popular in all parts of society. With the support of Crassus, who supported Caesar&#x27;s joint ticket with one Lucius Lucceius, Caesar won. Lucceius, however, did not and the voters returned Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus instead, one of Caesar&#x27;s long-standing personal and political enemies.

=== First consulship ===
After the elections, Caesar reconciled Pompey and Crassus, two political foes, in a three-way alliance misleadingly termed the &quot;First Triumvirate&quot; in modern times. Caesar was still at work in December of 60 BC attempting to find allies for his consulship and the alliance was finalised only some time around its start. Pompey and Crassus joined in pursuit of two respective goals: the ratification of Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlement and the bailing out of tax farmers in Asia, many of whom were Crassus&#x27; clients. All three sought the extended patronage of land grants, with Pompey especially seeking the promised land grants for his veterans.

Caesar&#x27;s first act was to publish the minutes of the Senate and the assemblies, signalling the Senate&#x27;s accountability to the public. He then brought in the Senate a bill – crafted to avoid objections to previous land reform proposals and any indications of radicalism – to purchase property from willing sellers to distribute to Pompey&#x27;s veterans and the urban poor. It would be administered by a board of twenty (with Caesar excluded), and financed by Pompey&#x27;s plunder and territorial gains. Referring it to the Senate in hope that it would take up the matter to show its beneficence for the people, there was little opposition and the obstructionism that occurred was largely unprincipled, firmly opposing it not on grounds of public interest but rather opposition to Caesar&#x27;s political advancement. Unable to overcome Cato&#x27;s filibustering, he moved the bill before the people and, at a public meeting, Caesar&#x27;s co-consul Bibulus threatened a permanent veto for the entire year. This clearly violated the people&#x27;s well-established legislative sovereignty and triggered a riot in which Bibulus&#x27; fasces were broken, symbolising popular rejection of his magistracy. The bill was then voted through. Bibulus attempted to induce the Senate to nullify it on grounds it was passed by violence and contrary to the auspices but the Senate refused.

Caesar also brought and passed a one-third write-down of tax farmers&#x27; arrears for Crassus and ratification of Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlements. Both bills were passed with little or no debate in the Senate. Caesar then moved to extend his agrarian bill to Campania some time in May; this may be when Bibulus withdrew to his house. Pompey, shortly thereafter, also wed Caesar&#x27;s daughter Julia to seal their alliance. An ally of Caesar&#x27;s, plebeian tribune Publius Vatinius moved the &quot;lex Vatinia&quot; assigning the provinces of Illyricum and Cisalpine Gaul to Caesar for five years. Suetonius&#x27; claim that the Senate had assigned to Caesar the (&quot;woods and tracks&quot;) is likely an exaggeration: fear of Gallic invasion had grown in 60 BC and it is more likely that the consuls had been assigned to Italy, a defensive posture that Caesarian partisans dismissed as &quot;mere &#x27;forest tracks&#x27;&quot;. The Senate was also persuaded to assign to Caesar Transalpine Gaul as well, subject to annual renewal, most likely to control his ability to make war on the far side of the Alps.

Some time in the year, perhaps after the passing of the bill distributing the Campanian land and after these political defeats, Bibulus withdrew to his house. There, he issued edicts in absentia, purporting unprecedentedly to cancel all days on which Caesar or his allies could hold votes for religious reasons. Cato too attempted symbolic gestures against Caesar, which allowed him and his allies to &quot;feign victimisation&quot;; these tactics were successful in building revulsion to Caesar and his allies through the year. This opposition caused serious political difficulties to Caesar and his allies, belying the common depiction of triumviral political supremacy. Later in the year, however, Caesar – with the support of his opponents – brought and passed the to crack down on provincial corruption. When his consulship ended, Caesar&#x27;s legislation was challenged by two of the new praetors but discussion in the Senate stalled and was regardless dropped. He stayed near the city until some time around mid-March.

=== Campaigns in Gaul ===
During the Gallic Wars, Caesar wrote his &quot;Commentaries&quot; thereon, which were acknowledged even in his time as a Latin literary masterwork. Meant to document Caesar&#x27;s campaigns in his own words and maintain support in Rome for his military operations and career, he produced some ten volumes covering operations in Gaul from 58 to 52 BC. Each was likely produced in the year following the events described and was likely aimed at the general, or at least literate, population in Rome; the account is naturally partial to Caesar – his defeats are excused and victories highlighted – but it is almost the sole source for events in Gaul in this period.

Gaul in 58 BC was in the midst of some instability. Tribes had raided into Transalpine Gaul and there was an on-going struggle between two tribes in central Gaul which collaterally involved Roman alliances and politics. The divisions within the Gauls – they were no unified bloc – would be exploited in the coming years. The first engagement was in April 58 BC when Caesar prevented the migrating Helvetii from moving through Roman territory, allegedly because he feared they would unseat a Roman ally. Building a wall, he stopped their movement near Geneva and – after raising two legions – defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte before forcing them to return to their original homes. He was drawn further north responding to requests from Gallic tribes, including the Aedui, for aid against Ariovistus – king of the Suebi and a declared friend of Rome by the Senate during Caesar&#x27;s own consulship – and he defeated them at the Battle of Vosges. Wintering in northeastern Gaul near the Belgae in the winter of 58–57, Caesar&#x27;s forward military position triggered an uprising to remove his troops; able to eke out a victory at the Battle of the Sabis, Caesar spent much of 56 BC suppressing the Belgae and dispersing his troops to campaign across much of Gaul, including against the Veneti in what is now Brittany. At this point, almost all of Gaul – except its central regions – fell under Roman subjugation.

Seeking to buttress his military reputation, he engaged Germans attempting to cross the Rhine, which marked it as a Roman frontier; displaying Roman engineering prowess, he here built a bridge across the Rhine in a feat of engineering meant to show Rome&#x27;s ability to project power. Ostensibly seeking to interdict British aid to his Gallic enemies, he led expeditions into southern Britain in 55 and 54 BC, perhaps seeking further conquests or otherwise wanting to impress readers in Rome; Britain at the time was to the Romans an &quot;island of mystery&quot; and &quot;a land of wonder&quot;. He, however, withdrew from the island in the face of winter uprisings in Gaul led by the Eburones and Belgae starting in late 54 BC which ambushed and virtually annihilated a legion and five cohorts. Caesar was, however, able to lure the rebels into unfavourable terrain and routed them in battle. The next year, a greater challenge emerged with the uprising of most of central Gaul, led by Vercingetorix of the Averni. Caesar was initially defeated at Gergovia before besieging Vercingetorix at Alesia. After becoming himself besieged, Caesar won a major victory which forced Vercingetorix&#x27;s surrender; Caesar then spent much of his time into 51 BC suppressing any remaining resistance.

=== Politics, Gaul, and Rome ===
In the initial years from the end of Caesar&#x27;s consulship in 59 BC, the three so-called triumvirs sought to maintain the goodwill of the extremely popular Publius Clodius Pulcher, who was plebeian tribune in 58 BC and in that year successfully sent Cicero into exile. When Clodius took an anti-Pompeian stance later that year, he unsettled Pompey&#x27;s eastern arrangements, started attacking the validity of Caesar&#x27;s consular legislation, and by August 58 forced Pompey into seclusion. Caesar and Pompey responded by successfully backing the election of magistrates to recall Cicero from exile on the condition that Cicero would refrain from criticism or obstruction of the allies.

Politics in Rome fell into violent street clashes between Clodius and two tribunes who were friends of Cicero. With Cicero now supporting Caesar and Pompey, Caesar sent news of Gaul to Rome and claimed total victory and pacification. The Senate at Cicero&#x27;s motion voted him an unprecedented fifteen days of thanksgiving. Such reports were necessary for Caesar, especially in light of senatorial opponents, to prevent the Senate from reassigning his command in Transalpine Gaul, even if his position in Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum was guaranteed by the &quot;lex Vatinia&quot; until 54 BC. His success was evidently recognised when the Senate voted state funds for some of Caesar&#x27;s legions, which until this time Caesar had paid for personally.

The three allies&#x27; relations broke down in 57 BC: one of Pompey&#x27;s allies challenged Caesar&#x27;s land reform bill and the allies had a poor showing in the elections that year. With a real threat to Caesar&#x27;s command and brewing in 56 BC under the aegis of the unfriendly consuls, Caesar needed his allies&#x27; political support. Pompey and Crassus too wanted military commands. Their combined interests led to a renewal of the alliance; drawing in the support of Appius Claudius Pulcher and his younger brother Clodius for the consulship of 54 BC, they planned second consulships with following governorships in 55 BC for both Pompey and Crassus. Caesar, for his part, would receive a five-year extension of command.

Cicero was induced to oppose reassignment of Caesar&#x27;s provinces and to defend a number of the allies&#x27; clients; his gloomy predictions of a triumviral set of consuls-designate for years on end proved an exaggeration when, only by desperate tactics, bribery, intimidation and violence were Pompey and Crassus elected consuls for 55 BC. During their consulship, Pompey and Crassus passed – with some tribunician support – the extending Caesar&#x27;s command and the &quot;lex Trebonia&quot; giving them respective commands in Spain and Syria, though Pompey never left for the province and remained politically active at Rome. The opposition again unified against their heavy-handed political tactics – though not against Caesar&#x27;s activities in Gaul – and defeated the allies in the elections of that year.

The ambush and destruction in Gaul of a legion and five cohorts in the winter of 55–54 BC produced substantial concern in Rome about Caesar&#x27;s command and competence, evidenced by the highly defensive narrative in Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;. The death of Caesar&#x27;s daughter and Pompey&#x27;s wife Julia in childbirth did not create a rift between Caesar and Pompey. At the start of 53 BC, Caesar sought and received reinforcements by recruitment and a private deal with Pompey before two years of largely unsuccessful campaigning against Gallic insurgents. In the same year, Crassus&#x27;s campaign ended in disaster at the Battle of Carrhae, culminating in his death at the hands of the Parthians. When in 52 BC Pompey started the year with a sole consulship to restore order to the city, Caesar was in Gaul suppressing insurgencies; after news of his victory at Alesia, with the support of Pompey he received twenty days of thanksgiving and, pursuant to the &quot;Law of the Ten Tribunes&quot;, the right to stand for the consulship in absentia.

== Civil war ==

From the period 52 to 49 BC, trust between Caesar and Pompey disintegrated. In 51 BC, the consul Marcellus proposed recalling Caesar, arguing that his &quot;provincia&quot; (here meaning &quot;task&quot;) in Gaul – due to his victory against Vercingetorix in 52 – was complete; it evidently was incomplete as Caesar was that year fighting the Bellovaci and regardless the proposal was vetoed. That year, it seemed that the conservatives around Cato in the Senate would seek to enlist Pompey to force Caesar to return from Gaul without honours or a second consulship. Cato, Bibulus, and their allies, however, were successful in winning Pompey over to take a hard line against Caesar&#x27;s continued command.

As 50 BC progressed, fears of civil war grew; both Caesar and his opponents started building up troops in southern Gaul and northern Italy, respectively. In the autumn, Cicero and others sought disarmament by both Caesar and Pompey, and on 1 December 50 BC this was formally proposed in the Senate. It received overwhelming support – 370 to 22 – but was not passed when one of the consuls dissolved the meeting. That year, when a rumour came to Rome that Caesar was marching into Italy, both consuls instructed Pompey to defend Italy, a charge he accepted as a last resort. At the start of 49 BC, Caesar&#x27;s renewed offer that he and Pompey disarm was read to the Senate and was rejected by the hardliners. A later compromise given privately to Pompey was also rejected at their insistence. On 7 January, his supportive tribunes were driven from Rome; the Senate then declared Caesar an enemy and it issued its &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;.

There is scholarly disagreement as to the specific reasons why Caesar marched on Rome. A very popular theory is that Caesar was forced to choose – when denied the immunity of his proconsular tenure – between prosecution, conviction, and exile or civil war in defence of his position. Whether Caesar actually would have been prosecuted and convicted is debated. Some scholars believe the possibility of successful prosecution was extremely unlikely. Caesar&#x27;s main objectives were to secure a second consulship – first mooted in 52 as colleague to Pompey&#x27;s sole consulship – and a triumph. He feared that his opponents – then holding both consulships for 50 BC – would reject his candidacy or refuse to ratify an election he won. This also was the core of his war justification: that Pompey and his allies were planning, by force if necessary (indicated in the expulsion of the tribunes), to suppress the liberty of the Roman people to elect Caesar and honour his accomplishments.

=== Italy, Spain, and Greece ===
Around 10 or 11 January 49 BC, in response to the Senate&#x27;s &quot;final decree&quot;, Caesar crossed the Rubicon – the river defining the northern boundary of Italy – with a single legion, the Legio XIII Gemina, and ignited civil war. Upon crossing the Rubicon, Caesar, according to Plutarch and Suetonius, is supposed to have quoted the Athenian playwright Menander, in Greek, &quot;let the die be cast&quot;. Pompey and many senators fled south, believing that Caesar was marching quickly for Rome. Caesar, after capturing communication routes to Rome, paused and opened negotiations, but they fell apart amid mutual distrust. Caesar responded by advancing south, seeking to capture Pompey to force a conference.

Pompey withdrew to Brundisium and was able to escape to Greece, abandoning Italy in face of Caesar&#x27;s superior forces and evading Caesar&#x27;s pursuit. Caesar stayed near Rome for about two weeks – during his stay his forceful seizure of the treasury over tribunician veto put the lie to his pro-tribunician war justifications – and left Lepidus in charge of Italy while he attacked Pompey&#x27;s Spanish provinces. He defeated two of Pompey&#x27;s legates at the Battle of Ilerda before forcing surrender of the third; his legates moved into Sicily and into Africa, though the African expedition failed. Returning to Rome in the autumn, Caesar had Lepidus, as praetor, bring a law appointing Caesar dictator to conduct the elections; he, along with Publius Servilius Isauricus, won the following elections and would serve as consuls for 48 BC. Resigning the dictatorship after eleven days, Caesar then left Italy for Greece to stop Pompey&#x27;s preparations, arriving in force in early 48 BC.

Caesar besieged Pompey at Dyrrhachium, but Pompey was able to break out and force Caesar&#x27;s forces to flee. Following Pompey southeast into Greece and to save one of his legates, he engaged and decisively defeated Pompey at Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC. Pompey then fled for Egypt; Cato fled for Africa; others, like Cicero and Marcus Junius Brutus, begged for Caesar&#x27;s pardon.

=== Alexandrine war and Asia Minor ===


Pompey was killed when he arrived in Alexandria, the capital of Egypt. Caesar arrived three days later on 2 October 48 BC. Prevented from leaving the city by Etesian winds, Caesar decided to arbitrate an Egyptian civil war between the child pharaoh Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator and Cleopatra, his sister, wife, and co-regent queen. In late October 48 BC, Caesar was appointed in absentia to a year-long dictatorship, after news of his victory at Pharsalus arrived to Rome. While in Alexandria, he started an affair with Cleopatra and withstood a siege by Ptolemy and his other sister Arsinoe until March 47 BC. Reinforced by eastern client allies under Mithridates of Pergamum, he then defeated Ptolemy at the Battle of the Nile and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated the victory with a triumphal procession on the Nile. He stayed in Egypt with Cleopatra until June or July that year, though the relevant commentaries attributed to him give no such impression. Some time in late June, Cleopatra gave birth to a child by Caesar, called Caesarion.

When Caesar landed at Antioch, he learnt that during his time in Egypt, the king of what is now Crimea, Pharnaces, had attempted to seize what had been his father&#x27;s kingdom, Pontus, across the Black Sea in northern Anatolia. His invasion had swept aside Caesar&#x27;s legates and the local client kings, but Caesar engaged him at Zela and defeated him immediately, leading Caesar to write (&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;), downplaying Pompey&#x27;s previous Pontic victories. He then left quickly for Italy.

=== Italy, Africa, and Spain ===
Caesar&#x27;s absence from Italy put Mark Antony, as , in charge. His rule was unpopular: Publius Cornelius Dolabella, serving as plebeian tribune in 47 BC, agitated for debt relief and after that agitation got out of hand the Senate moved for Antony to restore order. Delayed by a mutiny in southern Italy, he returned and suppressed the riots by force, killing many and delivering a similar blow to his popularity. Cato had marched to Africa and there Metellus Scipio was in charge of the remaining republicans; they allied with Juba of Numidia; what used to be Pompey&#x27;s fleet also raided the central Mediterranean islands. Caesar&#x27;s governor in Spain, moreover, was sufficiently unpopular that the province revolted and switched to the republican side.

Caesar demoted Antony on his return and pacified the mutineers without violence before overseeing the election of magistrates for 47 BC – Italy had been ruled by Caesar&#x27;s authoritarian subordinates with no ordinary consuls, praetors, etc until his return in September – and also those for 46 BC. Caesar would serve with Lepidus as consul in 46; he borrowed money for the war, confiscated and sold the property of his enemies at fair prices, and then left for Africa on 25 December 47 BC. Caesar&#x27;s landing in Africa was marked with some difficulties establishing a beachhead and logistically. He was defeated by Titus Labienus at Ruspina on 4 January 46 BC and thereafter took a rather cautious approach. After inducing some desertions from the republicans, Caesar ended up surrounded at Thapsus. His troops attacked prematurely on 6 April 46 BC, starting a battle; they then won it and massacred the republican forces without quarter. Marching on Utica, where Cato commanded, Caesar arrived to find that Cato had killed himself rather than receive Caesar&#x27;s clemency. Many of the remaining anti-Caesarian leaders, including Metellus Scipio and Juba, also committed suicide shortly thereafter. Labienus and two of Pompey&#x27;s sons, however, had moved to the Spanish provinces in revolt. Caesar started a process of annexing parts of Numidia and then returned to Italy via Sardinia in June 46 BC.

Caesar stayed in Italy to celebrate four triumphs in late September, supposedly over four foreign enemies: Gaul, Egypt, Pharnaces (Asia), and Juba (Africa). He led Vercingetorix, Cleopatra&#x27;s younger sister Arsinoe, and Juba&#x27;s son before his chariot; Vercingetorix was executed. According to Appian, in some of the triumphs, Caesar paraded pictures and models of his victories over fellow Romans in the civil wars, to popular dismay. The soldiers were each given 24,000 sesterces (a lifetime&#x27;s worth of pay); further games and celebrations were put on for the plebs. Near the end of the year, Caesar heard bad news from Spain and, with an army, left for the peninsula, leaving Lepidus in charge as .

At a bloody battle at Munda on 17 March 45 BC, Caesar narrowly found victory; his enemies were treated as rebels and he had them massacred. Labienus died on the field. While one of Pompey&#x27;s sons, Sextus, escaped, the war was effectively over. Caesar remained in the province until June before setting out for Rome, arriving in October of the same year, and celebrated an unseemly triumph over fellow Romans. By this point he had started preparations for war on the Parthians to avenge Crassus&#x27; death at Carrhae in 53 BC, with wide-ranging objectives that would take him into Dacia for three or more years. It was set to start on 18 March 44 BC.

== Dictatorship and assassination ==

=== Dictatorships and honours ===
Prior to Caesar&#x27;s assumption of the title in February 44 BC, he had been appointed dictator some four times since his first dictatorship in 49 BC. After occupying Rome, he engineered this first appointment, largely to hold elections; after 11 days he resigned. The other dictatorships lasted for longer periods, up to a year, and by April 46 BC he was given a new dictatorship annually. The task he was assigned revived that of Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship: . These appointments, however, were not the source of legal power themselves; in the eyes of the literary sources, they were instead honours and titles which reflected Caesar&#x27;s dominant position in the state, secured not by extraordinary magistracy or legal powers, but by personal status as victor over other Romans. 

Through the period after Pharsalus, the Senate showered Caesar with honours, including the title () which historically was associated with the censorial power to revise the Senate rolls. He was also granted power over war and peace, usurping a power traditionally held by the comitia centuriata. These powers attached to Caesar personally. Similarly extraordinary were a number of symbolic honours which saw Caesar&#x27;s portrait placed on coins in Rome – the first for a living Roman – with special rights to wear royal dress, sit atop a golden chair in the Senate, and have his statues erected in public temples. The month Quintilis, in which he was born, was renamed (now July). These were symbols of divine monarchy and, later, objects of resentment.

The decisions on the normal operation of the state – justice, legislation, administration, and public works – were concentrated into Caesar&#x27;s person without regard for or even notice given to the traditional institutions of the republic. Caesar&#x27;s domination over public affairs and his competitive instinct to preclude all others alienated the political class and led eventually to the conspiracy against his life.

=== Legislation ===
Caesar, as far as is attested in evidence, did not intend to restructure Roman society. Ernst Badian, writing in the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot;, noted that although Caesar did implement a series of reforms, they did not touch on the core of the republican system: he &quot;had no plans for basic social and constitutional reform&quot; and that &quot;the extraordinary honours heaped upon him... merely grafted him as an ill-fitting head on to the body of the traditional structure&quot;.

The most important of Caesar&#x27;s reforms was to the calendar, which saw the abolition of the traditional republican lunisolar calendar and its replacement with a solar calendar now called the Julian calendar. He also increased the number of magistrates and senators (from 600 to 900) to better administer the empire and reward his supporters with offices. Colonies also were founded outside Italy – notably on the sites of Carthage and Corinth, which had both been destroyed during Rome&#x27;s 2nd century BC conquests – to discharge Italy&#x27;s population into the provinces and reduce unrest. The royal power of naming patricians was revived to benefit the families of his men and the permanent courts&#x27; jury pools were also altered to remove the , leaving only the equestrians and senators.

He also took further administrative actions to stabilise his rule and that of the state. Caesar reduced the size of the grain dole from 320,000 down to around 150,000 by tightening the qualifications; special bonuses were offered to families with many children to stall depopulation. Plans were drawn for the conduct of a census. Citizenship was extended to a number of communities in Cisalpine Gaul and to Cádiz. During the civil wars, Caesar had also instituted a novel debt repayment programme (no debts would be forgiven but they could be paid in kind), remitted rents up to a certain amount, and thrown games distributing food. Many of his enemies during the civil wars were pardoned – Caesar&#x27;s clemency was exalted in his propaganda and temple works – with the intent to cultivate gratitude and draw a contrast between himself and the vengeful dictatorship of Sulla.

The building programmes, started prior to his expedition to Spain, continued, with the construction of the Forum of Caesar and the Temple of Venus Genetrix therein. Other public works, including an expansion of Ostia&#x27;s port and a canal through the Corinthian Isthmus, were also planned. Very busy with this work, the heavy-handedness with which he ignored the Senate, magistrates, and those who came to visit him also alienated many in Rome.

The , civic associations restored by Clodius in 58 BC, were again abolished. His actions to reward his supporters saw him allow his subordinates illegal triumphal processions and resign the consulship so that allies could take it up for the rest of the year. On the last day of 45 BC, when one of the succeeding consuls died, Caesar had an ally elected as replacement for a single day. Corruption on the part of his partisans was also overlooked to ensure their support; provincial cities and client kingdoms were extorted for favours to pay his bills.

=== Conspiracy and death ===

Attempts in January 44 BC to call Caesar () – a title associated with arbitrary oppression against citizens – were shut down by two tribunes before a supportive crowd. Caesar, claiming that the two tribunes infringed on his honour by doing so, had them deposed from office and ejected from the Senate. The incident both undermined Caesar&#x27;s original arguments for pursuing the civil war (protecting the tribunes) and angered a public which still revered the tribunes as protectors of popular freedom. Shortly before 15 February 44 BC, he assumed the dictatorship for life, putting an end to any hopes that his powers would be merely temporary. Transforming his dictatorship, even with a decadal appointment, into one for life clearly showed to all contemporaries that Caesar had no intention to restore a free republic and that no free republic could be restored so long as he was in power.

Just days after his assumption of the life dictatorship, he publicly rejected a diadem from Antony at celebrations for the Lupercalia. Interpretations of the episode vary: he may have been rejecting the diadem publicly only because the crowd was insufficiently supportive; he could have done it performatively to signal he was no monarch; alternatively, Antony could have acted on his own initiative. By this point, however, rumour was rife that Caesar – already wearing the dress of a monarch – sought a formal crown and the episode did little to reassure.

The plan to assassinate Caesar had started by the summer of 45 BC. An attempt to recruit Antony was made around that time, though he declined and gave Caesar no warning. By February 44 BC, there were some sixty conspirators. It is clear that by this time, the victorious Caesarian coalition from the civil war had broken apart. While most of the conspirators were former Pompeians, they were joined by a substantial number of Caesarians. Among their leaders were Gaius Trebonius (consul in 45), Decimus Brutus (consul designate for 42), as well as Cassius and Brutus (both praetors in 44 BC). Trebonius and Decimus had joined Caesar during the war while Brutus and Cassius had joined Pompey; other Caesarians involved included Servius Sulpicius Galba, Lucius Minucius Basilus, Lucius Tullius Cimber, and Gaius Servilius Casca. Many of the conspirators would have been candidates in the consular elections for 43 to 41 BC, likely dismayed by Caesar&#x27;s sham elections in early 44 BC that produced advance results for the years 43–41 BC. Those electoral results came from the grace of the dictator and not that of the people; for the republican elite this was no substitute for actual popular support. Nor is it likely that the subordination of the normal magistrates to Caesar&#x27;s masters of horse () was appreciated.

Brutus, who claimed descent from the Lucius Junius Brutus who had driven out the kings and the Gaius Servilius Ahala who had freed Rome from incipient tyranny, was the main leader of the conspiracy. By late autumn 45 BC, graffiti and some public comments at Rome were condemning Caesar as a tyrant and insinuating the need for a Brutus to remove the dictator. The ancient sources, excepting Nicolaus of Damascus, are unanimous that this reflected a genuine turn in public opinion against Caesar. Popular indignation at Caesar was likely rooted in his debt policies (too friendly to lenders), use of lethal force to suppress protests for debt relief, his reduction in the grain dole, his abolition of the restored by Clodius, his abolition of the poorest panel of jurors in the permanent courts, and his abolition of open elections which deprived the people of their ancient right of decision. A popular turn against Caesar is also observed with reports that the two deposed tribunes were written-in on ballots at Caesar&#x27;s advance consular elections in place of Caesar&#x27;s candidates. Whether the Romans thought they had a tradition of tyrannicide is unclear; Cicero wrote in private as if the duty to kill tyrants was already given, but he made no public speeches to that effect and there is little evidence that the public accepted the logic of preventive tyrannicide. The philosophical tradition of the Platonic Old Academy was also a factor driving Brutus to action due to its emphasis on a duty to free the state from tyranny. 

While some news of the conspiracy did leak, Caesar refused to take precautions and rejected escort by a bodyguard. The date decided upon by the conspirators was 15 March, the Ides of March, three days before Caesar intended to leave for his Parthian campaign. News of his imminent departure forced the conspirators to move up their plans; the Senate meeting on the 15th would be the last before his departure. They had decided that a Senate meeting was the best place to frame the killing as political, rejecting the alternatives at games, elections, or on the road. That only the conspirators would be armed at the Senate meeting, per Dio, also would have been an advantage. The day, 15 March, was also symbolically important as it was the day on which consuls took office until the mid-2nd century BC.
Various stories purport that Caesar was on the cusp of not attending or otherwise being warned about the plot. Approached on his golden chair at the foot of the statue of Pompey, the conspirators attacked him with daggers. Whether he fell in silence, per Suetonius, or after reply to Brutus&#x27; appearance – (&quot;you too, child?&quot;) – is variantly recorded. He was stabbed at least twenty-three times and died at once.

=== Aftermath of the assassination ===


The assassins seized the Capitoline hill after killing the dictator. They then summoned a public meeting in the Forum where they were coldly received by the population. They were also unable to fully secure the city, as Lepidus – Caesar&#x27;s lieutenant in the dictatorship – moved troops from the Tiber Island into the city proper. Antony, the consul who escaped the assassination, urged an illogical compromise position in the Senate: Caesar was not declared a tyrant and the conspirators were not punished. Caesar&#x27;s funeral was then approved. At the funeral, Antony inflamed the public against the assassins, which triggered mob violence that lasted for some months before the assassins were forced to flee the capital and Antony then finally acted to suppress it by force. 

In 44 BC, there was a seven-day cometary outburst that the Romans believed to represent the deification of Caeser, giving it the name Caesar&#x27;s Comet. On the site of his cremation, the Temple of Caesar was begun by the triumvirs in 42 BC at the east side of the main square of the Roman Forum. Only its altar now remains. The terms of the will were also read to the public: it gave a generous donative to the plebs at large and left as principal heir one Gaius Octavius, Caesar&#x27;s great-nephew then at Apollonia, and adopted him in the will.

Resumption of the pre-existing republic proved impossible as various actors appealed in the aftermath of Caesar&#x27;s death to liberty or to vengeance to mobilise huge armies that led to a series of civil wars. The first war was between Antony in 43 BC and the Senate (including senators of both Caesarian and Pompeian persuasion) which resulted in Octavian – Caesar&#x27;s heir – exploiting the chaos to seize the consulship and join with Antony and Lepidus to form the Second Triumvirate. After purging their political enemies in a series of proscriptions, the triumvirs secured the deification of Caesar – the Senate declared on 1 January 42 BC that Caesar would be placed among the Roman gods – and marched on the east where a second war saw the triumvirs defeat the tyrannicides in battle, resulting in a final death of the republican cause and a three-way division of much of the Roman world. By 31 BC, Caesar&#x27;s heir had taken sole control of the empire, ejecting his triumviral rivals after two decades of civil war. Pretending to restore the republic, his masked autocracy was acceptable to the war-weary Romans and marked the establishment of a new Roman monarchy.
==Personal life==
===Health and physical appearance===
Based on remarks by Plutarch ( – ), Caesar is sometimes thought to have suffered from epilepsy. Modern scholarship is sharply divided on the subject, and some scholars believe that he was plagued by malaria, particularly during the Sullan proscriptions of the 80s BC. Other scholars contend his epileptic seizures were due to a parasitic infection in the brain by a tapeworm.

Caesar had four documented episodes of what may have been complex partial seizures. He may additionally have had absence seizures in his youth. The earliest accounts of these seizures were made by the biographer Suetonius, who was born after Caesar died. The claim of epilepsy is countered among some medical historians by a claim of hypoglycemia, which can cause epileptoid seizures.

A line from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; has sometimes been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: &quot;Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf.&quot; No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.

Francesco M. Galassi and Hutan Ashrafian suggest that Caesar&#x27;s behavioural manifestationsheadaches, vertigo, falls (possibly caused by muscle weakness due to nerve damage), sensory deficit, giddiness and insensibilityand syncopal episodes were the results of cerebrovascular episodes, not epilepsy. Pliny the Elder reports in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that Caesar&#x27;s father and forefather died without apparent cause while putting on their shoes. These events can be more readily associated with cardiovascular complications from a stroke episode or lethal heart attack. Caesar possibly had a genetic predisposition for cardiovascular disease.

Suetonius ( – ) describes Caesar as &quot;tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes&quot;. He adds that the balding Caesar was sensitive to teasing on the subject, and therefore had a combover. Suetonius reports that Caesar was thus especially pleased to be granted the honour of wearing a wreath at all times.

===Name and family===

====The name Gaius Julius Caesar====

Using the Latin alphabet of the period, which lacked the letters &quot;J&quot; and &quot;U&quot;, Caesar&#x27;s name would be rendered GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR; the form CAIVS is also attested, using the older Roman representation of &quot;G&quot; by &quot;C&quot;. The standard abbreviation was C. IVLIVS CÆSAR, reflecting the older spelling. (The letterform &quot;Æ&quot; is a ligature of the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, and is often used in Latin inscriptions to save space.)

In Classical Latin, it was pronounced . In the days of the late Roman Republic, many historical writings were done in Greek, a language most educated Romans studied. Young wealthy Roman boys were often taught by Greek slaves and sometimes sent to Athens for advanced training, as was Caesar&#x27;s principal assassin, Brutus. In Greek, during Caesar&#x27;s time, his family name was written (&quot;Kaísar&quot;), reflecting its contemporary pronunciation. Thus, his name is pronounced in a similar way to the pronunciation of the German &quot;Kaiser&quot; or Dutch &quot;keizer&quot; .

In Vulgar Latin, the original diphthong first began to be pronounced as a simple long vowel . Then, the plosive before front vowels began, due to palatalization, to be pronounced as an affricate, hence renderings like in Italian and in German regional pronunciations of Latin, as well as the title of Tsar. With the evolution of the Romance languages, the affricate became a fricative (thus, and the like) in many regional pronunciations, including the French one, from which the modern English pronunciation is derived.

Caesar&#x27;s cognomen itself became a title; it was promulgated by the Bible, which contains the famous verse &quot;Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&#x27;s, and unto God the things that are God&#x27;s&quot;. The title became, from the late first millennium, &quot;Kaiser&quot; in German and (through Old Church Slavic &quot;cěsarĭ&quot;) Tsar or Czar in the Slavic languages. The last Tsar in nominal power was Simeon II of Bulgaria, whose reign ended in 1946, but is still alive in 2023. This means that for approximately two thousand years, there was at least one head of state bearing his name. As a term for the highest ruler, the word Caesar constitutes one of the earliest, best attested and most widespread Latin loanwords in the Germanic languages, being found in the text corpora of Old High German (&quot;keisar&quot;), Old Saxon (&quot;kēsur&quot;), Old English (&quot;cāsere&quot;), Old Norse (&quot;keisari&quot;), Old Dutch (&quot;keisere&quot;) and (through Greek) Gothic (&quot;kaisar&quot;).

===Rumors of passive homosexuality===
Roman society viewed the passive role during sexual activity, regardless of gender, to be a sign of submission or inferiority. Indeed, Suetonius says that in Caesar&#x27;s Gallic triumph, his soldiers sang that, &quot;Caesar may have conquered the Gauls, but Nicomedes conquered Caesar.&quot; According to Cicero, Bibulus, Gaius Memmius, and others – mainly Caesar&#x27;s enemies – he had an affair with Nicomedes IV of Bithynia early in his career. The stories were repeated, referring to Caesar as the &quot;Queen of Bithynia&quot;, by some Roman politicians as a way to humiliate him. Caesar himself denied the accusations repeatedly throughout his lifetime, and according to Cassius Dio, even under oath on one occasion. This form of slander was popular during this time in the Roman Republic to demean and discredit political opponents.

Catullus wrote a poem suggesting that Caesar and his engineer Mamurra were lovers, but later apologised.

Mark Antony charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours. Suetonius described Antony&#x27;s accusation of an affair with Octavian as political slander. Octavian eventually became the first Roman Emperor as Augustus.

==Literary works==
During his lifetime, Caesar was regarded as one of the best orators and prose authors in Latineven Cicero spoke highly of Caesar&#x27;s rhetoric and style. Only Caesar&#x27;s war commentaries have survived. A few sentences from other works are quoted by other authors. Among his lost works are his funeral oration for his paternal aunt Julia and his &quot;Anticato&quot;, a document attacking Cato in response to Cicero&#x27;s eulogy. Poems by Julius Caesar are also mentioned in ancient sources.

===Memoirs===
* The &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, usually known in English as &quot;The Gallic Wars&quot;, seven books each covering one year of his campaigns in Gaul and southern Britain in the 50s BC, with the eighth book written by Aulus Hirtius on the last two years.
* The &quot;Commentarii de Bello Civili&quot; (&quot;The Civil War&quot;), events of the Civil War from Caesar&#x27;s perspective, until immediately after Pompey&#x27;s death in Egypt.

Other works historically have been attributed to Caesar, but their authorship is in doubt:
* &quot;De Bello Alexandrino&quot; (&quot;On the Alexandrine War&quot;), campaign in Alexandria;
* &quot;De Bello Africo&quot; (&quot;On the African War&quot;), campaigns in North Africa; and
* &quot;De Bello Hispaniensi&quot; (&quot;On the Hispanic War&quot;), campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula.

These narratives were written and published annually during or just after the actual campaigns, as a sort of &quot;dispatches from the front&quot;. They were important in shaping Caesar&#x27;s public image and enhancing his reputation when he was away from Rome for long periods. They may have been presented as public readings. As a model of clear and direct Latin style, &quot;The Gallic Wars&quot; traditionally has been studied by first- or second-year Latin students.

==Legacy==

===Historiography===

The texts written by Caesar, an autobiography of the most important events of his public life, are the most complete primary source for the reconstruction of his biography. However, Caesar wrote those texts with his political career in mind. Julius Caesar is also considered one of the first historical figures to fold his message scrolls into a concertina form, which made them easier to read. The Roman emperor Augustus began a cult of personality of Caesar, which described Augustus as Caesar&#x27;s political heir. The modern historiography is influenced by this tradition.

Many rulers in history became interested in the historiography of Caesar. Napoleon III wrote the scholarly work &quot;Histoire de Jules César&quot;, which was not finished. The second volume listed previous rulers interested in the topic. Charles VIII ordered a monk to prepare a translation of the &quot;Gallic Wars&quot; in 1480. Charles V ordered a topographic study in France, to place the Gallic Wars in context; which created forty high-quality maps of the conflict. The contemporary Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent catalogued the surviving editions of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, and translated them to Turkish language. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France translated the first two commentaries and the last two respectively; Louis XIV re-translated the first one afterwards.

The remains of Caesar&#x27;s altar are a pilgrimage site for visitors from across Italy and the world. Flowers and other items are left there daily and special commemorations take place on 15 March to commemorate Caesar&#x27;s death.

===Politics===

Julius Caesar is seen as the main example of &quot;Caesarism&quot;, a form of political rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale is the need to rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government. Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists. Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar&#x27;s military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to populism. The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.

<text>Jacobitism was a political ideology advocating the restoration of the senior line of the House of Stuart to the British throne. When James II of England chose exile after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, the Parliament of England ruled he had &quot;abandoned&quot; the English throne, which was given to his Protestant daughter Mary II of England, and his nephew, her husband William III. On the same basis, in April the Scottish Convention awarded Mary and William the throne of Scotland.

The Revolution created the principle of a contract between monarch and people, which if violated meant the monarch could be removed. A key tenet of Jacobitism was that kings were appointed by God, making the post-1688 regime illegitimate. However, it also functioned as an outlet for popular discontent, and thus was a complex mix of ideas, many opposed by the Stuarts themselves. Conflict between Prince Charles and Scottish Jacobites over the Acts of Union 1707 and divine right seriously undermined the 1745 rising.

Jacobitism was strongest in Ireland, the Western Scottish Highlands, Perthshire, and Aberdeenshire. Pockets of support were also present in Wales, Northern England, the West Midlands and South West England, all areas strongly Royalist during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In addition, the Stuarts received intermittent backing from countries like France, usually dependent on their own strategic objectives.

In addition to the 1689–1691 Williamite War in Ireland and Jacobite rising of 1689 in Scotland, there were serious revolts in 1715, 1719 and 1745, French invasion attempts in 1708 and 1744, and numerous unsuccessful plots. While the 1745 Rising briefly seemed to threaten the Hanoverian monarchy, its defeat in 1746 ended Jacobitism as a serious political movement.

== Political background ==
Jacobite ideology originated with James VI and I, who in 1603 became the first monarch to rule all three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland. Its basis was divine right, which claimed his authority came from God, and the crown&#x27;s descent by indefeasible hereditary right: James and his supporters emphasised his right to the throne by blood to forestall controversy over his appointment by Elizabeth I as her successor. Personal rule by the monarch eliminated the need for Parliaments, and required political and religious union, concepts widely unpopular in all three kingdoms.

Divine right also clashed with Catholic allegiance to the Pope and with Protestant nonconformists, since both argued there was an authority above the king. The 17th-century belief that &#x27;true religion&#x27; and &#x27;good government&#x27; were one and the same meant disputes in one area fed into the other; Millenarianism and belief in the imminence of the Second Coming meant many Protestants viewed such issues as urgent and real.

As the first step towards union, James began standardising religious practices between the churches of England, Scotland and Ireland. After his death in 1625, this was continued by his son Charles I, who lacked his political sensitivity; by the late 1630s, instituting Personal Rule in 1629, enforcing Laudian reforms on the Church of England, and ruling without Parliament led to a political crisis. Similar measures in Scotland caused the 1639–1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, and installation of a Covenanter government.

Organised by a small group of Catholic nobility, the October 1641 Irish Rebellion was the cumulative effect of land confiscation, loss of political control, anti-Catholic measures and economic decline. The Rebellion was intended as a bloodless coup, but its leaders quickly lost control, leading to atrocities on both sides. In May, a Covenanter army landed in Ulster to support Scots settlers. Although Charles and Parliament both supported raising an army to suppress the Rebellion, neither trusted the other with its control; these tensions ultimately led to the outbreak of the First English Civil War in August 1642.

In 1642, the Catholic Confederacy representing the Irish insurgents proclaimed allegiance to Charles, but the Stuarts were an unreliable ally, since concessions in Ireland cost them Protestant support in all three kingdoms. In addition, the Adventurers&#x27; Act, approved by Charles in March 1642, funded suppression of the revolt by confiscating land from Irish Catholics, much of it owned by members of the Confederacy. The result was a three-way contest between the Confederacy, Royalist forces under the Protestant Duke of Ormond, and a Covenanter-led army in Ulster. The latter were increasingly at odds with the English government; after Charles&#x27; execution in January 1649, Ormond combined these factions to resist the 1649-to-1652 Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

Charles II repudiated his alliance with the Confederacy, in return for Scottish support in the Third English Civil War, and Ormond went into exile in 1650. Defeat in 1652 led to the mass confiscation of Catholic and Royalist land, and its re-distribution among English Parliamentary soldiers and Protestant settlers. The three kingdoms were combined into the Commonwealth of England, regaining their separate status when the monarchy was restored in 1660.

Charles&#x27;s reign was dominated by the expansionist policies of Louis XIV of France, seen as a threat to Protestant Europe. When his brother and heir James announced his conversion to Catholicism in 1677, an attempt was made to bar him from the English throne. Nevertheless, he became king in February 1685 with widespread support from the Protestant majorities in England and Scotland. Accepting a Catholic monarch was seen as preferable to excluding the &#x27;natural heir&#x27;, and rebellions by Protestant dissidents were quickly suppressed. It was also viewed as temporary, since James was 52, his second marriage was childless after 11 years, and his Protestant daughter Mary was heir.

His religion made James popular among Irish Catholics, whose position had not improved under his brother. Catholic land ownership had fallen from 90% in 1600 to 22% in 1685, not least through Catholic landlords converting to the Anglican Church. After 1673, a series of proclamations deprived Catholic gentry of the right to bear arms or hold public office. The Catholic Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1687, and began building a Catholic establishment that could survive James. Fearing a short reign, Tyrconnell moved at a speed that destabilised all three kingdoms.

When the English and Scottish Parliaments refused to remove civil restrictions on Catholics and Non-Conformists, James dismissed them and used the Royal Prerogative to force his measures through. These actions re-opened disputes over religion, rewarded the Protestant dissidents who rebelled in 1685, and undermined his own supporters. It also ignored the impact of the 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau, which revoked tolerance for French Protestants and created an estimated 400,000 refugees, 40,000 of whom settled in London. Two events turned discontent into rebellion, the first being the birth of James&#x27;s son on 10 June 1688, which created the prospect of a Catholic dynasty. The second was James&#x27;s prosecution of the Seven Bishops, which seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism into actively attacking the Church of England. Their acquittal on 30 June caused widespread rejoicing, and destroyed James&#x27;s political authority.

In 1685, many had feared civil war if James were bypassed. By 1688, even his chief minister, the Earl of Sunderland, felt only his removal could prevent it. Sunderland secretly coordinated an Invitation to William, assuring Mary and her husband and James&#x27;s nephew, William of Orange of English support for armed intervention. William landed in Brixham on 5 November with 14,000 men; as he advanced, James&#x27;s army deserted and he went into exile on 23 December. In February 1689, the English Parliament appointed William and Mary joint monarchs of England, while the Scots followed suit in March.

Most of Ireland was still controlled by Tyrconnell, where James landed on 12 March 1689 with 6,000 French troops, but the 1689-to-1691 Williamite War in Ireland highlighted two recurring trends. For James and his Stuart successors, the main prize was to regain England, while the primary French objective was to tie down British resources, rebellions in Scotland and Ireland being seen as the cheapest option. Elections in May 1689 produced the first Irish Parliament with a Catholic majority since 1613. It repealed the Cromwellian land seizures, confiscated land from Williamites, and proclaimed Ireland a &#x27;distinct kingdom from England&#x27;, measures subsequently annulled after defeat in 1691.

A Jacobite rising in Scotland achieved some initial success but was ultimately suppressed. Several days after the Irish Jacobites were defeated at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, victory at Beachy Head gave the French temporary control of the English Channel. James returned to France to urge an immediate invasion of England, but the Anglo-Dutch fleet soon regained maritime supremacy and the opportunity was lost.

The Irish Jacobites and their French allies were finally defeated at the battle of Aughrim in 1691, and the Treaty of Limerick ended the war in Ireland; future risings on behalf of the exiled Stuarts were confined to England and Scotland. The Act of Settlement 1701 barred Catholics from the English throne, and when Anne became the last Stuart monarch in 1702, her heir was her Protestant cousin Sophia of Hanover, not her Catholic half-brother James. Ireland retained a separate Parliament until 1800, but the 1707 Union combined England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Anne viewed this as the unified Protestant kingdom which her predecessors had failed to achieve.

The exiled Stuarts continued to agitate for a return to power, based on the support they retained within the three kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland. Doing so required external help, most consistently supplied by France, while Spain backed the 1719 Rising. While talks were also held at different times with Sweden, Prussia, and Russia, these never produced concrete results. Although the Stuarts were useful as a lever, their foreign backers generally had little interest in their restoration.

==Ideology==
Historian Frank McLynn identifies seven primary drivers in Jacobitism, noting that while the movement contained &quot;sincere men [..] who aimed solely to restore the Stuarts&quot;, it &quot;provided a source of legitimacy for political dissent of all kinds&quot;. Establishing the ideology of active participants is complicated by the fact that &quot;by and large, those who wrote most did not act, and those who acted wrote little, if anything.&quot; As a result, historians have taken different views on its primary driving force. These include being an aristocratic rejection of an increasingly Unitary state, feudal opposition to capitalism, or Scots and Irish nationalism.

Jacobitism drew on elements of a political theology shared by Non-juring, Tory elements within the Church of England, and members of the Scottish Episcopal Church. These were the divine right of kings, their accountability to God, not man or Parliament; secondly, that monarchy was a divine institution; thirdly, legitimism, the crown&#x27;s descent by indefeasible dynastic right, which could not be overturned or annulled; and lastly the scriptural injunction of passive obedience and non-resistance, even towards monarchs of which the individual subject might disapprove.

Jacobite propagandists argued such divinely sanctioned authority was the main moral safeguard of society, while its absence led to party strife. They claimed the 1688 Revolution had enabled political corruption and allowed selfish opportunists, such as Whigs, religious dissenters, and foreigners, to take control of the government and oppress the common people. 

However, views on the &#x27;correct&#x27; balance of rights and duties between monarch and subject varied, and Jacobites attempted to distinguish between &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; and &#x27;absolute&#x27; power. Non-juring Church of Ireland clergyman Charles Leslie was perhaps the most extreme divine right theorist, but even he argued the monarch was bound by &quot;his oath to God, as well as his promise to his people&quot; and &quot;the laws of justice and honour&quot;. Jacobite pamphlets often suggested domestic issues were divine punishment on the British for rejecting their rightful king, although post 1710 this was blamed specifically on the Whigs.

These views were not held by all Jacobites, while many Whigs argued the post 1688 succession was also &quot;divinely ordained&quot;. After the 1701 Act of Settlement, Jacobite propagandists deemphasised the purely legitimist elements in their writing and by 1745, active promotion of hereditary and indefeasible right was restricted largely to a few Scots Episcopalians such as Lords Pitsligo and Balmerino.

Instead they began to focus on populist themes such as opposition to a standing army, political corruption, and social injustice. By the 1750s, Charles himself promised triennial parliaments, disbanding the army and legal guarantees on freedom of the press. Such tactics broadened their appeal but also carried risks, since they could always be coopted by a government prepared to offer similar concessions. The ongoing Stuart focus on England and regaining a united British throne led to tensions with their broader-based supporters in 1745, when the primary goal of most Scots Jacobites was ending the 1707 Union. This meant that following victory at Prestonpans in September, they preferred to negotiate, rather than invade England as Charles wanted.

More generally, Jacobite theorists reflected a broader conservative current in Enlightenment thought, appealing to those attracted to a monarchist solution to perceived modern decadence. Populist songs and tracts presented the Stuarts as capable of correcting a wide range of ills and restoring social harmony, as well as contrasting Dutch and Hanoverian &quot;foreigners&quot; with a man who even in exile continued to consume English beef and beer. While particularly calculated to appeal to Tories, the wide range of themes adopted by Jacobite pamphleteers and agents periodically drew in disaffected Whigs and former radicals. Such &quot;Whig-Jacobites&quot; were highly valued by the exiled court, although many viewed James II as a potentially weak king from whom it would be easy to extract concessions in the event of a restoration.

== Jacobite supporters in the three kingdoms ==

===Ireland===
The role of Jacobitism in Irish political history is debated; some argue that it was a broad-based popular movement and the main driver of Irish Catholic nationalism between 1688 and 1795. Others see it as part of &quot;a pan-British movement, rooted in confessional and dynastic loyalties&quot;, very different from 19th-century Irish nationalism. Historian Vincent Morely describes Irish Jacobitism as a distinctive ideology within the broader movement that &quot;emphasised the Milesian ancestry of the Stuarts, their loyalty to Catholicism, and Ireland&#x27;s status as a kingdom with a Crown of its own.&quot; In the first half of the 18th century, Jacobitism was &quot;the primary allegiance of politically conscious Catholics&quot;.

Irish Catholic support for James was predicated on his religion and assumed willingness to deliver their demands. In 1685, Irish bard Dáibhí Ó Bruadair celebrated his accession as ensuring the revived supremacy of both the Catholic Church in Ireland and the Irish language. Tyrconnell&#x27;s expansion of the army by the creation of Catholic regiments was welcomed by Diarmuid Mac Carthaigh, as enabling the native Irish &#x27;Tadhg&#x27; to be armed and to assert his dominance over &quot;John&quot; the English Protestant. Conversely, most Irish Protestants viewed his policies as designed to &quot;utterly ruin the Protestant interest and the English interest in Ireland&quot;. This restricted Protestant Jacobitism to &quot;doctrinaire clergymen, disgruntled Tory landowners and Catholic converts&quot;, who opposed Catholicism but still viewed James&#x27; removal as unlawful. A few Church of Ireland ministers refused to swear allegiance to the new regime and became Non-Jurors, the most famous being propagandist Charles Leslie.

Since regaining England was his primary objective, James viewed Ireland as a strategic dead-end but Louis XIV of France argued it was the best place to launch a regime change war, since the administration was controlled by Tyrconnell and his cause was popular among the majority Catholic population. James landed at Kinsale in March 1689 and in May called the first Parliament of Ireland since 1666, primarily seeking taxes to fund the war effort. Tyrconnell ensured a predominantly Catholic electorate and candidates by issuing new borough charters, admitting Catholics into city corporations, and removing &quot;disloyal members&quot;. Since elections were not held in many northern areas, the Irish House of Commons was 70 members short, and 224 out of 230 MPs were Catholic.

Known to 19th-century Irish historians as the &quot;Patriot Parliament&quot;, it opened by proclaiming James as the rightful king and condemning the &quot;treasonous subjects&quot; who had ousted him. There were some divisions among Irish Jacobites on the issue of returning all Catholic lands confiscated in 1652 after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. The majority of the Irish House of Commons wanted the 1652 Cromwellian Act of Settlement repealed in its entirety, with ownership returned to that prevailing in 1641. This was opposed by a minority within the Catholic elite who had benefited from the 1662 Act of Settlement, a group that included James himself, Tyrconnell and other members of the Irish House of Lords. Instead, they suggested those dispossessed in the 1650s should be restored to half their estates and paid compensation for the remainder. However, with the Commons overwhelmingly in favour of complete restoration, Tyrconnell persuaded the Lords to approve the bill.

More serious was the fact James was unwilling to do anything that might jeopardise potential support from Protestants in England and Scotland. These conflicted with the demands of the Irish Parliament, which in addition to land restoration included toleration for Catholicism and Irish autonomy. When it became clear Parliament would only vote war taxes if he met their minimum demands, James reluctantly gave his assent to Tyrconnell&#x27;s land bill and passed a Bill of attainder, confiscating estates from 2,000 mostly Protestant &quot;rebels&quot;. Although he also approved Parliament&#x27;s resolution that Ireland was a &quot;distinct kingdom&quot; and laws passed in England did not apply there, he refused to abolish Poynings&#x27; Law, which required Irish legislation be approved by the English Parliament.

Despite his own Catholicism, James viewed the Protestant Church of Ireland as an important part of his support base; he insisted on retaining its legal pre-eminence, although agreeing landowners would only have to pay tithes to clergy of their own religion. However, the price of these concessions was Irish Jacobitism became almost entirely confined to Catholics, who post 1690 split between Tyrconnell&#x27;s &#x27;Peace party&#x27;, who sought a negotiated solution, and a &#x27;War party&#x27; led by Patrick Sarsfield who favoured fighting on to the end.

James left Ireland after defeat at the Boyne in 1690, telling his supporters to &quot;shift for themselves&quot;. This led some to depict him as (, &quot;James the shit&quot;), who had deserted his loyal followers. However, Gaelic scholar Breandán Ó Buachalla claims his reputation subsequently recovered as &quot;the rightful king...destined to return&#x27;, while upper-class Irish Jacobites like Charles O&#x27;Kelly and Nicholas Plunkett blamed &quot;corrupt English and Scottish advisors&quot; for his apparent desertion.

After 1691, measures passed by the 1689 Parliament were annulled, penal laws criminalized the practice of Catholicism and barred Catholics from public life, while the Act of Attainder was used to justify further land confiscations. 12,000 Jacobite soldiers went into exile in the diaspora known as the Flight of the Wild Geese, the majority of whom were later absorbed into the French Royal Army&#x27;s Irish Brigade. About 1,000 men were recruited for the French and Spanish armies annually, many with a &quot;tangible commitment to the Stuart cause&quot;. Elements of the French Irish Brigade participated in the Scottish Jacobite rising of 1745.

Irish-language poets, especially in Munster, continued to champion the cause after James&#x27; death; in 1715, Eoin O Callanain described his son Prince James Francis Edward Stuart as &quot;taoiseach na nGaoidheal&quot; or &quot;chieftain of the Gaels&quot;. As in England, throughout the 1720s, Prince James&#x27; birthday on 10 June was marked by celebrations in Dublin, and towns like Kilkenny and Galway. These were often accompanied by rioting, suggested as proof of popular pro-Jacobite sympathies. Others argue riots were common in 18th-century urban areas and see them as a &quot;series of ritualised clashes&quot;.

Some historians claim Jacobite rhetoric and symbolism in the many works of Aisling poetry composed in the Irish language and support for rapparees like Éamonn an Chnoic, John Hurley, and Galloping Hogan, is proof of popular backing for a Stuart restoration. Others, however, argue it is hard to discern &quot;how far rhetorical Jacobitism reflected support for the Stuarts, as opposed to discontent with the status quo&quot;. Nevertheless, fears of resurgent Jacobitism among the ruling Protestant minority meant anti-Catholic Penal Laws remained in place for most of the eighteenth century.

In both 1715 and 1745, there were no Irish risings to accompany those in England and Scotland. One suggestion is that for various reasons, post 1691 Irish Jacobites looked to European allies, rather than a domestic revolt. From the 1720s on, many middle-class Catholics were willing to swear loyalty to the Hanoverian regime, but balked at the Oath of Abjuration, which required them to reject the authority of the Pope, and doctrines of Transubstantiation and the Real Presence. After the effective demise of the Jacobite cause in the 1750s and &#x27;60s, organisations like the Catholic Convention were established to agitate for the redress of Catholic grievances within the existing state. When Charles died in 1788, Irish nationalists looked for alternative liberators, among them the French First Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte and Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

=== England and Wales ===

In England and Wales, Jacobitism was often associated with the Tories, many of whom supported James&#x27;s right to the throne during the Exclusion Crisis. Tory ideology implied that neither &quot;time nor statute law [...] could ameliorate the sin of usurpation&quot;, while shared Tory and Jacobite themes of divine right and sacred kingship may have provided an alternative to Whig concepts of &quot;liberty and property&quot;. A minority of academics, including Eveline Cruickshanks, have argued that until the late 1750s the Tories were a crypto-Jacobite party; others, that Jacobitism was a &quot;limb of Toryism&quot;. However, the supremacy of the Church of England was also central to Tory ideology, and James lost their support when his policies seemed to threaten that primacy. The Act of Settlement 1701 excluding Catholics from the English throne was passed by a Tory administration; for the vast majority, Stuart Catholicism was an insuperable barrier to active support, while the Tory doctrine of non-resistance also discouraged them from supporting the exiles against a reigning monarch.

For most of the period from 1690 to 1714, Parliament was either controlled by the Tories, or evenly split with the Whigs; when George I succeeded Anne, most hoped to reconcile with the new regime. The Earl of Mar, who led the 1715 rising, observed &quot;Jacobitisme, which they used to brand the Tories with, is now I presum out of doors&quot;. However, George blamed the 1710-to-1714 Tory government for the Peace of Utrecht, which he viewed as damaging to his home state of Hanover. His isolation of former Tory ministers like Lord Bolingbroke and the Earl of Mar drove them first into opposition, then exile. Their exclusion from power between 1714 and 1742 led many Tories to remain in contact with the Jacobite court, which they saw as a potential tool for changing or pressuring the existing government.

In 1715, there were co-ordinated celebrations on 29 May, Restoration Day, and 10 June, James Stuart&#x27;s birthday, especially in Tory-dominated towns like Bristol, Oxford, Manchester and Norwich, although they remained quiet in the 1715 Rising. In the 1730s many &#x27;Jacobite&#x27; demonstrations in Wales and elsewhere were driven by local tensions, especially hostility to Methodism, and featured attacks on Nonconformist chapels. Most English participants in 1715 came from traditionally Catholic areas in the northwest, such as Lancashire. By 1720 there were fewer than 115,000 in England and Wales, and most remained loyal in 1745, including the Duke of Norfolk, head of the English Catholic community, sentenced to death for his role in 1715 but pardoned. Even so, sympathies were complex; Norfolk&#x27;s agent Andrew Blood joined the Manchester Regiment, and he later employed another ex-officer, John Sanderson, as his master of horse. English Catholics continued to provide the exiles with financial support well into the 1770s.

In 1689, around 2% of clergy in the Church of England refused to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary; one list identifies a total of 584 clergy, schoolmasters and university dons as Non Jurors. This almost certainly understates their numbers, for many sympathisers remained within the Church of England, but Non Jurors were disproportionately represented in Jacobite risings and riots, and provided many &quot;martyrs&quot;. By the late 1720s arguments over doctrine and the death of its originators reduced the church to a handful of scattered congregations, but several of those executed in 1745 came from Manchester, the last significant assembly in England.

Quaker leader William Penn was a prominent non-conformist supporter of James, although this was based on their personal relationship and did not survive his deposition. Another element in English Jacobitism was a handful of disaffected radicals, for whom the exiled Stuarts provided a potential alternative to the Whig establishment. An example was John Matthews, a Jacobite printer executed in 1719; his pamphlet &quot;Vox Populi vox Dei&quot; emphasised the Lockean theory of the social contract, a doctrine very few Tories of the period would have supported.

=== Scotland ===
Scottish Jacobitism had wider and more extensive roots than in England. 20,000 Scots fought for the Jacobites in 1715, compared to 11,000 who joined the government army, and were the majority of the 9,000 to 14,000 who served in 1745. One reason was the persistence of feudalism in parts of rural Scotland, where tenants could be compelled to provide their landlords with military service. Many of the Highland clansmen who were a feature of Jacobite armies were raised this way: in all three major risings, the bulk of the rank and file were supplied by a small number of north-western clans whose leaders joined the rebellion.

Despite this, many Jacobites were Protestant Lowlanders, rather than the Catholic, Gaelic-speaking Highlanders of legend. By 1745, fewer than 1% of Scots were Catholic, restricted to the far north-west and a few noble families. The majority of the rank and file, as well as many Jacobite leaders, belonged to Protestant non-juring Episcopalian congregations. Throughout the 17th century, the close connection between Scottish politics and religion meant regime changes were accompanied by the losers being expelled from the Church of Scotland. In 1690, over 200 clergymen lost their parishes, mostly in Aberdeenshire and Banffshire, a strongly Episcopalian area since the 1620s. In 1745, around 25% of Jacobite recruits came from this part of the country.

Episcopalianism was popular among social conservatives, as it emphasised indefeasible hereditary right, absolute obedience, and implied deposition of the senior Stuart line was a breach of natural order. The church continued to offer prayers for the Stuarts until 1788, while many refused to swear allegiance to the Hanoverians in 1714. However, even in 1690, a substantial minority accommodated to the new regime, a number that increased significantly after the establishment of the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1712.

Episcopalian ministers, such as Professor James Garden of Aberdeen, presented the 1707 Union as one in a series of disasters to befall Scotland, provoked by &quot;the sins [...] of rebellion, injustice, oppression, schism and perjury&quot;. Opposition was boosted by measures imposed by the post-1707 Parliament of Great Britain, including the Treason Act 1708, the 1711 ruling that barred Scots peers with English or British peerages from their seats in the House of Lords, and tax increases. Despite their own preferences, the Stuarts tried to appeal to this group; in 1745, Charles issued declarations dissolving the &quot;pretended Union&quot;, despite concerns this would alienate his English supporters.

However, opposition to post-Union legislation was not restricted to Jacobites. Many Presbyterians opposed the establishment of the Episcopal Church in 1712 and other measures of indulgence, while the worst tax riots took place in Glasgow, a town noted for its antipathy to the Stuarts. As in England, some objected less to the Union than the Hanoverian connection; Lord George Murray, a senior Jacobite commander in 1745, was a Unionist who repeatedly disagreed with Charles, but opposed &quot;wars [...] on account of the Electors of Hanover&quot;.

==Community==

While Jacobite agents continued in their attempts to recruit the disaffected, the most committed Jacobites were often linked by relatively small family networks, particularly in Scotland; Jacobite activities in areas like Perthshire and Aberdeenshire centred on a limited number of influential families heavily involved in 1715 and 1745.

Some of the most powerful landowning families preserved their establishment loyalties, but maintained traditions of Stuart allegiance by permitting younger sons to become involved in active Jacobitism; in 1745, Lewis Gordon was widely believed to be a proxy for his brother, the Duke of Gordon. Many Jacobite leaders were closely linked to each other and the exile community by marriage or blood. This has led some historians, notably Bruce Lenman, to characterise the Jacobite risings as French-backed coup attempts by a small network drawn from the elite, though this view is not universally accepted.

Family traditions of Jacobite sympathy were reinforced through objects such as inscribed glassware or rings with hidden symbols, although many of those that survive are in fact 19th-century neo-Jacobite creations. Other family heirlooms contained reference to executed Jacobite martyrs, for which the movement preserved an unusual level of veneration. Tartan cloth, widely adopted by the Jacobite army in 1745, was used in portraiture as a symbol of Stuart sympathies, even before the Rising. Outside elite social circles, the Jacobite community circulated propaganda and symbolic objects through a network of clubs, print-sellers and pedlars, aimed at the provincial gentry and middling sort. In 1745, Prince Charles ordered commemorative medals and miniature pictures for clandestine distribution.

Among the more visible elements of the Jacobite community were drinking clubs established in the early 18th century, such as the Scottish Bucks Club or the &quot;Cycle of the White Rose&quot;, led by Welsh Tory Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn. Others included the &quot;Sea Serjeants&quot;, largely composed of South Wales gentry or the &quot;Independent Electors of Westminster&quot; led by the Glamorganshire lawyer David Morgan, executed for his role in 1745. Other than Morgan, the vast majority of their members took no part in the 1745 Rising; Charles later said &quot;I will do for the Welsh Jacobites what they did for me. I will drink their health&quot;.

Oak Apple Day on 29 May commemorated Charles II and was an occasion for displays of Stuart sympathy, as was &quot;White Rose Day&quot;, the Old Pretender&#x27;s birthday on 10 June. Symbols were commonly employed by Jacobites, given that they could not be prosecuted for their use; the most common of these was the White rose of York, adopted after 1688 for reasons now unclear. Various origins have been suggested, including its use as an ancient Scottish royal device, its association with James II as Duke of York, or Charles I being styled as the &quot;White King&quot;. Jacobite military units often used plain white standards or cockades, while green ribbons were another recognised Stuart symbol despite their association with the Whig Green Ribbon Club.

==Post-1745 decline==

Despite being greeted as a hero on his return to Paris, Charles&#x27; reception behind the scenes was more muted. D&#x27;Éguilles, unofficial French envoy to the Jacobites, had a low opinion of him and other senior Jacobites, describing Lochgarry as &quot;a bandit&quot;, and suggesting George Murray was a British spy. For their part, the Scots were disillusioned by lack of meaningful English or French support, despite constant assurances of both. Events also highlighted the reality that a low level, ongoing insurgency was far more cost-effective for the French than a restoration, a form of warfare potentially devastating to the local populace. By exposing the divergence between Scottish, French and Stuart objectives, as well as the lack of support in England, the 1745 Rising ended Jacobitism as a viable political alternative in England and Scotland.

The British authorities enacted a series of measures designed to prevent the Scottish Highlands being used for another rising. New forts were built, the military road network finally completed and William Roy made the first comprehensive survey of the Highlands. Much of the power held by the Highland chiefs derived from their ability to require military service from their clansmen and even before 1745 the clan system had been under severe stress due to changing economic conditions; the Heritable Jurisdictions Act removed such feudal controls by Highland chiefs. This was far more significant than the better-known Act of Proscription which outlawed Highland dress unless worn in military service: its impact is debated and the law was repealed in 1782.

As early as 1745, the French were struggling with the costs of the War of the Austrian Succession, and in June 1746, they began peace negotiations with Britain at Breda. Victories in Flanders in 1747 and 1748 actually worsened their position by drawing in the previously neutral Dutch Republic, whose shipping they relied on to avoid the British naval blockade. By 1748, food shortages among the French population made peace a matter of urgency, but the British refused to sign the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle while Charles remained in France. After he ignored requests to leave, the French lost patience; in December 1748, he was briefly jailed before being deported. 

In June 1747, his brother Henry became a Catholic priest; given that Charles had no legitimate heir, this was seen as tacit acceptance by their father James that the Jacobite cause was finished. Charles continued to explore options for a rising in England, including his conversion to Anglicanism, a proposal that had outraged his father James when previously suggested. He &quot;secretly&quot; visited London in 1750 to meet supporters, and was inducted into the Non Juror church. However, the decline of Jacobitism is demonstrated by the fact that King George II and his government were well aware of Charles&#x27;s presence and did nothing to intervene. The English Jacobites made it clear they would do nothing without foreign backing, which despite Charles&#x27;s overtures to Frederick II of Prussia seemed unlikely.

A plot to capture or assassinate George II, headed by Alexander Murray of Elibank, was betrayed to the government by Alastair Ruadh MacDonnell, or &quot;Pickle the Spy&quot;, but not before Charles had sent two exiles as agents. One was Archibald Cameron, responsible for recruiting the Cameron regiment in 1745, who was allegedly betrayed by his own clansmen and executed on 7 June 1753. In a 1754 dispute with the English conspirators, a drunken and increasingly desperate Charles threatened to publish their names for having &quot;betrayed&quot; him; most remaining English sympathisers now left the cause.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1759, Charles met Choiseul, then Chief minister of France to discuss another invasion, but Choiseul dismissed him as &quot;incapacitated by drink&quot;. The Jacobite cause was abandoned by the French, while British supporters stopped providing funds; Charles, who had returned to Catholicism, now relied on the Papacy to fund his lifestyle. However, with the death of Charles&#x27;s father in 1766, the Hanoverians received the Pope&#x27;s recognition. Despite Henry&#x27;s urgings, Clement XIII refused to recognise his brother as Charles III; Charles died of a stroke in Rome in January 1788, a disappointed and embittered man.

Following Charles&#x27;s death, Scottish Catholics swore allegiance to the House of Hanover, and resolved two years later to pray for King George by name. The Stuart claim passed to Henry, now a Cardinal, who styled himself King Henry IX of England. After he fell into financial difficulty during the French Revolution, he was granted a stipend by George III. However, his refusal to renounce his claim to be &#x27;Henry IX&#x27; prevented a full reconciliation with the House of Hanover.

During the Irish Rebellion of 1798, headed by the United Irishmen with French support, the Directory suggested making Henry King of the Irish. They hoped this would attract support from the Catholic Irish and lead to the creation of a stable pro-French client state. Wolfe Tone, the Protestant republican leader, rejected the suggestion, and a short-lived Irish Republic was proclaimed instead.

Following the death of Henry in 1807, the Jacobite claim passed to those excluded by the 1701 Act of Settlement. From 1807 to 1840, it was held by the House of Savoy, then the House of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1919, while the current Jacobite heir is Franz, Duke of Bavaria, from the House of Wittelsbach. However, neither he nor any of his predecessors since 1807 have pursued their claim. Henry, Charles and James are memorialised in the Monument to the Royal Stuarts in the Vatican.

== Analysis ==
Traditional Whig historiography viewed Jacobitism as a marginal threat to the progression towards present-day Parliamentary democracy, taking the view that as it was defeated, it could never have won. Representing &quot;pre-industrial paternalism&quot; and &quot;mystical loyalism&quot; against forward-thinking individualism, this conception of Jacobitism was reinforced by Macaulay&#x27;s stereotype of the typical &quot;Tory-Jacobite squire&quot; as a &quot;bigoted, ignorant, drunken philistine&quot;.

More recent analyses, such as that of J. C. D. Clark, suggest that Jacobitism can instead be regarded as part of a &quot;deep vein of social and political conservatism running throughout British history&quot;, arguing that the Whig settlement was not as stable as has been depicted. Further interest in Jacobite studies has been prompted by a reassessment of the nationalist aspirations of Scots Jacobites in particular, emphasising their place as part of an ongoing political debate.

=== Romantic revival ===
As the political danger of Jacobitism receded, the movement was increasingly viewed as a romantic symbol of the past, particularly the final rebellion. Relics and mementoes of 1745 were preserved, and Charles himself celebrated in &quot;increasingly emotional language&quot;. This memorialising tendency was reinforced by the publication in the 1830s of selections from &quot;The Lyon in Mourning&quot; by Robert Forbes (1708–1775), a collection of source material and interviews with Jacobite participants in the 1745 rising.

19th-century historiography often presented Scottish Jacobites as primarily driven by a romantic attachment to the Stuarts, rather than the reality of individuals with disparate motives. This suited the Victorian depiction of Highlanders as a &quot;martial race&quot;, distinguished by a tradition of a &quot;misplaced loyalism&quot; since transferred to the British crown. The participation of the Lowland Scots and north-eastern gentry was less emphasised, while his Irish Jacobite advisors like Captain , were, until very recently, inaccurately presented as worthless individuals who were solely a negative influence on Charles Stuart in 1745. 

Walter Scott, author of &quot;Waverley&quot;, a story of the 1745 rebellion, combined a romantic view of Jacobitism with a belief in what he says as the practical benefits of Whiggism. In 1822 he arranged a pageantry of reinvented Scottish traditions for the visit of King George IV to Scotland. The displays of tartan proved immensely popular, and Highland clothing, previously associated with rebellion and regime change, became emblems of Scottish national identity. Some descendants of those attained for rebellion had their titles restored in 1824, while persecutory and discriminatory laws against Catholics were repealed through the efforts of Daniel O&#x27;Connell in 1829. With political and military Jacobitism now safely confined to an &quot;earlier era&quot;, the hitherto largely ignored site of their final defeat at Culloden began to be celebrated.

=== Neo-Jacobite revival ===

There was a brief revival of political Jacobitism in the late 1880s and into the 1890s. A number of Jacobite clubs and societies were formed, starting with the Order of the White Rose founded by Bertram Ashburnham in 1886. In 1890, Herbert Vivian and Ruaraidh Erskine co-founded a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Whirlwind&quot;, that espoused a Jacobite political view. Vivian, Erskine and Melville Henry Massue formed the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland in 1891, which lasted for several years. Vivian went on to stand for Parliament four times on a Jacobite platform – though he failed to be elected each time. The revival largely came to an end with the First World War, and the various societies of the time are now represented by the Royal Stuart Society.

==Literary legacy==
===English and Lowland Scots===
Many Jacobite folk songs emerged in Scotland in the Romantic era; a number of examples were collected by Scott&#x27;s colleague James Hogg in his &quot;Jacobite Reliques&quot;, including several he likely composed himself. Scots poets such as Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns, Alicia Ann Spottiswoode, Agnes Maxwell MacLeod, and Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne (whose &quot;Bonnie Charlie&quot; remains popular) added further examples. Many of these songs have seen a renewed popularity since the beginning of the British folk revival in the 1950s.

Relatively few of the most famous surviving songs, except for those by William Hamilton and James Robson, actually date from the time of the risings and the majority of those that do are in other languages than English or Scots.

===Irish language literature===
As demonstrated in 1924 by Daniel Corkery, in Modern literature in Irish, Jacobitism inspired the enormously influential Aisling or dream vision genre of Irish bardic poetry. One of the most widely known is &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot; by Seán Clárach Mac Domhnaill. Other important Jacobite poets who composed immortal verse in Munster Irish during the 18th-century included Aogán Ó Rathaille, Éamonn an Chnoic, Tadhg Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin, Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin, and Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Conmara. The Aisling poetic genre has also remained a living tradition and has been adapted, by poets such as Máire Bhuidhe Ní Laoghaire, Pádraig Phiarais Cúndún, and Seán Gaelach Ó Súilleabháin to more recent causes and struggles by the Irish people. Since 1976, an Aisling poem by Liam mac Uistín in honour of &quot;those who gave their lives for Irish freedom&quot; has been permanently displayed at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin.

===Scottish Gaelic literature===
By 1933, John Lorne Campbell published the groundbreaking book &quot;Highland Songs of the Forty-Five&quot;, consisting of 32 Gaelic song-poems, which were analyzed for political content, annotated, and published with facing translations into English blank verse, or unrhymed iambic pentameter; the real cultural, political, and religious reasons for the Jacobite rising of 1745 had been obscured by the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Robert Louis Stevenson, who both depicted, &quot;the Highlander as a romantic hero fighting for a lost cause.&quot; In response, Campbell set out to give, &quot;a voice to the voiceless - ordinary men who had never been allowed to speak for themselves&quot;.

As Campbell&#x27;s volume and his later published writings revealed to the English-speaking world, within Scottish Gaelic literature, Jacobite ideology and the events of the risings inspired the immortal poetry of Iain Lom, Sìleas na Ceapaich, Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, Iain Mac Fhearchair, Catriona Nic Fhearghais, Iain Ruadh Stùibhart, and William Ross. Despite also composing immortal poetry of his own about fighting for the government in the Campbell of Argyll Militia during the Battle of Falkirk Muir in 1746, their contemporary, Duncan Ban MacIntyre, offers in his later poetry, according to Campbell, &quot;an interesting testimony to the bitter disillusionment of the Highlanders who had come to the aid of the Government, to be in the end treated no better that those who had rebelled against it.&quot;

==Claimants to the thrones of England, Scotland, Ireland and France==

*James II and VII (6 February 168516 September 1701).
*James III and VIII (16 September 17011 January 1766), James Francis Edward Stuart, also known as the &quot;Chevalier de St. George&quot;, the &quot;King over the Water&quot;, or the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;. (Son of James II)
*Charles III (1 January 176631 January 1788), Charles Edward Stuart, also known as &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, the &quot;Young Chevalier&quot;, or the &quot;Young Pretender&quot;. (Son of James III)
*Henry IX and I (31 January 178813 July 1807), Henry Benedict Stuart, also known as the &quot;Cardinal King&quot;. (Son of James III)

Since Henry&#x27;s death, none of the Jacobite heirs have claimed the English or Scottish thrones. Franz, Duke of Bavaria (born 1933), a direct descendant of Charles I, is the current legitimate heir of the house of Stuart. It has been suggested that a repeal of the Act of Settlement 1701 could allow him to claim the throne, although he has expressed no interest in doing so.
