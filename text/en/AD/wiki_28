<text>Jean Joseph Marie Amiot (; February 8, 1718October 8, 1793) was a French Jesuit priest who worked in Qing China, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor.

Born in Toulon, Amiot entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at the age of 19. After he was ordained in 1746, he aspired to serve in an overseas mission. Eventually, he was assigned a mission in China and left France in 1749. He arrived at Beijing in 1751 and remained there for the rest of his life.

Amiot served as an intermediary between the academics of Europe and China. His correspondence provided insight on the culture of China to the Europeans. He translated Chinese works into French. Most notably, his translation of Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; is the first rendition of the work into a Western language. 

== Early life ==
Amiot was born in Toulon on February 8, 1718 to Louis Amiot, the royal notary of Toulon, and Marie-Anne Serre. He was the eldest of ten children: five boys and five girls. His brother Pierre-Jules-Roch Amiot would go on to become the lieutenant-general of the admiralty of Toulon and his sister, Marguerite-Claire was an Ursuline nun. Amiot maintained contact with both.

After finishing his studies in philosophy and theology at the Jesuit seminary in Toulon, Amiot entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Avignon on September 27, 1737; he remained a novice for two years. Afterwards, he taught at the Jesuit colleges of Besançon, Arles, Aix-en-Provence and finally at Nîmes, where he was professor of rhetoric in the academic year of 1744–1745. He completed his theological studies at Dôle from 1745 to 1748 and was ordained as a priest on December 22, 1746.

== Arrival at China ==
Amiot requested Franz Retz, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus at that time, to serve in an overseas mission, and was eventually given a mission to China. Earlier, in a letter to his brother, he had expressed his desire to serve in a delegation to this particular country. He left France in 1749, accompanied by Chinese Jesuits Paul Liu and Stanislas Kang, who had been sent to study in France and were returning to their home country. Kang died at sea, before the party could reach China.

They arrived at Macau on July 27, 1750. The Jesuits of Beijing announced Amiot&#x27;s arrival, along with that of the Portuguese Jesuits José d&#x27;Espinha and Emmanuel de Mattos, to Emperor Qianlong, who ordered that they be taken to the capital. On March 28, 1751, they left Macau for Guangzhou and arrived there five days later. They left Canton on June 2, and reached Beijing on August 22.

After his arrival in Beijing, he was put in charge of the children&#x27;s congregation of the Holy Guardian Angels. Alongside this, he studied the Chinese language. He adopted the Chinese name Qian Deming () and wore Chinese clothing in order to adapt himself to the culture of China. In 1754, Amiot made a young Chinese man by the name of Yang Ya-Ko-Pe his assistant and instructed him in the European manner. Yang died in 1784, after working with Amiot for over thirty years.

== Suppression of the Jesuits ==
In 1762 the Parlement of Paris ordered the suppression of the Society of Jesus and the confiscation of its property. The society was abolished in France two years later, by the order of King Louis XV. The Jesuit mission in China survived for a while after their suppression, being protected by the Qianlong Emperor himself. The final blow, however, would be Pope Clement XIV&#x27;s brief, &quot;Dominus ac Redemptor&quot;, issued on July 21, 1773, with which the Bishop of Rome officially ordered the suppression of the Society of Jesus. The brief reached the French Jesuits in China on September 22, 1775 via a German Carmelite named Joseph de Sainte-Thérèse. The Jesuits of Beijing surrendered to it, resigned from the Society of Jesus and became secular priests. Wishing to keep the French mission alive, King Louis XVI sent them financial aid and appointed François Bourgeois as their administrator. Amiot was named as Bourgeois&#x27; replacement in the event of his absence.

Subsequently, Amiot turned his attention to writing. He maintained contact with Henri Bertin, the foreign minister of France. His correspondences were published from 1776 to 1791 in the . He also corresponded with other European Academies, including brief contacts with the Imperial Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society.

== Later life and death ==
After the death of Bourgeois in 1792, Amiot started visiting the tombs of his Jesuit companions, where he prayed and meditated; he also carved the Jesuits&#x27; epitaphs on their tombs. News about the upheaval of the French Revolution distressed him to the point that his physical and mental health declined, and thus he had to stop visiting the tombs by September 1792.

In 1792, Britain sent a diplomatic mission to China, led by George Macartney. The goals of the delegation were to open new trading ports with the country and establish a permanent mission there. Macartney had wished to meet Amiot in Beijing. However, he was too ill to meet the diplomat and instead sent him a portrait of himself and a letter, which was delivered on October 3, 1793. He gave his advice to Macartney and suggested that he leave China.

On October 8, 1793, the news of King Louis XVI&#x27;s execution reached Amiot, who celebrated Mass for the deceased monarch. He died on the same night of October 8, or on the following day, October 9, 1793.

== Works ==

In 1772 Amiot&#x27;s translation of Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; was published. It includes a translation of the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s &quot;Ten Precepts&quot;. Amiot was the first person to translate &quot;The Art of War&quot; in the West. The next translation of the work in a Western language would not be made until Everard Ferguson Calthrop published his English rendition in 1905.

Amiot could speak in Manchu, the language of the emperor. He wrote a Manchu-French dictionary, which was published from 1789 to 1790 with the help of Bertin; Prince Hongwu, a member of the Qing imperial family, praised the dictionary. He also wrote a Manchu grammar, which was never published.

Amiot carried out scientific observations and experiments while working in China. For example, he made a record of the weather in Beijing, which was published by Charles Messier in 1774. He also tried to build a hot air balloon, but was discouraged by Prince Hongwu, for fear of the danger of flying and disseminating the discovery.

== Music ==
Amiot could play the harpsichord and the flute. He tried to win over Chinese listeners by playing pieces by French baroque composers, including Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Les sauvages&quot; and &quot;Les cyclopes&quot;. These attempts, however, were not successful; when he asked the Chinese musicians for their opinions, they remarked that &quot;your music was not made for our ears, nor our ears for your music&quot;. Lester Hu, assistant professor of musicology at the University of California, Berkeley has doubted the veracity of this story.

Amiot sent his translation of Li Guangdi&#x27;s &quot;Guyue Jingzhuan&quot; (), a treatise on Chinese music, to Paris in 1754; he later acknowledged that it contained errors and was incomplete. Jean-Philippe Rameau referenced the work in his 1760 treatise, , though Rameau&#x27;s idea of harmony in Chinese music was erroneous. Amiot&#x27;s own work on Chinese music, was published twice by Pierre-Joseph Roussier in 1779 and 1780. The author&#x27;s supplements to the work were not published until 1997. He also sent collections of Chinese music and instruments to France. In 1777, he sent a Sheng, thus contributing to the development of the harmonica in Europe.

<text>Jean-Jacques Ampère (12 August 1800 – 27 March 1864) was a French philologist and man of letters.

Born in Lyon, he was the only son of the physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836). Jean-Jacques&#x27; mother died while he was an infant. (But André-Marie Ampère had a daughter – Albine (1807–1842) – with his second wife.) On his tomb at the cemetery of Montmartre, Paris, he is named Jean-Jacques Antoine Ampère. His father&#x27;s father was also named Jean-Jacques Ampère (executed in Lyon, 1793).

He studied the folk songs and popular poetry of the Scandinavian countries in an extended tour in northern Europe. Returning to France in 1830, he delivered a series of lectures on Scandinavian and early German poetry at the Athenaeum in Marseille. The first of these was printed as &quot;De l&#x27;Histoire de la poésie&quot; (1830), and was practically the first introduction of the French public to the Scandinavian and German epics.

Moving to Paris, he taught at the Sorbonne, and became professor of the history of French literature at the Collège de France. A journey in northern Africa (1841) was followed by a tour in Greece and Italy, in company with Prosper Mérimée, Jean de Witte and Charles Lenormant. This bore fruit in his &quot;Voyage dantesque&quot; (printed in his &quot;Grèce, Rome et Dante&quot;, 1848), which did much to popularize the study of Dante in France.

In 1848 he became a member of the Académie française, and in 1851 he visited America. From this time he was occupied with his chief work, &quot;L&#x27;Histoire romaine à Rome&quot; (4 vols., 1861–1864), until his death at Pau.

The &quot;Correspondence et souvenirs&quot; (2 vols.) of A-M and J-J Ampère (1805–1854) was published in 1875. Notices of J-J Ampère are to be found in Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s &quot;Portraits littéraires,&quot; vol. iv., and &quot;Nouveaux Lundis,&quot; vol. xiii.; in P Mérimée&#x27;s &quot;Portraits historiques et littéraires&quot; (2nd ed., 1875); and in Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Recollections&quot; (1893).

The Ampère Museum, close to Lyon, France, includes some documents presenting the life and works of Jean-Jacques Ampère.

<doc id="15999" wikidata="Q958438" url="?curid=15999" title="Jacob Anatoli">
<text>Jacob ben Abba Mari ben Simson Anatoli (c. 1194 – 1256) was a translator of Arabic texts to Hebrew. He was invited to Naples by Frederick II. Under this royal patronage, and in association with Michael Scot, Anatoli made Arabic learning accessible to Western readers. Among his most important works were translations of texts by Averroes.

==Early life and invitation to Naples==

Born in southern France, perhaps in Marseille, Anatoli had an interest in literary activity that was stimulated early by his learned associates and relations at Narbonne and Béziers. He so distinguished himself that the emperor Frederick II, the most genial and enlightened monarch of the time, invited him to come to Naples. Under the emperor&#x27;s patronage, Antatoli was enabled to devote himself to his studies. He translated scientific Arabic literature into the more accessible Hebrew language. Anatoli produced his most important literary and scientific translations while in Naples, and his works were copied under his name.

==Opposed by Anti-Maimonists==

Anatoli was the son-in-law (and possibly also the brother-in-law) of Samuel ibn Tibbon, a well-known translator of Maimonides. Moses b. Samuel ibn Tibbon frequently refers to Anatoli as his uncle, which makes it likely that Samuel married Anatoli&#x27;s sister. Anatoli later married Samuel&#x27;s daughter. Because of this intimate connection with the ibn Tibbons, Anatoli was introduced to the philosophy of Maimonides. He found study of this man to be such a great revelation that he later referred to it as the beginning of his intelligent and true comprehension of the Scriptures. He also frequently alluded to Ibn Tibbon as one of the two masters who had instructed and inspired him. His esteem for Maimonides knew no bounds: he placed him next to the Prophets, and he exhibited little patience with Maimonides&#x27;s critics and detractors.

He accordingly interprets the Bible and the Haggadah in a truly Maimonistic spirit, rationalizing the miracles and investing every possible passage in the ancient literature with philosophic and allegoric significance. As an allegorist who could read into the ancient documents the particular philosophical idiosyncrasies of his day, Anatoli deserves a place beside other allegoric and philosophical commentators, from Philo down; indeed, he may be regarded as a pioneer in the application of the Maimonistic manner to purposes of popular instruction. This work he began while still in his native land, on occasions of private and public festivities, such as weddings and other assemblies. Afterward he delivered Sabbath-afternoon sermons, in which he advocated the allegoric and philosophic method of Scriptural exegesis. This evoked the opposition of the anti-Maimonists, whose number was large in southern France; and probably Anatoli&#x27;s departure for Sicily was hastened by the antagonism he encountered. But even at Naples Anatoli&#x27;s views aroused the opposition of his Orthodox coreligionists. This treatment, together with several other unpleasant experiences at the royal court, seems to have caused him to entertain thoughts of suicide. He soon, however, recovered and wrote, for the benefit of his two sons, his &quot;Malmad ha-Talmidim&quot;, a name which, involving a play on words, was intended to be both a &quot;Teacher of the Disciples&quot; and a &quot;Goad to the Students&quot;.

The &quot;Malmad&quot;, which was completed when its author was fifty-five years old, but was first published by the Meḳiẓe Nirdamim Society at Lyck in the year 1866, is really nothing but a volume of sermons, by which the author intended to stimulate study and to dispel intellectual blindness. As a curious specimen of his method, it may be mentioned that he regards the three stories of Noah&#x27;s ark as symbolic of the three sciences mathematics, physics, and metaphysics. As such, the work is of some importance in the history of Jewish culture. Anatoli&#x27;s ethical admonitions and spiritual meditations have value as portraying both the circumstances of the age and the character of the reforms he aimed at.

==Moral Fervor==

Anatoli is quite plain-spoken in the manner in which he states and defends his views, as well as in his criticisms of contemporary failings. For instance, he does not hesitate to reproach the rabbis of his day for their general neglect not only of the thorough study, but even of the obligatory perusal, of the Bible, charging them with a preference for Talmudic dialectics. He, likewise, deplores the contemporary degeneracy in the home life and the religious practises of his people, a circumstance which he thinks due largely to the imitation of surrounding manners. Scientific investigation he insists upon as an absolute necessity for the true comprehension of religion, despite the fact that his contemporaries regarded all the hours which he was accustomed to spend with his father-in-law, Samuel ibn Tibbon, in mathematical and philosophic study as mere waste of time.

==The &quot;Malmad&quot;==

The &quot;Malmad&quot; is divided into brief chapters, according to the weekly Scriptural portions. In it Anatoli manifests a wide acquaintance not only with the classic Jewish exegetes, but also with Plato, Aristotle, Averroes, and the Vulgate, as well as with a large number of Christian institutions, some of which he ventures to criticize, such as celibacy and monastic castigation, as well as certain heretics (compare 15a, 98a, 115a); and he repeatedly appeals to his readers for a broader cultivation of the classic languages and the profane branches of learning. He indignantly repudiates the fanatical view of some coreligionists that all non-Jews have no souls —a belief reciprocated by the Gentiles of the time. To Anatoli all men are, in truth, formed in the image of God, though the Jews stand under a particular obligation to further the true cognition of God simply by reason of their election—&quot;the Greeks had chosen wisdom as their pursuit; the Romans, power; and the Jews, religiousness&quot; (l.c. 103b). If, however, a non-Jew devotes himself to serious search after divine truth, his merit is so much the more significant; and whatever suggestion he may have to offer, no Jew dares refuse with levity.

==Anatoli and Michael Scot==

An example of such intellectual catholicity was set by Anatoli himself; for, in the course of his &quot;Malmad,&quot; he not only cites incidentally allegoric suggestions made to him by Frederick II., but several times—Güdemann has counted seventeen—he offers the exegetic remarks of a certain Christian savant of whose association he speaks most reverently, and whom, furthermore, he names as his second master besides Samuel ibn Tibbon. This Christian savant was identified by Senior Sachs as Michael Scot, who, like Anatoli, devoted himself to scientific work at the court of Frederick. Graetz even goes to the length of regarding Anatoli as identical with the Jew Andreas, who, according to Roger Bacon, assisted Michael Scot in his philosophic translations from the Arabic, seeing that Andreas might be a corruption of Anatoli. But Steinschneider will not admit the possibility of this conjecture, while Renan scarcely strengthens it by regarding &quot;Andreas&quot; as a possible northern corruption of &quot;En Duran,&quot; which, he says, may have been the Provençal surname of Anatoli, since Anatoli, in reality, was but the name of his great-grandfather.

Anatoli&#x27;s example of broad-minded study of Christian literature and intercourse with Christian scholars found many followers, as, for example, Moses ben Solomon of Salerno; and his work was an important factor in bringing the Jews of Italy into close contact with their Christian fellow students.

==Anatoli as translator==

The &quot;Malmad,&quot; owing to its deep ethical vein, became, despite its Maimonistic heresies, a very popular book. It is rather as a translator that Anatoli deserves a distinguished place in the scientific realm; for it is he and Michael Scot who together, under the influence of Frederick II, opened to the western world the treasure-house of Arabic learning. Anatoli, in fact, was the first man to translate the commentaries of Averroes into Hebrew, thus opening a new era in the history of Aristotelian philosophy. Prior to translating Averroes&#x27; commentaries, Anatoli had occupied himself with the translation of astronomical treatises by the same writer and others; but at the instance of friends he turned his attention to logic and the speculative works, realizing and recommending the importance of logic, in particular, in view of the contemporary religious controversies. Thenceforth, his program was twofold, as he devoted himself to his work in astronomy in the mornings, and to logic in the evenings.

His principal translation embraced the first five books of Averroes&#x27; &quot;intermediate&quot; commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot;, consisting of the Introduction of Porphyry and the four books of Aristotle on the Categories, Interpretation, Syllogism, and Demonstration. Anatoli probably commenced his work on the commentary while in Provence, though he must have finished the fifth book at Naples about 1231 or 1232. The conclusion of the commentary was never reached. Upon the ending of the first division he desired to go over the ground again, to acquire greater proficiency, and, for some reason unknown, he never resumed his task, which was completed by another after a lapse of eighty years.

Besides this, Anatoli translated, between the years 1231 and 1235, the following works: 
(1) The &quot;Almagest of Ptolemy&quot;, from the Arabic, though probably the Greek or Latin title of this treatise was also familiar to him. Its Hebrew title is &quot;Ḥibbur ha-Gadol ha-Niḳra al-Magesti&quot; (&quot;The Great Composition Called Almagest&quot;). 
(2) A &quot;Compendium of Astronomy&quot;, by Averroes, a book which was unknown to the Christians of the Middle Ages, and of which neither a manuscript of the original nor a Latin translation has come down. Its Hebrew title is &quot;Ḳiẓẓur al-Magesti&quot; (&quot;Compendium of the Almagest&quot;). 
(3) &quot;The Elements of Astronomy&quot;, by Al-Fargani (Alfraganus); possibly translated from a Latin version. It was afterward rendered into Latin by Jacob Christmann (Frankfort, 1590) under the title of &quot;Elementa Astronomica&quot;, which, in its turn, may have given rise to the Hebrew title of the treatise &quot;Yesodot ha-Teḳunah&quot;, which is undoubtedly recent. 
(4) A treatise on the Syllogism, by Al-Farabi, from the Arabic. Its Hebrew title is &quot;Sefer Heḳesh Ḳaẓar&quot; (&quot;A Brief Treatise on the Syllogism&quot;).

Graetz also suggests the possibility that Anatoli, in conjunction with Michael Scot, may have translated Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot; into Latin; but this suggestion has not yet been sufficiently proved (compare Steinschneider, &quot;Hebr. Uebers.&quot; i. 433). Similarly, the anonymous commentary on the &quot;Guide&quot;, called &quot;Ruaḥ Ḥen&quot;, though sometimes attributed to Anatoli, can not definitely be established as his. Still, it is on an allusion in this work that Zunz, followed by Steinschneider, partly bases the hypothesis of Marseille having been Anatoli&#x27;s original home (compare Zunz, &quot;Zur Gesch.&quot; p. 482; Renan-Neubauer, &quot;Les Rabbins Français,&quot; p. 588; Steinschneider, &quot;Cat. Bodl.&quot; col. 1180, and &quot;Hebr. Bibl.&quot; xvii. 124).

<text>Count Gyula Andrássy de Csíkszentkirály et Krasznahorka (, 8 March 1823 – 18 February 1890) was a Hungarian statesman, who served as Prime Minister of Hungary (1867–1871) and subsequently as Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871–1879). Andrássy was a conservative; his foreign policies looked to expanding the Empire into Southeast Europe, preferably with British and German support, and without alienating Turkey. He saw Russia as the main adversary, because of its own expansionist policies toward Slavic and Orthodox areas. He distrusted Slavic nationalist movements as a threat to his multi-ethnic empire.

==Biography==
The son of Count Károly Andrássy and Etelka Szapáry, he was born in Oláhpatak (present-day Vlachovo, Rožňava District, Slovakia), Kingdom of Hungary. His date and place of birth, however, are somewhat disputed. According to registry of Košice, Andrássy was baptised in the city then known as Kassa on 3 March 1823. The son of a liberal father who belonged to the political opposition, at a time when opposing the government was very dangerous, Andrássy at a very early age threw himself into the political struggles of the day, adopting at the outset the patriotic side.

===Career===

Count István Széchenyi was the first adequately to appreciate his capacity. In 1845 Andrássy was appointed as president of the society for the regulation of the waters of the Upper Tisza River.
In 1846, he attracted attention by publishing highly critical articles of the government in Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s paper, the &quot;Pesti Hírlap.&quot; He was elected as one of the Radical candidates to the Diet of 1848.

When the Croats under Josip Jelačić attempted to have Međimurje, which was then part of Hungary, returned to Croatia, Andrássy entered military service. He was commander of the gentry of his county, and served with distinction at the battles of Pákozd and Schwechat, as Artúr Görgei&#x27;s adjutant (1848).
Toward the end of the war, Andrássy was sent to Constantinople by the revolutionary government. He was seeking to obtain the neutrality of the Ottoman Empire, if not their support, during the struggle with Croatia.

After the catastrophe of Világos, where the Hungarians were defeated, Andrássy emigrated to London and then to Paris. On 21 September 1851, he was condemned &quot;in absentia&quot; to death and was hanged in effigy by the Austrian government for his share in the Hungarian revolt.
In exile for ten years, he studied politics in what was then the centre of European diplomacy. He discerned the weakness of the second French empire beneath its imposing exterior.

Andrássy returned to Hungary in 1858, but his position was still difficult. He had never petitioned for an amnesty, and had steadily rejected all the overtures both of the Austrian government and of the Magyar Conservatives (who would have accepted something short of full autonomy for the kingdom). He enthusiastically supported Ferenc Deák&#x27;s party.

On 21 December 1865, he was chosen vice-president of the Diet. In March 1866, he was elected as president of the sub-committee appointed by the parliamentary commission to draw up the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 between Austria and Hungary. He originated the idea of the &quot;Delegations&quot; of powers. 
It was said at that time that he was the only member of the commission who could persuade the court of the justice of the national claims.

In the 1866 Battle of Königgrätz (also called the Battle of Sadowa), Prussia decisively defeated Austria in the short Austro-Prussian War. It ended Austria&#x27;s hopes for a role in uniting Germany. Bismarck wanted to restore good relations after the war. Emperor Franz Joseph for the first time consulted Andrássy, who recommended the re-establishment of the constitution and the appointment of a responsible foreign and defence ministry. On 17 February 1867 the king/emperor appointed him as the first prime minister of the Hungarian half of the newly formed Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The obvious first choice had been Ferenc Deák, one of the architects of the Compromise, but he declined in favour of Andrássy. Deák described him as &quot;the providential statesman given to Hungary by the grace of God.&quot;

As premier, Andrássy by his firmness, amiability and dexterity as a debater, soon won for himself a commanding position. Yet his position continued to be difficult, inasmuch as the authority of Deák dwarfed that of all the party leaders, however eminent. Andrássy chose for himself the departments of war and foreign affairs. It was he who reorganized the Honvéd system (state army), and he used often to say that the regulation of the military border districts was the most difficult labour of his life.

On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Andrássy resolutely defended the neutrality of the Austrian monarchy, and in his speech on 28 July 1870 warmly protested against the assumption that it was in the interests of Austria to seek to recover the position it had held in Germany before 1863. On the fall of Beust (6 November 1871), Andrássy stepped into his place. His tenure of the chancellorship was epoch-making. Where Beust had been hostile to Germany and friendly toward Russia, Andrássy took the opposite approach. One problem was that Germany was close to Italy, but Italy and Austria were at odds about who would control border areas.

Hitherto the empire of the Habsburgs had never been able to dissociate itself from its historic Holy Roman traditions. But its loss of influence in Italy and Germany, and the consequent formation of the Dual State, had at length indicated the proper, and, indeed, the only field for its diplomacy in the future – the Near East, where the process of the crystallization of the Balkan peoples into nationalities was still incomplete. The question was whether these nationalities were to be allowed to become independent or were only to exchange the tyranny of the sultan for the tyranny of the tsar or the Habsburg emperor.

To this point Austria had been content either to keep out the Russians or share the booty with them. She was now, moreover, in consequence of her misfortunes deprived of most of her influence in the councils of Europe.
It was Andrassy who recovered for Austria her proper place in the European concert. First he approached the German emperor; then more satisfactory relations were established with the courts of Italy and Russia by means of conferences at Berlin, Vienna, St Petersburg and Venice.

===The &quot;Andrássy Note&quot;===
The recovered influence of Austria was evident in the negotiations which followed the outbreak of serious disturbances in Bosnia in 1875.
The three courts of Vienna, Berlin and St Petersburg reached an understanding as to their attitude in the Eastern question, and their views were embodied in the dispatch, known as the &quot;Andrássy Note&quot;, sent on 30 December 1875 by Andrássy to Count Beust, the Austrian ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s.

In it he pointed out that the efforts of the powers to localize the revolt seemed in danger of failure, that the rebels were still holding their own, and that the Ottoman promises of reform, embodied in various firmans, were no more than vague statements of principle which had never had, and were probably not intended to have, any local application. In order to avert the risk of a general conflagration, therefore, he urged that the time had come for concerted action of the powers for the purpose of pressing the Porte to fulfil its promises.
A sketch of the more essential reforms followed: the recognition rather than the toleration of the Christian religion; the abolition of the system of farming the taxes; and, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the religious was complicated by an agrarian question, the conversion of the Christian peasants into free proprietors, to rescue them from their double subjection to the Muslim Ottoman landowners.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina elected provincial councils were to be established, life-term judges appointed and individual liberties guaranteed.
Finally, a mixed commission of Muslims and Christians was to be empowered to watch over the carrying out of these reforms.

The fact that the sultan would be responsible to Europe for the realization of his promises would serve to allay the natural suspicions of the insurgents. To this plan both Britain and France gave a general assent, and the Andrássy Note was adopted as the basis of negotiations.

When war became inevitable between Russia and the Porte, Andrássy arranged with the Russian court that, in case Russia prevailed, the status quo should not be changed to the detriment of the Austrian monarchy. When, however, the Treaty of San Stefano threatened a Russian hegemony in the Near East, Andrássy concurred with the German and British courts that the final adjustment of matters must be submitted to a European congress.

At the Congress of Berlin in 1878 he was the principal Austrian plenipotentiary, and directed his efforts to diminish the gains of Russia and aggrandize the Dual Monarchy. Before the Congress opened on 13 June, negotiations between Andrássy and the British Foreign Secretary Marquess of Salisbury had already &quot;ended on 6 June by Britain agreeing to all the Austrian proposals relative to Bosnia-Herzegovina about to come before the congress while Austria would support British demands&quot;.

In addition to the occupation and administration of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Andrássy also obtained the right to station garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, which remained under Ottoman administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence&quot;. &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an ...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective&quot;.

This occupation was most unpopular in Hungary, both for financial reasons and because of the strong pro-Turk sentiments of the Magyars.
On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, behind which stood the Archduke Albert, were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution by his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion was lost by 179 to 95. By the Opposition rank and file the gravest accusations were raised against Andrassy.
On 10 October 1878 the French diplomat Melchior de Vogüé described the situation as follows:
Particularly in Hungary the dissatisfaction caused by this &quot;adventure&quot; has reached the gravest proportions, prompted by that strong conservative instinct which animates the Magyar race and is the secret of its destinies. This vigorous and exclusive instinct explains the historical phenomenon of an isolated group, small in numbers yet dominating a country inhabited by a majority of peoples of different races and conflicting aspirations, and playing a role in European affairs out of all proportions to its numerical importance or intellectual culture. This instinct is to-day awakened and gives warning that it feels the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be a menace which, by introducing fresh Slav elements into the Hungarian political organism and providing a wider field and further recruitment of the Croat opposition, would upset the unstable equilibrium in which the Magyar domination is poised.
Andrássy felt constrained to bow before the storm, and he placed his resignation in the emperor&#x27;s hands (8 October 1879). The day before his retirement he signed the offensive-defensive alliance with Germany, which placed the foreign relations of Austria-Hungary once more on a stable footing.

==Later life==

After his retirement, Andrássy continued to take an active part in public affairs both in the Delegations and in the Upper House. In 1885 he warmly supported the project for the reform of the House of Magnates, but on the other hand he jealously defended the inviolability of the Composition of 1867, and on 5 March 1889 in his place in the Upper House spoke against any particularist tampering with the common army. In the last years of his life he regained his popularity, and his death on 18 February 1890, aged 66, was mourned as a national calamity. There is a plaque dedicated to him in the town of Volosko where he died (between Rijeka and Opatija in present-day Croatia). It is located just above the restaurant Amfora.

He was the first Magyar statesman who, for centuries, had occupied a European position. It has been said that he united in himself the Magyar magnate with the modern gentleman. His motto was: &quot;It is hard to promise, but it is easy to perform.&quot;

==Family==

Andrássy married countess Katinka Kendeffy in Paris in 1856. They had two sons, Tivadar (born 10 July 1857) and Gyula (born 30 June 1860), and one daughter, Ilona (b. 1858).
Both sons gained distinction in Hungarian politics. Tivadar was elected vice-president of the Lower House of the Hungarian parliament in 1890. Gyula also had a successful political career.

Count Gyula Andrássy&#x27;s granddaughter, Klára, married the Hungarian nobleman and industrialist Prince Károly Odescalchi.

Many rumors suggest that Count Andrássy had a long lasting romance with Elisabeth, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, also known as Sisi, the wife of Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary. Some rumored that Sisi&#x27;s fourth child, Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, had been fathered by Andrassy. There is no evidence for this, and these rumors have all been proven to be false. The rumor may have evolved due to the devotion of both Sisi and Count Andrássy towards Hungary, its culture and national customs (she was fluent in Hungarian, and both regarded Hungarian poetry highly), and the amount of time they spent together in mutual pursuit of their dreams for Hungary. Additionally, as Marie Valerie grew up, her physical resemblance to her father Franz Josef became very marked.

Count Andrássy had four granddaughters, Klára above, Borbála, married Marquis Pallavicini, Katalin married Count Mihály Károlyi and Ilona war widow of Prince Pál Esterházy, remarried Count József Cziráky.

<doc id="16003" wikidata="Q75778" url="?curid=16003" title="Joseph Weizenbaum">
<text>Joseph Weizenbaum (8 January 1923 – 5 March 2008) was a German American computer scientist and a professor at MIT. The Weizenbaum Award and the Weizenbaum Institute are named after him.

==Life and career==
Born in Berlin, Germany to Jewish parents, he escaped Nazi Germany in January 1936, immigrating with his family to the United States. He started studying mathematics in 1941 at Wayne State University, in Detroit, Michigan. In 1942, he interrupted his studies to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps as a meteorologist, having been turned down for cryptology work because of his &quot;enemy alien&quot; status. After the war, in 1946, he returned to Wayne State, obtaining his B.S. in Mathematics in 1948, and his M.S. in 1950.

Around 1952, as a research assistant at Wayne, Weizenbaum worked on analog computers and helped create a digital computer. In 1956, he worked for General Electric on ERMA, a computer system that introduced the use of the magnetically encoded fonts imprinted on the bottom border of checks, allowing automated check processing via magnetic ink character recognition (MICR). He published a short paper in Datamation in 1962 entitled &quot;How to Make a Computer Appear Intelligent&quot; that described the strategy used in a Gomoku program that could beat novice players. 

In 1963 he took a position of associate professor at MIT on the strength of his SLIP (Symmetric List Processing) software. Within four years, he had been awarded tenure and a full professorship in computer science and engineering (in 1970). In addition to working at MIT, Weizenbaum held academic appointments at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Bremen, and other universities.

==Psychology simulation at MIT==
In 1966, he published a comparatively simple program called ELIZA, named after the ingénue in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, which could chat to the user. ELIZA was written in the SLIP programming language of Weizenbaum&#x27;s own creation. The program applied pattern matching rules to statements to figure out its replies. (Programs like this are now called chatbots.) Driven by a script named DOCTOR, it was capable of engaging humans in a conversation which bore a striking resemblance to one with an empathic psychologist. Weizenbaum modeled its conversational style after Carl Rogers, who introduced the use of open-ended questions to encourage patients to communicate more effectively with therapists. He was shocked that his program was taken seriously by many users, who would open their hearts to it. Famously, when he was observing his secretary using the software - who was aware that it was a simulation - she asked Weizenbaum: &quot;would you mind leaving the room please?&quot; Many hailed the program as a forerunner of thinking machines, a misguided interpretation that Weizenbaum&#x27;s later writing would attempt to correct.

==Apprehensions about computers and artificial intelligence==
He started to think philosophically about the implications of artificial intelligence and later became one of its leading critics. In an interview with MIT&#x27;s &quot;The Tech&quot;, Weizenbaum elaborated on his fears, expanding them beyond the realm of mere artificial intelligence, explaining that his fears for society and the future of society were largely because of the computer itself. His belief was that the computer, at its most base level, is a fundamentally conservative force and that despite being a technological innovation, it would end up hindering social progress. Weizenbaum used his experience working with Bank of America as justification for his reasoning, saying that the computer allowed banks to deal with an ever-expanding number of checks in play that otherwise would have forced drastic changes to banking organization such as decentralization. As such, although the computer allowed the industry to become more efficient, it prevented a fundamental re-haul of the system.

Weizenbaum also worried about the negative effects computers would have with regards to the military, calling the computer &quot;a child of the military.&quot; 

== Position on the military ==
When asked about his belief that a computer science professional would more often than not end up working with defense, Weizenbaum detailed his position on the effect of rhetoric, specifically euphemism, on public viewpoints. He believed that the terms &quot;the military&quot; and &quot;defense&quot; did not accurately represent the organizations and their actions. He made it clear that he did not think of himself as a pacifist, believing that there are certainly times where arms are necessary, but by referring to defense as killings and bombings, humanity as a whole would be less inclined to embrace violent reactions so quickly.

==Difference between deciding and choosing==
His influential 1976 book &quot;Computer Power and Human Reason&quot; displays his ambivalence towards computer technology and lays out his case: the possibility of programming computers to perform one task or another that humans also perform (i.e., whether Artificial Intelligence is achievable or not) is irrelevant to the question of whether computers can be put to a given task. Instead, Weizenbaum asserts that the definition of tasks and the selection of criteria for their completion is a creative act that relies on human values, which cannot come from computers. Weizenbaum makes the crucial distinction between deciding and choosing. Deciding is a computational activity, something that can ultimately be programmed. Choice, however, is the product of judgement, not calculation. In deploying computers to make decisions that humans once made, the agent doing so has made a choice based on their values that will have particular, non-neutral consequences for the subjects who will experience the outcomes of the computerized decisions that the agent has instituted.

==Personal life==
As of 1987, Weizenbaum had five children: one son from his first marriage and four daughters from his second.

In 1996, Weizenbaum moved to Berlin and lived in the vicinity of his childhood neighborhood.

Weizenbaum was buried at the Weißensee Jewish cemetery in Berlin. A memorial service was held in Berlin on 18 March 2008.

== Legacy ==
A German documentary film on Weizenbaum, &quot;Weizenbaum. Rebel at Work.&quot;, was released in 2007 and later dubbed in English. The documentary film &quot;Plug &amp; Pray&quot; on Weizenbaum and the ethics of artificial intelligence was released in 2010.

The interdisciplinary German Internet Institute (Weizenbaum Institute for the Networked Society) was named after Joseph Weizenbaum.

<doc id="16005" wikidata="Q44248" url="?curid=16005" title="Jerome">
<text>Jerome (; ; ; – 30 September 420), also known as Jerome of Stridon, was an early Christian priest, confessor, theologian, translator, and historian; he is commonly known as Saint Jerome.

He is best known for his translation of the Bible into Latin (the translation that became known as the Vulgate) and his commentaries on the whole Bible. Jerome attempted to create a translation of the Old Testament based on a Hebrew version, rather than the Septuagint, as prior Latin Bible translations had done. His list of writings is extensive. In addition to his biblical works, he wrote polemical and historical essays, always from a theologian&#x27;s perspective.

Jerome was known for his teachings on Christian moral life, especially those in cosmopolitan centers such as Rome. He often focused on women&#x27;s lives and identified how a woman devoted to Jesus should live her life. This focus stemmed from his close patron relationships with several prominent female ascetics who were members of affluent senatorial families.

In addition, his works are a crucial source of information on the pronunciation of the Hebrew language in Byzantine Palestine.

Due to his work, Jerome is recognized as a saint and Doctor of the Church by the Catholic Church, and as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Anglican Communion. His feast day is 30 September (Gregorian calendar).

== Early life ==
Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus was born at Stridon around 342–347 AD. He was of Illyrian ancestry. He was not baptized until about 360–369 in Rome, where he had gone with his friend Bonosus of Sardica to pursue rhetorical and philosophical studies. (This Bonosus may or may not have been the same Bonosus whom Jerome identifies as his friend who went to live as a hermit on an island in the Adriatic.) Jerome studied under the philologist Aelius Donatus. There he learned Latin and at least some Koine Greek, though he probably did not yet acquire the familiarity with Greek literature that he later claimed to have acquired as a schoolboy.

As a student, Jerome engaged in the superficial escapades and sexual experimentation of students in Rome; he indulged himself quite casually but he suffered terrible bouts of guilt afterwards. To appease his conscience, on Sundays he visited the sepulchers of the martyrs and the Apostles in the catacombs. This experience reminded him of the terrors of Hell:

Often I would find myself entering those crypts, deep dug in the earth, with their walls on either side lined with the bodies of the dead, where everything was so dark that almost it seemed as though the Psalmist&#x27;s words were fulfilled, Let them go down quick into Hell. Here and there the light, not entering in through windows, but filtering down from above through shafts, relieved the horror of the darkness. But again, as soon as you found yourself cautiously moving forward, the black night closed around and there came to my mind the line of Virgil, &quot;Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent&quot;.

The quotation from Virgil reads, in translation, &quot;On all sides round, horror spread wide; the very silence breathed a terror on my soul&quot;.

=== Conversion to Christianity ===

Although at first afraid of Christianity, he eventually converted.
Seized with a desire for a life of ascetic penance, Jerome went for a time to the desert of Chalcis, to the southeast of Antioch, known as the &quot;Syrian Thebaid&quot; from the number of eremites (hermits) inhabiting it. During this period, he seems to have found time for studying and writing. He made his first attempt to learn Hebrew under the guidance of a converted Jew; and he seems to have been in correspondence with Jewish Christians in Antioch. Around this time he had copied for himself a Hebrew Gospel, of which fragments are preserved in his notes. It is known today as the Gospel of the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes considered to be the true Gospel of Matthew. Jerome translated parts of this Hebrew Gospel into Greek.

=== Ministry in Rome ===
As protégé of Pope Damasus I, Jerome was given duties in Rome, and he undertook a revision of the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; Gospels based on Greek manuscripts. He also updated the Psalter containing the Book of Psalms then in use in Rome, based on the Septuagint.

Throughout his epistles he shows himself to be surrounded by women and united with close ties; it is estimated that 40% of his epistles were addressed to someone of the female sex and, at the time, he was criticized for it.

Even in his time, Jerome noted Porphyry&#x27;s accusation that the Christian communities were run by women and that the favor of the ladies decided who could accede to the dignity of the priesthood.

In Rome, Jerome was surrounded by a circle of well-born and well-educated women, including some from the noblest patrician families. Among these women were such as the widows Lea, Marcella, and Paula, and Paula&#x27;s daughters Blaesilla and Eustochium. The resulting inclination of these women towards the monastic life, away from the indulgent lasciviousness in Rome, and his unsparing criticism of the secular clergy of Rome, brought a growing hostility against him among the Roman clergy and their supporters. Soon after the death of his patron Pope Damasus I on 10 December 384, Jerome was forced to leave his position at Rome after an inquiry was brought up by the Roman clergy into allegations that he had an improper relationship with the widow Paula. Still, his writings were highly regarded by women who were attempting to maintain vows of becoming consecrated virgins. His letters were widely read and distributed throughout the Christian empire and it is clear through his writing that he knew these virgin women were not his only audience.

Additionally, Jerome&#x27;s condemnation of Blaesilla&#x27;s hedonistic lifestyle in Rome led her to adopt ascetic practices, but these affected her health and worsened her physical weakness to the point that she died just four months after starting to follow his instructions; much of the Roman populace was outraged that Jerome, in their view, thus caused the premature death of such a lively young woman. Additionally, his insistence to Paula that Blaesilla should not be mourned and complaints that her grief was excessive were seen as heartless, which further polarized Roman opinion against him.

==Scholarly works==
===Translation of the Bible (382–405)===
Jerome was a scholar at a time when being a scholar implied a fluency in Greek. He knew some Hebrew when he started his translation project, but moved to Jerusalem to strengthen his grip on Jewish scripture commentary. A wealthy Roman aristocrat, Paula, funded Jerome&#x27;s stay in a monastery in the nearby city of Bethlehem, where he settled next to the Church of the Nativity – built half a century prior on orders of Emperor Constantine over what was reputed to be the site of the Nativity of Jesus – and he completed his translation there. He began in 382 by correcting the existing Latin-language version of the New Testament, commonly referred to as the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot;. By 390 he turned to translating the Hebrew Bible from the original Hebrew, having previously translated portions from the Septuagint which came from Alexandria. He believed that the mainstream Rabbinical Judaism had rejected the Septuagint as invalid Jewish scriptural texts because of what were ascertained as mistranslations along with its Hellenistic heretical elements. He completed this work by 405. Prior to Jerome&#x27;s Vulgate, all Latin translations of the Old Testament were based on the Septuagint, not the Hebrew. Jerome&#x27;s decision to use a Hebrew text instead of the previously translated Septuagint went against the advice of most other Christians, including Augustine, who thought the Septuagint inspired. Modern scholarship, however, has sometimes cast doubts on the actual quality of Jerome&#x27;s Hebrew knowledge. Many modern scholars believe that the Greek Hexapla is the main source for Jerome&#x27;s &quot;iuxta Hebraeos&quot; (i.e. &quot;close to the Hebrews&quot;, &quot;immediately following the Hebrews&quot;) translation of the Old Testament. However, detailed studies have shown that to a considerable degree Jerome was a competent Hebraist.

=== Biblical onomastica ===
Jerome also produced two :

=== Commentaries (405–420) ===
For the next 15 years, until he died, Jerome produced a number of commentaries on Scripture, often explaining his translation choices in using the original Hebrew rather than suspect translations. His patristic commentaries align closely with Jewish tradition, and he indulges in allegorical and mystical subtleties after the manner of Philo and the Alexandrian school. Unlike his contemporaries, he emphasizes the difference between the Hebrew Bible &quot;Apocrypha&quot; and the &quot;Hebraica veritas&quot; of the protocanonical books. In his Vulgate&#x27;s prologues, he describes some portions of books in the Septuagint that were not found in the Hebrew as being non-canonical (he called them &quot;apocrypha&quot;); for Baruch, he mentions by name in his &quot;Prologue to Jeremiah&quot; and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or &quot;not in the canon&quot;. His &quot;Preface to the Books of Samuel and Kings&quot; (commonly called the &quot;Helmeted Preface&quot;) includes the following statement:
This preface to the Scriptures may serve as a &quot;helmeted&quot; introduction to all the books which we turn from Hebrew into Latin, so that we may be assured that what is not found in our list must be placed amongst the Apocryphal writings. Wisdom, therefore, which generally bears the name of Solomon, and the book of Jesus, the Son of Sirach, and Judith, and Tobias, and the Shepherd are not in the canon. The first book of Maccabees I have found to be Hebrew, the second is Greek, as can be proved from the very style.

=== Historical and hagiographic writings ===
Jerome as a historian

Jerome&#x27;s most famous work of historical writing was the &quot;Chronicon&quot;, a translation, reworking, and continuation of the &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Eusebius. Written in Constantinople around 380 it became an influential text in Latin Christendom even though it is not without errors. In his other works he evoked historical events and used history as an example and source of argument. Even though Jerome engaged in historical writing, he did not consider himself bound by the rules of historians and his output in this domain has to be judged accordingly.

=== Letters ===
Jerome&#x27;s letters or epistles, both by the great variety of their subjects and by their qualities of style, form an important portion of his literary remains. Whether he is discussing problems of scholarship, or reasoning on cases of conscience, comforting the afflicted, or saying pleasant things to his friends, scourging the vices and corruptions of the time and against sexual immorality among the clergy, exhorting to the ascetic life and renunciation of the world, or debating his theological opponents, he gives a vivid picture not only of his own mind, but of the age and its peculiar characteristics. (See Plowboy trope.) Because there was no distinct line between personal documents and those meant for publication, his letters frequently contain both confidential messages and treatises meant for others besides the one to whom he was writing.

Due to the time he spent in Rome among wealthy families belonging to the Roman upper class, Jerome was frequently commissioned by women who had taken a vow of virginity to write to them in guidance of how to live their life. As a result, he spent a great deal of his life corresponding with these women about certain abstentions and lifestyle practices.

=== Theological writings ===
==== Eschatology ====

Jerome warned that those substituting fake interpretations for the actual meaning of Scripture belonged to the &quot;synagogue of the Antichrist&quot;. &quot;He that is not of Christ is of Antichrist,&quot; he wrote to Pope Damasus I. He believed that &quot;the mystery of iniquity&quot; written about by Paul in was already in action when &quot;every one chatters about his views.&quot; To Jerome, the power restraining this mystery of iniquity was the Roman Empire, but as it fell this restraining force was removed. He warned a noblewoman of Gaul:

He that letteth is taken out of the way, and yet we do not realize that Antichrist is near. Yes, Antichrist is near whom the Lord Jesus Christ &quot;shall consume with the spirit of his mouth&quot;. &quot;Woe unto them,&quot; he cries, &quot;that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days.&quot; ... Savage tribes in countless numbers have overrun all parts of Gaul. The whole country between the Alps and the Pyrenees, between the Rhine and the Ocean, has been laid waste by hordes of Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Herules, Saxons, Burgundians, Allemanni, and – alas! for the commonweal! – even Pannonians.

His &quot;Commentary on Daniel&quot; was expressly written to offset the criticisms of Porphyry, who taught that Daniel related entirely to the time of Antiochus IV Epiphanes and was written by an unknown individual living in the second century BC. Against Porphyry, Jerome identified Rome as the fourth kingdom of chapters two and seven, but his view of chapters eight and eleven was more complex. Jerome held that chapter eight describes the activity of Antiochus Epiphanes, who is understood as a &quot;type&quot; of a future antichrist; 11:24 onwards applies primarily to a future antichrist but was partially fulfilled by Antiochus. Instead, he advocated that the &quot;little horn&quot; was the Antichrist:

We should therefore concur with the traditional interpretation of all the commentators of the Christian Church, that at the end of the world, when the Roman Empire is to be destroyed, there shall be ten kings who will partition the Roman world amongst themselves. Then an insignificant eleventh king will arise, who will overcome three of the ten kings. ... After they have been slain, the seven other kings also will bow their necks to the victor.

In his &quot;Commentary on Daniel&quot;, he noted, &quot;Let us not follow the opinion of some commentators and suppose him to be either the Devil or some demon, but rather, one of the human race, in whom Satan will wholly take up his residence in bodily form.&quot; Instead of rebuilding the Jewish Temple to reign from, Jerome thought the Antichrist sat in God&#x27;s Temple inasmuch as he made &quot;himself out to be like God.&quot;

Jerome identified the four prophetic kingdoms symbolized in Daniel 2 as the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Medes and Persians, Macedon, and Rome. Jerome identified the stone cut out without hands as &quot;namely, the Lord and Savior&quot;.

Jerome refuted Porphyry&#x27;s application of the little horn of chapter seven to Antiochus. He expected that at the end of the world, Rome would be destroyed, and partitioned among ten kingdoms before the little horn appeared.

Jerome believed that Cyrus of Persia was the higher of the two horns of the Medo-Persian ram of Daniel 8:3. The he-goat is Greece smiting Persia.

==== Soteriology ====
Jerome opposed the doctrine of Pelagianism, and wrote against it three years before his death. Jerome, despite being opposed to Origen, was influenced by Origenism in his soteriology. Although he taught that the Devil and the unbelieving will be eternally punished (unlike Origen), he believed that the punishment for Christian sinners, who have once believed but sin and fall away, will be temporal in nature. Some scholars such as J.N.D Kelly have also interpreted Ambrose to have held similar views considering the judgement of Christians.

Although Augustine does not name Jerome personally, the view that all Christians would eventually be reunited to God was criticized by Augustine in his treatise &quot;on faith and works&quot;.

===Reception by later Christianity===
Jerome is the second-most voluminous writer – after Augustine of Hippo (354–430) – in ancient Latin Christianity. The Catholic Church recognizes him as the patron saint of translators, librarians, and encyclopedists.

Jerome translated many biblical texts into Latin from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. His translations formed part of the &quot;Vulgate&quot;; the &quot;Vulgate&quot; eventually superseded the preceding Latin translations of the Bible (the &quot;Vetus Latina&quot;). The Council of Trent in 1546 declared the &quot;Vulgate&quot; authoritative &quot;in public lectures, disputations, sermons, and expositions&quot;.

Jerome showed more zeal and interest in the ascetic ideal than in abstract speculation. He lived as an ascetic for 4~5 years in the Syrian desert, and later near Bethlehem for 34 years. Nevertheless, his writings show outstanding scholarship and his correspondence has great historical importance.

The Church of England honours Jerome with a commemoration on 30 September.

== In art ==
Jerome is also often depicted with a lion, in reference to the popular hagiographical belief that Jerome once tamed a lion in the wilderness by healing its paw. The source for the story may actually have been the second century Roman tale of Androcles, or confusion with the exploits of Gerasimus (Jerome in later Latin is &quot;Geronimus&quot;); it is &quot;a figment&quot; found in the thirteenth-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot; by Jacobus de Voragine. Hagiographies of Jerome talk of his having spent many years in the Syrian desert, and artists often depict him in a &quot;wilderness&quot;, which for West European painters can take the form of a wood.

From the late Middle Ages, depictions of Jerome in a wider setting became popular. He is either shown in his study, surrounded by books and the equipment of a scholar, or in a rocky desert, or in a setting that combines both aspects, with him studying a book under the shelter of a rock-face or cave mouth. His study is often shown as large and well-provided for, he is often clean-shaven and well-dressed, and a cardinal&#x27;s hat may appear. These images derive from the tradition of the evangelist portrait, though Jerome is often given the library and desk of a serious scholar. His attribute of the lion, often shown at a smaller scale, may be beside him in either setting. The subject of &quot;Jerome Penitent&quot; first appears in the later 15th century in Italy; he is usually in the desert, wearing ragged clothes, and often naked above the waist. His gaze is usually fixed on a crucifix and he may beat himself with his fist or a rock. In one of Georges de La Tour&#x27;s 17th century French versions of St. Jerome his penitence is depicted alongside his red cardinal hat.

Jerome is often depicted in connection with the &quot;vanitas&quot; motif, the reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. In the 16th century &quot;Saint Jerome in his study&quot; by Pieter Coecke van Aelst and workshop, the saint is depicted with a skull. Behind him on the wall is pinned an admonition, &quot;Cogita Mori&quot; (&quot;Think upon death&quot;). Further reminders of the &quot;vanitas&quot; motif of the passage of time and the imminence of death are the image of the Last Judgment visible in the saint&#x27;s Bible, the candle and the hourglass.

Both Agostino Carracci and Domenichino portrayed Jerome&#x27;s last communion.

Jerome is also sometimes depicted with an owl, the symbol of wisdom and scholarship. Writing materials and the trumpet of final judgment are also part of his iconography.

A four and three quarters foot tall limestone statue of Jerome was installed above the entrance of O&#x27;Shaughnessy Library on the campus of the University of St. Thomas (then College of St. Thomas) in St. Paul Minnesota in October 1950. The sculptor was Joseph Kiselewski and the stone carver was Egisto Bertozzi.

<text>JPEG ( , short for Joint Photographic Experts Group and sometimes retroactively referred to as JPEG 1) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable trade off between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with noticeable, but widely agreed to be acceptable perceptible loss in image quality. Since its introduction in 1992, JPEG has been the most widely used image compression standard in the world, and the most widely used digital image format, with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of 2015.

The Joint Photographic Experts Group created the standard in 1992. JPEG was largely responsible for the proliferation of digital images and digital photos across the Internet and later social media. JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats. JPEG/Exif is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web. These format variations are often not distinguished and are simply called JPEG.

The MIME media type for JPEG is &quot;image/jpeg&quot;, except in older Internet Explorer versions, which provide a MIME type of &quot;image/pjpeg&quot; when uploading JPEG images. JPEG files usually have a filename extension of &quot;jpg&quot; or &quot;jpeg&quot;. JPEG/JFIF supports a maximum image size of 65,535×65,535 pixels, hence up to 4 gigapixels for an aspect ratio of 1:1. In 2000, the JPEG group introduced a format intended to be a successor, JPEG 2000, but it was unable to replace the original JPEG as the dominant image standard.

==History==
===Background===
The original JPEG specification published in 1992 implements processes from various earlier research papers and patents cited by the CCITT (now ITU-T) and Joint Photographic Experts Group.

The JPEG specification cites patents from several companies. The following patents provided the basis for its arithmetic coding algorithm.
* IBM
** February 4, 1986 Kottappuram M. A. Mohiuddin and Jorma J. Rissanen Multiplication-free multi-alphabet arithmetic code
** February 27, 1990 G. Langdon, J. L. Mitchell, W. B. Pennebaker, and Jorma J. Rissanen Arithmetic coding encoder and decoder system
** June 19, 1990 W. B. Pennebaker and J. L. Mitchell Probability adaptation for arithmetic coders
* Mitsubishi Electric
** (1021672) January 21, 1989 Toshihiro Kimura, Shigenori Kino, Fumitaka Ono, Masayuki Yoshida Coding system
** (2-46275) February 26, 1990 Tomohiro Kimura, Shigenori Kino, Fumitaka Ono, and Masayuki Yoshida Coding apparatus and coding method

The JPEG specification also cites three other patents from IBM. Other companies cited as patent holders include AT&amp;T (two patents) and Canon Inc. Absent from the list is , filed by Compression Labs&#x27; Wen-Hsiung Chen and Daniel J. Klenke in October 1986. The patent describes a DCT-based image compression algorithm, and would later be a cause of controversy in 2002 (see &quot;Patent controversy&quot; below). However, the JPEG specification did cite two earlier research papers by Wen-Hsiung Chen, published in 1977 and 1984.

===JPEG standard===
&quot;JPEG&quot; stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the name of the committee that created the JPEG standard and other still picture coding standards. The &quot;Joint&quot; stood for ISO TC97 WG8 and CCITT SGVIII. Founded in 1986, the group developed the JPEG standard during the late 1980s. The group published the JPEG standard in 1992.

In 1987, ISO TC 97 became ISO/IEC JTC 1 and, in 1992, CCITT became ITU-T. Currently on the JTC1 side, JPEG is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1) – titled as &quot;Coding of still pictures&quot;. On the ITU-T side, ITU-T SG16 is the respective body. The original JPEG Group was organized in 1986, issuing the first JPEG standard in 1992, which was approved in September 1992 as ITU-T Recommendation T.81 and, in 1994, as ISO/IEC 10918-1.

The JPEG standard specifies the codec, which defines how an image is compressed into a stream of bytes and decompressed back into an image, but not the file format used to contain that stream.
The Exif and JFIF standards define the commonly used file formats for interchange of JPEG-compressed images.

JPEG standards are formally named as &quot;Information technology – Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images&quot;. ISO/IEC 10918 consists of the following parts:

Ecma International TR/98 specifies the JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF); the first edition was published in June 2009.

===Patent controversy===
In 2002, Forgent Networks asserted that it owned and would enforce patent rights on the JPEG technology, arising from a patent that had been filed on October 27, 1986, and granted on October 6, 1987: by Compression Labs&#x27; Wen-Hsiung Chen and Daniel J. Klenke. While Forgent did not own Compression Labs at the time, Chen later sold Compression Labs to Forgent, before Chen went on to work for Cisco. This led to Forgent acquiring ownership over the patent. Forgent&#x27;s 2002 announcement created a furor reminiscent of Unisys&#x27; attempts to assert its rights over the GIF image compression standard.

The JPEG committee investigated the patent claims in 2002 and were of the opinion that they were invalidated by prior art, a view shared by various experts.

Between 2002 and 2004, Forgent was able to obtain about US$105 million by licensing their patent to some 30 companies. In April 2004, Forgent sued 31 other companies to enforce further license payments. In July of the same year, a consortium of 21 large computer companies filed a countersuit, with the goal of invalidating the patent. In addition, Microsoft launched a separate lawsuit against Forgent in April 2005. In February 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to re-examine Forgent&#x27;s JPEG patent at the request of the Public Patent Foundation. On May 26, 2006, the USPTO found the patent invalid based on prior art. The USPTO also found that Forgent knew about the prior art, yet it intentionally avoided telling the Patent Office. This makes any appeal to reinstate the patent highly unlikely to succeed.

Forgent also possesses a similar patent granted by the European Patent Office in 1994, though it is unclear how enforceable it is.

As of October 27, 2006, the U.S. patent&#x27;s 20-year term appears to have expired, and in November 2006, Forgent agreed to abandon enforcement of patent claims against use of the JPEG standard.

The JPEG committee has as one of its explicit goals that their standards (in particular their baseline methods) be implementable without payment of license fees, and they have secured appropriate license rights for their JPEG 2000 standard from over 20 large organizations.

Beginning in August 2007, another company, Global Patent Holdings, LLC claimed that its patent () issued in 1993, is infringed by the downloading of JPEG images on either a website or through e-mail. If not invalidated, this patent could apply to any website that displays JPEG images. The patent was under reexamination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from 2000 to 2007; in July 2007, the Patent Office revoked all of the original claims of the patent but found that an additional claim proposed by Global Patent Holdings (claim 17) was valid. Global Patent Holdings then filed a number of lawsuits based on claim 17 of its patent.

In its first two lawsuits following the reexamination, both filed in Chicago, Illinois, Global Patent Holdings sued the Green Bay Packers, CDW, Motorola, Apple, Orbitz, Officemax, Caterpillar, Kraft and Peapod as defendants. A third lawsuit was filed on December 5, 2007, in South Florida against ADT Security Services, AutoNation, Florida Crystals Corp., HearUSA, MovieTickets.com, Ocwen Financial Corp. and Tire Kingdom, and a fourth lawsuit on January 8, 2008, in South Florida against the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club. A fifth lawsuit was filed against Global Patent Holdings in Nevada. That lawsuit was filed by Zappos.com, Inc., which was allegedly threatened by Global Patent Holdings, and sought a judicial declaration that the &#x27;341 patent is invalid and not infringed.

Global Patent Holdings had also used the &#x27;341 patent to sue or threaten outspoken critics of broad software patents, including Gregory Aharonian and the anonymous operator of a website blog known as the &quot;Patent Troll Tracker.&quot; On December 21, 2007, patent lawyer Vernon Francissen of Chicago asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reexamine the sole remaining claim of the &#x27;341 patent on the basis of new prior art.

On March 5, 2008, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office agreed to reexamine the &#x27;341 patent, finding that the new prior art raised substantial new questions regarding the patent&#x27;s validity. In light of the reexamination, the accused infringers in four of the five pending lawsuits have filed motions to suspend (stay) their cases until completion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&#x27;s review of the &#x27;341 patent. On April 23, 2008, a judge presiding over the two lawsuits in Chicago, Illinois granted the motions in those cases. On July 22, 2008, the Patent Office issued the first &quot;Office Action&quot; of the second reexamination, finding the claim invalid based on nineteen separate grounds. On Nov. 24, 2009, a Reexamination Certificate was issued cancelling all claims.

Beginning in 2011 and continuing as of early 2013, an entity known as Princeton Digital Image Corporation, based in Eastern Texas, began suing large numbers of companies for alleged infringement of . Princeton claims that the JPEG image compression standard infringes the &#x27;056 patent and has sued large numbers of websites, retailers, camera and device manufacturers and resellers. The patent was originally owned and assigned to General Electric. The patent expired in December 2007, but Princeton has sued large numbers of companies for &quot;past infringement&quot; of this patent. (Under U.S. patent laws, a patent owner can sue for &quot;past infringement&quot; up to six years before the filing of a lawsuit, so Princeton could theoretically have continued suing companies until December 2013.) As of March 2013, Princeton had suits pending in New York and Delaware against more than 55 companies. General Electric&#x27;s involvement in the suit is unknown, although court records indicate that it assigned the patent to Princeton in 2009 and retains certain rights in the patent.

==Typical use==
The JPEG compression algorithm operates at its best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and color. For web usage, where reducing the amount of data used for an image is important for responsive presentation, JPEG&#x27;s compression benefits make JPEG popular. JPEG/Exif is also the most common format saved by digital cameras.

However, JPEG is not well suited for line drawings and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. Such images are better saved in a lossless graphics format such as TIFF, GIF, PNG, or a raw image format. The JPEG standard includes a lossless coding mode, but that mode is not supported in most products.

As the typical use of JPEG is a lossy compression method, which reduces the image fidelity, it is inappropriate for exact reproduction of imaging data (such as some scientific and medical imaging applications and certain technical image processing work).

JPEG is also not well suited to files that will undergo multiple edits, as some image quality is lost each time the image is recompressed, particularly if the image is cropped or shifted, or if encoding parameters are changed – see digital generation loss for details. To prevent image information loss during sequential and repetitive editing, the first edit can be saved in a lossless format, subsequently edited in that format, then finally published as JPEG for distribution.

==JPEG compression==
JPEG uses a lossy form of compression based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to the overall picture than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit user control over the compression ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.

The compression method is usually lossy, meaning that some original image information is lost and cannot be restored, possibly affecting image quality. There is an optional lossless mode defined in the JPEG standard. However, this mode is not widely supported in products.

There is also an interlaced &quot;progressive&quot; JPEG format, in which data is compressed in multiple passes of progressively higher detail. This is ideal for large images that will be displayed while downloading over a slow connection, allowing a reasonable preview after receiving only a portion of the data. However, support for progressive JPEGs is not universal. When progressive JPEGs are received by programs that do not support them (such as versions of Internet Explorer before Windows 7) the software displays the image only after it has been completely downloaded.

There are also many medical imaging, traffic and camera applications that create and process 12-bit JPEG images both grayscale and color. 12-bit JPEG format is included in an Extended part of the JPEG specification. The libjpeg codec supports 12-bit JPEG and there even exists a high-performance version.

===Lossless editing===

Several alterations to a JPEG image can be performed losslessly (that is, without recompression and the associated quality loss) as long as the image size is a multiple of 1 MCU block (Minimum Coded Unit) (usually 16 pixels in both directions, for 4:2:0 chroma subsampling). Utilities that implement this include:
* jpegtran and its GUI, Jpegcrop.
* IrfanView using &quot;JPG Lossless Crop (PlugIn)&quot; and &quot;JPG Lossless Rotation (PlugIn)&quot;, which require installing the JPG_TRANSFORM plugin.
* FastStone Image Viewer using &quot;Lossless Crop to File&quot; and &quot;JPEG Lossless Rotate&quot;.
* XnViewMP using &quot;JPEG lossless transformations&quot;.
* ACDSee supports lossless rotation (but not lossless cropping) with its &quot;Force lossless JPEG operations&quot; option.

Blocks can be rotated in 90-degree increments, flipped in the horizontal, vertical and diagonal axes and moved about in the image. Not all blocks from the original image need to be used in the modified one.

The top and left edge of a JPEG image must lie on an 8 × 8 pixel block boundary (or 16 × 16 pixel for larger MCU sizes), but the bottom and right edge need not do so. This limits the possible lossless crop operations, and prevents flips and rotations of an image whose bottom or right edge does not lie on a block boundary for all channels (because the edge would end up on top or left, where – as aforementioned – a block boundary is obligatory).

Rotations where the image is not a multiple of 8 or 16, which value depends upon the chroma subsampling, are not lossless. Rotating such an image causes the blocks to be recomputed which results in loss of quality.

When using lossless cropping, if the bottom or right side of the crop region is not on a block boundary, then the rest of the data from the partially used blocks will still be present in the cropped file and can be recovered. It is also possible to transform between baseline and progressive formats without any loss of quality, since the only difference is the order in which the coefficients are placed in the file.

Furthermore, several JPEG images can be losslessly joined, as long as they were saved with the same quality and the edges coincide with block boundaries.

==JPEG files==
The file format known as &quot;JPEG Interchange Format&quot; (JIF) is specified in Annex B of the standard. However, this &quot;pure&quot; file format is rarely used, primarily because of the difficulty of programming encoders and decoders that fully implement all aspects of the standard and because of certain shortcomings of the standard:
* Color space definition
* Component sub-sampling registration
* Pixel aspect ratio definition.

Several additional standards have evolved to address these issues. The first of these, released in 1992, was the JPEG File Interchange Format (or JFIF), followed in recent years by Exchangeable image file format (Exif) and ICC color profiles. Both of these formats use the actual JIF byte layout, consisting of different &quot;markers&quot;, but in addition, employ one of the JIF standard&#x27;s extension points, namely the &quot;application markers&quot;: JFIF uses APP0, while Exif uses APP1. Within these segments of the file that were left for future use in the JIF standard and are not read by it, these standards add specific metadata.

Thus, in some ways, JFIF is a cut-down version of the JIF standard in that it specifies certain constraints (such as not allowing all the different encoding modes), while in other ways, it is an extension of JIF due to the added metadata. The documentation for the original JFIF standard states:

Image files that employ JPEG compression are commonly called &quot;JPEG files&quot;, and are stored in variants of the JIF image format. Most image capture devices (such as digital cameras) that output JPEG are actually creating files in the Exif format, the format that the camera industry has standardized on for metadata interchange. On the other hand, since the Exif standard does not allow color profiles, most image editing software stores JPEG in JFIF format, and includes the APP1 segment from the Exif file to include the metadata in an almost-compliant way; the JFIF standard is interpreted somewhat flexibly.

Strictly speaking, the JFIF and Exif standards are incompatible, because each specifies that its marker segment (APP0 or APP1, respectively) appear first. In practice, most JPEG files contain a JFIF marker segment that precedes the Exif header. This allows older readers to correctly handle the older format JFIF segment, while newer readers also decode the following Exif segment, being less strict about requiring it to appear first.

===JPEG filename extensions===
The most common filename extensions for files employing JPEG compression are codice_1 and codice_2, though codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5 are also used. It is also possible for JPEG data to be embedded in other file types – TIFF encoded files often embed a JPEG image as a thumbnail of the main image; and MP3 files can contain a JPEG of cover art in the ID3v2 tag.

===Color profile===
Many JPEG files embed an ICC color profile (color space). Commonly used color profiles include sRGB and Adobe RGB. Because these color spaces use a non-linear transformation, the dynamic range of an 8-bit JPEG file is about 11 stops; see gamma curve.

If the image doesn&#x27;t specify color profile information (&quot;untagged&quot;), the color space is assumed to be sRGB for the purposes of display on webpages.

==Syntax and structure==
A JPEG image consists of a sequence of &quot;segments&quot;, each beginning with a &quot;marker&quot;, each of which begins with a 0xFF byte, followed by a byte indicating what kind of marker it is. Some markers consist of just those two bytes; others are followed by two bytes (high then low), indicating the length of marker-specific payload data that follows. (The length includes the two bytes for the length, but not the two bytes for the marker.) Some markers are followed by entropy-coded data; the length of such a marker does not include the entropy-coded data. Note that consecutive 0xFF bytes are used as fill bytes for padding purposes, although this fill byte padding should only ever take place for markers immediately following entropy-coded scan data (see JPEG specification section B.1.1.2 and E.1.2 for details; specifically &quot;In all cases where markers are appended after the compressed data, optional 0xFF fill bytes may precede the marker&quot;).

Within the entropy-coded data, after any 0xFF byte, a 0x00 byte is inserted by the encoder before the next byte, so that there does not appear to be a marker where none is intended, preventing framing errors. Decoders must skip this 0x00 byte. This technique, called byte stuffing (see JPEG specification section F.1.2.3), is only applied to the entropy-coded data, not to marker payload data. Note however that entropy-coded data has a few markers of its own; specifically the Reset markers (0xD0 through 0xD7), which are used to isolate independent chunks of entropy-coded data to allow parallel decoding, and encoders are free to insert these Reset markers at regular intervals (although not all encoders do this).

There are other &quot;Start Of Frame&quot; markers that introduce other kinds of JPEG encodings.

Since several vendors might use the same APP&quot;n&quot; marker type, application-specific markers often begin with a standard or vendor name (e.g., &quot;Exif&quot; or &quot;Adobe&quot;) or some other identifying string.

At a restart marker, block-to-block predictor variables are reset, and the bitstream is synchronized to a byte boundary. Restart markers provide means for recovery after bitstream error, such as transmission over an unreliable network or file corruption. Since the runs of macroblocks between restart markers may be independently decoded, these runs may be decoded in parallel.

==JPEG codec example==
Although a JPEG file can be encoded in various ways, most commonly it is done with JFIF encoding. The encoding process consists of several steps:

# The representation of the colors in the image is converted from RGB to , consisting of one luma component (Y&#x27;), representing brightness, and two chroma components, (CB and CR), representing color. This step is sometimes skipped.
# The resolution of the chroma data is reduced, usually by a factor of 2 or 3. This reflects the fact that the eye is less sensitive to fine color details than to fine brightness details.
# The image is split into blocks of 8×8 pixels, and for each block, each of the Y, CB, and CR data undergoes the discrete cosine transform (DCT). A DCT is similar to a Fourier transform in the sense that it produces a kind of spatial frequency spectrum.
# The amplitudes of the frequency components are quantized. Human vision is much more sensitive to small variations in color or brightness over large areas than to the strength of high-frequency brightness variations. Therefore, the magnitudes of the high-frequency components are stored with a lower accuracy than the low-frequency components. The quality setting of the encoder (for example 50 or 95 on a scale of 0–100 in the Independent JPEG Group&#x27;s library) affects to what extent the resolution of each frequency component is reduced. If an excessively low quality setting is used, the high-frequency components are discarded altogether.
# The resulting data for all 8×8 blocks is further compressed with a lossless algorithm, a variant of Huffman encoding.
The decoding process reverses these steps, except the &quot;quantization&quot; because it is irreversible. In the remainder of this section, the encoding and decoding processes are described in more detail.

===Encoding===
Many of the options in the JPEG standard are not commonly used, and as mentioned above, most image software uses the simpler JFIF format when creating a JPEG file, which among other things specifies the encoding method. Here is a brief description of one of the more common methods of encoding when applied to an input that has 24 bits per pixel (eight each of red, green, and blue). This particular option is a lossy data compression method. They are represented in matrices below.

====Color space transformation====
First, the image should be converted from RGB (by default sRGB, but other color spaces are possible) into a different color space called  (or, informally, YCbCr). It has three components Y&#x27;, CB and CR: the Y&#x27; component represents the brightness of a pixel, and the CB and CR components represent the chrominance (split into blue and red components). This is basically the same color space as used by digital color television as well as digital video including video DVDs. The color space conversion allows greater compression without a significant effect on perceptual image quality (or greater perceptual image quality for the same compression). The compression is more efficient because the brightness information, which is more important to the eventual perceptual quality of the image, is confined to a single channel. This more closely corresponds to the perception of color in the human visual system. The color transformation also improves compression by statistical decorrelation.

A particular conversion to is specified in the JFIF standard, and should be performed for the resulting JPEG file to have maximum compatibility. However, some JPEG implementations in &quot;highest quality&quot; mode do not apply this step and instead keep the color information in the RGB color model, where the image is stored in separate channels for red, green and blue brightness components. This results in less efficient compression, and would not likely be used when file size is especially important.

====Downsampling====
Due to the densities of color- and brightness-sensitive receptors in the human eye, humans can see considerably more fine detail in the brightness of an image (the Y&#x27; component) than in the hue and color saturation of an image (the Cb and Cr components). Using this knowledge, encoders can be designed to compress images more efficiently.

The transformation into the color model enables the next usual step, which is to reduce the spatial resolution of the Cb and Cr components (called &quot;downsampling&quot; or &quot;chroma subsampling&quot;). The ratios at which the downsampling is ordinarily done for JPEG images are 4:4:4 (no downsampling), 4:2:2 (reduction by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction), or (most commonly) 4:2:0 (reduction by a factor of 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions). For the rest of the compression process, Y&#x27;, Cb and Cr are processed separately and in a very similar manner.

====Block splitting====
After subsampling, each channel must be split into 8×8 blocks. Depending on chroma subsampling, this yields Minimum Coded Unit (MCU) blocks of size 8×8 (4:4:4 – no subsampling), 16×8 (4:2:2), or most commonly 16×16 (4:2:0). In video compression MCUs are called macroblocks.

If the data for a channel does not represent an integer number of blocks then the encoder must fill the remaining area of the incomplete blocks with some form of dummy data. Filling the edges with a fixed color (for example, black) can create ringing artifacts along the visible part of the border;
repeating the edge pixels is a common technique that reduces (but does not necessarily eliminate) such artifacts, and more sophisticated border filling techniques can also be applied.

====Discrete cosine transform====
Next, each 8×8 block of each component (Y, Cb, Cr) is converted to a frequency-domain representation, using a normalized, two-dimensional type-II discrete cosine transform (DCT), see Citation 1 in discrete cosine transform. The DCT is sometimes referred to as &quot;type-II DCT&quot; in the context of a family of transforms as in discrete cosine transform, and the corresponding inverse (IDCT) is denoted as &quot;type-III DCT&quot;.

As an example, one such 8×8 8-bit subimage might be:

:formula_1

Before computing the DCT of the 8×8 block, its values are shifted from a positive range to one centered on zero. For an 8-bit image, each entry in the original block falls in the range formula_2. The midpoint of the range (in this case, the value 128) is subtracted from each entry to produce a data range that is centered on zero, so that the modified range is formula_3. This step reduces the dynamic range requirements in the DCT processing stage that follows.

This step results in the following values:

:formula_4

The next step is to take the two-dimensional DCT, which is given by:

:formula_5

where
* formula_6 is the horizontal spatial frequency, for the integers formula_7.
* formula_8 is the vertical spatial frequency, for the integers formula_9.
* formula_10 is a normalizing scale factor to make the transformation orthonormal
* formula_11 is the pixel value at coordinates formula_12
* formula_13 is the DCT coefficient at coordinates formula_14

If we perform this transformation on our matrix above, we get the following (rounded to the nearest two digits beyond the decimal point):

:formula_15

Note the top-left corner entry with the rather large magnitude. This is the DC coefficient (also called the constant component), which defines the basic hue for the entire block. The remaining 63 coefficients are the AC coefficients (also called the alternating components). The advantage of the DCT is its tendency to aggregate most of the signal in one corner of the result, as may be seen above. The quantization step to follow accentuates this effect while simultaneously reducing the overall size of the DCT coefficients, resulting in a signal that is easy to compress efficiently in the entropy stage.

The DCT temporarily increases the bit-depth of the data, since the DCT coefficients of an 8-bit/component image take up to 11 or more bits (depending on fidelity of the DCT calculation) to store. This may force the codec to temporarily use 16-bit numbers to hold these coefficients, doubling the size of the image representation at this point; these values are typically reduced back to 8-bit values by the quantization step. The temporary increase in size at this stage is not a performance concern for most JPEG implementations, since typically only a very small part of the image is stored in full DCT form at any given time during the image encoding or decoding process.

====Quantization====
The human eye is good at seeing small differences in brightness over a relatively large area, but not so good at distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation. This allows one to greatly reduce the amount of information in the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process (other than chroma subsampling) if the DCT computation is performed with sufficiently high precision. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers, which take many fewer bits to represent.

The elements in the quantization matrix control the compression ratio, with larger values producing greater compression. A typical quantization matrix (for a quality of 50% as specified in the original JPEG Standard), is as follows:

:formula_16

The quantized DCT coefficients are computed with

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the unquantized DCT coefficients; formula_19 is the quantization matrix above; and formula_20 is the quantized DCT coefficients.

Using this quantization matrix with the DCT coefficient matrix from above results in:

:formula_21

For example, using −415 (the DC coefficient) and rounding to the nearest integer

:formula_22

Notice that most of the higher-frequency elements of the sub-block (i.e., those with an &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; spatial frequency greater than 4) are quantized into zero values.

====Entropy coding====

Entropy coding is a special form of lossless data compression. It involves arranging the image components in a &quot;zigzag&quot; order employing run-length encoding (RLE) algorithm that groups similar frequencies together, inserting length coding zeros, and then using Huffman coding on what is left.

The JPEG standard also allows, but does not require, decoders to support the use of arithmetic coding, which is mathematically superior to Huffman coding. However, this feature has rarely been used, as it was historically covered by patents requiring royalty-bearing licenses, and because it is slower to encode and decode compared to Huffman coding. Arithmetic coding typically makes files about 5–7% smaller.

The previous quantized DC coefficient is used to predict the current quantized DC coefficient. The difference between the two is encoded rather than the actual value. The encoding of the 63 quantized AC coefficients does not use such prediction differencing.

The zigzag sequence for the above quantized coefficients are shown below. (The format shown is just for ease of understanding/viewing.)

If the &quot;i&quot;-th block is represented by formula_23 and positions within each block are represented by formula_24 where formula_25 and formula_26, then any coefficient in the DCT image can be represented as formula_27. Thus, in the above scheme, the order of encoding pixels (for the -th block) is formula_28, formula_29, formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, formula_35 and so on.

This encoding mode is called baseline &quot;sequential&quot; encoding. Baseline JPEG also supports &quot;progressive&quot; encoding. While sequential encoding encodes coefficients of a single block at a time (in a zigzag manner), progressive encoding encodes similar-positioned batch of coefficients of all blocks in one go (called a &quot;scan&quot;), followed by the next batch of coefficients of all blocks, and so on. For example, if the image is divided into N 8×8 blocks formula_36, then a 3-scan progressive encoding encodes DC component, formula_28 for all blocks, i.e., for all formula_38, in first scan. This is followed by the second scan which encoding a few more components (assuming four more components, they are formula_29 to formula_32, still in a zigzag manner) coefficients of all blocks (so the sequence is: formula_41), followed by all the remained coefficients of all blocks in the last scan.

Once all similar-positioned coefficients have been encoded, the next position to be encoded is the one occurring next in the zigzag traversal as indicated in the figure above. It has been found that &quot;baseline progressive&quot; JPEG encoding usually gives better compression as compared to &quot;baseline sequential&quot; JPEG due to the ability to use different Huffman tables (see below) tailored for different frequencies on each &quot;scan&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; (which includes similar-positioned coefficients), though the difference is not too large.

In the rest of the article, it is assumed that the coefficient pattern generated is due to sequential mode.

In order to encode the above generated coefficient pattern, JPEG uses Huffman encoding. The JPEG standard provides general-purpose Huffman tables; encoders may also choose to generate Huffman tables optimized for the actual frequency distributions in images being encoded.

The process of encoding the zig-zag quantized data begins with a run-length encoding explained below, where:
* is the non-zero, quantized AC coefficient.
* &quot;RUNLENGTH&quot; is the number of zeroes that came before this non-zero AC coefficient.
* &quot;SIZE&quot; is the number of bits required to represent .
* &quot;AMPLITUDE&quot; is the bit-representation of .

The run-length encoding works by examining each non-zero AC coefficient and determining how many zeroes came before the previous AC coefficient. With this information, two symbols are created:

Both &quot;RUNLENGTH&quot; and &quot;SIZE&quot; rest on the same byte, meaning that each only contains four bits of information. The higher bits deal with the number of zeroes, while the lower bits denote the number of bits necessary to encode the value of .

This has the immediate implication of &quot;Symbol 1&quot; being only able store information regarding the first 15 zeroes preceding the non-zero AC coefficient. However, JPEG defines two special Huffman code words. One is for ending the sequence prematurely when the remaining coefficients are zero (called &quot;End-of-Block&quot; or &quot;EOB&quot;), and another when the run of zeroes goes beyond 15 before reaching a non-zero AC coefficient. In such a case where 16 zeroes are encountered before a given non-zero AC coefficient, &quot;Symbol 1&quot; is encoded &quot;specially&quot; as: (15, 0)(0).

The overall process continues until &quot;EOB&quot; denoted by (0, 0) is reached.

With this in mind, the sequence from earlier becomes:

:(0, 2)(-3);(1, 2)(-3);(0, 2)(-2);(0, 3)(-6);(0, 2)(2);(0, 3)(-4);(0, 1)(1);(0, 2)(-3);(0, 1)(1);(0, 1)(1);
:(0, 3)(5);(0, 1)(1);(0, 2)(2);(0, 1)(-1);(0, 1)(1);(0, 1)(-1);(0, 2)(2);(5, 1)(-1);(0, 1)(-1);(0, 0);

(The first value in the matrix, −26, is the DC coefficient; it is not encoded the same way. See above.)

From here, frequency calculations are made based on occurrences of the coefficients. In our example block, most of the quantized coefficients are small numbers that are not preceded immediately by a zero coefficient. These more-frequent cases will be represented by shorter code words.

===Compression ratio and artifacts===


The resulting compression ratio can be varied according to need by being more or less aggressive in the divisors used in the quantization phase. Ten to one compression usually results in an image that cannot be distinguished by eye from the original. A compression ratio of 100:1 is usually possible, but will look distinctly artifacted compared to the original. The appropriate level of compression depends on the use to which the image will be put.

Those who use the World Wide Web may be familiar with the irregularities known as compression artifacts that appear in JPEG images, which may take the form of noise around contrasting edges (especially curves and corners), or &quot;blocky&quot; images. These are due to the quantization step of the JPEG algorithm. They are especially noticeable around sharp corners between contrasting colors (text is a good example, as it contains many such corners). The analogous artifacts in MPEG video are referred to as &quot;mosquito noise,&quot; as the resulting &quot;edge busyness&quot; and spurious dots, which change over time, resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object.

These artifacts can be reduced by choosing a lower level of compression; they may be completely avoided by saving an image using a lossless file format, though this will result in a larger file size. The images created with ray-tracing programs have noticeable blocky shapes on the terrain. Certain low-intensity compression artifacts might be acceptable when simply viewing the images, but can be emphasized if the image is subsequently processed, usually resulting in unacceptable quality. Consider the example below, demonstrating the effect of lossy compression on an edge detection processing step.

Some programs allow the user to vary the amount by which individual blocks are compressed. Stronger compression is applied to areas of the image that show fewer artifacts. This way it is possible to manually reduce JPEG file size with less loss of quality.

Since the quantization stage &quot;always&quot; results in a loss of information, JPEG standard is always a lossy compression codec. (Information is lost both in quantizing and rounding of the floating-point numbers.) Even if the quantization matrix is a matrix of ones, information will still be lost in the rounding step.
===Decoding===
Decoding to display the image consists of doing all the above in reverse.

Taking the DCT coefficient matrix (after adding the difference of the DC coefficient back in)

:formula_42

and taking the entry-for-entry product with the quantization matrix from above results in

:formula_43

which closely resembles the original DCT coefficient matrix for the top-left portion.

The next step is to take the two-dimensional inverse DCT (a 2D type-III DCT), which is given by:

formula_44

where
* formula_45 is the pixel row, for the integers formula_46.
* formula_47 is the pixel column, for the integers formula_48.
* formula_49 is the normalizing scale factor defined earlier, for the integers formula_7.
* formula_51 is the approximated DCT coefficient at coordinates formula_14
* formula_53 is the reconstructed pixel value at coordinates formula_12

Rounding the output to integer values (since the original had integer values) results in an image with values (still shifted down by 128)

:formula_55

and adding 128 to each entry

:formula_56

This is the decompressed subimage. In general, the decompression process may produce values outside the original input range of formula_2. If this occurs, the decoder needs to clip the output values so as to keep them within that range to prevent overflow when storing the decompressed image with the original bit depth.

The decompressed subimage can be compared to the original subimage (also see images to the right) by taking the difference (original − uncompressed) results in the following error values:

:formula_58

with an average absolute error of about 5 values per pixels (i.e., formula_59).

The error is most noticeable in the bottom-left corner where the bottom-left pixel becomes darker than the pixel to its immediate right.

===Required precision===
The required implementation precision of a JPEG codec is implicitly defined through the requirements formulated for compliance to the JPEG standard. These requirements are specified in ITU.T Recommendation T.83 | ISO/IEC 10918-2. Unlike MPEG standards and many later JPEG standards, the above document defines both required implementation precisions for the encoding and the decoding process of a JPEG codec by means of a maximal tolerable error of the forwards and inverse DCT in the DCT domain as determined by reference test streams. For example, the output of a decoder implementation must not exceed an error of one quantization unit in the DCT domain when applied to the reference testing codestreams provided as part of the above standard. While unusual, and unlike many other and more modern standards, ITU.T T.83 | ISO/IEC 10918-2 does not formulate error bounds in the image domain.

==Effects of JPEG compression==
JPEG compression artifacts blend well into photographs with detailed non-uniform textures, allowing higher compression ratios. Notice how a higher compression ratio first affects the high-frequency textures in the upper-left corner of the image, and how the contrasting lines become more fuzzy. The very high compression ratio severely affects the quality of the image, although the overall colors and image form are still recognizable. However, the precision of colors suffer less (for a human eye) than the precision of contours (based on luminance). This justifies the fact that images should be first transformed in a color model separating the luminance from the chromatic information, before subsampling the chromatic planes (which may also use lower quality quantization) in order to preserve the precision of the luminance plane with more information bits.

===Sample photographs===

For information, the uncompressed 24-bit RGB bitmap image below (73,242 pixels) would require 219,726 bytes (excluding all other information headers). The filesizes indicated below include the internal JPEG information headers and some metadata. For highest quality images (Q=100), about 8.25 bits per color pixel is required. On grayscale images, a minimum of 6.5 bits per pixel is enough (a comparable Q=100 quality color information requires about 25% more encoded bits). The highest quality image below (Q=100) is encoded at nine bits per color pixel, the medium quality image (Q=25) uses one bit per color pixel. For most applications, the quality factor should not go below 0.75 bit per pixel (Q=12.5), as demonstrated by the low quality image. The image at lowest quality uses only 0.13 bit per pixel, and displays very poor color. This is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaled-down size. A method for creating better quantization matrices for a given image quality using PSNR instead of the Q factor is described in Minguillón &amp; Pujol (2001).

The medium quality photo uses only 4.3% of the storage space required for the uncompressed image, but has little noticeable loss of detail or visible artifacts. However, once a certain threshold of compression is passed, compressed images show increasingly visible defects. See the article on rate–distortion theory for a mathematical explanation of this threshold effect. A particular limitation of JPEG in this regard is its non-overlapped 8×8 block transform structure. More modern designs such as JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR exhibit a more graceful degradation of quality as the bit usage decreases – by using transforms with a larger spatial extent for the lower frequency coefficients and by using overlapping transform basis functions.

==Lossless further compression==
From 2004 to 2008, new research emerged on ways to further compress the data contained in JPEG images without modifying the represented image. This has applications in scenarios where the original image is only available in JPEG format, and its size needs to be reduced for archiving or transmission. Standard general-purpose compression tools cannot significantly compress JPEG files.

Typically, such schemes take advantage of improvements to the naive scheme for coding DCT coefficients, which fails to take into account:
* Correlations between magnitudes of adjacent coefficients in the same block;
* Correlations between magnitudes of the same coefficient in adjacent blocks;
* Correlations between magnitudes of the same coefficient/block in different channels;
* The DC coefficients when taken together resemble a downscale version of the original image multiplied by a scaling factor. Well-known schemes for lossless coding of continuous-tone images can be applied, achieving somewhat better compression than the Huffman coded DPCM used in JPEG.

Some standard but rarely used options already exist in JPEG to improve the efficiency of coding DCT coefficients: the arithmetic coding option, and the progressive coding option (which produces lower bitrates because values for each coefficient are coded independently, and each coefficient has a significantly different distribution). Modern methods have improved on these techniques by reordering coefficients to group coefficients of larger magnitude together; using adjacent coefficients and blocks to predict new coefficient values; dividing blocks or coefficients up among a small number of independently coded models based on their statistics and adjacent values; and most recently, by decoding blocks, predicting subsequent blocks in the spatial domain, and then encoding these to generate predictions for DCT coefficients.

Typically, such methods can compress existing JPEG files between 15 and 25 percent, and for JPEGs compressed at low-quality settings, can produce improvements of up to 65%.

A freely available tool called packJPG is based on the 2007 paper &quot;Improved Redundancy Reduction for JPEG Files.&quot; As of version 2.5k of 2016, it reports a typical 20% reduction by transcoding. JPEG XL (ISO/IEC 18181) of 2018 reports a similar reduction in its transcoding.

==Derived formats for stereoscopic 3D==

===JPEG Stereoscopic===

JPS is a stereoscopic JPEG image used for creating 3D effects from 2D images. It contains two static images, one for the left eye and one for the right eye; encoded as two side-by-side images in a single JPG file.
JPEG Stereoscopic (JPS, extension .jps) is a JPEG-based format for stereoscopic images. It has a range of configurations stored in the JPEG APP3 marker field, but usually contains one image of double width, representing two images of identical size in cross-eyed (i.e. left frame on the right half of the image and vice versa) side-by-side arrangement. This file format can be viewed as a JPEG without any special software, or can be processed for rendering in other modes.

===JPEG Multi-Picture Format===
JPEG Multi-Picture Format (MPO, extension .mpo) is a JPEG-based format for storing multiple images in a single file. It contains two or more JPEG files concatenated together. It also defines a JPEG APP2 marker segment for image description. Various devices use it to store 3D images, such as Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W1, HTC Evo 3D, JVC GY-HMZ1U AVCHD/MVC extension camcorder, Nintendo 3DS, Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ20, DMC-TZ30, DMC-TZ60, DMC-TS4 (FT4), and Sony DSC-HX7V. Other devices use it to store &quot;preview images&quot; that can be displayed on a TV.

In the last few years, due to the growing use of stereoscopic images, much effort has been spent by the scientific community to develop algorithms for stereoscopic image compression.

==Implementations==
A very important implementation of a JPEG codec is the free programming library libjpeg of the Independent JPEG Group. It was first published in 1991 and was key for the success of the standard. This library was used in countless applications. The development went quiet in 1998; when libjpeg resurfaced with the 2009 version 7, it broke ABI compatibility with previous versions. Version 8 of 2010 introduced non-standard extensions, a decision criticized by the original IJG leader Tom Lane.

libjpeg-turbo, forked from the 1998 libjpeg 6b, improves on libjpeg with SIMD optimizations. Originally seen as a maintained fork of libjpeg, it has become more popular after the incompatible changes of 2009. In 2019, it became the ITU|ISO/IEC reference implementation as ISO/IEC 10918-7 and ITU-T T.873.

ISO/IEC Joint Photography Experts Group maintains the other reference software implementation under the JPEG XT heading. It can encode both base JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1 and 18477–1) and JPEG XT extensions (ISO/IEC 18477 Parts 2 and 6–9), as well as JPEG-LS (ISO/IEC 14495). In 2016, &quot;JPEG on steroids&quot; was introduced as an option for the ISO JPEG XT reference implementation.

There is persistent interest in encoding JPEG in unconventional ways that maximize image quality for a given file size. In 2014, Mozilla created MozJPEG from libjpeg-turbo, a slower but higher-quality encoder intended for web images. In March 2017, Google released the open source project Guetzli, which trades off a much longer encoding time for smaller file size (similar to what Zopfli does for PNG and other lossless data formats).

In April 2024, Google introduced Jpegli, a new JPEG coding library that offers enhanced capabilities and a 35% compression ratio improvement at high quality compression settings, while the coding speed is comparable with MozJPEG.

== Successors ==
The Joint Photographic Experts Group has developed several newer standards meant to complement or replace the functionality of the original JPEG format.

=== JPEG LS ===

Originating in 1993 and published as ISO-14495-1/ITU-T.87, JPEG LS offers a low-complexity lossless file format which was more efficient than JPEG&#x27;s original lossless implementation. It also features a lossy mode close to lossless. Its functionality is largely limited to that, and largely shares the same limitations of the original JPEG in other aspects.

=== JPEG 2000 ===

JPEG 2000 was published as ISO/IEC 15444 in December 2000. It is based on a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and was designed to completely replace the original JPEG standard and exceed it in every way. It allows up to 38 bits per colour channel and 16384 channels, more than any other format, with a multitude of colour spaces, and thus high dynamic range (HDR). Furthermore, it supports alpha transparency coding, billions-by-billions pixel images, which is also more than any other format, and lossless compression. It has significantly improved lossy compression ratio with significantly less visible artefacts at strong compression levels.

=== JPEG XT ===
JPEG XT (ISO/IEC 18477) was published in June 2015; it extends base JPEG format with support for higher integer bit depths (up to 16 bit), high dynamic range imaging and floating-point coding, lossless coding, and alpha channel coding. Extensions are backward compatible with the base JPEG/JFIF file format and 8-bit lossy compressed image. JPEG XT uses an extensible file format based on JFIF. Extension layers are used to modify the JPEG 8-bit base layer and restore the high-resolution image. Existing software is forward compatible and can read the JPEG XT binary stream, though it would only decode the base 8-bit layer.

=== JPEG XL ===

JPEG XL (ISO/IEC 18181) was published in 2021–2022. It replaces the JPEG format with a new DCT-based royalty-free format and allows efficient transcoding as a storage option for traditional JPEG images. The new format is designed to exceed the still image compression performance shown by HEIF HM, Daala and WebP. It supports billion-by-billion pixel images, up to 32-bit-per-component high dynamic range with the appropriate transfer functions (PQ and HLG), patch encoding of synthetic images such as bitmap fonts and gradients, animated images, alpha channel coding, and a choice of RGB/YCbCr/ICtCp color encoding.

<doc id="16010" wikidata="Q345978" url="?curid=16010" title="Joseph Severn">
<text>Joseph Severn (7 December 1793 – 3 August 1879) was an English portrait and subject painter and a personal friend of the English poet John Keats. He exhibited portraits, Italian genre, literary and biblical subjects, and a selection of his paintings can today be found in some of the most important museums in London, including the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tate Britain.

== Background ==

The eldest son of a music teacher, Severn was born in Hoxton, near London, and apprenticed at the age of 14 to William Bond, an engraver. Severn was one of seven children; two of his brothers, Thomas (1801–1881) and Charles (1806–1894), became professional musicians, and Severn himself was an adroit pianist. During his early years he practised portraiture as a miniaturist.

== Early years in London 1815-1820==
In 1815, he was admitted to the Royal Academy Schools in London and exhibited his first work in oil, &quot;Hermia and Helena&quot;, a subject from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, along with a portrait miniature, &quot;J. Keats, Esq&quot;, in the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1819. He probably first met the poet John Keats in the spring of 1816.

In 1819, Severn was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Academy for his painting &quot;Una and the Red Cross Knight in the Cave of Despair&quot; which was inspired by the epic poem The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser. It was the first time the prize had been awarded in eight years, and the painting was exhibited at the Academy in 1820. This award also allowed Severn to apply for a three years&#x27; travelling studentship, paid for by the Royal Academy. The painting was purchased by Lord Houghton, the first biographer of Keats; although it was recorded as sold by Christie&#x27;s in June 1963, it has since disappeared from public view and there are no reproductions of it in the public domain.

According to a new edition of Severn&#x27;s letters and memoirs, Severn fathered an illegitimate child named Henry (b. 31 Aug 1819) about a year before leaving England for Italy. In 1826 there were plans for father and son to reunite, but Henry died, aged 11, before he could make the journey to Rome.

== Journey to Italy with John Keats, 1820–1821==
 On 17 September 1820, Severn set sail aboard the &quot;Maria Crowther&quot; from England to Italy with the English poet John Keats. Keats and Severn had known one another in England, but they were only passing acquaintances. Yet it was Severn who agreed to accompany the poet to Rome when all others could, or would, not. The trip was intended to cure Keats&#x27;s lingering illness, which he suspected was tuberculosis; however, his friends and several doctors disagreed and urged him to spend some time in a warm climate. After a harrowing voyage, they arrived in the Bay of Naples on 21 October, only to be placed in quarantine for ten days. The two men remained in Naples for a week before travelling to Rome in a small carriage, where they arrived mid-November 1820 and met Keats&#x27;s physician, Dr. James Clark. In Rome they lived in an apartment at number 26 Piazza di Spagna, just at the bottom right of the Spanish Steps and overlooking Bernini&#x27;s Barcaccia fountain.

Severn had left England against his father&#x27;s wishes and with little money. In fact, his father was so incensed by his departure that, as Severn reported in a late memoir, &quot;in his insane rage he struck me a blow which fell me to the ground.&quot; He was never to see his father again. While in Rome during the winter of 1820-21, Severn wrote numerous letters about Keats to their mutual friends in England, in particular William Haslam and Charles Armitage Brown, who then shared them with other members of the Keats circle, including the poet&#x27;s fiancée, Fanny Brawne. These journal-letters now represent the only surviving account of the poet&#x27;s final months and as a consequence are used as the primary historical source for biographers of Keats&#x27; last days.
Severn nursed Keats until his death on 23 February 1821, three months after they had arrived in Rome. As he reported to John Taylor two weeks afterwards, &quot;Each day he would look up in the doctors face to discover how long he should live -- he would say -- &quot;how long will this posthumous life of mine last&quot;—that look was more than we could ever bear—the extreme brightness of his eyes—with his poor pallid face—were not earthly --&quot; Severn&#x27;s ordeal was recognised by Keats himself, who, a month before his death, said, &quot;Severn I can see under your quiet look -- immense twisting and contending -- you dont know what you are reading -- you are induring for me more than I&#x27;d have you -- O! that my last hour was come --&quot; He was later thanked for his devotion by the poet Percy B. Shelley in the preface to his elegy, Adonais, which was written for Keats in 1821. It was also at this time that Severn met, among other notables, the sculptors John Gibson and Antonio Canova, and Lord Byron&#x27;s friend, the adventurer Edward John Trelawny. Severn made a sketch of Trelawny in 1838.

== Life and work after the death of Keats ==

Until recently, it was believed that Severn&#x27;s life culminated in his association with Keats and that he lived on this fame for the rest of his long life. In reality, Severn launched his own successful artistic career soon after Keats died, becoming a versatile painter in Rome during the 1820s and 1830s. He painted miniatures and altarpieces, landscapes and frescoes, historical and religious scenes, and subjects from the Bible, Greek mythology and Shakespeare. His pictures of Italian peasant life and pastoral genre scenes became very popular with British visitors on the continent and attracted many commissions for his work.

Severn was also instrumental in helping to found the British Academy of Arts in Rome, which drew the support of such influential figures as the Duke of Devonshire, John Flaxman and Sir Thomas Lawrence. Severn&#x27;s spacious apartment in the Via di San Isidoro became the busy centre of Academy life. Among those who joined the academy were Charles Eastlake, Richard Westmacott (the younger), William Bewick and Thomas Uwins. Perhaps the most dedicated patron of Severn&#x27;s work in the 1830s was William Gladstone, who was drawn to Severn more for his reputation as a painter than as Keats&#x27;s friend.

On his return to England in 1841 Severn fell on hard times, trying desperately to earn enough money to support his growing family by painting portraits. Although he was never able to match his early artistic success in Rome and eventually had to flee his creditors for the Isle of Jersey in 1853, between 1819 and 1857, Severn exhibited 53 paintings at the Royal Academy in London.

In 1861, Severn was appointed British Consul in Rome during the ferment over Italian unification. A few months before his arrival Garibaldi had seized the Kingdom of Naples, and all of Southern Italy and Sicily had been annexed to the new Kingdom of Italy. Many of the kingdoms, principalities and dukedoms in the Italian peninsula had come together under the leadership of Victor Emmanuel II, but Rome and its surroundings remained as the rump of the Papal States. This was the case throughout the majority of Severn&#x27;s tenure as Consul, as Pope Pius IX managed to retain a fragile hold on power, relying on a garrison of French troops to control Rome. Although the official position of the British government on &quot;The Roman Question&quot; was neutrality and nonintervention, Severn often took diplomatic action that his superiors viewed as exceeding his mandate as Consul. On several occasions, such as when he used his office to liberate Italian political prisoners in 1864, he was rebuked by the Foreign Office. His knowledge of the Italian language and his affability and good humour, however, often helped in mediating between the papal regime and the British government. He welcomed British visitors to Rome, such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Robert Browning, telling them about the time he nursed Keats, and he was able on many occasions to offer advice and protection for British visitors who found themselves in awkward scrapes. He eventually retired as Consul in 1872.
== Marriage and family ==

In 1828 Severn married Elizabeth Montgomerie, the natural (i.e. illegitimate) daughter of Archibald, Lord Montgomerie (1773–1814) and the ward of the Countess of Westmoreland, one of the artist&#x27;s patrons in Rome. Together they had seven children, three of whom became noteworthy artists: Walter and Arthur Severn, and Ann Mary Newton, who married the archeologist and Keeper of Antiquities at the British Museum, Charles Thomas Newton. Mary had a successful painting career in England, supporting the family for a time, and executing a number of portraits of the Royal Family. Her early death from measles at the age of 32 affected Severn. In 1871, Arthur Severn married Joan Ruskin Agnew, a cousin of the Victorian art and social critic John Ruskin. The Severns had another child, Arthur, who died as an infant in a crib accident. He is buried between Keats and Severn in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.

== Death ==
Severn died on 3 August 1879 at the age of 85, and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery alongside John Keats. Both gravestones are still standing today. Shelley and Trelawny are also buried side by side in the same cemetery.

== Paintings ==

Severn is best known for his many portraits of Keats, the most famous being the miniature portrait in The Fitzwilliam Museum (1819), the pen-and-ink sketch, &quot;Keats on his Deathbed&quot; (1821), in the Keats-Shelley house, Rome, and the oil painting of the poet reading, &quot;John Keats at Wentworth Place&quot; (1821–23), in the National Portrait Gallery. A later painting, &quot;Keats, at Hampstead, when he first imagined his Ode to a Nightingale&quot; (1849), now at Keats House, is also notable. In the 1860s Severn produced a number of copies and memory portraits as Keats&#x27; reputation continued to grow. The most influential of Severn&#x27;s early Italian genre paintings are &quot;The Vintage&quot;, commissioned by the Duke of Bedford in 1825, and &quot;The Fountain&quot; (Royal Palace, Brussels) commissioned by Leopold I of Belgium in 1826. The latter picture probably influenced J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s major work, &quot;View of Orvieto&quot;. One of his most remarkably inventive works is the &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; (1839), based on Samuel Coleridge&#x27;s famous poem, which recently sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for £32,400. Another historical subject, &quot;The Abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots&quot;, sold for £115,250 at Sotheby&#x27;s Gleneagles sale on 26 August 2008.

Severn also painted such works as &quot;Cordelia Watching by the Bed of Lear&quot;, &quot;Shepherds in the Campagna&quot;, &quot;Shelley Composing Prometheus Unbound&quot;, &quot;Isabella and the Pot of Basil&quot;, &quot;Portia with the Casket&quot;, &quot;Ariel&quot;, &quot;Rienzi&quot;, &quot;The Infant of the Apocalypse Saved from the Dragon&quot;, a large altarpiece for the church of San Paolo fuori le Mura at Rome, and many portraits of statesman and aristocrats, including Baron Bunsen and William Gladstone. The last picture he exhibited at the Royal Academy was a scene from Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; in 1857.

== Biographies and books ==

In 1892 the first significant collection of Severn&#x27;s papers was published by William Sharp in &quot;The Life and Letters of Joseph Severn&quot;. Modern critics have cast doubt on the accuracy of Sharp&#x27;s transcriptions and noted important omissions and embellishments.

In 1965, Sheila Birkenhead published &quot;Illustrious Friends: The story of Joseph Severn and his son Arthur&quot;.

In 2005, Grant F. Scott published &quot;Joseph Severn: Letters and Memoirs&quot; in which he re-edited the original material, added hundreds of newly discovered letters, included numerous reproductions of Severn&#x27;s paintings, and prefaced this material with a critical introduction and commentary.

In 2009, Sue Brown published the biography &quot;Joseph Severn, A Life: The Rewards of Friendship&quot; using Scott&#x27;s new information to provide a reassessment of Severn&#x27;s character, his friendship with Keats, and his own subsequent artistic and diplomatic career.

<text>Jetsprint or sprint boat racing is a form of motorboat racing in which jetboats, with a crew of two, race individually against the clock through a twisting series of channels in less than a metre of water.

Tracks are typically designed for spectators, and racing is fast and loud, with boat motors usually powered by V8s developing well over 500 hp.

==History==
Jetsprinting as an organised sport originated in New Zealand in 1981 by Pat Quinn and his wife, Margaret. Margaret spectated jet boat Marathons which Pat competed in, but wanted to see more of the race, suggesting a smaller, more condensed track. Events were originally held in the same natural braided rivers that had inspired Sir William Hamilton to develop the jetboat, but when the sport was introduced to Australia in the mid-1980s, permanent artificial courses were used—and this is now the norm even in New Zealand.
There is now a world championship under the auspices of the Union Internationale Motonautique, with hosting rotating between New Zealand, Australia and the U.S.A.

==Format==
The race itself consists of a predefined course through the channels with 25 to 30 changes of direction. These races generally take just 45–60 seconds. Once qualifying is completed, the competitors each run the course with the fastest qualifiers running last. The fastest 16 (typically depending on the number of competitions) proceed to the next round. This is then reduced to the top 12, Top 8 then the top 5 and finally the fastest three.

===Boats===
A jetsprint hull is typically short - just 3.8 to 4.0 metres (12½ to 13 feet) long. The hull&#x27;s vee is usually 23 to 25 degrees with several strakes on each side. A short hull is preferred, as a longer hull takes more distance to turn and usually must be turned at a slower speed. The strakes provide &quot;traction&#x27; by stopping the boat from sliding sideways across the water when turning at high speed.

A rollcage must be fitted to the boat.

===Crew===
A crew consists of the driver and a navigator, whose responsibility is to guide the driver through the course - typically via simple hand signals, pointing the hand in the direction that the boat must go at the next intersection.

==Classes==
There are two internationally recognised classes

Group A - engines in Group A boats are restricted to either 6.7-litre (412 cubic inch) engines with cast iron blocks and heads, or 6-litre (365 cubic inch) engines with aluminium heads. Both engines are only allowed two push-rod operated valves per cylinder. Furthermore, the engine must be normally aspirated, using a four-barrel carburetor. Fuel is 100+ octane aviation fuel. Typically these engines produce up to 650 horsepower

Super Boats - engines in the Super Boat class have no maximum size, but instead have a minimum size restriction. Normally aspirated engines must have a displacement of 6.5 litres (400 cubic inches), while forced induction (turbocharged or supercharged) engines must be at least 3.8 liters (235 cubic inches) in displacement. These engines typically are fuel injected and run methanol fuel. The small-block engines typically produce 950+ horsepower, while the big blocks can produce between 1000 and 1600 horsepower.

Nitromethane and nitrous oxide are not allowed.

<doc id="16016" wikidata="Q9232" url="?curid=16016" title="Jainism">
<text>Jainism ( ), also known as Jain Dharma, is an Indian religion. Jainism traces its spiritual ideas and history through the succession of twenty-four &quot;tirthankara&quot;s (supreme preachers of &quot;dharma&quot;), with the first in the current time cycle being Rishabhadeva, whom the tradition holds to have lived millions of years ago, the twenty-third &quot;tirthankara&quot; Parshvanatha, traditionally dated to the 9th century BCE, and the twenty-fourth &quot;tirthankara&quot; Mahavira, historically around the 6th or 5th BCE. Jainism is considered an eternal &quot;dharma&quot; with the &quot;tirthankaras&quot; guiding every time cycle of the cosmology. Central to understanding Jain philosophy is the concept of &quot;bhedavijñāna&quot;, or the clear distinction in the nature of the soul and non-soul entities. This principle underscores the innate purity and potential for liberation within every soul, distinct from the physical and mental elements that bind it to the cycle of birth and rebirth. Recognizing and internalizing this separation is essential for spiritual progress and the attainment of &quot;samyaka darśana&quot; or self realization, which marks the beginning of the aspirant&#x27;s journey towards liberation. The three main pillars of Jainism are &quot;ahiṃsā&quot; (non-violence), &quot;anekāntavāda&quot; (non-absolutism), and &quot;aparigraha&quot; (asceticism).

Jain monks take five main vows: &quot;ahiṃsā&quot; (non-violence), &quot;satya&quot; (truth), &quot;asteya&quot; (not stealing), &quot;brahmacharya&quot; (chastity), and &quot;aparigraha&quot; (non-possessiveness). These principles have affected Jain culture in many ways, such as leading to a predominantly lacto-vegetarian lifestyle. &quot;Parasparopagraho jīvānām&quot; (the function of souls is to help one another) is the faith&#x27;s motto, and the &quot;Namokar Mantra&quot; is its most common and strongest prayer.

Jainism is one of the oldest religions still practiced today. It has two major ancient sub-traditions, Digambaras and Śvētāmbaras, which hold different views on ascetic practices, gender, and the texts considered canonical. Both sub-traditions have mendicants supported by laypersons (&quot;śrāvakas&quot; and &quot;śrāvikas&quot;). The Śvētāmbara tradition in turn has two sub-traditions: Deravasi, also known as Mandirmargis, and Sthānakavasī. The religion has between four and five million followers, known as Jains or Jainas, who reside mostly in India, where they numbered around 4.5 million at the 2011 census. Outside India, some of the largest Jain communities can be found in Canada, Europe, and the United States. Japan is also home to a fast-growing community of converts. Major festivals include &quot;Paryushana&quot; and &quot;Das Lakshana&quot;, &quot;Ashtanika&quot;, &quot;Mahavir Janma Kalyanak&quot;, &quot;Akshaya Tritiya&quot;, and &quot;Dipawali&quot;.

==Beliefs and philosophy==
Jainism is transtheistic and forecasts that the universe evolves without violating the law of substance dualism, and the actual realization of this principle plays out through the phenomena of both parallelism and interactionism.

===&quot;Dravya&quot; (Ontological facts)===

&quot;Dravya&quot; means substances or entity in Sanskrit. Jains believe the universe is made up of six eternal substances: sentient beings or souls (&quot;jīva&quot;), non-sentient substance or matter (&quot;pudgala&quot;), the principle of motion (&quot;dharma&quot;), the principle of rest (&quot;adharma&quot;), space (&quot;ākāśa&quot;), and time (&quot;kāla&quot;). The last five are united as the &quot;ajiva&quot; (non-living). Jains distinguish a substance from a complex body, or thing, by declaring the former a simple indestructible element, while the latter is a compound made of one or more substances that can be destroyed.

===&quot;Tattva&quot; (Soteriological facts)===

&quot;Tattva&quot; connotes reality or truth in Jain philosophy and is the framework for salvation. According to Digambara Jains, there are seven &quot;tattvas&quot;: the sentient (&quot;jiva&quot; or living), the insentient (&quot;ajiva&quot; or non-living), the karmic influx to the soul (&quot;Āsrava&quot;, which is a mix of living and non-living), the bondage of karmic particles to the soul (&quot;Bandha&quot;), the stoppage of karmic particles (&quot;Saṃvara&quot;), the wiping away of past karmic particles (&quot;Nirjarā&quot;), and the liberation (&quot;Moksha&quot;). Śvētāmbaras add two further &quot;tattvas&quot;, namely good karma (&quot;Punya&quot;) and bad karma (&quot;Paapa&quot;). The true insight in Jain philosophy is considered as &quot;faith in the &quot;tattvas&quot;&quot;. The spiritual goal in Jainism is to reach &quot;moksha&quot; for ascetics, but for most Jain laypersons, it is to accumulate good karma that leads to better rebirth and a step closer to liberation.

===&quot;Pramana&quot; (Epistemological facts)===

Jain philosophy accepts three reliable means of knowledge (&quot;pramana&quot;). It holds that correct knowledge is based on perception (&quot;pratyaksa&quot;), inference (&quot;anumana&quot;) and testimony (&quot;sabda&quot; or the word of scriptures). These ideas are elaborated in Jain texts such as &quot;Tattvarthasūtra&quot;, &quot;Parvacanasara&quot;, &quot;Nandi&quot; and &quot;Anuyogadvarini&quot;. Some Jain texts add analogy (&quot;upamana&quot;) as the fourth reliable means, in a manner similar to epistemological theories found in other Indian religions.

In Jainism, &quot;jnāna&quot; (knowledge) is said to be of five kinds – &quot;mati jñāna&quot; (sensory knowledge), &quot;śrutu jñāna&quot; (scriptural knowledge), &quot;avadhi jñāna&quot; (clairvoyance), &quot;manah prayāya Jñāna&quot; (telepathy) and &quot;kevala jnana&quot; (omniscience). According to the Jain text &quot;Tattvartha sūtra&quot;, the first two are indirect knowledge and the remaining three are direct knowledge.

===Soul and karma===
According to Jainism, the existence of &quot;a bound and ever changing soul&quot; is a self-evident truth, an axiom which does not need to be proven. It maintains that there are numerous souls, but every one of them has three qualities (&quot;Guṇa&quot;): consciousness (&quot;chaitanya&quot;, the most important), bliss (&quot;sukha&quot;) and vibrational energy (&quot;virya&quot;).

It further claims the vibration draws karmic particles to the soul and creates bondages, but is also what adds merit or demerit to the soul. Jain texts state that souls exist as &quot;clothed with material bodies&quot;, where it entirely fills up the body. Karma, as in other Indian religions, connotes in Jainism the universal cause and effect law. However, it is envisioned as a material substance (subtle matter) that can bind to the soul, travel with the soul in bound form between rebirths, and affect the suffering and happiness experienced by the &quot;jiva&quot; in the &quot;lokas&quot;. Karma is believed to obscure and obstruct the innate nature and striving of the soul, as well as its spiritual potential in the next rebirth.

===Saṃsāra===

The conceptual framework of the Saṃsāra doctrine differs between Jainism and other Indian religions. Soul (&quot;jiva&quot;) is accepted as a truth, as in Hinduism but not Buddhism. The cycle of rebirths has a definite beginning and end in Jainism. Jain theosophy asserts that each soul passes through 8,400,000 birth-situations as they circle through &quot;Saṃsāra&quot;, going through five types of bodies: earth bodies, water bodies, fire bodies, air bodies and vegetable lives, constantly changing with all human and non-human activities from rainfall to breathing.

Harming any life form is a sin in Jainism, with negative karmic effects. Jainism states that souls begin in a primordial state, and either evolve to a higher state or regress if driven by their karma. It further clarifies that &quot;abhavya&quot; (incapable) souls can never attain &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation). It explains that the &quot;abhavya&quot; state is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act.

Souls can be good or evil in Jainism, unlike the nondualism of some forms of Hinduism and Buddhism. According to Jainism, a &quot;Siddha&quot; (liberated soul) has gone beyond &quot;Saṃsāra&quot;, is at the apex, is omniscient, and remains there eternally.

===Cosmology===
Jain texts propound that the universe consists of many eternal &quot;lokas&quot; (realms of existence). As in Buddhism and Hinduism, both time and the universe are eternal, but the universe is transient. The universe, body, matter and time are considered separate from the soul (&quot;jiva&quot;). Their interaction explains life, living, death and rebirth in Jain philosophy. The Jain cosmic universe has three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds (&quot;urdhva loka&quot;, &quot;madhya loka&quot;, and &quot;adho loka&quot;). Jainism states that &quot;Kāla&quot; (time) is without beginning and eternal; the cosmic wheel of time, &quot;kālachakra&quot;, rotates ceaselessly. In this part of the universe, it explains, there are six periods of time within two eons (&quot;ara&quot;), and in the first eon the universe generates, and in the next it degenerates.

Thus, it divides the worldly cycle of time into two half-cycles, &quot;utsarpiṇī&quot; (ascending, progressive prosperity and happiness) and &quot;avasarpiṇī&quot; (descending, increasing sorrow and immorality). It states that the world is currently in the fifth &quot;ara&quot; of &quot;avasarpiṇī&quot;, full of sorrow and religious decline, where the height of living beings shrinks. According to Jainism, after the sixth &quot;ara&quot;, the universe will be reawakened in a new cycle.

===God===
Jainism is a transtheistic religion, holding that the universe was not created, and will exist forever. It is independent, having no creator, governor, judge, or destroyer. In this, it is unlike the Abrahamic religions and the theistic strands of Hinduism, but similar to Buddhism. However, Jainism believes in the world of heavenly and hellish beings who are born, die and are reborn like earthly beings. The souls who live happily in the body of a heavenly celestial do so because of their positive karma. It is further stated that they possess a more transcendent knowledge about material things and can anticipate events in the human realms. However, once their past karmic merit is exhausted, it is explained that their souls are reborn again as humans, animals or other beings. The perfect enlightened souls &quot;with&quot; a body are called &quot;Arihants&quot; (victors) and perfect souls &quot;without&quot; a body are called &quot;Siddhas&quot; (liberated souls). Only a soul with human body can attain enlightenment and liberation. The liberated beings are the supreme beings and are worshipped by all heavenly, earthly and hellish beings who aspire to attain liberation themselves.

===Salvation, liberation===

Purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels: &quot;Samyak Darśana&quot; (Correct View), meaning faith, acceptance of the truth of soul (&quot;jīva&quot;); &quot;Samyak Gyana&quot; (Correct Knowledge), meaning undoubting knowledge of the &quot;tattvas&quot;; and &quot;Samyak Charitra&quot; (Correct Conduct), meaning behavior consistent with the Five vows. Jain texts often add &quot;samyak tapas&quot; (Correct Asceticism) as a fourth jewel, emphasizing belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation (moksha). The four jewels are called &quot;Moksha Marga&quot; (the path of liberation).

==Main principles==
===Non-violence (&quot;ahimsa&quot;)===

The principle of &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence or non-injury) is a fundamental tenet of Jainism. It holds that one must abandon all violent activity and that without such a commitment to non-violence all religious behavior is worthless. In Jain theology, it does not matter how correct or defensible the violence may be, one must not kill or harm any being, and non-violence is the highest religious duty. Jain texts such as &quot;Ācārāṅga Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Tattvarthasūtra&quot; state that one must renounce all killing of living beings, whether tiny or large, movable or immovable. Its theology teaches that one must neither kill another living being, nor cause another to kill, nor consent to any killing directly or indirectly.

Furthermore, Jainism emphasizes non-violence against all beings not only in action but also in speech and in thought. It states that instead of hate or violence against anyone, &quot;all living creatures must help each other&quot;.

Jains believe that violence negatively affects and destroys one&#x27;s soul, particularly when the violence is done with intent, hate or carelessness, or when one indirectly causes or consents to the killing of a human or non-human living being.

The doctrine exists in Hinduism and Buddhism, but is most highly developed in Jainism. The theological basis of non-violence as the highest religious duty has been interpreted by some Jain scholars not to &quot;be driven by merit from giving or compassion to other creatures, nor a duty to rescue all creatures&quot;, but resulting from &quot;continual self-discipline&quot;, a cleansing of the soul that leads to one&#x27;s own spiritual development which ultimately affects one&#x27;s salvation and release from rebirths. Jains believe that causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one&#x27;s rebirth, future well-being and causes suffering.

Late medieval Jain scholars re-examined the &quot;Ahiṃsā&quot; doctrine when faced with external threat or violence. For example, they justified violence by monks to protect nuns. According to Dundas, the Jain scholar Jinadattasuri wrote during a time of destruction of temples and persecution that &quot;anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody would not lose any spiritual merit but instead attain deliverance&quot;.

However, examples in Jain texts that condone fighting and killing under certain circumstances are relatively rare.

===Many-sided reality (&quot;anekāntavāda&quot;)===
The second main principle of Jainism is &quot;anekāntavāda&quot;, from &quot;anekānta&quot; (&quot;many-sidedness,&quot; etymologically &quot;non-oneness&quot; or &quot;not being one&quot;) and &quot;vada&quot; (&quot;doctrine&quot;). The doctrine states that truth and reality are complex and always have multiple aspects. It further states that reality can be experienced, but cannot be fully expressed with language. It suggests that human attempts to communicate are &quot;Naya&quot;, &quot;partial expression of the truth&quot;. According to it, one can experience the taste of truth, but cannot fully express that taste through language. It holds that attempts to express experience are &quot;syāt&quot;, or valid &quot;in some respect&quot;, but remain &quot;perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete&quot;. It concludes that in the same way, spiritual truths can be experienced but not fully expressed. It suggests that the great error is belief in &quot;ekānta&quot; (one-sidedness), where some relative truth is treated as absolute. The doctrine is ancient, found in Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Samaññaphala Sutta&quot;. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahāvīra&#x27;s approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a &quot;qualified yes&quot; (&quot;syāt&quot;). These texts identify &quot;anekāntavāda&quot; as a key difference from the Buddha&#x27;s teachings. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer &quot;it is&quot; or &quot;it is not&quot; to metaphysical questions. The Mahāvīra, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both &quot;it is&quot;, and &quot;it is not&quot;, qualified with &quot;perhaps&quot;, to understand Absolute Reality. The permanent being is conceptualized as &quot;jiva&quot; (soul) and &quot;ajiva&quot; (matter) within a dualistic &quot;anekāntavāda&quot; framework.

According to Paul Dundas, in contemporary times the &quot;anekāntavāda&quot; doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to &quot;promote a universal religious tolerance&quot;, and a teaching of &quot;plurality&quot; and &quot;benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions&quot;. Dundas states this is a misreading of historical texts and Mahāvīra&#x27;s teachings. According to him, the &quot;many pointedness, multiple perspective&quot; teachings of the Mahāvīra is about the nature of absolute reality and human existence. He claims that it is not about condoning activities such as killing animals for food, nor violence against disbelievers or any other living being as &quot;perhaps right&quot;. The five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no &quot;perhaps&quot; about them. Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism according to Dundas, but Jainism disagreed, in specific areas, with the knowledge systems and beliefs of these traditions, and vice versa.

===Non-attachment (&quot;aparigraha&quot;)===

The third main principle in Jainism is &quot;aparigraha&quot; which means non-attachment to worldly possessions. For monks and nuns, Jainism requires a vow of complete non-possession of any property, relations and emotions. The ascetic is a wandering mendicant in the Digambara tradition, or a resident mendicant in the Śvētāmbara tradition. For Jain laypersons, it recommends limited possession of property that has been honestly earned, and giving excess property to charity. According to Natubhai Shah, &quot;aparigraha&quot; applies to both the material and the psychic. Material possessions refer to various forms of property. Psychic possessions refer to emotions, likes and dislikes, and attachments of any form. Unchecked attachment to possessions is said to result in direct harm to one&#x27;s personality.

===Jain ethics and five vows===

Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows. These are called &quot;anuvratas&quot; (small vows) for Jain laypersons, and &quot;mahavratas&quot; (great vows) for Jain mendicants. For both, its moral precepts preface that the Jain has access to a &quot;guru&quot; (teacher, counsellor), &quot;deva&quot; (Jina, god), doctrine, and that the individual is free from five offences: doubts about the faith, indecisiveness about the truths of Jainism, insincerity of desire for Jain teachings, non-recognition of fellow Jains, and insufficient admiration of fellow Jains&#x27; spiritual endeavors. Such a person undertakes the following Five vows of Jainism:
# &quot;Ahiṃsā&quot;, &quot;intentional non-violence&quot; or &quot;noninjury&quot;: The first major vow taken by Jains is to cause no harm to other human beings, as well as all living beings (particularly animals). This is the highest ethical duty in Jainism, and it applies not only to one&#x27;s actions, but demands that one be non-violent in one&#x27;s speech and thoughts.
# &quot;Satya&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;: This vow is to always speak the truth. Neither lie, nor speak what is not true, and do not encourage others or approve anyone who speaks an untruth.
# &quot;Asteya&quot;, &quot;not stealing&quot;: A Jain layperson should not take anything that is not willingly given. Additionally, a Jain mendicant should ask for permission to take it if something is being given.
# &quot;Brahmacharya&quot;, &quot;celibacy&quot;: Abstinence from sex and sensual pleasures is prescribed for Jain monks and nuns. For laypersons, the vow means chastity, faithfulness to one&#x27;s partner.
# &quot;Aparigraha&quot;, &quot;non-possessiveness&quot;: This includes non-attachment to material and psychological possessions, avoiding craving and greed. Jain monks and nuns completely renounce property and social relations, own nothing and are attached to no one.

Jainism prescribes seven supplementary vows, including three &quot;guņa vratas&quot; (merit vows) and four &quot;śikşā vratas&quot;. The &quot;Sallekhana&quot; (or &quot;Santhara&quot;) vow is a &quot;religious death&quot; ritual observed at the end of life, historically by Jain monks and nuns, but rare in the modern age. In this vow, there is voluntary and gradual reduction of food and liquid intake to end one&#x27;s life by choice and with dispassion, This is believed to reduce negative karma that affects a soul&#x27;s future rebirths.

==Practices==
===Asceticism and monasticism===


Of the major Indian religions, Jainism has had the strongest ascetic tradition. Ascetic life may include nakedness, symbolizing non-possession even of clothes, fasting, body mortification, and penance, to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, both of which are believed essential for reaching &quot;siddha&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; (&quot;liberation from rebirths&quot; and &quot;salvation&quot;).

Jain texts like &quot;Tattvartha Sūtra&quot; and &quot;Uttaradhyayana Sūtra&quot; discuss austerities in detail. Six outer and six inner practices are oft-repeated in later Jain texts. Outer austerities include complete fasting, eating limited amounts, eating restricted items, abstaining from tasty foods, mortifying the flesh, and guarding the flesh (avoiding anything that is a source of temptation). Inner austerities include expiation, confession, respecting and assisting mendicants, studying, meditation, and ignoring bodily wants in order to abandon the body. Lists of internal and external austerities vary with the text and tradition. Asceticism is viewed as a means to control desires, and to purify the &quot;jiva&quot; (soul). The &quot;tirthankaras&quot; such as the Mahāvīra (Vardhamana) set an example by performing severe austerities for twelve years.

Monastic organization, &quot;sangh&quot;, has a four-fold order consisting of &quot;sadhu&quot; (male ascetics, &quot;muni&quot;), &quot;sadhvi&quot; (female ascetics, &quot;aryika&quot;), &quot;śrāvaka&quot; (laymen), and &quot;śrāvikā&quot; (laywomen). The latter two support the ascetics and their monastic organizations called &quot;gacch&quot; or &quot;samuday&quot;, in autonomous regional Jain congregations. Jain monastic rules have encouraged the use of mouth cover, as well as the &quot;Dandasan&quot; – a long stick with woolen threads – to gently remove ants and insects that may come in their path.

===Food and fasting===

The practice of non-violence towards all living beings has led to Jain culture being vegetarian. Devout Jains practice lacto-vegetarianism, meaning that they eat no eggs, but accept dairy products if there is no violence against animals during their production. Veganism is encouraged if there are concerns about animal welfare. Jain monks, nuns and some followers avoid root vegetables such as potatoes, onions, and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and because a bulb or tuber&#x27;s ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a higher living being. Jain monks and advanced lay people avoid eating after sunset, observing a vow of &quot;ratri-bhojana-tyaga-vrata&quot;. Monks observe a stricter vow by eating only once a day.

Jains fast particularly during festivals. This practice is called &quot;upavasa&quot;, &quot;tapasya&quot; or &quot;vrata&quot;, and may be practiced according to one&#x27;s ability. Digambaras fast for &quot;Dasa-laksana-parvan&quot;, eating only one or two meals per day, drinking only boiled water for ten days, or fasting completely on the first and last days of the festival, mimicking the practices of a Jain mendicant for the period. Śvētāmbara Jains do similarly in the eight day &quot;paryusana&quot; with &quot;samvatsari-pratikramana&quot;. The practice is believed to remove karma from one&#x27;s soul and provides merit (&quot;punya&quot;). A &quot;one day&quot; fast lasts about 36 hours, starting at sunset before the day of the fast and ending 48 minutes after sunrise the day after. Among laypeople, fasting is more commonly observed by women, as it shows their piety and religious purity, gains merit earning and helps ensure future well-being for their family. Some religious fasts are observed in a social and supportive female group. Long fasts are celebrated by friends and families with special ceremonies.

===Meditation===
Jainism considers meditation (&quot;dhyana&quot;) a necessary practice, but its goals are very different from those in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, meditation is concerned more with stopping karmic attachments and activity, not as a means to transformational insights or self-realization in other Indian religions. According to Padmanabh Jaini, &quot;Sāmāyika&quot; is a practice of &quot;brief periods in meditation&quot; in Jainism that is a part of &quot;siksavrata&quot; (ritual restraint). The goal of &quot;Sāmāyika&quot; is to achieve equanimity, and it is the second &quot;siksavrata&quot;. The &quot;samayika&quot; ritual is practiced at least three times a day by mendicants, while a layperson includes it with other ritual practices such as &quot;Puja&quot; in a Jain temple and doing charity work. According to Johnson, as well as Jaini, &quot;samayika&quot; connotes more than meditation, and for a Jain householder is the voluntary ritual practice of &quot;assuming temporary ascetic status&quot;.

===Rituals and worship===
There are many rituals in Jainism&#x27;s various sects. According to Dundas, the ritualistic lay path among Śvētāmbara Jains is &quot;heavily imbued with ascetic values&quot;, where the rituals either revere or celebrate the ascetic life of tirthankaras, or progressively approach the psychological and physical life of an ascetic. The ultimate ritual is &quot;sallekhana&quot;, a religious death through ascetic abandonment of food and drinks. The Digambara Jains follow the same theme, but the life cycle and religious rituals are closer to a Hindu liturgy. The overlap is mainly in the life cycle (rites-of-passage) rituals, and likely developed because Jain and Hindu societies overlapped, and rituals were viewed as necessary and secular.

Jains ritually worship numerous deities, especially the &quot;Jinas&quot;. In Jainism a &quot;Jina&quot; as &quot;deva&quot; is not an avatar (incarnation), but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic &quot;tirthankara&quot; achieved. Out of the 24 tirthankaras, Jains predominantly worship four: Mahāvīra, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and Rishabhanatha. Among the non-&quot;tirthankara&quot; saints, devotional worship is common for Bahubali among the Digambaras. The &quot;Panch Kalyanaka&quot; rituals remember the five life events of the &quot;tirthankaras&quot;, including the &quot;Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava&quot;, &quot;Panch Kalyanaka Puja&quot; and &quot;Snatrapuja&quot;.
The basic ritual is &quot;darsana&quot; (seeing) of &quot;deva&quot;, which includes Jina, or other yaksas, gods and goddesses such as Brahmadeva, 52 Viras, Padmavati, Ambika and 16 Vidyadevis (including Sarasvati and Lakshmi). Terapanthi Digambaras limit their ritual worship to tirthankaras. The worship ritual is called &quot;devapuja&quot;, and is found in all Jain sub-traditions. Typically, the Jain layperson enters the Derasar (Jain temple) inner sanctum in simple clothing and bare feet with a plate filled with offerings, bows down, says the namaskar, completes his or her litany and prayers, sometimes is assisted by the temple priest, leaves the offerings and then departs.

Jain practices include performing &quot;abhisheka&quot; (ceremonial bath) of the images. Some Jain sects employ a &quot;pujari&quot; (also called &quot;upadhye&quot;), who may be a Hindu, to perform priestly duties at the temple. More elaborate worship includes offerings such as rice, fresh and dry fruits, flowers, coconut, sweets, and money. Some may light up a lamp with camphor and make auspicious marks with sandalwood paste. Devotees also recite Jain texts, particularly the life stories of the tirthankaras.

Traditional Jains, like Buddhists and Hindus, believe in the efficacy of mantras and that certain sounds and words are inherently auspicious, powerful and spiritual. The most famous of the mantras, broadly accepted in various sects of Jainism, is the &quot;five homage&quot; (&quot;panca namaskara&quot;) mantra which is believed to be eternal and existent since the first tirthankara&#x27;s time. Medieval worship practices included making tantric diagrams of the &quot;Rishi-mandala&quot; including the &quot;tirthankaras&quot;. The Jain tantric traditions use mantra and rituals that are believed to accrue merit for rebirth realms.

===Festivals===
The most important annual Jain festival is called the &quot;Paryushana&quot; by Svetambaras and &quot;Dasa lakshana parva&quot; by the Digambaras. It is celebrated from the 12th day of the waning moon in the traditional lunisolar month of Bhadrapada in the Indian calendar. This typically falls in August or September of the Gregorian calendar. It lasts eight days for Svetambaras, and ten days among the Digambaras. It is a time when lay people fast and pray. The five vows are emphasized during this time. Svetambaras recite the &quot;Kalpasūtras&quot;, while Digambaras read their own texts. The festival is an occasion where Jains make active effort to stop cruelty towards other life forms, freeing animals in captivity and preventing the slaughter of animals.
The last day involves a focused prayer and meditation session known as &quot;Samvatsari&quot;. Jains consider this a day of atonement, granting forgiveness to others, seeking forgiveness from all living beings, physically or mentally asking for forgiveness and resolving to treat everyone in the world as friends. Forgiveness is asked by saying &quot;&quot;Micchami Dukkadam&quot; or &quot;Khamat khamna&quot;&quot; to others. This means, &quot;If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness.&quot; The literal meaning of &quot;Paryushana&quot; is &quot;abiding&quot; or &quot;coming together&quot;.

Mahavir Janma Kalyanak celebrates the birth of Mahāvīra. It is celebrated on the 13th day of the lunisolar month of Chaitra in the traditional Indian calendar. This typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. The festivities include visiting Jain temples, pilgrimages to shrines, reading Jain texts and processions of Mahāvīra by the community. At his legendary birthplace of Kundagrama in Bihar, north of Patna, special events are held by Jains. The next day of Dipawali is observed by Jains as the anniversary of Mahāvīra&#x27;s attainment of &quot;moksha&quot;. The Hindu festival of Diwali is also celebrated on the same date (&quot;Kartika Amavasya&quot;). Jain temples, homes, offices, and shops are decorated with lights and &quot;diyas&quot; (small oil lamps). The lights are symbolic of knowledge or removal of ignorance. Sweets are often distributed. On Diwali morning, &quot;Nirvan Ladoo&quot; is offered after praying to Mahāvīra in all Jain temples across the world. The Jain new year starts right after Diwali. Some other festivals celebrated by Jains are Akshaya Tritiya and Raksha Bandhan, similar to those in the Hindu communities.

==Traditions and sects==
The Jain community is divided into two major denominations, Digambara and Śvētāmbara. Monks of the Digambara (sky-clad) tradition do not wear clothes. Female monastics of the Digambara sect wear unstitched plain white sarees and are referred to as &quot;Aryikas&quot;. Śvētāmbara (white-clad) monastics, on the other hand, wear seamless white clothes.

According to Viśeṣāvaśyaka Bhāṣya, a 5th century CE Śvetāmbara text, they are the original followers which is corroborated by the pattavali of the Kalpa Sutra, and that Digambaras arose 609 years after the death of Mahavira (in about the 1st century CE or 82 AD) because of an arrogant man named Sivabhuti who became a Jain monk in a fit of pique after a fight at home. He is accused of starting the Digambara Jain tradition with what Śvetāmbara call as &quot;eight concealments&quot;, of rejecting Jain texts preserved by the Śvetāmbara tradition, and misunderstanding the Jain ideology including those related to nuns and clothes. The claim of them being the original followers of Jainism is further corroborated by the naked idols excavated from Kankali Tila, but consecrated by Śvetāmbara ascetics whose names match exactly with those mentioned in the pattavali of the Kalpa Sutra. According to Jinabhadra Gaṇi, Sivabhuti was the eighth heretic who is regarded as the founder of the Digambara sect. Another Śvetāmbara work, &quot;Nihnavavad,&quot; also confirms this account. A condition was enforced that since women possess clothes in the Digambara tradition, they are not fit to attain Moksha or liberation. This aligns with the current-day Digambara belief regarding women attaining salvation. Several well-known scholars such as R. G. Bhandarkar and Professor J. F. Fleet of Cambridge University agree with the Śvetāmbara account more than later Digambara accounts.

During Chandragupta Maurya&#x27;s reign, Jain tradition states that &quot;Acharya&quot; Bhadrabahu predicted a twelve-year-long famine and moved to Karnataka with his disciples. Sthulabhadra, a pupil of &quot;Acharya&quot; Bhadrabahu, is believed to have stayed in Magadha. Later, as stated in tradition, when followers of &quot;Acharya&quot; Bhadrabahu returned, they found those who had remained at Magadha had started wearing white clothes, which was unacceptable to the others who remained naked. This is how Jains believe the Digambara and Śvētāmbara schism began, with the former being naked while the latter wore white clothes. Digambara saw this as being opposed to the Jain tenet of &quot;aparigraha&quot; which, according to them, required not even possession of clothes, i.e. complete nudity. In the fifth-century CE, the Council of Valabhi was organized by Śvētāmbara, which Digambara did not attend. At the council, the Śvētāmbara adopted the texts they had preserved as canonical scriptures, which Digambara has ever since rejected. This council is believed to have solidified the historic schism between these two major traditions of Jainism. The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit &quot;Suttapahuda&quot; of Kundakunda.

The earliest mention and description of the schism is in the 5th century CE Śvetāmbara texts. Digambara texts do not mention the schism at least until the 10th century CE. Even after a much later mention of the schism, several important Digambara texts differ greatly on the narrative about the Śvetāmbara sect&#x27;s emergence. Bhadrabāhucaritra by Digambara monk Ratnanandi states that the Śvetāmbara sect emerged after the famine in Magadha. While this is one account of the schism as per the Digambara scriptures, another alternate story is described in Darśanasār, also a Digambara text authored by Digambara monk Devasena states that the Śvetāmbara sect emerged in Vallabhi in Saurashtra 136 years after the death of Vikramaditya (or 50 AD) after a monk named Jinacandra spread the narrative that women could attain omniscience and salvation. It is worth mentioning that none of the two accounts from Digambara texts are confirmed and are believed to be much later additions (at least after 10th century CE). Pattavalis of both the sects confirm that there did not exist a pupil of Bhadrabāhu who was named Jinacandra. On the contrary, such anomalies are not observed in Śvetāmbara texts which describe only one account of the schism i.e., the one about Sahasramalla or Sivabhuti.

Digambaras and Śvētāmbara differ in their practices and dress code, interpretations of teachings, and on Jain history especially concerning the &quot;tirthankaras&quot;. Their monasticism rules differ, as does their iconography. Śvētāmbara has had more female than male mendicants, where Digambara has mostly had male monks and considers males closest to the soul&#x27;s liberation. The Śvētāmbaras believe that women can also achieve liberation through asceticism and state that the 19th &quot;Tirthankara&quot; Māllīnātha was female, which Digambara rejects. Early Jain images from Mathura depict Digambara iconography until late fifth century CE where Svetambara iconography starts appearing.

Several scholars and scriptures of other religions as well as those of their counterpart Śvetāmbara Jains criticize Digambara sect&#x27;s practices of public nudity as well as their belief that women are incapable of attaining spiritual liberation.

Excavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the Kushan Empire (c.1st century CE). &quot;Tirthankara&quot; represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm, are identified as the &quot;Ardhaphalaka&quot; (half-clothed) mentioned in texts. The Yapaniyas, believed to have originated from the &quot;Ardhaphalaka&quot;, followed Digambara nudity along with several Śvētāmbara beliefs. In the modern era, according to Flügel, new Jain religious movements that are a &quot;primarily devotional form of Jainism&quot; have developed which resemble &quot;Jain Mahayana&quot; style devotionalism.

==Scriptures and texts==

Jain canonical scriptures are called &quot;Agamas&quot;. They are believed to have been verbally transmitted, much like the ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and to have originated from the sermons of the &quot;tirthankaras&quot;, whereupon the &quot;Ganadharas&quot; (chief disciples) transmitted them as &quot;Śhrut Jnāna&quot; (heard knowledge). The spoken scriptural language is believed to be &quot;Ardhamagadhi&quot; by the Śvētāmbara Jains, and a form of sonic resonance by the Digambara Jains.

The Śvētāmbaras believe that they have preserved 45 of the 50 original Jain scriptures (having lost an Anga text and four Purva texts), while the Digambaras believe that all were lost, and that Āchārya Bhutabali was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. According to them, Digambara &quot;Āchāryas&quot; recreated the oldest-known Digambara Jain texts, including the four &quot;anuyoga&quot;. The Digambara texts partially agree with older Śvētāmbara texts, but there are also gross differences between the texts of the two major Jain traditions. The Digambaras created a secondary canon between 600 and 900 CE, compiling it into four groups or &quot;Vedas&quot;: history, cosmography, philosophy and ethics.

The most popular and influential texts of Jainism have been its non-canonical literature. Of these, the &quot;Kalpa Sūtras&quot; are particularly popular among Śvētāmbaras, which they attribute to Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE). This ancient scholar is revered in the Digambara tradition, and they believe he led their migration into the ancient south Karnataka region and created their tradition. Śvētāmbaras believe instead that Bhadrabahu moved to Nepal. Both traditions consider his &quot;Niryuktis&quot; and &quot;Samhitas&quot; important. The earliest surviving Sanskrit text by Umaswati, the &quot;Tattvarthasūtra&quot; is considered authoritative by all traditions of Jainism. In the Digambara tradition, the texts written by Kundakunda are highly revered and have been historically influential, while the oldest being &quot;Kasayapahuda&quot; and &quot;Shatkhandagama&quot; attributed to Acharya pushpdanta and Bhutbali. Other important Digambara Jain texts include: &quot;Samayasara&quot;, &quot;Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra&quot;, and &quot;Niyamasara&quot;.

==Comparison with other religions==

All four Dharmic religions, viz., Jainism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism, share concepts and doctrines such as karma and rebirth. They do not believe in eternal heaven or hell or judgment day, and leave it up to individual discretion to choose whether or not to believe in gods, to disagree with core teachings, and to choose whether to participate in prayers, rituals and festivals. They all consider values such as &quot;ahimsa&quot; (non-violence) to be important, link suffering to craving, individual&#x27;s actions, intents, and karma, and believe spirituality is a means to enlightened peace, bliss and eternal liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;).

Jainism differs from both Buddhism and Hinduism in its ontological premises. All believe in impermanence, but Buddhism incorporates the premise of &quot;anatta&quot; (&quot;no eternal self or soul&quot;). Hinduism incorporates an eternal unchanging &quot;atman&quot; (&quot;soul&quot;), while Jainism incorporates an eternal but changing &quot;jiva&quot; (&quot;soul&quot;). In Jain thought, there are infinite eternal &quot;jivas&quot;, predominantly in cycles of rebirth, and a few &quot;siddhas&quot; (liberated ones). Unlike Jainism, Hindu philosophies encompass nondualism where all souls are identical as Brahman and posited as interconnected one Jainism rejected the non-dual concept, stating that if there were only one universal consciousness which was already liberated, the purpose of dharma would be nullified. Additionally, the need and desire for an infinitely blissful consciousness to create the universe would imply a limitation within that consciousness. Jainism also criticized Vedanta&#x27;s inability to explain how an intangible consciousness could create a material universe, filled with countless living beings who experience suffering. Jain scholar Dr. Hukumchand Bharill explains that, according to both Jainism and Vedanta, only consciousness can perceive itself, while the mind and body are incapable of recognizing and experiencing the soul. In Jainism, the soul, in its state of ignorance, mistakenly identifies with the body and consequently experiences suffering. When the soul realizes its true nature, it attains enlightenment, gaining infinite knowledge and bliss. If there were only a singular, universal consciousness, Bharill questions, who attains realization as the consciousness is already liberated, and the mind is incapable of experiencing soul&#x27;s boundless knowledge-bliss nature.

While both Hinduism and Jainism believe &quot;soul exists&quot; to be a self-evident truth, most Hindu systems consider it to be eternally present, infinite and constant (&quot;vibhu&quot;), but some Hindu scholars propose soul to be atomic. Hindu thought generally discusses Atman and Brahman through a monistic or dualistic framework. In contrast, Jain thought denies the Hindu metaphysical concept of Brahman, and Jain philosophy considers the soul to be ever changing and bound to the body or matter for each lifetime, thereby having a finite size that infuses the entire body of a living being.

Jainism is similar to Buddhism in not recognizing the primacy of the Vedas and the Hindu Brahman. Jainism and Hinduism, however, both believe &quot;soul exists&quot; as a self-evident truth. Jains and Hindus have frequently intermarried, particularly in northern, central and western regions of India. Some early colonial scholars stated that Jainism like Buddhism was, in part, a rejection of the Hindu caste system, but later scholars consider this a Western error. A caste system not based on birth has been a historic part of Jain society, and Jainism focused on transforming the individual, not society.

Monasticism is similar in all three traditions, with similar rules, hierarchical structure, not traveling during the four-month monsoon season, and celibacy, originating before the Buddha or the Mahāvīra. Jain and Hindu monastic communities have traditionally been more mobile and had an itinerant lifestyle, while Buddhist monks have favored belonging to a &quot;sangha&quot; (monastery) and staying in its premises. Buddhist monastic rules forbid a monk to go outside without wearing the sangha&#x27;s distinctive ruddy robe, or to use wooden bowls. In contrast, Jain monastic rules have either required nakedness (Digambara) or white clothes (Śvētāmbara), and they have disagreed on the legitimacy of the wooden or empty gourd as the begging bowl by Jain monks.

Jains have similar views with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified, and that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty. Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence; there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers. The Jain and Hindu communities have often been very close and mutually accepting. Some Hindu temples have included a Jain &quot;Tirthankara&quot; within its premises in a place of honour, while temple complexes such as the Badami cave temples and Khajuraho feature both Hindu and Jain monuments.

Fynes (1996) argues that various Jain influences, particularly ideas on the existence of plant souls, were transmitted from Western Kshatrapa territories to Mesopotamia and then integrated into Manichaean beliefs.

==Art and architecture==

Jainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jain arts depict life legends of &quot;tirthankara&quot; or other important people, particularly with them in a seated or standing meditative posture. &quot;Yakshas&quot; and &quot;yakshinis&quot;, attendant spirits who guard the &quot;tirthankara&quot;, are usually shown with them. The earliest known Jain image is in the Patna museum. It is dated approximately to the third century BCE. Bronze images of Pārśva can be seen in the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and in the Patna museum; these are dated to the second century BCE.

&quot;Ayagapata&quot; is a type of votive tablet used in Jainism for donation and worship in the early centuries. These tablets are decorated with objects and designs central to Jain worship such as the &quot;stupa&quot;, &quot;dharmacakra&quot; and &quot;triratna&quot;. They present simultaneous trends or image and symbol worship. Numerous such stone tablets were discovered during excavations at ancient Jain sites like Kankali Tila near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, India. The practice of donating these tablets is documented from first century BCE to the third century CE. &quot;Samavasarana&quot;, a preaching hall of &quot;tirthankaras&quot; with various beings concentrically placed, is an important theme of Jain art.

The Jain tower in Chittor, Rajasthan, is a good example of Jain architecture. Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology. Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as &quot;Panch Kalyanaka&quot;, from the life of the &quot;tirthankara&quot;. Rishabha, the first &quot;tirthankara&quot;, is usually depicted in either the lotus position or &quot;kayotsarga&quot;, the standing position. He is distinguished from other &quot;tirthankara&quot; by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures. In paintings, incidents from his life, like his marriage and Indra marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi. Each of the twenty-four &quot;tirthankara&quot; is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such texts as &quot;Tiloyapannati&quot;, &quot;Kahavaali&quot; and &quot;Pravacanasaarodhara&quot;.

===Temples===
A Jain temple, a &quot;Derasar&quot; or &quot;Basadi&quot;, is a place of worship. Temples contain &quot;tirthankara&quot; images, some fixed, others moveable. These are stationed in the inner sanctum, one of the two sacred zones, the other being the main hall. One of the images is marked as the &quot;moolnayak&quot; (primary deity). A &quot;manastambha&quot; (column of honor) is a pillar that is often constructed in front of Jain temples. Temple construction is considered a meritorious act.

Ancient Jain monuments include the Udaigiri Hills near Bhelsa (Vidisha) and Pataini temple in Madhya Pradesh, the Ellora in Maharashtra, the Palitana temples in Gujarat, and the Jain temples at Dilwara Temples near Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Chaumukha temple in Ranakpur is considered one of the most beautiful Jain temples and is famous for its detailed carvings. According to Jain texts, Shikharji is the place where twenty of the twenty-four Jain &quot;Tīrthaṅkaras&quot; along with many other monks attained &quot;moksha&quot; (died without being reborn, with their soul in &quot;Siddhashila&quot;). The Shikharji site in northeastern Jharkhand is therefore a revered pilgrimage site. The Palitana temples are the holiest shrine for the Śvētāmbara Murtipujaka sect. Along with Shikharji the two sites are considered the holiest of all pilgrimage sites by the Jain community. The Jain complex, Khajuraho and Jain Narayana temple are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shravanabelagola, Saavira Kambada Basadi or &quot;1000 pillars&quot; and Brahma Jinalaya are important Jain centers in Karnataka. In and around Madurai, there are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures.

The second–first century BCE Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves are rich with carvings of &quot;tirthanakars&quot; and deities with inscriptions including the Elephant Cave inscription. Jain cave temples at Badami, Mangi-Tungi and the Ellora Caves are considered important. The Sittanavasal Cave temple is a fine example of Jain art with an early cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha. Inside are seventeen stone beds with second century BCE. Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions. The eighth century Kazhugumalai temple marks the revival of Jainism in South India.

===Pilgrimages===

Jain &quot;Tirtha&quot; (pilgrim) sites are divided into the following categories:

* &quot;Siddhakshetra&quot;Site of the &quot;moksha&quot; of an &quot;arihant&quot; (&quot;kevalin&quot;) or &quot;tirthankara&quot;, such as: Ashtapada of Rishabhanatha, Shikharji of 20 Tirthankara, Girnar of Neminatha, Pawapuri of Mahaveera, Champapuri (capital of Anga) of Vasupujya, Mangi-Tungi of Ram, Palitana of 3 Pandavas.
* &quot;Atishayakshetra&quot;Locations where divine events are believed to have occurred, such as: Mahavirji, Rishabhdeo, Kundalpur, Tijara, and Aharji.
* &quot;Puranakshetra&quot; Places associated with the lives of great men, such as: Ayodhya, Vidisha, Hastinapur, and Rajgir.
* &quot;Gyanakshetra&quot; Places associated with famous &quot;acharyas&quot;, or centers of learning, such as Shravanabelagola.

Outside contemporary India, Jain communities built temples in locations such as Nagarparkar, Sindh (Pakistan). However, according to a UNESCO tentative world heritage site application, Nagarparkar was not a &quot;major religious centre or a place of pilgrimage&quot; for Jainism, but it was once an important cultural landscape before &quot;the last remaining Jain community left the area in 1947 at Partition&quot;.

===Statues and sculptures===


Jain sculptures usually depict one of the twenty-four &quot;tīrthaṅkaras&quot;; Parshvanatha, Rishabhanatha and Mahāvīra are among the more popular, often seated in lotus position or &quot;kayotsarga&quot;, along with &quot;Arihant&quot;, Bahubali, and protector deities like Ambika. Quadruple images are also popular. &quot;Tirthankar&quot; idols look similar, differentiated by their individual symbol, except for Parshvanatha whose head is crowned by a snake. Digambara images are naked without any beautification, whereas Śvētāmbara depictions are clothed and ornamented.

A monolithic, statue of Bahubali, &quot;Gommateshvara&quot;, built in 981 CE by the Ganga minister and commander Chavundaraya, is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in Karnataka. This statue was voted first in the SMS poll Seven Wonders of India conducted by &quot;The Times of India&quot;. The tall Statue of Ahiṃsā (depicting Rishabhanatha) was erected in the Nashik district in 2015. Idols are often made in &quot;Ashtadhatu&quot; (literally &quot;eight metals&quot;), namely Akota Bronze, brass, gold, silver, stone monoliths, rock cut, and precious stones.

===Symbols===

Jain icons and arts incorporate symbols such as the swastika, &quot;Om&quot;, and the &quot;Ashtamangala&quot;. In Jainism, &quot;Om&quot; is a condensed reference to the initials &quot;A-A-A-U-M&quot; of the five parameshthis: &quot;&quot;Arihant&quot;, &quot;Ashiri&quot;, &quot;Acharya&quot;, &quot;Upajjhaya&quot;, &quot;Muni&quot;&quot;. The &quot;Ashtamangala&quot; is a set of eight auspicious symbols: in the Digambara tradition, these are chatra, &quot;dhvaja&quot;, &quot;kalasha&quot;, fly-whisk, mirror, chair, hand fan and vessel. In the Śvētāmbar tradition, they are Swastika, &quot;Srivatsa&quot;, &quot;Nandavarta&quot;, &quot;Vardhmanaka&quot; (food vessel), &quot;Bhadrasana&quot; (seat), &quot;Kalasha&quot; (pot), &quot;Darpan&quot; (mirror) and pair of fish.

The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes &quot;ahimsā&quot;. The wheel represents the &quot;dharmachakra&quot;, which stands for the resolve to halt the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (wandering) through the relentless pursuit of &quot;ahimsā&quot;. The five colours of the Jain flag represent the &quot;Pañca-Parameṣṭhi&quot; and the five vows. The swastika&#x27;s four arms symbolise the four realms in which rebirth occurs according to Jainism: humans, heavenly beings, hellish beings and non-humans. The three dots on the top represent the three jewels mentioned in ancient texts: correct faith, correct understanding and correct conduct, believed to lead to spiritual perfection.

In 1974, on the 2500th anniversary of the nirvana of Mahāvīra, the Jain community chose a single combined image for Jainism. It depicts the three &quot;lokas&quot;, heaven, the human world and hell. The semi-circular topmost portion symbolizes &quot;Siddhashila&quot;, a zone beyond the three realms. The Jain swastika and the symbol of &quot;Ahiṃsā&quot; are included, with the Jain mantra &quot;Parasparopagraho Jīvānām&quot; from sūtra 5.21 of Umaswati&#x27;s &quot;Tattvarthasūtra&quot;, meaning &quot;souls render service to one another&quot;.

==History==

Jainism is a religion founded in ancient India. Jains trace their history through twenty-four &quot;tirthankaras&quot; and revere Rishabhanatha as the first &quot;tirthankara&quot; (in the present time-cycle). Some artifacts found in the Indus River Valley civilization have been suggested as a link to ancient Jain culture, but very little is known about the Indus Valley iconography and script. The last two &quot;tirthankaras&quot;, the 23rd &quot;tirthankara&quot; Parshvanatha (c. 9th–8th century BCE) and the 24th &quot;tirthankara&quot; Mahavira (c. 599 – c. 527 BCE) are historical figures. Mahavira was a contemporary of the Buddha. According to Jain texts, the 22nd &quot;Tirthankara&quot; Neminatha lived about 85,000 years ago and was the cousin of Krishna.

===Ancient===
Jainism is an ancient Indian religion of obscure origins. Jains claim it to be eternal, and consider the first &quot;tirthankara&quot; Rishabhanatha as the reinforcer of Jain Dharma in the current time cycle. It is one of the &quot;Śramaṇa&quot; traditions of ancient India, those that rejected the Vedas, and according to the twentieth-century scholar of comparative religion Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Jainism was in existence before the Vedas were composed.

The first twenty two tirthankaras are not considered by non-Jain scholars as historical figures. The 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanatha, was likely a historical being, dated by the Jain tradition to the ninth century BCE; historians date him to the eighth or seventh century BCE. Parshvanatha may have founded a proto-Jain ascetic community which subsequently got revived and reformed by Mahavira.

Mahāvīra is considered a contemporary of the Buddha, in around the sixth or 5th century BCE. The interaction between the two religions began with the Buddha; later, they competed for followers and the merchant trade networks that sustained them. Buddhist and Jain texts sometimes have the same or similar titles but present different doctrines.

Kings Bimbisara (–491 BCE), Ajatashatru (–460 BCE), and Udayin (–440 BCE) of the Haryanka dynasty were patrons of Jainism. Jain tradition states that Chandragupta Maurya (322–298 BCE), the founder of the Mauryan Empire and grandfather of Ashoka, became a monk and disciple of Jain ascetic Bhadrabahu in the later part of his life. Jain texts state that he died intentionally at Shravanabelagola by fasting.

The third century BCE emperor Ashoka, in his pillar edicts, mentions the &quot;Niganthas&quot; (Jains). &quot;Tirthankara&quot; statues date back to the second century BCE. Archeological evidence suggests that Mathura was an important Jain center from the second century BCE. onwards. Inscriptions from as early as the first century CE already show the schism between Digambara and Śvētāmbara. There is inscriptional evidence for the presence of Jain monks in south India by the second or first centuries BCE, and archaeological evidence of Jain monks in Saurashtra in Gujarat by the second century CE.

Royal patronage has been a key factor in the growth and decline of Jainism. In the second half of the first century CE, Hindu kings of the Rashtrakuta dynasty sponsored major Jain cave temples. King Harshavardhana of the seventh century championed Jainism, Buddhism and all traditions of Hinduism. The Pallava King Mahendravarman I (600–630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism. His work &quot;Mattavilasa Prahasana&quot; ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and expresses contempt for Jain ascetics. The Yadava dynasty built many temples at the Ellora Caves between 700 and 1000 CE. King Āma of the eighth century converted to Jainism, and the Jain pilgrimage tradition was well established in his era. Mularaja (10th century CE), the founder of the Chalukya dynasty, constructed a Jain temple, even though he was not a Jain. During the 11th century, Basava, a minister to the Jain Kalachuri king Bijjala, converted many Jains to the Lingayat Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed Jain temples and adapted them to their use. The Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana (–1152 CE) became a Vaishnavite under the influence of Ramanuja, and Vaishnavism then grew rapidly in what is now Karnataka.

===Medieval===

Jainism faced persecution during and after the Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent. The scholarship in context of Jain relations with the ruler of Delhi Sultanate remains scarce, notwithstanding there were several instances of cordial relations of Jains with prominent rulers of the Sultanate. Alauddin Khalji (1296–1316), as attested by the Jain texts held discussions with Jain sages and once specially summoned Acharya Mahasena to Delhi. One more prominent Jain figure Acharya Ramachandra Suri was also honored by him. During his reign, his governor of Gujarat, Alp Khan permitted the reconstruction of the temples razed during earlier Muslim conquests and himself made huge donation for the renovation of Jain temples. Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325–1351) according to the Jain chronicles favoured the Jain scholars.

The Mughal emperors in general were influenced by the Jain scholars and made patronage and grants for their pilgrimage sites under Humayun (1540–1556), Akbar (1556–1605), Jahangir (1605–1627) and even Aurangzeb (1658–1707). Despite this, there were instances of religious bigotry during the Mughal rule towards Jains. Babur (1526–1530), the first Mughal emperor ordered the destruction of various Jain idols in Gwalior. In 1567, Akbar ravaged the fort of Chittor. After the conquest of the fort, Akbar ordered the destruction of several Jain shrines and temples in Chittor. Similarly there were instances of desecration of Jain religious shrines under Jahangir, Shah Jahan and most notably under Aurangzeb.

The Jain community were the traditional bankers and financiers, and this significantly impacted the Muslim rulers. However, they rarely were a part of the political power during the Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent.

===Colonial era===

A Gujarati Jain scholar, Virchand Gandhi, represented Jainism at the first World Parliament of Religions in 1893, held in America during the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. He worked to defend the rights of Jains and wrote and lectured extensively on Jainism.

Shrimad Rajchandra, a mystic, poet and philosopher from Gujarat is believed to have attained &quot;jatismaran gnana&quot; (ability to recollect past lives) at the age of seven. Virchand Gandhi mentioned this feat at the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions. He is best known because of his association with Mahatma Gandhi. Shrimad Rajchandra composed Shri Atmasiddhi Shastra, considered his magnum opus, containing the essence of Jainism in a single sitting of 1.5–2 hours. He expounds on the six fundamental truths of the soul:

# Self (soul) exists
# It is permanent and eternal
# It is the doer of its own actions
# It is the enjoyer or the sufferer of its actions
# Liberation exists
# There is a path to achieve liberation.

Colonial era reports and Christian missions variously viewed Jainism as a sect of Hinduism, a sect of Buddhism, or a distinct religion. Christian missionaries were frustrated at Jain people without pagan creator gods refusing to convert to Christianity, while colonial era Jain scholars such as Champat Rai Jain defended Jainism against criticism and misrepresentation by Christian activists. Missionaries of Christianity and Islam considered Jain traditions idolatrous and superstitious. These criticisms, states John E. Cort, were flawed and ignored similar practices within sects of Christianity.

The British colonial government in India and Indian princely states promoted religious tolerance. However, laws were passed that made roaming naked by anyone an arrestable crime. This drew popular support from the majority Hindu population, but particularly impacted Digambara monks. The Akhil Bharatiya Jain Samaj opposed this law, claiming that it interfered with Jain religious rights. Acharya Shantisagar entered Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1927, but was forced to cover his body. He then led an India-wide tour as the naked monk with his followers, to various Digambara sacred sites, and was welcomed by kings of the Maharashtra provinces. Shantisagar fasted to oppose the restrictions imposed on Digambara monks by the British Raj and prompted their discontinuance. The laws were abolished by India after independence.

==Modern era==
Followers of Jainism are called &quot;Jains&quot;, a word derived from the Sanskrit verbal root &quot;ji&quot;, which means to conquer. In the Jain context, monks have to conquer their senses and karma for liberation. Those who have succeeded are &quot;jinas&quot; (victors), which means an omniscient person who teaches the path of salvation, and their followers are Jains. The majority of Jains currently reside in India. With four to five million followers worldwide, Jainism is small compared to major world religions. Jains form 0.37% of India&#x27;s population, mostly in the states of Maharashtra (1.4 million in 2011, 31.46% of Indian Jains), Rajasthan (13.97%), Gujarat (13.02%) and Madhya Pradesh (12.74%). Significant Jain populations exist in Karnataka (9.89%), Uttar Pradesh (4.79%), Delhi (3.73%) and Tamil Nadu (2.01%). Outside India, Jain communities can be found in most areas hosting large Indian populations, such as Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia and Kenya. Jainism also counts non-Indian converts; for example, it is spreading rapidly in Japan, where more than 5,000 families have converted between 2010 and 2020.

According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) conducted in 2015–16, Jains form the wealthiest community in India. According to its 2011 census, they have the country&#x27;s highest literacy rate (87%) among those aged seven and older, and the most college graduates; excluding the retired, Jain literacy in India exceeded 97%. The female to male sex ratio among Jains is .940; among Indians in the 0–6 year age range the ratio was second lowest (870 girls per 1,000 boys), higher only than Sikhs. Jain males have the highest work participation rates in India, while Jain females have the lowest.

Jainism has been praised for some of its practices and beliefs. Greatly influenced by Shrimad Rajchandra, the leader of the campaign for Indian independence, Mahatma Gandhi stated regarding Jainism:

Chandanaji became the first Jain woman to receive the title of Acharya in 1987.

<text>Joanna Russ (February 22, 1937 – April 29, 2011) was an American writer, academic and feminist. She is the author of a number of works of science fiction, fantasy and feminist literary criticism such as &quot;How to Suppress Women&#x27;s Writing&quot;, as well as a contemporary novel, &quot;On Strike Against God&quot;, and one children&#x27;s book, &quot;Kittatinny&quot;. She is best known for &quot;The Female Man&quot;, a novel combining utopian fiction and satire, and the story &quot;When It Changed&quot;.

==Background==
Joanna Russ was born in The Bronx, New York City, to Evarett I. and Bertha (née Zinner) Russ, both teachers. Her family was Jewish. She began creating works of fiction at a very early age. Over the following years she filled countless notebooks with stories, poems, comics and illustrations, often hand-binding the material with thread.

As a senior at William Howard Taft High School, Russ was selected as one of the top ten Westinghouse Science Talent Search winners. She graduated from Cornell University, where she studied with Vladimir Nabokov, in 1957, and received her MFA from the Yale Drama School in 1960. She was briefly married to Albert Amateau. 

Russ taught at Queensborough Community College from 1966 to 1967, at Cornell from 1967 to 1972, SUNY Binghamton, from 1972 to 1975, and at the University of Colorado, Boulder, from 1975 to 1977. In 1977 she started teaching at the University of Washington. She became a full professor in 1984 and retired in 1991. Russ was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in 1974-1975.

==Science fiction and other writing==
Russ came to be noticed in the science fiction world in the late 1960s, in particular for her award-nominated novel &quot;Picnic on Paradise&quot;. At the time, SF was a field dominated by male authors, writing for a predominantly male audience, but women were starting to enter the field in larger numbers. Russ was one of the most outspoken female authors to challenge male dominance of the field, and is generally regarded as one of the leading feminist science fiction scholars and writers. She was also one of the first major science fiction writers to take slash fiction and its cultural and literary implications seriously. She published over fifty short stories. Russ was associated with the American New Wave of science fiction.

Along with her work as a writer of prose fiction, Russ was also a playwright, essayist, and author of nonfiction works, generally literary criticism and feminist theory, including the essay collection &quot;Magic Mommas, Trembling Sisters, Puritans &amp; Perverts&quot;; &quot;How to Suppress Women&#x27;s Writing&quot;; and the book-length study of modern feminism, &quot;What Are We Fighting For?&quot;. Her essays and articles have been published in &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot;, &quot;Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot;, and &quot;College English&quot;. Russ was a self-described socialist feminist, expressing particular admiration for the work and theories of Clara Fraser and her Freedom Socialist Party. Both fiction and nonfiction, for Russ, were modes of engaging theory with the real world; in particular, &quot;The Female Man&quot; can be read as a theoretical or narrative text. The short story &quot;When It Changed&quot;, which became a part of the novel, explores the constraints of gender and asks if gender is necessary in a society.

Russ&#x27;s writing is characterized by anger interspersed with humor and irony. James Tiptree Jr, in a letter to her, wrote, &quot;Do you imagine that anyone with half a functional neuron can read your work and not have his fingers smoked by the bitter, multi-layered anger in it? It smells and smoulders like a volcano buried so long and deadly it is just beginning to wonder if it can explode.&quot; In a letter to Susan Koppelman, Russ asks of a young feminist critic &quot;where is her anger?&quot; and adds &quot;I think from now on, I will not trust anyone who isn&#x27;t angry.&quot;

For nearly 15 years she was an influential (if intermittent) review columnist for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. Though by then she was no longer an active member of science fiction fandom, she was interviewed by phone during Wiscon (the feminist science fiction convention in Madison, Wisconsin) in 2006 by her friend and member of the same cohort, Samuel R. Delany.

Her first SF story was &quot;Nor Custom Stale&quot; in F&amp;SF (1959). Notable short works include Hugo winner and Nebula Award finalist &quot;Souls&quot; (1982), Nebula Award and Tiptree Award winner &quot;When It Changed&quot; (1972), Nebula Award finalists &quot;The Second Inquisition&quot; (1970), &quot;Poor Man, Beggar Man&quot; (1971), &quot;The Extraordinary Voyages of Amélie Bertrand&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Mystery of the Young Gentlemen&quot; (1982). Her fiction has been nominated for nine Nebula and three Hugo Awards, and her genre-related scholarly work was recognized with a Pilgrim Award in 1988. Her story &quot;The Autobiography of My Mother&quot; was one of the 1977 O. Henry Prize stories.

She wrote several contributions to feminist thinking about pornography and sexuality, including &quot;Pornography by Women, for Women, with Love&quot; (1985), &quot;Pornography and the Doubleness of Sex for Women&quot;, and &quot;Being Against Pornography&quot;, which can be found in her archival pieces located in the University of Oregon&#x27;s Special Collections. These essays include very detailed descriptions of her views on pornography and how influential it was to feminist thought in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Specifically, in &quot;Being Against Pornography&quot;, she calls pornography a feminist issue. Her issues with pornography range from feminist critiques to women&#x27;s sexuality in general, maintaining that porn prevents women from freely expressing their sexual selves like men can. Russ believed that anti-pornography activists were not addressing how women experienced pornography created by men, a topic that she addressed in &quot;Being Against Pornography&quot;.

==Reputation and legacy==
Her work is widely taught in courses on science fiction and feminism throughout the English speaking world. Russ is the subject of Farah Mendlesohn&#x27;s book &quot;On Joanna Russ&quot; and Jeanne Cortiel&#x27;s &quot;Demand My Writing: Joanna Russ, Feminism, Science Fiction&quot;. Russ and her work are prominently featured in Sarah LeFanu&#x27;s&quot; In the Chinks of the World Machine: Feminism and Science Fiction&quot; (1988). She was named to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013.

Gwyneth Jones wrote a 2019 book about Joanna Russ that was part of the University of Illinois Press series called Modern Masters of Science Fiction.

In a 2004 essay about the connections between Russ&#x27;s work and D. W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;Intolerance&quot;, Samuel R. Delany describes her as being &quot;one of the finest - and most necessary - writers of American fiction&quot; since she published her first professional short story in 1959.

Her papers are part of the University of Oregon&#x27;s Special Collections and University Archives.

==Critical writings==
The late 1960s and 1970s marked the beginnings of feminist SF scholarship—a field of inquiry that was all but created single-handedly by Russ, who wrote many essays on feminism and science fiction that appeared in journals such as &quot;College English&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction Studies&quot;. She also contributed 25 reviews to &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, covering more than 100 books of all genres. In their article &quot;Learning the &#x27;Prophet Business&#x27;: The Merril-Russ Intersection,&quot; Newell and Tallentire described Russ as an &quot;intelligent, tough-minded reviewer who routinely tempered harsh criticism with just the sort of faint praise she handed out to Judith Merril,&quot; who in turn was among the foremost editors and critics in American science fiction in the late 1960s. Russ was also described as a fearless, incisive, and radical person, whose writing was often characterized as acerbic and angry.

Russ was acclaimed as one of science fiction&#x27;s most revolutionary and accomplished writers. Helen Merrick claimed that Russ is an inescapable figure in science fiction history. James Tiptree Jr. once commented on how Russ could be an &quot;absolute delight&quot; one minute, but then she &quot;rushes out and bites my ankles with one sentence.&quot; For example, Russ criticized Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s 1969 &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, which won both the 1969 Nebula and 1970 Hugo awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women. According to Russ, Le Guin&#x27;s novel represented these stereotypes.

Russ felt that science fiction gives something to its readers that cannot be easily acquired anywhere else. She maintained that science should be accurate, and seriousness is a virtue. She insisted on the unique qualities of her chosen genre, maintaining that science fiction shared certain qualities with art and its flexibility compared to other forms writing. Russ was also interested in demonstrating the unique potentials of women science fiction writers. As her career moved into its second decade in the 1980s, she started to worry about reviewing standards. She once said, &quot;The reviewer&#x27;s hardest task is to define standards.&quot;

Russ&#x27;s reviewing style was characterized by logic. She was attacked by readers because of her harsh reviews of Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;Lord Foul&#x27;s Bane&quot; (1977) and Joy Chant&#x27;s &quot;The Grey Mane of Morning&quot; (1977). She organized attacks into these seven categories, taken directly from the cited article:
*Don&#x27;t shove your politics into your reviews. Just review the books. &quot;I will,&quot; Russ said, &quot;when authors keep politics out of their books.&quot;
*You don&#x27;t prove what you say; you just assert it. &quot;There is no way to &#x27;prove&#x27; anything in aesthetic or moral matters.&quot;
*Then your opinion is purely subjective. &quot;I might be subjective, but not arbitrary. It is based on a critic&#x27;s whole education.&quot;
*Everyone&#x27;s entitled to his [sic] own opinion. &quot;Writing is a craft too, and it can be judged. And some opinions are worth a good deal more than others.&quot;
*I knew it. You&#x27;re a snob. &quot;Science fiction is a small world that often doesn&#x27;t look outside of its own bounds.&quot;
*You&#x27;re vitriolic too. &quot;The only way to relieve oneself of the pain that has to be endured by reading every line is to express one&#x27;s opinions vividly, precisely, and compactly.&quot;
*Never mind all that stuff. Just tell me what I&#x27;d enjoy reading. &quot;Bless you, what makes you think I know?&quot;

However, she felt guilty about dire and frank criticism. She apologized for her harsh words on Lloyd Biggle&#x27;s &quot;The Light That Never Was&quot; (1972) by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s narsty to beat up on authors who are probably starving to death on turnip soup (&quot;ghoti&quot; soup) but critics ought to be honest.&quot;

==Personal life==
Around the time of the publication of &quot;The Female Man&quot; in 1975, Russ came out as a lesbian. However, Russ remained protective of her personal life, and as late as a December 1981 interview with Charles Platt, she was still evasive on the subject for the first third of the interview.

===Health===
In her later life she published little, largely because she had chronic pain and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

On April 27, 2011, it was reported that Russ had been admitted to a hospice after suffering a series of strokes. Samuel R. Delany was quoted as saying that Russ was &quot;slipping away&quot; and had long had a &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; order on file. She died early in the morning on April 29, 2011.

<doc id="16020" wikidata="Q984374" url="?curid=16020" title="Jackson, Michigan">
<text>Jackson is the seat of government of Jackson County, Michigan, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 31,309. Located along Interstate 94 and U.S. Route 127, it is approximately east of Kalamazoo, west of Detroit and south of Lansing. Jackson is the core city of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Jackson County and has a population of 160,248.

Founded in 1829, it was named after President Andrew Jackson. Michigan&#x27;s first prison, Michigan State Prison (or Jackson State Prison), opened in Jackson in 1838 and remains in operation. For the longest time, the city was known as the &quot;birthplace of the Republican Party&quot; when politicians met in Jackson in 1854 to argue against the expansion of slavery, although the political party now formally recognizes its birthplace as being Ripon, Wisconsin. Nevertheless, the Republican Party&#x27;s earliest history dates back to Jackson and is commemorated by a plaque in the city&#x27;s Under the Oaks City Park, which has since been visited by numerous Republican presidents.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jackson became an early automotive manufacturing center that attracted southerners and immigrants to the city&#x27;s numerous factories, which saw its population increase significantly.

==History==
On July 3, 1829, Horace Blackman, accompanied by Alexander Laverty, a land surveyor, and &quot;Pewytum&quot;, an Indian guide, forded the Grand River and made camp for the night at a site now marked as Trail and N. Jackson Street. They arrived there along a well-traveled Native American trail leading west from Ann Arbor. Blackman had hired Laverty and Pewytum to guide him west. Returning to Ann Arbor and Monroe, Blackman registered his claim for at two dollars an acre.

He returned to the Jackson area in August 1829 with his brother Russell. Together they cleared land and built a cabin at what would become the corner of Ingham and Trail streets. The town was first called Jacksonopolis. Later, it was renamed Jacksonburgh. Finally in 1838, the town&#x27;s name was changed to simply Jackson.

===Birthplace of the Republican Party – &quot;Under the Oaks&quot;===
Jackson is one of the birthplaces of the Republican Party. The first official meeting of the group that called itself &quot;Republican&quot; was held in Jackson on July 6, 1854. A Michigan historical marker at what is now the northwest corner of Second and Franklin streets in Jackson commemorates an anti-slavery county convention held that day. Meeting outside to avoid a hot, overcrowded hall, the group ultimately selected a slate of candidates for state elections. The marker identifies this as the birth of the Republican Party. The site, an oak grove on &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Forty&quot;, then on the outskirts of town, became known as &quot;Under the Oaks&quot;.

===Auto industry===
Before Detroit began building cars on assembly lines in 1910, Jackson factories were making parts for cars and putting them together. By 1910, the auto industry had become Jackson&#x27;s main industry. More than 20 different brands of cars were once made in Jackson, including: Reeves, Jaxon, Jackson, CarterCar, Orlo, Whiting, Butcher and Gage; Buick, Janney, Globe, Steel Swallow, C.V.I., Imperial, Ames-Dean, Cutting, Standard Electric, Duck, Briscoe, Argo, Hollier, Hackett, Marion-Handly, Gem, Earl, Wolverine, and Kaiser-Darrin. 
Ye Ole Carriage Shop in Spring Arbor displays more than 60 antique and classic cars, including five one-and-onlys and 16 made in Jackson. One of these is a 1902 JAXON. Today the auto parts industry remains one of the largest employers of skilled machine operators in Jackson County. The city was also an early site for the moped parts industry.

===Birthplace of the Coney Island hot dog===
In 1914 Macedonian immigrant George Todoroff founded the first &quot;Coney Island restaurant&quot; and created his famous Coney Island hot dog topping. His Coney Island restaurant was located directly in front of the railroad station on East Michigan Avenue and was open 24 hours. The restaurant proved to be a popular dining option for rail passengers. Over the course of 31 years, Todoroff sold more than 17 million Coney Island hot dogs. Today two Coney Island restaurants unaffiliated with Todoroff&#x27;s are located in a building near the train station on East Michigan Avenue, Virginia Coney Island and Jackson Coney Island. In addition, several area restaurants throughout the Jackson area offer their own version of the Coney Island hot dog, or just &quot;coney&quot; as referred to by local residents. Jackson&#x27;s version of the coney dog is distinctly different from those featured in Detroit-area Coney Island restaurants or other Coney Island restaurants throughout Michigan and the Midwest. In 2014 Todoroff&#x27;s Coney Island celebrated its centenary.

=== Michigan&#x27;s first state prison (1838–1934) ===
The legislature authorized Michigan&#x27;s first state prison in 1838. A temporary wooden prison, enclosed by a fence of tamarack poles, was built on 60 acres donated for that purpose inside the city limits of Jackson. In 1839 the first 35 prisoners were received. A permanent prison was built three years later. 
Beginning in the 1850s, Warden H.F. Hatch placed more emphasis on the education and rehabilitation of prisoners. By 1882, Michigan&#x27;s First State Prison (1838–1934) had developed as the largest walled prison in the world. Within its walls, the factories and surrounding farms, manned by cheap inmate labor, made Jackson one of the leading industrial cities in the nation. In 1934 a new prison was completed just north of Jackson&#x27;s city limit in Blackman Township; it took all of the state prisoners.

The historic building is now used as an artists&#x27; resident community, known as the Armory Arts Village. Tours of the original prison site on Cooper Street are available through the Original Jackson Historic Prison Tours. A closed, fully intact cell block at the modern prison in Blackman Township was operated as the Cell Block 7 Prison Museum from 2014-2019. Independently operated by the accredited Ella Sharp Museum, this was the only museum where visitors could enter a closed cell block on the grounds of an active prison for a self-guided tour.

===Corset industry (1860s–1920s)===

Numerous railroad connections were constructed to Jackson, connecting it to many markets. The local invention of the duplex corset by Bortree helped make Jackson a center of corset manufacturing. By the early 20th century, as many as 16 manufacturers of women&#x27;s corsets operated here; the majority of which were located on Cortland and Pearl streets. As elastics were adopted in manufacturing and fashions changed, the corset industry quickly declined. The majority of the corset manufacturers in Jackson closed their doors by 1920. Only three of the original corset companies survived past the 1920s, by changing their production to therapeutic and prosthetic support garments and devices.

&quot;The First&quot;
Moses Bortree founded the Bortree Corset Company, the first corset manufacturer outside of New York, in 1868 at 112 W. Cortland. Founded to make crinoline skirts and bustles (hoop skirts!), they began manufacturing Bortree&#x27;s newest creation, the Duplex Corset, in 1875. Within five years, production rose from 50,000 to 300,000 corsets per year.

&quot;The Biggest&quot;
Founded in 1884, the Jackson Corset Co. became the largest manufacturer of corset and waist garments in the US. Located at 209-215 W. Cortland St., they employed almost 300 people by 1895.

&quot;Woman-Owned&quot;
The Coronet Corset Manufactory opened in 1880 at 146 W. Main St. and later moved to 131-133 W. Pearl St. Coronet had the distinction of being run by the first and only female president, Mrs. C.A. McGee, who invented and patented the Coronet Corset.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.09%) is water.

===Climate===
This climate region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Jackson has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 33,534 people, 13,294 households, and 7,872 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 15,457 housing units at an average density of .

===Religion===
Jackson has a number of notable historic churches, several of which were established prior to the American Civil War. The First Baptist Church was established in 1839; the present building, a Romanesque Revival structure, was dedicated in March 1872. The First Congregational Church is housed in a monumental Romanesque Revival building constructed in 1859. A basement was added after the structure had been in operation for several years. In 1871 the building was raised eight feet to accommodate lower-level classrooms. Its congregation has actively participated in local social reform efforts, becoming part of the antislavery movement in the 1840s and later supporting the temperance and the civil rights movement. St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church was also founded in 1839. The congregation&#x27;s first church building, constructed in 1840, was replaced by a Romanesque Revival building in 1853; it is one of the oldest Episcopal Church structures in southern Michigan.

Constructed in 1857, St. John&#x27;s the Evangelist Church is the oldest Roman Catholic church in the city. It was established as a mission in 1836 to serve a congregation that was originally predominately Irish immigrants. Given the following waves of Catholic immigrants from other countries, its congregation today is more diverse. St. Mary Star of the Sea was established in 1881 as Jackson&#x27;s second Catholic church. The present building, a limestone Romanesque structure built between 1923 and 1926, incorporates elements of the parish&#x27;s first church as well as stained glass windows, marble altars and communion rails imported from Italy and Austria. The first and only Eastern Orthodox Church is St. Demetrius Orthodox Church, founded in 1958. Among the modern churches in the town is Westwinds Community Church, a non-denominational, evangelical Christian church. Founded in 1865 in a blacksmith shop, Community Jackson African Methodist Episcopal Church became the first place of worship for African Americans in Jackson County.
Late 19th-century immigrants included Jews from Germany and eastern Europe. Jackson is home to Temple Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue founded in 1862 by German Jewish immigrants.

==Economy==
Restructuring in heavy industry in the mid-20th century caused a decline in jobs and population in many industrial cities, including Jackson. There are three major private employers in the city. CMS Energy provides natural gas and electrical services to much of Michigan and has its international headquarters in the city. The next two major employers are Henry Ford Health (formerly Foote Hospital) and the Eaton Corporation.

Michigan Automotive Compressor, Inc. (MACI) is the largest manufacturer in Jackson County and its fourth-largest individual employer. In February 2009 it began offering voluntary buyouts to its workers, in reaction to the slowing economy during the financial crisis.

Family-owned food manufacturer and distributor Dawn Foods has been based in Jackson since 1920.

Jackson Flexible Products, just outside the city, has been one of North America&#x27;s premier custom-molded rubber specialists since 1969. The company employs over 35 people, providing components for the aerospace, automotive and defense industries.

Jackson&#x27;s state prison complex includes the first state prison building, which was expanded and became known as the largest walled prison in the world. Portions of the prison complex closed in 2007, including the Annex of the Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center Annex (RGC) and the Southern Michigan Correctional Facility (JMF). One of the closed cell blocks at JMF has been adapted and re-opened as the Cell Block 7 Prison Museum.

The other facilities in the complex, including two in the old walled building, remain open: the G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility (JCF), the Cooper Street Correctional Facility (JCS), the Charles Egeler Reception and Guidance Center (RGC), and the Parnall Correctional Facility (SMT).

==Parks and recreation==
Jackson&#x27;s parks and recreation department includes a golf course, swimming pool, sporting fields, and 26 parks, totaling 645 acres.

The city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents. Federally, Jackson is located in Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district, represented by Republican Tim Walberg.

==Education==
Jackson is served by Jackson Public Schools. The Jackson urbanized area is home to approximately 16 elementary public schools, as well as about 16 private or parochial schools. It also has a large public middle school (The Middle School at Parkside). It has nine high schools: the public Jackson High School, East Jackson Secondary School (Public), Parma Western High School, and Northwest High School, T. A. Wilson Academy, Napoleon High School, and Vandercook Lake High School; and the private DaVinci Institute (Charter), Jackson Preparatory and Early College (Charter), and Jackson Christian School (Non-Denom), and Lumen Christi Catholic School (Catholic).

The city is also home to institutions of adult and higher education: Jackson College (formerly Jackson Community College), Baker College, Career Quest Learning Centers, and Spring Arbor University. An additional 15 higher education institutions are within a one-hour drive of Jackson County.

==Transportation==

From the late nineteenth century into the mid-twentieth century, Jackson was a major railway hub and for over a century has been known as the crossroads of Michigan. Today the Michigan Central Railroad Jackson Depot on East Michigan Avenue is the nation&#x27;s oldest train station in continuous active use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Jackson, operating its Wolverine three times daily in each direction between Chicago and Pontiac, Michigan, via Detroit. Baggage cannot be checked at this location; however, up to two suitcases, in addition to any &quot;personal items&quot; such as briefcases, purses, laptop bags, and infant equipment, are allowed on board as carry-ons.

Jackson and Lansing Railroad (JAIL) owns a line from Jackson to Lansing, Michigan. Norfolk Southern (NS) owns a yard in Jackson as well.

Reynolds Field at Jackson County Airport is the main airport for the city. It hosted commercial service, primarily under the North Central Airlines banner, until 1984. With the &quot;Blue Goose&quot; aircraft now gone, the airport today operates as a general aviation facility. The 700-acre airport, equipped with an ILS system, is located just south of I-94 ( Airport Road exit #137). More than 100 general aviation aircraft are housed here, ranging from single-engine planes to business/corporate jet aircraft.

The Airport is home to many related businesses, including the Jackson College Flight School, a restaurant, bar, and car rental. The Jackson Blues Festival is held here annually in June.

<doc id="16021" wikidata="Q310379" url="?curid=16021" title="John Irving">
<text>John Winslow Irving (born John Wallace Blunt Jr.; March 2, 1942) is an American-Canadian novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter.

Irving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; in 1978. Many of Irving&#x27;s novels, including &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; (1981), &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (1985), &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; (1989), and &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; (1998), have been bestsellers. He won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 72nd Academy Awards for his script of the film adaptation of &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;.

Five of his novels have been adapted into films (&quot;Garp&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot; &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, &quot;Owen Meany&quot;, &quot;Cider House&quot;, and &quot;Widow for One Year&quot;). Several of Irving&#x27;s books and short stories have been set in and around New England, in fictional towns resembling Exeter, New Hampshire.

==Early life==
Irving was born John Wallace Blunt Jr. in Exeter, New Hampshire, the son of Helen Frances (née Winslow) and John Wallace Blunt Sr., a writer and executive recruiter; the couple separated during pregnancy. Irving was raised by his mother and stepfather, Colin Franklin Newell Irving, who was a Phillips Exeter Academy faculty member. His uncle Hammy Bissell was also part of the faculty. John Irving was in the Phillips Exeter wrestling program as a student athlete and as an assistant coach, and wrestling features prominently in his books, stories, and life. While a student at Exeter, Irving was taught by author and Christian theologian Frederick Buechner, whom he quoted in an epigraph in &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;. Irving has dyslexia.

Irving never met his biological father, who was a pilot in the Army Air Forces during World War II. In July 1943, John Blunt Sr. was shot down over Burma but survived. The incident was incorporated into &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;. Irving did not find out about his father&#x27;s heroism until 1981, when he was almost 40 years old.

==Career==
Irving&#x27;s career began at the age of 26 with the publication of his first novel, &quot;Setting Free the Bears&quot; (1968). The novel was reasonably well reviewed but failed to gain a large readership. In the late 1960s, he studied under Kurt Vonnegut at the University of Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop. His second and third novels, &quot;The Water-Method Man&quot; (1972) and &quot;The 158-Pound Marriage&quot; (1974), were similarly received. In 1975, Irving accepted a position as assistant professor of English at Mount Holyoke College.

Frustrated at the lack of promotion his novels were receiving from his first publisher, Random House, Irving offered his fourth novel, &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; (1978), to Dutton, which promised him stronger commitment to marketing. The novel became an international bestseller and cultural phenomenon. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction in 1979 (which ultimately went to Tim O&#x27;Brien for &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot;) and its first paperback edition won the Award the next year. &quot;Garp&quot; was later made into a film directed by George Roy Hill, starring Robin Williams in the title role and Glenn Close as his mother; it garnered several Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Close and John Lithgow. Irving makes a brief cameo appearance in the film as the referee in one of Garp&#x27;s high school wrestling matches.
 &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; was among three books recommended to the Pulitzer Advisory Board for consideration for the 1979 Award in Fiction in the Pulitzer Jury Committee report, although the award was given to &quot;The Stories of John Cheever&quot; (1978).

&quot;Garp&quot; transformed Irving from an obscure literary writer to a household name, and his subsequent books were bestsellers. The next was &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; (1981), which sold well despite mixed reviews from critics. Like &quot;Garp&quot;, the novel was quickly made into a film, this time directed by Tony Richardson and starring Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe, and Beau Bridges. &quot;Interior Space&quot;, a short story originally published in &quot;Fiction&quot; magazine in 1980, was selected for the 1981 O. Henry Prize Stories collection.

In 1985, Irving published &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;. An epic set in a Maine orphanage, the novel&#x27;s central topic is abortion. Many drew parallels between the novel and Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838). Irving&#x27;s next novel was &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; (1989), another New England family epic about religion set in a New England boarding school and in Toronto, Ontario. The novel was influenced by &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1959) by Günter Grass, and the plot contains further allusions to &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1850) by Nathaniel Hawthorne and the works of Dickens. In &quot;Owen Meany,&quot; Irving for the first time examined the consequences of the Vietnam War—particularly mandatory conscription, which Irving avoided because he was a married father when of age for the draft. &quot;Owen Meany&quot; became Irving&#x27;s best selling book since &quot;Garp.&quot;

Irving returned to Random House for his next book, &quot;A Son of the Circus&quot; (1995). Arguably his most complicated and difficult book, and a departure from the themes and settings of his previous novels, it received ambivalent reviews by American critics but became a national and international bestseller on the strength of Irving&#x27;s reputation for fashioning literate, engrossing page-turners. Irving returned in 1998 with &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot;, which was named a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book.

In 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; was made into a film directed by Lasse Hallström, starring Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, and Delroy Lindo. Irving also made a cameo appearance as a disapproving stationmaster. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Irving wrote &quot;My Movie Business&quot;, a memoir about his involvement in creating the film version of &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;. After its publication in 1999, he appeared on the CBC Television program &quot;Hot Type&quot; to promote the book. During the interview, he was asked about author Tom Wolfe &quot;once again&quot; proclaiming the death of the modern novel. Irving responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t read Tom Wolfe, so I didn&#x27;t hear what he said.&quot; The episode then cut to a photo of Wolfe, and Irving elaborating that Wolfe &quot;can&#x27;t write&quot; and his writing made Irving gag. When asked about his statements subsequently, Irving has said he believed the &quot;Hot Type&quot; interview was over and he was speaking off the record, and that footage from the interview had been manipulated. Wolfe appeared on &quot;Hot Type&quot; later in 1999, calling Irving, Norman Mailer, and John Updike his &quot;three stooges&quot; who were panicked by his newest novel, &quot;A Man in Full&quot; (1998).

Irving&#x27;s 10th book, &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; (2001), also became a bestseller. In 2004, &quot;A Sound Like Someone Trying Not to Make a Sound&quot;, a children&#x27;s picture book originally included in &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot;, was published with illustrations by Tatjana Hauptmann. Irving&#x27;s 11th novel, &quot;Until I Find You&quot;, was released on July 12, 2005.

On June 28, 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article revealing that &quot;Until I Find You&quot; (2005) contains two specifically personal elements about his life that he had never before discussed publicly: his sexual abuse at age 11 by an older woman, and the recent entrance in his life of his biological father&#x27;s family.

In his 12th novel, &quot;Last Night in Twisted River&quot;, published in 2009, Irving&#x27;s central character is a novelist with, as critic Boyd Tonkin puts it, &quot;a career that teasingly follows Irving&#x27;s own.&quot;

Irving has had four novels reach number one on the bestseller list of &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; (September 27, 1981), which stayed number one for seven weeks, and was in the top 15 for over 27 weeks; &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; (June 16, 1985); &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; (June 14, 1998); and &quot;The Fourth Hand&quot; (July 29, 2001).

==Other projects==

Before the publication of &quot;Garp&quot; made him independently wealthy, Irving sporadically accepted short-term teaching positions (including one at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop). He also served as an assistant coach on his sons&#x27; high school wrestling teams until he was 47 years old. Irving was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as an Outstanding American in 1992.

In addition to his novels, he has also published &quot;Trying to Save Piggy Sneed&quot; (1996), a collection of his writings including a brief memoir and unpublished short fiction, &quot;My Movie Business&quot;, an account of the protracted process of bringing &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; to the big screen, and &quot;The Imaginary Girlfriend&quot;, a short memoir focusing on writing and wrestling. In 2000, Irving revealed that he and Tod &quot;Kip&quot; Williams were co-writing a screenplay for an adaptation of the novel &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot; (1998). This adaptation became &quot;The Door in the Floor&quot;, starring Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger, released in 2004, directed by Williams.

In 2002, his four most highly regarded novels, &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot;, &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot;, and &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot;, were published in Modern Library editions. &quot;Owen Meany&quot; was adapted into the 1998 film &quot;Simon Birch&quot; (Irving required that the title and character names be changed because the screenplay&#x27;s story was &quot;markedly different&quot; from that of the novel; Irving is on record as having enjoyed the film, however).

In 2005, Irving received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In a &quot;New York Magazine&quot; interview in 2009, Irving stated that he had begun work on a new novel, his 13th, based in part on a speech from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II.&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster published the novel, titled &quot;In One Person&quot; (2012), taking over from Random House. &quot;In One Person&quot; has a first-person viewpoint, Irving&#x27;s first such narrative since &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany&quot; (Irving decided to change the first-person perspective of &quot;Until I Find You&quot; to third person less than a year before publication). &quot;In One Person&quot; features a 60-year-old, bisexual protagonist named William, looking back on his life in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. The novel shares a similar theme and concern with &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, the latter being in part about &quot;people who hate you for your sexual differences,&quot; said Irving.

He won a Lambda Literary Award in 2013 in the Bisexual Fiction category for &quot;In One Person&quot;, and was also awarded the organization&#x27;s Bridge Builder Award to honor him as an ally of the LGBT community.

On June 10, 2013, Irving announced his next novel, his 14th, titled &quot;Avenue of Mysteries&quot;, named after a street in Mexico City. In an interview the previous year, he had revealed the last line of the book: &quot;Not every collision course comes as a surprise.&quot;

On December 19, 2014, Irving posted a message on the Facebook page devoted to him and his work that he had &quot;finished &#x27;Avenue of Mysteries.&#x27; It is a shorter novel for me, comparable in length to &#x27;In One Person.&#x27;&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster published the book in November, 2015.

On November 3, 2015, Irving revealed that he&#x27;d been approached by HBO and Warner Brothers to reconstruct &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; as a miniseries. He described the project as being in the early stages. According to the byline of a self-penned, February 20, 2017, essay for The Hollywood Reporter, Irving had completed his teleplay for the five-part series based on &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; and was working on his fifteenth novel.

On June 28, 2017, Irving revealed in a long letter to fans on Facebook that his new novel was primarily a ghost story. &quot;...I have a history of being interested in ghosts. And here come the ghosts again. In my new novel, my fifteenth, the ghosts are more prominent than before; the novel begins and ends with them. Like &quot;A Widow for One Year&quot;, this novel is constructed as a play in three acts. I&#x27;m calling Act I &#x27;Early Signs.&#x27; I began writing it on New Year&#x27;s Eve—not a bad night to start a ghost story.&quot;

In an interview with Mike Kilen for &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot;, published on October 26, 2017, Irving revealed that the title of his novel-in-progress was &quot;Darkness As a Bride.&quot; The title was taken from Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;Measure for Measure:&quot; &quot;If I must die, / I will encounter darkness as a bride, / and hug it in mine arms.&quot; He later changed the title to &quot;The Last Chairlift &quot;. The novel was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in October 2022.

Irving received the Richard C. Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award at the annual Dayton Literary Peace Prize gala on October 28, 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1964, Irving married Shyla Leary, whom he had met at Harvard in 1963 while taking a summer course in German, before traveling to Vienna with IES Abroad. They have two sons, Colin and Brendan. The couple divorced in the early 1980s. In 1987, he married Janet Turnbull, who had been his publisher at Bantam-Seal Books and is now one of his literary agents. They have one daughter, actor and writer Eva Everett Irving.

Irving has homes in Toronto and Pointe au Baril, Ontario. On December 13, 2019, Irving became a Canadian citizen. He has said he plans to keep his U.S. citizenship, reserving the right to be outspoken about the United States and his dislike of Donald Trump.

<text>Justus &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Liebig (12 May 1803 – 20 April 1873) was a German scientist who made major contributions to the theory, practice, and pedagogy of chemistry, as well as to agricultural and biological chemistry; he is considered one of the principal founders of organic chemistry. As a professor at the University of Giessen, he devised the modern laboratory-oriented teaching method, and for such innovations, he is regarded as one of the most outstanding chemistry teachers of all time. He has been described as the &quot;father of the fertilizer industry&quot; for his emphasis on nitrogen and minerals as essential plant nutrients, and his popularization of the law of the minimum, which states that plant growth is limited by the scarcest nutrient resource, rather than the total amount of resources available. He also developed a manufacturing process for beef extracts, and with his consent a company, called Liebig Extract of Meat Company, was founded to exploit the concept; it later introduced the Oxo brand beef bouillon cube. He popularized an earlier invention for condensing vapors, which came to be known as the Liebig condenser.

==Early life and education==
Justus Liebig was born in Darmstadt into the middle-class family of Johann Georg Liebig and Maria Caroline Möser in early May 1803. His father was a drysalter and hardware merchant who compounded and sold paints, varnishes, and pigments, which he developed in his own workshop. From childhood, Justus was fascinated with chemistry.

At the age of 13, Liebig lived through the year without a summer, when the majority of food crops in the Northern Hemisphere were destroyed by a volcanic winter. Germany was among the hardest-hit nations in the global famine that ensued, and the experience is said to have shaped Liebig&#x27;s later work. Due in part to Liebig&#x27;s innovations in fertilizers and agriculture, the 1816 famine became known as &quot;the last great subsistence crisis in the Western world&quot;.

Liebig attended grammar school at the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium in Darmstadt, from the ages of 8 to 14. Leaving without a certificate of completion, he was apprenticed for several months to the apothecary Gottfried Pirsch (1792–1870) in Heppenheim before returning home, possibly because his father could not afford to pay his indentures (a legal contract that reflects or covers a debt or purchase obligation). He worked with his father for the next two years, then attended the University of Bonn, studying under Karl Wilhelm Gottlob Kastner, his father&#x27;s business associate. When Kastner moved to the University of Erlangen, Liebig followed him.

Liebig left Erlangen in March 1822, in part because of his involvement with the radical Korps Rhenania (a nationalist student organization), but also because of his hopes for more advanced chemical studies. The circumstances are clouded by possible scandal. Some scholars argue that he fled to Paris because of his involvement in radical student groups. In late October 1822, Liebig went to Paris to study on a grant obtained for him by Kastner from the Hessian government. He worked in the private laboratory of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and was also befriended by Alexander von Humboldt and Georges Cuvier (1769–1832). Liebig&#x27;s doctorate from Erlangen was conferred on 23 June 1823, a considerable time after he left, as a result of Kastner&#x27;s intervention on his behalf. Kastner pleaded that the requirement of a dissertation be waived and the degree granted &quot;in absentia&quot;.

==Research and development==
Liebig left Paris to return to Darmstadt in April 1824. On 26 May 1824, at the age of 21 and with Humboldt&#x27;s recommendation, Liebig became a professor &quot;extraordinarius&quot; at the University of Giessen. Liebig&#x27;s appointment was part of an attempt to modernize the University of Giessen and attract more students. He received a small stipend, without laboratory funding or access to facilities.

The presence of existing faculty complicated his situation: Professor Wilhelm Zimmermann (1780–1825) taught general chemistry as part of the philosophy faculty, leaving medical chemistry and pharmacy to Professor Philipp Vogt in the medical faculty. Vogt was happy to support a reorganization in which pharmacy was taught by Liebig and became the responsibility of the faculty of arts, rather than the faculty of medicine. Zimmermann found himself competing unsuccessfully with Liebig for students and their lecture fees. He refused to allow Liebig to use existing space and equipment and finally committed suicide on 19 July 1825. The deaths of Zimmermann and Professor Blumhof, who taught technology and mining, opened the way for Liebig to apply for a full professorship. Liebig was appointed to the &quot;Ordentlicher&quot; chair in chemistry on 7 December 1825, receiving a considerably increased salary and a laboratory allowance.

Liebig married Henriette &quot;Jettchen&quot; Moldenhauer (1807–1881), the daughter of a state official, in May 1826. They had five children: Georg (1827–1903), Agnes (1828–1862), Hermann (1831–1894), Johanna (1836–1925), and Marie (1845–1920). Although Liebig was Lutheran and Jettchen Catholic, their differences in religion appear to have been resolved amicably by bringing their sons up in the Lutheran faith and their daughters as Catholics.

===Transforming chemistry education===

Liebig and several associates proposed to create an institute for pharmacy and manufacturing within the university. The Senate, however, uncompromisingly rejected their idea, stating that training &quot;apothecaries, soapmakers, beer-brewers, dyers and vinegar-distillers&quot; was not the university&#x27;s task. As of 17 December 1825, they ruled that any such institution would have to be a private venture. This decision worked to Liebig&#x27;s advantage. As an independent venture, he could ignore university rules and accept matriculated and unmatriculated students. Liebig&#x27;s institute was widely advertised in pharmaceutical journals and opened in 1826. Its classes in practical chemistry and laboratory procedures for chemical analysis were taught in addition to Liebig&#x27;s formal courses at the university.

From 1825 to 1835, the laboratory was housed in the guardroom of a disused barracks on the edge of town. The main laboratory space was about in size and included a small lecture room, a storage closet, and a main room with ovens and work tables. An open colonnade outside could be used for dangerous reactions. Liebig could work there with eight or nine students at a time. He lived in a cramped apartment with his wife and children on the floor above.

Liebig was one of the first chemists to organize a laboratory in its present form, engaging with students in empirical research on a large scale through a combination of research and teaching. His methods of organic analysis enabled him to direct the analytical work of many graduate students. Liebig&#x27;s students were from many of the German states, as well as Britain and the United States. They helped create an international reputation for their &quot;Doktorvater.&quot; His laboratory became renowned as a model institution for the teaching of practical chemistry. It was also significant for its emphasis on applying discoveries in fundamental research to the development of specific chemical processes and products.

In 1833, Liebig convinced chancellor Justin von Linde to include the institute within the university. In 1839, he obtained government funds to build a lecture theatre and two separate laboratories designed by architect Paul Hofmann. The new chemistry laboratory featured innovative glass-fronted fume cupboards and venting chimneys. By 1852, when he left Giessen for Munich, more than 700 students of chemistry and pharmacy had studied with Liebig.

===Instrumentation===


A significant challenge facing 19th-century organic chemists was the lack of instruments and methods of analysis to support accurate, replicable analyses of organic materials. Many chemists worked on the problem of organic analysis, including French Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Swedish Jöns Jacob Berzelius, before Liebig developed his version of an apparatus for determining the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen content of organic substances in 1830. It involved an array of five glass bulbs, called a Kaliapparat, to trap the oxidation product of the carbon in the sample following its combustion. Before reaching the Kaliapparat, the combustion gases were conducted through a tube containing hygroscopic calcium chloride, which absorbed and retained the oxidation product of the hydrogen of the sample, namely water vapor. Next, in the Kaliapparat, carbon dioxide was absorbed in a potassium hydroxide solution in the three lower bulbs and used to measure the weight of carbon in the sample. For any substance consisting only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the percentage of oxygen was found by subtracting the carbon and hydrogen percentages from 100%; the remainder must be the percentage of oxygen. A charcoal furnace (a sheet steel tray in which the combustion tube was laid) was used for the combustion. Weighing carbon and hydrogen directly, rather than estimating them volumetrically, significantly increased the method&#x27;s accuracy of measurement. Liebig&#x27;s assistant, Carl Ettling, perfected glass-blowing techniques for producing the Kaliapparat and demonstrated them to visitors. Liebig&#x27;s kaliapparat simplified the method of quantitative organic analysis and rendered it routine. Brock suggests that the availability of a superior technical apparatus was one reason why Liebig was able to attract so many students to his laboratory. His method of combustion analysis was used pharmaceutically, and certainly made possible many contributions to organic, agricultural and biological chemistry.

Liebig also popularized the use of a counter-current water-cooling system for distillation, still referred to as a Liebig condenser. Liebig himself attributed the vapor condensation device to German pharmacist Johann Friedrich August Gottling, who had made improvements in 1794 to a design discovered independently by German chemist Christian Ehrenfried Weigel in 1771, by French scientist P. J. Poisonnier in 1779, and by Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin in 1791.

Although it was not widely adopted until after Liebig&#x27;s death, when safety legislation finally prohibited the use of mercury in making mirrors, Liebig proposed a process for silvering that eventually became the basis of modern mirror-making. In 1835, he reported that aldehydes reduce silver salts to metallic silver. After working with other scientists, Carl August von Steinheil approached Liebig in 1856 to see if he could develop a silvering technique capable of producing high-quality optical mirrors for use in reflecting telescopes. Liebig developed blemish-free mirrors by adding copper to ammoniated silver nitrate and sugar. An attempt to commercialize the process and &quot;drive out mercury mirror-making and its injurious influence on workers&#x27; health&quot; was unsuccessful. Liebig&#x27;s mirrors struggled commercially due to poor glass, which produced an off-color, greenish-yellow reflection. Rudely, Liebig commented that Frenchwomen especially hated his mirrors because Frenchwomen already looked yellow and sickly, and the mirrors just reminded them how ugly they were.

=== Organic chemistry ===
One of Liebig&#x27;s frequent collaborators was Friedrich Wöhler. They met in 1826 in Frankfurt, after independently reporting on the preparation of two substances, cyanic acid and fulminic acid, that apparently had the same composition, but very different characteristics. The silver fulminate investigated by Liebig was explosive, whereas the silver cyanate found by Wöhler was not. After reviewing the disputed analyses together, they agreed that both were valid. The discovery of these and other substances led Jöns Jacob Berzelius to suggest the idea of isomers, substances that are defined not simply by the number and kind of atoms in the molecule, but also by the arrangement of those atoms.

In 1832, Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler published an investigation of the oil of bitter almonds. They transformed pure oil into several halogenated compounds, which were further transformed in other reactions. Throughout these transformations, &quot;a single compound&quot; (which they named benzoyl) &quot;preserves its nature and composition unchanged in nearly all its associations with other bodies.&quot; Their experiments proved that a group of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms could behave like an element, take the place of an element, and can be exchanged for elements in chemical compounds. This laid the foundation for the doctrine of compound radicals, which can be seen as an early step in the development of structural chemistry.

The 1830s were a period of intense investigation of organic compounds by Liebig and his students, and of vigorous debate about the theoretical implications of their results. Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging 30 papers per year between 1830 and 1840. Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function. Other significant contributions by Liebig during this time include his examination of
the nitrogen content of bases;
the study of chlorination and the isolation of chloral (1832);
the identification of the ethyl radical (1834);
the oxidation of alcohol and formation of aldehyde (1835);
the polybasic theory of organic acids (1838);
and the degradation of urea (1837).

Writing about the analysis of urine, a complex organic product, he made a declaration that reveals both the changes that were occurring in chemistry over a short time and the impact of his own work. At a time when many chemists such as Jöns Jakob Berzelius still insisted on a hard and fast separation between the organic and inorganic, Liebig asserted:

Liebig&#x27;s arguments against any chemical distinction between living (physiological) and dead chemical processes proved a great inspiration to several of his students and others who were interested in materialism. Though Liebig distanced himself from the direct political implications of materialism, he tacitly supported the work of Carl Vogt (1817–1895), Jacob Moleschott (1822–1893), and Ludwig Büchner (1824–1899).

===Plant nutrition===
By the 1840s, Liebig was attempting to apply theoretical knowledge from organic chemistry to real-world problems of food availability. His book &quot;Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie&quot; (&quot;Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology&quot;) (1840) promoted the idea that chemistry could revolutionize agricultural practice, increasing yields and lowering costs. It was widely translated, vociferously critiqued, and highly influential.

Liebig&#x27;s book discussed chemical transformations within living systems, both plant and animal, outlining a theoretical approach to agricultural chemistry. The book&#x27;s first part focused on plant nutrition; the second was on chemical mechanisms of putrefaction and decay. Liebig&#x27;s awareness of both synthesis and degradation led him to become an early advocate of conservation, promoting ideas such as the recycling of sewage.

Liebig argued against prevalent theories about role of humus in plant nutrition, which held that decayed plant matter was the primary source of carbon for plant nutrition. Fertilizers were believed to act by breaking down humus, making it easier for plants to absorb. Associated with such ideas was the belief that some sort of &quot;vital force&quot; distinguished reactions involving organic as opposed to inorganic materials.

Early studies of photosynthesis had identified carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as important, but disagreed over their sources and mechanisms of action. Carbon dioxide was known to be taken in and oxygen released during photosynthesis, but researchers suggested that oxygen was obtained from carbon dioxide, rather than from water. Hydrogen was believed to come primarily from water. Researchers disagreed about whether sources of carbon and nitrogen were atmospheric or soil-based. Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure&#x27;s experiments, reported in &quot;Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation&quot; (1804), suggested that carbon was obtained from atmospheric rather than soil-based sources. It also indicated that water was a likely source of hydrogen. He also studied the absorption of minerals by plants, and observed that mineral concentrations in plants tended to reflect their presence in the soil in which the plants were grown. However, the implications of De Saussure&#x27;s results for theories of plant nutrition were neither clearly discussed nor easily understood.

Liebig reaffirmed the importance of De Saussure&#x27;s findings, and used them to critique humus theories, while regretting the limitations of De Saussure&#x27;s experimental techniques. Using more precise methods of measurement as a basis for estimation, he pointed out contradictions such as the inability of existing soil humus to provide enough carbon to support the plants growing in it. By the late 1830s, researchers such as Karl Sprengel were using Liebig&#x27;s methods of combustion analysis to assess manures, concluding that their value could be attributed to their constituent minerals. Liebig synthesized ideas about the mineral theory of plant nutrition and added his own conviction that inorganic materials could provide nutrients as effectively as organic sources.

In his theory of mineral nutrients, Liebig identified the chemical elements of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) as essential to plant growth. He reported that plants acquire carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) from the atmosphere and from water (H2O). In addition to emphasizing the importance of minerals in the soil, he argued that plants feed on nitrogen compounds derived from the air. This assertion was a source of contention for many years, and turned out to be true for legumes, but not for other plants.
Liebig also popularized Carl Sprengel&#x27;s &quot;theorem of minimum&quot; (known as the law of the minimum), stating that plant growth is not determined by the total resources available, but by the scarcest available resource. A plant&#x27;s development is limited by the one essential mineral that is in the relatively shortest supply. This concept of limitation can be visualized as &quot;Liebig&#x27;s barrel&quot;, a metaphorical barrel in which each stave represents a different element. A nutrient stave that is shorter than the others will cause the liquid contained in the barrel to spill out at that level. This is a qualitative version of the principles used for determining the application of fertilizer in modern agriculture.

&quot;Organic Chemistry&quot; was not intended as a guide to practical agriculture. Liebig&#x27;s lack of experience in practical applications, and differences between editions of the book, fueled considerable criticism. Nonetheless, Liebig&#x27;s writings had a profound impact on agriculture, spurring experiment and theoretical debate in Germany, England, and France.

One of his most recognized accomplishments is the development of nitrogen-based fertilizer. In the first two editions of his book (1840, 1842), Liebig reported that the atmosphere contained insufficient nitrogen, and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest possible crops. Liebig believed that nitrogen could be supplied in the form of ammonia, and recognized the possibility of substituting chemical fertilizers for natural ones (animal dung, etc.)

He later became convinced that nitrogen was sufficiently supplied by precipitation of ammonia from the atmosphere, and argued vehemently against the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers for many years. An early commercial attempt to produce his own fertilizers was unsuccessful, due to lack of nitrogen in the mixtures. When tested in a farmer&#x27;s field, Liebig&#x27;s manure was found to have no appreciable effect.

Liebig&#x27;s difficulties in reconciling theory and practice reflected that the real world of agriculture was more complex than was at first realized. By the publication of the seventh German edition of &quot;Agricultural Chemistry&quot; he had moderated some of his views, admitting some mistakes and returning to the position that nitrogen-based fertilizers were beneficial or even necessary.He was instrumental in the use of guano for nitrogen. In 1863 he published the book &quot;Es ist ja die Spitze meines lebens&quot; in which he revised his early perceptions, now appreciating soil life and in particular the biological N fixation. 
Nitrogen fertilizers are now widely used throughout the world, and their production is a substantial segment of the chemical industry.

===Plant and animal physiology===
Liebig&#x27;s work on applying chemistry to plant and animal physiology was especially influential. By 1842, he had published &quot;Chimie organique appliquée à la physiologie animale et à la pathologie&quot;, published in English as &quot; Animal Chemistry, or, Organic Chemistry in its Applications to Physiology and Pathology&quot;, presenting a chemical theory of metabolism. The experimental techniques used by Liebig and others often involved controlling and measuring diet, and monitoring and analyzing the products of animal metabolism, as indicators of internal metabolic processes. Liebig saw similarities between plant and animal metabolism, and suggested that nitrogenous animal matter was similar to, and derived from, plant matter. He categorized foodstuffs into two groups, nitrogenous materials which he believed were used to build animal tissue, and non-nitrogenous materials which he believed were involved in separate processes of respiration and generation of heat.

French researchers such as Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Jean-Baptiste Boussingault believed that animals assimilated sugars, proteins, and fats from plant materials and that animals could not synthesize complex molecules. Liebig&#x27;s work suggested a common ability of plants and animals to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. His experiments on fat metabolism convinced him that animals must be able to synthesize fats from sugars and starches. Other researchers built upon his work, confirming the abilities of animals to synthesize sugar and build fat.

Liebig also studied respiration, at one point measuring the &quot;ingesta and excreta&quot; of 855 soldiers, a bodyguard of the Grand Duke of Hessen-Darmstadt, for an entire month. He outlined an extremely speculative model of equations in which he attempted to explain how protein degradation might balance within a healthy body and result in pathological imbalances in cases of illness or inappropriate nutrition. This proposed model was justifiably criticized. Berzelius stingingly stated that &quot;this facile kind of physiological chemistry is created at the writing table&quot;. Some of the ideas that Liebig had enthusiastically incorporated were not supported by further research. The third and last edition of &quot;Animal Chemistry&quot; (1846) was substantially revised and did not include the equations.

The third area discussed in &quot;Animal Chemistry&quot; was fermentation and putrefaction. Liebig proposed chemical explanations for processes such as eremacausis (organic decomposition), describing the rearrangement of atoms as a result of unstable &quot;affinities&quot; reacting to external causes such as air or already decaying substances. Liebig identified the blood as the site of the body&#x27;s &quot;chemical factory&quot;, where he believed processes of synthesis and degradation took place. He presented a view of disease in terms of chemical process, in which healthy blood could be attacked by external contagia; secreting organs sought to transform and excrete such substances; and failure to do so could lead to their elimination through the skin, lungs, and other organs, potentially spreading contagion. Again, although the world was much more complicated than his theory, and many of his individual ideas were later proved wrong, Liebig managed to synthesize existing knowledge in a way that had implications for doctors, sanitarians, and social reformers. The English medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; reviewed Liebig&#x27;s work and translated his chemical lectures as part of its mission to establish a new era of medicine. Liebig&#x27;s ideas stimulated medical research, led to the development of better techniques for testing experimental models of metabolism, and pointed to chemistry as fundamental to the understanding of health and disease.

In 1850, Liebig investigated spontaneous human combustion, dismissing the simplistic explanations based on ethanol due to alcoholism.

===Liebig and the chemistry of food===

====Methods of cookery====
Liebig drew upon his work in plant nutrition and plant and animal metabolism to develop a theory of nutrition, which had implications for cookery. In his &quot;Researches on the Chemistry of Food&quot; (1847) Liebig argued that eating not only meat fibre, but also meat juices, which contained various inorganic chemicals, was important. These vital ingredients would be lost during conventional boiling or roasting in which cooking liquids were discarded. For optimum nutritional quality, Liebig advised that cooks should either sear the meat initially to retain fluids, or retain and use cooking liquids (as in soups or stews).

Liebig was acclaimed in &quot;The Lancet&quot; for revealing &quot;the true principles of cookery&quot;, and physicians promoted &quot;rational diets&quot; based on his ideas. Well-known British cookery writer Eliza Acton responded to Liebig by modifying the cookery techniques in the third edition of her &quot;Modern Cookery for Private Families&quot;, and subtitling the edition accordingly. Liebig&#x27;s idea that &quot;searing meat seals in the juices&quot;, though still widely believed, is not true.

====Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company====

Building on his theories of the nutritional value of meat fluids, and seeking an inexpensive nutrition source for Europe&#x27;s poor, Liebig developed a formula for producing beef extract. The details were published in 1847 so that &quot;the benefit of it should ... be placed at the command of as large a number of persons as possible by the extension of the manufacture, and consequently a reduction in the cost&quot;.

Production was not economically feasible in Europe, where meat was expensive, but in Uruguay and New South Wales, meat was an inexpensive byproduct of the leather industry. In 1865, Liebig partnered with Belgian engineer George Christian Giebert, and was named scientific director of Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat Company, located in Fray Bentos in Uruguay.

Other companies also attempted to market meat extracts under the name &quot;Liebig&#x27;s Extract of Meat&quot;. In Britain, a competitor&#x27;s right to use the name was successfully defended on the grounds that the name had fallen into general use and become a generic term before the creation of any particular company. The judge asserted that &quot;Purchasers must use their eyes&quot;, and considered the presentation of the products to be sufficiently different to enable the discriminating consumer to determine which of the products bore Liebig&#x27;s signature and was supported by Liebig himself.

Liebig&#x27;s company initially promoted their &quot;meat tea&quot; for its curative powers and nutritional value as a cheap, nutritious alternative to real meat. But such claims did not hold up to scrutiny. In 1868 the German physiologist Edward Kemmerich ran an experiment involving feeding the extract to dogs, every one of which died. After claims of its nutritional value were questioned, the company emphasized its convenience and flavor, marketing it as a comfort food.

The Liebig company worked with popular cookery writers in various countries to popularize their products. German cookery writer Henriette Davidis wrote recipes for &quot;Improved and Economic Cookery&quot; and other cookbooks. Katharina Prato wrote an Austro-Hungarian recipe book, &quot;Die Praktische Verwerthung Kochrecepte&quot; (1879). Hannah M. Young was commissioned in England to write &quot;Practical Cookery Book&quot; for the Liebig Company. In the United States, Maria Parloa extolled the benefits of Liebig&#x27;s extract. Colorful calendars and trading cards were also marketed to popularize the product.

The company also worked with British chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe to develop a related product, which it registered some years after Liebig&#x27;s death, under the &quot;Oxo&quot; trademark. Oxo was trademarked worldwide in 1899 and in the United Kingdom in 1900. Originally a liquid, Oxo was released in cubed solid form in 1911.

====Marmite====
Liebig studied other foods, as well. He promoted the use of baking powder to make lighter bread, studied the chemistry of coffee-making and oatmeal. He is considered to have made possible the invention of Marmite, because of his discovery that yeast could be concentrated to form yeast extract.

Infant Formula

Liebig produced some of the world&#x27;s first infant formula, a breast-milk substitute for babies who could not breast-feed. However, the product proved controversial, even though Liebig did not make any royalties off it. Liebig first came up with the idea based on the struggles of his favorite daughter, Johanna, who struggled to breastfeed her daughter, Carolina, who was born in 1864. (Johanna did not want to seek a wet-nurse, a common but controversial practice at the time.) Carolina, according to Liebig, thrived on the formula. But other scientists were skeptical. One of them, a French doctor in Paris named Jean-Anne-Henri Depaul, decided to test his formula on four infants whose mothers could not suckle.

Liebig himself prepared the first batches of formula. Depaul first gave it to a set of twins, who were born somewhat premature and weighed 2.24 kilograms (4.93 pounds) and 2.64 kg (5.82 lbs.). Both died within two days. Depaul tried it on a third baby, born full-term at 3.37 kg (7.43 lbs.); it soon began passing green &quot;starvation stools&quot; and died within three days. A fourth child, weighing 2.76 kg, also developed green stools and died within four days. At this point, Depaul stopped the experiment.

At first, Depaul kept the experiment to himself. But he attended a meeting of the French Academy of Medicine. And while didn&#x27;t want to say anything at first, he felt he had to after another member of the Academy rose to speak, a pharmacist named Nicholas-Jean-Baptiste-Gaston Guibourt. Guibourt had grave doubts about Liebig&#x27;s artificial milk, calling it &quot;fake milk&quot; (in French, &quot;lait factice&quot;). As historian Caroline Lieffers has written, &quot;He [i.e., Guibourt] worried that the substance would either spoil in liquid form or lose its nutritive quality and convenience in solid form.&quot; Upon hearing Guibourt speak, Depaul felt it incumbent upon him to speak as well, and mentioned his experiments with Liebig&#x27;s formula.

Many ethical questions were quickly raised. Publications in France generally supported Depaul, while German publications rallied to Liebig&#x27;s defense.

== Major works ==
Liebig founded the journal &quot;Annalen der Chemie&quot;, which he edited from 1832. Originally titled &quot;Annalen der Pharmacie&quot;, it became &quot;Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie&quot; to more accurately reflect its content. It became the leading journal of organic chemistry, and still exists, albeit under the name &quot;European Journal of Organic Chemistry&quot; after several mergers with other journals. The volumes from his lifetime are often referenced just as &quot;Liebigs Annalen&quot;; following his death the title was officially changed to &quot;Justus Liebig&#x27;s Annalen der Chemie&quot;.

Liebig published widely in &quot;Liebigs Annalen&quot; and elsewhere, in newspapers and journals. Most of his books were published concurrently in both German and English, and many were translated into other languages, as well. Some of his most influential titles include:
* &quot;Ueber das Studium der Naturwissenschaften und über den Zustand der Chemie in Preußen&quot; (1840) Digital edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf
* &quot;Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie&quot;; in English, &quot;Organic Chemistry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology&quot; (1840)
* &quot;Chimie organique appliquée à la physiologie animale et à la pathologie&quot;; in English, &quot; Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology&quot; (1842)
* &quot;Familiar letters on chemistry and its relation to commerce, physiology and agriculture&quot; (1843)
* &quot;Chemische Briefe&quot; (1844) Digital edition (1865) by the University and State Library Düsseldorf

In addition to books and articles, he wrote thousands of letters, most of them to other scientists.

Liebig also directly influenced the German publication of John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;Logic.&quot; Liebig had a close friendship with the Vieweg family publishing house. He arranged for his former student Jacob Schiel (1813–1889) to translate Mill&#x27;s important work for German publication. Liebig liked Mill&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot; in part because it promoted science as a means to social and political progress, but also because Mill featured several examples of Liebig&#x27;s research as an ideal for the scientific method. In this way, he sought to reform politics in the German states.

==Later life==
In 1852, after asking Hermann Kopp to take over management of the &quot;Annalen der Chemie&quot;, Liebig accepted an appointment from King Maximilian II of Bavaria to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He also became the Royal scientific advisor to King Maxilimian II, who hoped to transform the University of Munich into a center for scientific research and development. In part, Liebig accepted the post because, at age 50, he was finding supervision of large numbers of laboratory students increasingly difficult. His new accommodations in Munich reflected this shift in focus. They included a comfortable house suitable for extensive entertaining, a small laboratory, and a newly built lecture theatre capable of holding 300 people with a demonstration laboratory at the front. There, he gave lectures to the university and fortnightly to the public. In his position as a promoter of science, Liebig was appointed president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, becoming perpetual president of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1858.

In the 1850s, Liebig moved next door to the noted classics scholar and philologist Friederich Thiersch in the city of Munich. Liebig had previously scorned philologists like Thiersch in articles. (Liebig promoted science over supposedly impractical fields like the classics.) But Liebig&#x27;s most beloved daughter, Johanna, fell in love with Thiersch&#x27;s second son, Karl, who had studied medicine in several cities, including Berlin and Vienna. Johanna and Karl reportedly had a happy marriage, producing six children: four daughters and two sons. It was fairly common for the sons and daughters of academics to marry in Germany then.

Liebig enjoyed a personal friendship with Maximilian II, who died on 10 March 1864. After Maximilian&#x27;s death, Liebig and other liberal Protestant scientists in Bavaria were increasingly opposed by ultramontane Catholics.

Liebig died in Munich in 1873, and is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.

==Awards and honors==
Liebig was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1837.

He became a first-class member of the Ludwig Order, founded by Ludwig I, and awarded by Ludwig II on 24 July 1837.

In 1838, he became a correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he joined as a foreign member.

The British Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal &quot;for his discoveries in organic chemistry, and particularly for his development of the composition and theory of organic radicals&quot; in 1840.

In 1841, botanist Stephan Friedrich Ladislaus Endlicher (1804–1849) published a genus of flowering plants from Malesia, belonging to the family Gesneriaceae, as &quot;Liebigia&quot; in his honour.

King Ludwig II of Bavaria ennobled Liebig on 29 December 1845, conferring on him the hereditary title of &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Liebig. In English, the closest translation is Baron von Liebig.

In 1850, he received the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, presented by chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, the French trade minister.

He was honored with the Prussian Order of Merit for Science by Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia in 1851.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

In 1869, Liebig was awarded the Albert Medal by the Royal Society of Arts, &quot;for his numerous valuable researches and writings, which have contributed most importantly to the development of food-economy and agriculture, to the advancement of chemical science, and to the benefits derived from that science by Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce.&quot;

===Posthumous honors===
Liebig&#x27;s portrait appeared on the banknote issued by the Reichsbank from 1935 until 1945. Printing ceased in 1945 but the note remained in circulation until the issue of the Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948.

In 1946, after the end of World War II, the University of Giessen was officially renamed after him, &quot;Justus-Liebig-Universität Giessen&quot;.

In 1953, the West German post office issued a stamp in his honor.

In 1953, the third General Assembly of the International Scientific Centre of Fertilizers (CIEC), founded in 1932, was organized in Darmstadt to honor Justus von Liebig on the 150th anniversary of his birth.

A portrait of Liebig hangs in the Burlington House headquarters of the Royal Society of Chemistry. It was presented to the society&#x27;s forerunner, the Chemical Society, by his god-daughter, Mrs Alex Tweedie, née Harley, daughter of Emma Muspratt.

===Liebig medals===
Some organizations have granted medals in honor of Liebig. In 1871, the Versammlung deutscher Land- und Forstwirte (Assembly of German Farmers and Foresters) was first awarded a Liebig Gold Medal, given to Theodor Reuning. The image was struck from a portrait commissioned in 1869 from Friedrich Brehmer.

For several years, the Liebig Trust Fund, established by Baron Liebig, was administered by the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences at Munich and members of the Liebig family. They were empowered to award gold and silver Liebig Medals to deserving German scientists &quot;for the purpose of encouraging research in agricultural science&quot;. Silver medals could be awarded to scientists from other countries. Some of those who received medals include:

* 1893, silver, Sir John Lawes and Joseph Henry Gilbert, England
* 1894, silver, Professor Eugene Woldemar Hilgard, United States, &quot;for meritorious work in the investigation of the physical and chemical properties of soils.&quot;
* 1896, gold, Professor Friedrich Stohmann, professor of agricultural chemistry in Leipzig University.
* 1899, gold, Albert Schultz-Lupitz, Germany
* 1908, gold, Max Rubner, Germany

In 1903, the Verein deutscher Chemiker (Association of German Chemists) also had a medal struck using Brehmer&#x27;s portrait. Their Liebig Medal was first awarded in 1903 to Adolf von Baeyer, and in 1904 to Dr. Rudolf Knietsch of the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik. , it continues to be awarded.

At the third World Congress of CIEC, held at Heidelberg in 1957, the &quot;Sprengel-Liebig Medal&quot; was awarded to Dr. E. Feisst, president of CIEC, for outstanding contributions in agricultural chemistry.

<text>Joanne Rowling ( ; born 31 July 1965), known by her pen name , is a British author and philanthropist. She is the author of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, a seven-volume fantasy novel series published from 1997 to 2007. The series has sold over 600 million copies, been translated into 84 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games. &quot;The Casual Vacancy&quot; was her first novel for adults. She writes &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot;, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith. 

Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, concluding with &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; (2007). By 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; had named her the world&#x27;s highest-paid author.

The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series. Its influences include &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children&#x27;s market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see Rowling&#x27;s writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive. There were also religious debates over the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

Rowling has won many accolades for her work. She has been appointed an OBE and a Member of the Companions of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes. She established the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000, and co-founded the charity Lumos in 2005. Rowling&#x27;s philanthropy centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children. In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Rowling&#x27;s charitable giving totalled US$160 million. She has also donated to Britain&#x27;s Labour Party, and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit. 

Since 2017, Rowling has been vocal about her opinions on transgender people and related civil rights. Her comments, described as transphobic by critics and LGBT rights organisations, have divided feminists, fuelled debates on freedom of speech and cancel culture, and prompted declarations of support for transgender people from the culture sector.

== Name ==
Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, before her remarriage her name was Joanne Rowling, or Jo. At birth, she had no middle name. Staff at Bloomsbury Publishing suggested that she use two initials rather than her full name, anticipating that young boys – their target audience – would not want to read a book written by a woman. She chose &quot;K&quot; as the second initial, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Rowling, and because of the ease of pronunciation of the two consecutive letters. Following her 2001 remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and family ===
Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, to a middle-class family. Her parents Anne (née Volant) and Peter (&quot;Pete&quot;) James Rowling had met the previous year on a train, sharing a trip from King&#x27;s Cross station, London, to their naval postings at Arbroath, Scotland. Rowling&#x27;s mother was with the Wrens and her father with the Royal Navy. Pete Rowling was the son of a machine-tool setter who later opened a grocery shop. They left the navy life and sought a country home to raise the baby they were expecting, and married on 14 March 1965 when both were 19. The Rowlings settled in Yate, where Pete started work as an assembly-line production worker at the Bristol Siddeley factory. The company became part of Rolls-Royce, and he worked his way into management as a chartered engineer. Anne Rowling later worked as a science technician. Neither of Rowling&#x27;s parents attended university.

Rowling is two years older than her sister, Dianne, whose birth was Rowling&#x27;s earliest memory. When she was four, Rowling&#x27;s family moved to Winterbourne, Gloucestershire. She began at St Michael&#x27;s Church of England Primary School in Winterbourne when she was five. The Rowlings lived near a family called Potter – a name Rowling always liked. Rowling&#x27;s mother liked to read and the family&#x27;s homes were filled with books. Her father read &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; to his daughters, while her mother introduced them to the animals in Richard Scarry&#x27;s books. Rowling&#x27;s first attempt at writing, a story called &quot;Rabbit&quot; composed when she was six, was inspired by Scarry&#x27;s creatures.

When Rowling was about nine, the family purchased the historic Church Cottage in Tutshill. In 1974, Rowling began attending the nearby Church of England School. Biographer Sean Smith describes her teacher as a &quot;battleaxe&quot; who &quot;struck fear into the hearts of the children&quot;; Rowling&#x27;s teacher seated her in &quot;dunces&#x27; row&quot; after she performed poorly on an arithmetic test. In 1975, Rowling joined a Brownies pack. Its special events and parties, and the pack groups (Fairies, Pixies, Sprites, Elves, Gnomes and Imps) provided a magical world away from her stern teacher. When she was eleven or twelve, she wrote a short story, &quot;The Seven Cursed Diamonds&quot;. She later described herself during this period as &quot;the epitome of a bookish child – short and squat, thick National Health glasses, living in a world of complete daydreams&quot;.

=== Secondary school and university ===
Rowling&#x27;s secondary school was Wyedean School and College, a state school she began attending at the age of eleven and where she was bullied. Rowling was inspired by her favourite teacher, Lucy Shepherd, who taught the importance of structure and precision in writing. Smith writes that Rowling &quot;craved to play heavy electric guitar&quot;, and describes her as &quot;intelligent yet shy&quot;. Her teacher Dale Neuschwander was impressed by her imagination. When she was a young teenager, Rowling&#x27;s great-aunt gave her &quot;Hons and Rebels&quot;, the autobiography of the civil rights activist Jessica Mitford. Mitford became Rowling&#x27;s heroine, and she read all her books.

Anne had a strong influence on her daughter. Early in Rowling&#x27;s life, the support of her mother and sister instilled confidence and enthusiasm for storytelling. Anne was a creative and accomplished cook, who helped lead her daughters&#x27; Brownie activities, and took a job in the chemistry department at Wyedean while her daughters were there. The three walked to and from school together, with a relationship more like sisters than mother and daughters. John Nettleship, the head of science at Wyedean, described Anne as &quot;absolutely brilliant, a sparkling character ... very imaginative&quot;. Anne was diagnosed with a &quot;virulent strain&quot; of multiple sclerosis when she was 34 or 35 and Jo was 15, and had to quit her job. Rowling&#x27;s home life was complicated by her mother&#x27;s illness and a strained relationship with her father. Rowling later said &quot;home was a difficult place to be&quot;, and that her teenage years were unhappy. In 2020, she wrote that her father would have preferred a son and described herself as having severe obsessive–compulsive disorder in her teens. She began to smoke, took an interest in alternative rock, and adopted Siouxsie Sioux&#x27;s back-combed hair and black eyeliner. Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth, owned a turquoise Ford Anglia that provided an escape from her difficult home life and the means for Harris and Rowling to broaden their activities.

Living in a small town with pressures at home, Rowling became more interested in her schoolwork. Steve Eddy, her first secondary school English teacher, remembers her as &quot;not exceptional&quot; but &quot;one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English&quot;. Rowling took A-levels in English, French, and German, achieving two As and a B, and was named head girl at Wyedean. She applied to Oxford University in 1982 but was rejected. Biographers attribute her rejection to privilege, as she had attended a state school rather than a private one.

Rowling always wanted to be a writer, but chose to study French and the classics at the University of Exeter for practical reasons, influenced by her parents who thought job prospects would be better with evidence of bilingualism. She later stated that Exeter was not initially what she expected (&quot;to be among lots of similar people – thinking radical thoughts&quot;) but that she enjoyed herself after she met more people like her. She was an average student at Exeter, described by biographers as prioritising her social life over her studies, and lacking ambition and enthusiasm. Rowling recalls doing little work at university, preferring to read Dickens and Tolkien. She earned a BA in French from Exeter, graduating in 1987 after a year of study in Paris.

=== Inspiration and mother&#x27;s death ===
After university, Rowling moved to a flat in Clapham Junction with friends, and took a course to become a bilingual secretary. While she was working temporary jobs in London, Amnesty International hired her to document human rights issues in French-speaking Africa. She began writing adult novels while working as a temp, although they were never published. In 1990, she planned to move with her boyfriend to Manchester, and frequently took long train trips to visit. In mid-1990, she was on a train delayed by four hours from Manchester to London, when the characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger came plainly into her mind. Having no pen or paper allowed her to fully explore the characters and their story in her imagination before she reached her flat and began to write.

Rowling moved to Manchester around November 1990. She described her time in Manchester, where she worked for the Chamber of Commerce and at Manchester University in temp jobs, as a &quot;year of misery&quot;. Her mother died of multiple sclerosis on 30 December 1990. At the time, she was writing &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and had never told her mother about it. Her mother&#x27;s death heavily affected Rowling&#x27;s writing. She later said that her literary creation of the Mirror of Erised is about her mother&#x27;s death, and noted an &quot;evident parallelism&quot; between Harry confronting his own mortality and her life.

The pain of the loss of her mother was compounded when some personal effects her mother had left her were stolen. With the end of the relationship with her boyfriend, and &quot;being made redundant from an office job in Manchester&quot;, Rowling described herself as being in a state of &quot;fight or flight&quot;. An advertisement in &quot;The Guardian&quot; led her to move to Porto, Portugal, in November 1991 to teach night classes in English as a foreign language, writing during the day.

=== Marriage, divorce and single parenthood ===

Five months after arriving in Porto, Rowling met the Portuguese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar and found that they shared an interest in Jane Austen. By mid-1992, they were planning a trip to London to introduce Arantes to Rowling&#x27;s family, when she had a miscarriage. The relationship was troubled, but they married on 16 October 1992. Their daughter Jessica Isabel Rowling Arantes (named after Jessica Mitford) was born on 27 July 1993 in Portugal. By this time, Rowling had finished the first three chapters of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; – almost as they were eventually published – and had drafted the rest of the novel.

Rowling experienced domestic abuse during her marriage. Arantes said in June 2020 that he had slapped her and did not regret it. Rowling described the marriage as &quot;short and catastrophic&quot;. She says she was not allowed to have a house key and that her husband used the growing manuscript of her first book as a hostage. Rowling and Arantes separated on 17 November 1993 after Arantes threw her out of the house; she returned with the police to retrieve Jessica and her belongings and went into hiding for two weeks before she left Portugal. In late 1993, with a draft of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in her suitcase, Rowling moved with her daughter to Edinburgh, Scotland, planning to stay with her sister until Christmas.

Her biographer Sean Smith raises the question of why Rowling chose to stay with her sister rather than her father. Rowling has spoken of an estrangement from her father, stating in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a good relationship from my point of view for a very long time but I had a need to please and I kept that going for a long time and then there ... just came a point at which I had to pull up and say I can&#x27;t do this anymore.&quot; Pete had married his secretary within two years of Anne&#x27;s death, and &quot;The Scotsman&quot; reported in 2003 that &quot;[t]he speed of his decision to move in with his secretary ... distressed both sisters and a fault-line now separated them and their father.&quot; Rowling said in 2012 that they had not spoken in the last nine years.

Rowling sought government assistance and got £69 (US$103) per week from Social Security; not wanting to burden her recently married sister, she moved to a flat that she described as mouse-ridden. She later described her economic status as being as &quot;poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless&quot;. Seven years after graduating from university, she saw herself as a failure. Tison Pugh writes that the &quot;grinding effects of poverty, coupled with her concern for providing for her daughter as a single parent, caused great hardship&quot;. Her marriage had failed, and she was jobless with a dependent child, but she later described this as &quot;liberating&quot; her to focus on writing. She has said that &quot;Jessica kept me going&quot;. Her old school friend, Sean Harris, lent her £600 ($900), which allowed her to move to a flat in Leith, where she finished &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;.

Arantes arrived in Scotland in March 1994 seeking both Rowling and Jessica. On 15 March 1994, Rowling sought an action of interdict (order of restraint); the interdict was granted and Arantes returned to Portugal. Early in the year, Rowling began to experience a deep depression and sought medical help when she contemplated suicide. With nine months of therapy, her mental health gradually improved. She filed for divorce on 10 August 1994; the divorce was finalised on 26 June 1995.

Rowling wanted to finish the book before enrolling in a teacher training course, fearing she might not be able to finish once she started the course. She often wrote in cafés, including Nicolson&#x27;s, part-owned by her brother-in-law. Secretarial work brought in £15 ($22.50) per week, but she would lose government benefits if she earned more. In mid-1995, a friend gave her money that allowed her to come off benefits and enrol full-time in college. Still needing money and expecting to make a living by teaching, Rowling began a teacher training course in August 1995 at Moray House School of Education after completing her first novel. She earned her teaching certificate in July 1996 and began teaching at Leith Academy. Rowling later said that writing the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book had saved her life and that her concerns about &quot;love, loss, separation, death ... are reflected in the first book&quot;.

=== Publishing &quot;Harry Potter&quot; ===


Rowling completed &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; in June 1995. The initial draft included an illustration of Harry by a fireplace, showing a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. Following an enthusiastic report from an early reader, Christopher Little Literary Agency agreed to represent Rowling. Her manuscript was submitted to twelve publishers, all of which rejected it. Barry Cunningham, who ran the children&#x27;s literature department at Bloomsbury Publishing, bought it, after Nigel Newton, who headed Bloomsbury at the time, saw his eight-year-old daughter finish one chapter and want to keep reading. Rowling recalls Cunningham telling her, &quot;You&#x27;ll never make any money out of children&#x27;s books, Jo.&quot; Rowling was awarded a writer&#x27;s grant by the Scottish Arts Council to support her childcare costs and finances before &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; publication, and to aid in writing the sequel, &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. On 26 June 1997, Bloomsbury published &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; with an initial print run of 5,650 copies. Before &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; was published, Rowling had received £2,800 ($4,200) in royalties.

&quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; introduces Harry Potter. Harry is a wizard who lives with his non-magical relatives until his eleventh birthday, when he is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Rowling wrote six sequels, which follow Harry&#x27;s adventures at Hogwarts with friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley and his attempts to defeat Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry&#x27;s parents when he was a child.
Rowling received the news that the US rights were being auctioned at the Bologna Children&#x27;s Book Fair. To her surprise and delight, Scholastic Corporation bought the rights for $105,000. She bought a flat in Edinburgh with the money from the sale. Arthur A. Levine, head of the imprint at Scholastic, pushed for a name change. He wanted &quot;Harry Potter and the School of Magic&quot;; as a compromise Rowling suggested &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; was released in the United States in September 1998. It was not widely reviewed, but the reviews it received were generally positive. &quot;Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller by December.

The next three books in the series were released in quick succession between 1998 and 2000: &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (1998), &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (1999), and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), each selling millions of copies. When &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; had not appeared by 2002, rumours circulated that Rowling was suffering writer&#x27;s block. Rowling denied these rumours, stating the 896-page book took three years to write because of its length. It was published in June 2003, selling millions of copies on the first day. &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; was released two years later in July 2005, again selling millions of copies on the first day. The series ended with &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, published in July 2007.

=== Films ===
In 1999, Warner Bros. purchased film rights to the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels for a reported $1 million. Rowling accepted the offer with the provision that the studio only produce &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films based on books she authored, while retaining the right to final script approval, and some control over merchandising. &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, an adaptation of the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book, was released in November 2001. Steve Kloves wrote the screenplays for all but the fifth film, with Rowling&#x27;s assistance, ensuring that his scripts kept to the plots of the novels.
The film series concluded with &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, which was adapted in two parts; part one was released on 19 November 2010, and part two followed on 15 July 2011.

Warner Bros. announced an expanded relationship with Rowling in 2013, including a planned series of films about her character Newt Scamander, fictitious author of &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;. The first film of five, a prequel to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, set roughly 70 years earlier, was released in November 2016. Rowling wrote the screenplay, which was released as a book. &quot;Crimes of Grindelwald&quot; was released in November 2018. &quot;Secrets of Dumbledore&quot; was released in April 2022. 
In November 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Warner Bros. Discovery was not actively planning to continue the film series or to develop any further films related to the Wizarding World franchise.

=== Religion, wealth and remarriage ===

By 1998, Rowling was portrayed in the media as a &quot;penniless divorcee hitting the jackpot&quot;. According to her biographer Sean Smith, the publicity became effective marketing for &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, but her journey from living on benefits to wealth brought, along with fame, concerns from different groups about the books&#x27; portrayals of the occult and gender roles. Ultimately, Smith says that these concerns served to &quot;enhance [her] public profile rather than damage it&quot;.

Rowling identifies as a Christian. Although she grew up next door to her church, accounts of the family&#x27;s church attendance differ. She began attending a Church of Scotland congregation, where Jessica was christened, around the time she was writing &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. In a 2012 interview, she said she belonged to the Scottish Episcopal Church. Rowling has stated that she believes in God, but has experienced doubt, and that her struggles with faith play a part in her books. She does not believe in magic or witchcraft.

Rowling married Neil Murray, a doctor, in 2001. The couple intended to marry that July in the Galapagos, but when this leaked to the press, they delayed their wedding and changed their holiday destination to Mauritius. After the UK Press Complaints Commission ruled that a magazine had breached Jessica&#x27;s privacy when the eight-year-old was included in a photograph of the family taken during that trip, Murray and Rowling sought a more private and quiet place to live and work. Rowling bought Killiechassie House and its estate in Perthshire, Scotland, and on 26 December 2001, the couple had a small, private wedding there, officiated by an Episcopalian priest who travelled from Edinburgh. Their son, David Gordon Rowling Murray, was born in 2003, and their daughter Mackenzie Jean Rowling Murray in 2005.

In 2004, &quot;Forbes&quot; named Rowling &quot;the first billion-dollar author&quot;. Rowling denied that she was a billionaire in a 2005 interview. By 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; concluded she was no longer a billionaire due to her charitable donations and high UK taxes. She was named the world&#x27;s highest paid author by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2008, 2017 and 2019. Her UK sales total in excess of £238 million, which made her the best-selling living author in Britain, until 2025 when she was supplanted by Julia Donaldson. The 2021 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List estimated Rowling&#x27;s fortune at £820 million, ranking her as the 196th-richest person in the UK. As of 2020, she also owns a £4.5 million Georgian house in Kensington and a £2 million home in Edinburgh, where she lives with Murray and her two youngest children.

=== Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith ===

In mid-2011, Rowling left Christopher Little Literary Agency and followed her agent Neil Blair to the Blair Partnership. He represented her for the publication of &quot;The Casual Vacancy&quot;, released in September 2012 by Little, Brown and Company. It was Rowling&#x27;s first since &quot;Harry Potter&quot; ended, and her first book for adults. A contemporary take on 19th-century British fiction about village life, &quot;Casual Vacancy&quot; was promoted as a black comedy, while the critic Ian Parker described it as a &quot;rural comedy of manners&quot;. It was adapted to a miniseries co-created by the BBC and HBO. 

Little, Brown and Company also published &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Calling&quot;, the purported début novel of Robert Galbraith, in April 2013. Telling the story of detective Cormoran Strike, a disabled veteran of the War in Afghanistan, it initially sold 1,500 copies in hardback. After an investigation prompted by discussion on Twitter, the journalist Richard Brooks contacted Rowling&#x27;s agent, who confirmed Galbraith was Rowling&#x27;s pseudonym. Rowling later said she enjoyed working as Robert Galbraith, a name she took from Robert F. Kennedy, a personal hero, and Ella Galbraith, a name she invented for herself in childhood. After the revelation of her identity, sales of &quot;Cuckoo&#x27;s Calling&quot; escalated.

Continuing the &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; series of detective novels, &quot;The Silkworm&quot; was released in 2014; &quot;Career of Evil&quot; in 2015; &quot;Lethal White&quot; in 2018; &quot;Troubled Blood&quot; in 2020; &quot;The Ink Black Heart&quot; in 2022; and &quot;The Running Grave&quot; in 2023. In 2017, BBC One aired the first episode of the five-season series &quot;Strike&quot;, a television adaptation of the &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; novels starring Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger, with a sixth season being shot in 2024. The series was picked up by HBO for distribution in the United States and Canada.

In September 2024, Rowling tweeted that she had begun work on a futuristic novel; she added that there were three different projects she could turn to, once the tenth and final planned &quot;Strike&quot; novel had been published.

=== Later &quot;Harry Potter&quot; works ===


&quot;Pottermore&quot;, a website with information and stories about characters in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, launched in 2011. On its release, &quot;Pottermore&quot; was rooted in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels, tracing the series&#x27;s story in an interactive format. Its brand was associated with Rowling: she introduced the site in a video as a shared media environment to which she and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans would contribute. The site was substantially revised in 2015 to resemble an encyclopedia of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; premiered in the West End in May 2016 and on Broadway in July. At its London premiere, Rowling confirmed that she would not write any more &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books. Rowling collaborated with writer Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany. &quot;Cursed Child&quot; script was published as a book in July 2016. The play follows the friendship between Harry&#x27;s son Albus and Scorpius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy&#x27;s son, at Hogwarts.

In April 2023, it was announced that the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; television series will span 10 years of production and feature a season dedicated to each of the seven &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books, with Rowling as executive producer. It will release in 2026.

=== Children&#x27;s stories ===
&quot;The Ickabog&quot; was Rowling&#x27;s first book aimed at children since &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. Ickabog is a monster that turns out to be real; a group of children find out the truth about the Ickabog and save the day. Rowling released &quot;The Ickabog&quot; for free online in mid-2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. She began writing it in 2009 but set it aside to focus on other works including &quot;Casual Vacancy&quot;. Scholastic held a competition to select children&#x27;s art for the print edition, which was published in the US and Canada on 10 November 2020. Profits went to charities focused on COVID-19 relief.

In &quot;The Christmas Pig&quot;, a young boy loses his favourite stuffed animal, a pig, and the Christmas Pig guides him through the fantastical Land of the Lost to retrieve it. The novel was published on 12 October 2021 and became a bestseller in the UK and the US.

== Influences ==
Rowling has named Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence. She said Mitford had &quot;been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War&quot;, and that what inspired her about Mitford was that she was &quot;incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target&quot;. As a child, Rowling read C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, Elizabeth Goudge&#x27;s &quot;The Little White Horse&quot;, &quot;Manxmouse&quot; by Paul Gallico, and books by E. Nesbit and Noel Streatfeild. Rowling describes Jane Austen as her &quot;favourite author of all time&quot;.

Rowling acknowledges Homer, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare as literary influences. Scholars agree that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is heavily influenced by the children&#x27;s fantasy of writers such as Lewis, Goudge, Nesbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Diana Wynne Jones. According to the critic Beatrice Groves, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is also &quot;rooted in the Western literary tradition&quot;, including the classics. Commentators also note similarities to the children&#x27;s stories of Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl. Rowling expresses admiration for Lewis, in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent, but rejects any connection with Dahl.

Earlier works prominently featuring characters who learn to use magic include Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea&quot; series, in which a school of wizardry also appears, and the &quot;Chrestomanci&quot; books by Jones. Rowling&#x27;s setting of a &quot;school of witchcraft and wizardry&quot; departs from the still older tradition of protagonists as apprentices to magicians, exemplified by &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;: yet this trope does appear in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, when Harry receives individual instruction from Remus Lupin and other teachers. Rowling also draws on the tradition of stories set in boarding schools, a major example of which is Thomas Hughes&#x27;s 1857 volume &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;.

== Style and themes ==
=== Style and allusions ===
Rowling is known primarily as an author of fantasy and children&#x27;s literature. Her writing in other genres, including literary fiction and murder mystery, has received less critical attention. Rowling&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, has been defined as a fairy tale, a Bildungsroman and a boarding-school story. Her other writings have been described by Pugh as gritty contemporary fiction with historical influences (&quot;The Casual Vacancy&quot;) and hardboiled detective fiction (&quot;Cormoran Strike&quot;).

In &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, Rowling juxtaposes the extraordinary against the ordinary. Her narrative features two worlds – the mundane and the fantastic – but it differs from typical portal fantasy in that its magical elements stay grounded in the everyday. Paintings move and talk; books bite readers; letters shout messages; and maps show live journeys, making the wizarding world &quot;both exotic and cosily familiar&quot; according to the scholar Catherine Butler. This blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling&#x27;s characters. Harry is ordinary and relatable, with down-to-earth features such as wearing broken glasses; these elements serve to highlight Harry when he is heroic, making him both an everyman and a fairytale hero.

Arthurian, Christian and fairytale motifs are frequently found in Rowling&#x27;s writing. Harry&#x27;s ability to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat resembles the Arthurian sword in the stone legend. His life with the Dursleys has been compared to Cinderella. Like C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; contains Christian symbolism and allegory. The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person&#x27;s soul. The critic of children&#x27;s literature Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ. According to Maria Nikolajeva, Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series: she writes that Harry dies in self-sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an speech, after which Harry is resurrected and defeats his enemy.

=== Themes ===
Death is Rowling&#x27;s overarching theme in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. In the first book, when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he feels both joy and &quot;a terrible sadness&quot; at seeing his desire: his parents, alive and with him. Confronting their loss is central to Harry&#x27;s character arc and manifests in different ways through the series, such as in his struggles with Dementors. Other characters in Harry&#x27;s life die; he even faces his own death in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;. Rowling has spoken about thematising death and loss in the series. Soon after she started writing &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, her mother died, and she said that &quot;I really think from that moment on, death became a central, if not the central theme of the seven books&quot;. Rowling has described Harry as &quot;the prism through which I view death&quot;, and further stated that &quot;all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death&quot;.

While &quot;Harry Potter&quot; can be viewed as a story about good versus evil, its moral divisions are not absolute. First impressions of characters are often misleading. Harry assumes in the first book that Quirrell is good because he opposes Snape, who appears malicious; in reality, their positions are reversed. In Rowling&#x27;s world, good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes: second chances and redemption are key themes of the series.

== Reception ==
Rowling has enjoyed enormous commercial success as an author. Her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series topped bestseller lists, spawned a global media franchise including films and video games, and had been translated into 84 languages by 2023. The first three &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books occupied the top three spots of &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for more than a year; they were then moved to a newly created children&#x27;s list. The final four books each set records as the fastest-selling books in the UK or US, and the series as a whole had sold more than 600 million copies . Neither of Rowling&#x27;s later works, &quot;The Casual Vacancy&quot; and the &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; series, has been as successful, although &quot;Casual Vacancy&quot; was still a bestseller in the UK within weeks of its release. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; popularity has been attributed to factors including the nostalgia evoked by the boarding-school story, the endearing nature of Rowling&#x27;s characters, and the accessibility of her books to a variety of readers. According to Julia Eccleshare, the books are &quot;neither too literary nor too popular, too difficult nor too easy, neither too young nor too old&quot;, and hence bridge traditional reading divides.

Critical response to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; has been more mixed. Harold Bloom regarded Rowling&#x27;s prose as poor and her plots as conventional, while Jack Zipes argues that the series would not be successful if it were not formulaic. Zipes states that the early novels have the same plot: in each book, Harry escapes the Dursleys to visit Hogwarts, where he confronts Lord Voldemort and then heads back successful. Rowling&#x27;s prose has been described as simple and not innovative; Le Guin, like several other critics, considered it &quot;stylistically ordinary&quot;. According to the novelist A. S. Byatt, the books reflect a dumbed-down culture dominated by soap operas and reality television. Thus, some critics argue, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; does not innovate on established literary forms; nor does it challenge readers&#x27; preconceived ideas. Conversely, the scholar Philip Nel rejects such critiques as &quot;snobbery&quot; that reacts to the novels&#x27; popularity, whereas Mary Pharr argues that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; conventionalism is the point: by amalgamating literary forms familiar to her readers, Rowling invites them to &quot;ponder their own ideas&quot;. Other critics who see artistic merit in Rowling&#x27;s writing include Marina Warner, who views &quot;Harry Potter&quot; as part of an &quot;alternative genealogy&quot; of English literature that she traces from Edmund Spenser to Christina Rossetti. Michiko Kakutani praises Rowling&#x27;s fictional world and the darker tone of the series&#x27; later entries.

Reception of Rowling&#x27;s later works has varied among critics. &quot;The Casual Vacancy&quot;, her attempt at literary fiction, drew mixed reviews. Some critics praised its characterisation, while others stated that it would have been better if it had contained magic. The &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; series was more warmly received as a work of British detective fiction, even as some reviewers noted that its plots are occasionally contrived. Theatrical reviews of &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot; were highly positive. Fans have been more critical of the play&#x27;s use of time travel, changes to characters&#x27; personalities, and perceived queerbaiting in Albus and Scorpius&#x27;s relationship, leading some to question its connection to the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; canon.

=== Gender and social division ===
Rowling&#x27;s portrayal of women in &quot;Harry Potter&quot; has been described as complex and varied, but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender. Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books: Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society. However, this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles. According to the scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson, the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series. The final three books &quot;showcase richer roles and more powerful females&quot;: for instance, the series&#x27; &quot;most matriarchal character&quot;, Molly Weasley, engages substantially in the final battle of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, while other women are shown as leaders. Hermione Granger, in particular, becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists&#x27; battle against evil. Yet, even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles, and Hermione&#x27;s status as a feminist model is debated. Girls and women are frequently shown as emotional, defined by their appearance, and denied agency in family settings.

The social hierarchies in Rowling&#x27;s magical world have been a matter of debate among scholars and critics. The primary antagonists of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, Voldemort and his followers, believe blood purity is paramount, and that non-wizards, or &quot;muggles&quot;, are subhuman. Their ideology of racial difference is depicted as unambiguously evil. However, the series cannot wholly reject racial division, according to several scholars, as it still depicts wizards as fundamentally superior to muggles. Blake and Zipes argue that numerous examples of wizardly superiority are depicted as &quot;natural and comfortable&quot;. Thus, according to Gupta, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; depicts superior races as having a moral obligation of tolerance and altruism towards lesser races, rather than explicitly depicting equality.

Rowling&#x27;s depictions of the status of magical non-humans is similarly debated. Discussing the slavery of house-elves within &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books&#x27; abolitionist sentiments, viewing Hermione&#x27;s Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers&#x27; political engagement. Other critics, including Farah Mendlesohn, find the portrayal of house-elves extremely troublesome; they are written as happy in their slavery, and Hermione&#x27;s efforts on their behalf are implied to be naïve. Pharr terms the house-elves a disharmonious element in the series, writing that Rowling leaves their fate hanging; at the end of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, the elves remain enslaved and cheerful. More generally, the subordination of magical non-humans remains in place, unchanged by the defeat of Voldemort. Thus, scholars suggest, the series&#x27;s message is essentially conservative; it sees no reason to transform social hierarchies, only being concerned with who holds positions of power.

=== Religious reactions ===

There have been attempts to ban &quot;Harry Potter&quot; around the world, especially in the United States, and in the Bible Belt in particular. The series topped the American Library Association&#x27;s list of most challenged books in the first three years of its publication. In the following years, parents in several US cities launched protests against teaching it in schools. Some Christian critics, particularly Evangelical Christians, have claimed that the novels promote witchcraft and harm children; similar opposition has been expressed to the film adaptations. Criticism has taken two main forms: allegations that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a pagan text; and claims that it encourages children to oppose authority, derived mainly from Harry&#x27;s rejection of the Dursleys, his guardians. The author and scholar Amanda Cockrell suggests that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; popularity, and recent preoccupation with fantasy and the occult among Christian fundamentalists, explains why the series received particular opposition. Some groups of Shia and Sunni Muslims also argued that the series contained Satanic subtext, and it was banned in private schools in the United Arab Emirates by its Ministry of Education and Youth, which stated it contradicted Islamic values.

The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books also have a group of vocal religious supporters who believe that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; espouses Christian values, or that the Bible does not prohibit the forms of magic described in the series. Christian analyses of the series have argued that it embraces ideals of friendship, loyalty, courage, love, and the temptation of power. After the final volume was published, Rowling said she intentionally incorporated Christian themes, in particular the idea that love may hold power over death. According to Farmer, it is a profound misreading to think that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; promotes witchcraft. The scholar Em McAvan writes that evangelical objections to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; are superficial, based on the presence of magic in the books: they do not attempt to understand the moral messages in the series.

== Legacy ==

Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has been credited with a resurgence in crossover fiction: children&#x27;s literature with an adult appeal. Crossovers were prevalent in 19th-century American and British fiction, but fell out of favour in the 20th century and did not occur at the same scale. The post-&quot;Harry Potter&quot; crossover trend is associated with the fantasy genre. In the 1970s, children&#x27;s books were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic, while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim, realist themes, with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works.

The commercial success of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in 1997 reversed this trend. The scale of its growth had no precedent in the children&#x27;s market: within four years, it occupied 28% of that field by revenue. Children&#x27;s literature rose in cultural status, and fantasy became a dominant genre. Older works of children&#x27;s fantasy, including Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s &quot;Chrestomanci&quot; series and Diane Duane&#x27;s &quot;Young Wizards&quot;, were reprinted and rose in popularity; some authors re-established their careers. In the following decades, many &quot;Harry Potter&quot; imitators and subversive responses grew popular.

Rowling has been compared with Enid Blyton, who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children&#x27;s market. She has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl. Some critics view &quot;Harry Potter&quot; rise, along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, as part of a broader shift in reading tastes: a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure. This is reflected in the BBC&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Big Read&quot; survey of the UK&#x27;s favourite books, where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers 3 and 5, respectively, with very few British literary classics in the top 10.

&quot;Harry Potter&quot; popularity led its publishers to plan elaborate releases and spawned a textual afterlife among fans and forgers. Beginning with the release of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; on 8 July 1999 at 3:45 pm, its publishers coordinated selling the books at the same time globally, introduced security protocols to prevent premature purchases, and required booksellers to agree not to sell copies before the appointed time. Driven by the growth of the internet, fan fiction about the series proliferated and has spawned a diverse community of readers and writers. While Rowling has supported fan fiction, her statements about characters – for instance, that Harry and Hermione could have been a couple, and that Dumbledore was gay – have complicated her relationship with readers; according to Pugh, she only announced Dumbledore&#x27;s sexuality to her fans, but not in the books, thus &quot;closeting this character for unexplained reasons&quot;. According to scholars, this shows that modern readers feel a sense of ownership over the text that is independent of, and sometimes contradicts, authorial intent.

== Legal disputes ==

In the 1990s and 2000s, Rowling was both a plaintiff and defendant in lawsuits alleging copyright infringement. Nancy Stouffer sued Rowling in 1999, alleging that &quot;Harry Potter&quot; was based on stories she published in 1984. Rowling won in September 2002. Richard Posner describes Stouffer&#x27;s suit as deeply flawed and notes that the court, finding she had used &quot;forged and altered documents&quot;, assessed a $50,000 penalty against her.

With her literary agents and Warner Bros., Rowling has brought legal action against publishers and writers of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; knockoffs in several countries. In the mid-2000s, Rowling and her publishers obtained a series of injunctions prohibiting sales or published reviews of her books before their official release dates.

Beginning in 2001, after Rowling sold film rights to Warner Bros., the studio tried to take &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fan sites offline unless it determined that they were made by &quot;authentic&quot; fans for innocuous purposes. In 2007, with Warner Bros., Rowling started proceedings to cease publication of a book based on content from a fan site called &quot;The Harry Potter Lexicon&quot;. The court held that &quot;Lexicon&quot; was neither a fair use of Rowling&#x27;s material nor a derivative work, but it did not prevent the book from being published in a different form. &quot;Lexicon&quot; was published in 2009.

== Philanthropy ==
Long interested in issues affecting women and children, Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust in 2000, named after her mother to address social deprivation in at-risk women, children and youth. She was appointed president of One Parent Families (now Gingerbread) in 2004, after becoming its first ambassador in 2000. She collaborated with Sarah Brown on a book of children&#x27;s stories to benefit One Parent Families. Together with the MEP Emma Nicholson, Rowling founded the charity now known as Lumos in 2005. Lumos has worked with an orphanage west of Kyiv, Ukraine since 2013; after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rowling offered to personally match up to £1million in donations to Lumos for Ukraine. Later in 2022, during her advocacy against the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill, Rowling stated she had founded and would fund Beira&#x27;s Place, a women-only rape help centre that provides free support services to survivors of sexual violence. The centre excludes trans women. She has donated several hundred thousand pounds to help women lawyers flee from the Taliban&#x27;s control, helping hundreds of Afghans escape.

Rowling has made donations to support other medical causes. She named another institution after her mother in 2010, when she donated £10 million to found a multiple sclerosis research centre at the University of Edinburgh. She gave an additional £15.3 million to the centre in 2019. During the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, accompanied by an inflatable representation of Lord Voldemort, she read from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as part of a tribute to the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. To support COVID-19 relief, she donated six-figure sums to both Khalsa Aid and the British Asian Trust from royalties for &quot;The Ickabog&quot;.

Several publications in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe have been sold for charitable purposes. Profits from &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; and &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot;, both published in 2001, went to Comic Relief. To support Children&#x27;s Voice, later renamed Lumos, Rowling sold a deluxe copy of &quot;The Tales of Beedle the Bard&quot; at auction in 2007. Amazon&#x27;s £1.95 million purchase set a record for a contemporary literary work and for children&#x27;s literature. Rowling published the book and, in 2013, donated the proceeds of nearly £19 million (then about $30 million) to Lumos. Rowling and 12 other writers composed short pieces in 2008 to be sold to benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling&#x27;s contribution was an 800-word &quot;Harry Potter&quot; prequel. When the revelation that Rowling wrote &quot;The Cuckoo&#x27;s Calling&quot; led to an increase in sales, she donated the royalties to ABF The Soldiers&#x27; Charity (formerly the Army Benevolent Fund).

Rowling&#x27;s charitable donations before 2012 were estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at $160 million. She was the second most generous UK donor in 2015 (following the singer Elton John), giving about $14 million.

== Views ==
Rowling was actively engaged on the internet before author webpages were common. She has at times used Twitter unreservedly to reach her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans and followers.

=== Politics ===
In 2008, Rowling donated £1 million to the Labour Party, endorsed the Labour prime minister Gordon Brown over his Conservative challenger David Cameron, and commended Labour&#x27;s policies on child poverty. In June 2024, she wrote that she had a &quot;poor opinion&quot; of Keir Starmer and that it would be hard for her to vote for Labour. When asked about the 2008 United States presidential election, she stated that &quot;it is a pity that Clinton and Obama have to be rivals because both are extraordinary.&quot;

In her &quot;Single mother&#x27;s manifesto&quot; published in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2010, Rowling criticised the prime minister David Cameron&#x27;s plan to offer married couples an annual tax credit. She thought that the proposal discriminated against single parents, whose interests the Conservative Party failed to consider. Rowling opposed the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, due to concerns about the economic consequences, and donated £1 million to the Better Together anti-independence campaign. She campaigned for the UK to stay in the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. She defined herself as an internationalist, &quot;the mongrel product of this European continent&quot;, and expressed concern that &quot;racists and bigots&quot; were directing parts of the Leave campaign.

She opposed Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but refused to support a cultural boycott of Israel in 2015, believing that depriving Israelis of shared culture would not dislodge him. In 2015, Rowling joined 150 others in signing a letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in favour of cultural engagement with Israel.

=== Press ===
Rowling has a difficult relationship with the press and has tried to influence the type of coverage she receives. She described herself in 2003 as &quot;too thin-skinned&quot;. As of 2011, she had taken more than 50 actions against the press. Rowling dislikes the British tabloid the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which she successfully sued in 2014 for libel about her time as a single mother.

The Leveson Inquiry into the British press named Rowling as a &quot;core participant&quot; in 2011. She was one of many celebrities alleged to have been victims of phone hacking. The following year she criticised Cameron&#x27;s decision not to implement all the inquiry&#x27;s recommendations and supported the Hacked Off campaign, pushing for stricter media reform.

=== Transgender people ===

Rowling has gender-critical views, and she opposes many proposed laws that would make it simpler for transgender people to transition. Her views are often described as transphobic or anti-trans, though Rowling disputes this. In 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Rowling had &quot;made her campaign against trans identity the central focus of her online persona&quot;. 

Friction over Rowling&#x27;s gender-critical writings surged in 2019 when she defended Maya Forstater, whose employment contract was not renewed after she made anti-trans statements. Rowling wrote that transgender people should live in &quot;peace and security&quot; but said she opposed &quot;forc[ing] women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real&quot;. According to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; scholar Lana Whited, in the next six months &quot;Rowling herself fanned the flames as she became increasingly vocal&quot;. In June 2020, Rowling mocked the phrase &quot;people who menstruate&quot; and tweeted that women&#x27;s rights and &quot;lived reality&quot; would be &quot;erased&quot; if &quot;sex isn&#x27;t real&quot;. In April 2024, responding to Scotland&#x27;s Hate Crime and Public Order Act, she tweeted a list of trans women, writing that they are &quot;men, every last one of them&quot;.

Rowling believes that making it simpler for transgender people to transition could impinge on access to female-only spaces and legal protections for women. She opposes legislation to advance gender self-recognition and enable transition without a medical diagnosis. On social media, Rowling suggests that children and cisgender women are threatened by trans women and trans-positive messages.

Rowling&#x27;s views have prompted declarations of support for transgender people from the literary, music, theme park, and video gaming sectors, as well as fuelled debates on freedom of speech. She has been the target of widespread condemnation for her comments on transgender people. This negative reaction has included insults and threats, including death threats. Criticism came from &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fansites, LGBT charities, leading actors of the Wizarding World, and Human Rights Campaign. After Kerry Kennedy expressed &quot;profound disappointment&quot; in her views, Rowling returned the Ripple of Hope Award given to her by the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization. Despite the controversy, sales of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books have been unaffected.

Rowling denies being transphobic. In an essay posted on her website in June 2020, she explained that her views on women&#x27;s rights sprang from her experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault. While affirming that &quot;the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable ... transgender people need and deserve protection&quot;, she wrote that it would be unsafe to allow &quot;any man who believes or feels he&#x27;s a woman&quot; into bathrooms or changing rooms. Writing of her own experiences with misogyny, she wondered if the &quot;allure of escaping womanhood&quot; would have led her to transition if she had been born later, and she said that trans activism was &quot;seeking to erode &#x27;woman&#x27; as a political and biological class&quot;. Whited asserted in 2024 that Rowling&#x27;s sometimes &quot;flippant&quot; and &quot;simplistic understanding of gender identity&quot; had left some transgender people feeling betrayed and permanently changed her &quot;relationship not only with fans, readers, and scholars ... but also with her works themselves&quot;.

== Awards and honours ==
Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series has won awards for general literature, children&#x27;s literature, and speculative fiction. It has earned multiple British Book Awards, beginning with the Children&#x27;s Book of the Year for the first two volumes, &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. The third novel, &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, was nominated for an adult award, the Whitbread Book of the Year, where it competed against the Nobel Prize laureate Seamus Heaney&#x27;s . The award body gave Rowling the children&#x27;s prize instead (worth half the cash amount), which some scholars felt exemplified a literary prejudice against children&#x27;s books. She won the World Science Fiction Convention&#x27;s Hugo Award for the fourth book, &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, and the British Book Awards&#x27; adult prize – the Book of the Year – for the sixth novel, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;.

Rowling was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2000 Birthday Honours for services to children&#x27;s literature, and three years later received Spain&#x27;s Prince of Asturias Award for Concord. Following the conclusion of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, she won the Outstanding Achievement Prize at the 2008 British Book Awards. The next year, she was awarded by the French president Nicolas Sarkozy, and leading magazine editors named her the &quot;Most Influential Woman in the UK&quot; in 2010. For services to literature and philanthropy, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 2017. 

Many academic institutions have bestowed honorary degrees on Rowling, including her alma mater, the University of Exeter, and Harvard University, where she spoke at the 2008 commencement ceremony. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL), the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE), and the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (FRCPE).

Rowling shared the British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema with the cast and crew of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films in 2011. Her other awards include the 2017 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play for &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, and the 2021 British Book Awards&#x27; Crime and Thriller prize for the fifth volume of her &quot;Cormoran Strike&quot; series.

<doc id="16028" wikidata="Q43977" url="?curid=16028" title="Jan Hus">
<text>Jan Hus (; ; 1370 – 6 July 1415), sometimes anglicized as John Hus or John Huss, and referred to in historical texts as &quot;Iohannes Hus&quot; or &quot;Johannes Huss&quot;, was a Czech theologian and philosopher who became a Church reformer and the inspiration of Hussitism, a key predecessor to Protestantism, and a seminal figure in the Bohemian Reformation. Hus is considered to be the first Church reformer, even though some designate the theorist John Wycliffe. His teachings had a strong influence, most immediately in the approval of a reformed Bohemian religious denomination and, over a century later, on Martin Luther.

After being ordained as a Catholic priest, Hus began to preach in Prague. He opposed many aspects of the Catholic Church in Bohemia, such as its views on ecclesiology, simony, the Eucharist, and other theological topics. Hus was a master, dean and rector at the Charles University in Prague between 1409 and 1410.

Alexander V issued a Papal bull that excommunicated Hus; however, it was not enforced, and Hus continued to preach. Hus then spoke out against Alexander V&#x27;s successor, Antipope John XXIII, for his selling of indulgences. Hus&#x27; excommunication was then enforced, and he spent the next two years living in exile.

When the Council of Constance assembled, Hus was asked to be there and present his views on the dissension within the Church. When he arrived, with a promise of safe-conduct, he was arrested and put in prison. He was eventually taken in front of the council and asked to recant his views. He refused. On 6 July 1415, he was burned at the stake for &quot;heresy&quot; against the teachings of the Catholic Church.

After Hus was executed, the followers of his religious teachings (known as Hussites) refused to elect another Catholic monarch and defeated five consecutive papal crusades between 1420 and 1431 in what became known as the Hussite Wars. Both the Bohemian and the Moravian populations remained majority Hussite until the 1620s, when a Protestant defeat in the Battle of the White Mountain resulted in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown coming under Habsburg dominion for the next 300 years and being subject to immediate and forced conversion to Catholicism in an intense campaign.

==Early life==
The exact date of Hus&#x27;s birth is disputed. Some claim he was born around 1369, while others claim he was born between 1373 and 1375. Though older sources state the latter, more contemporary research states that 1372 is more likely. The belief that he was born on 6 July, also his death day, has no factual basis. Hus was born in Husinec, southern Bohemia, to peasant parents. It is well known that Hus took his name from the village where he lived (Husinec). The reason behind him taking his name from his village rather than from his father is up to speculation; some believe that it was because Hus did not know of his father, while others say it was simply a custom at that time. The name &quot;Hus,&quot; however, means &quot;goose&quot; in Bohemian (now called Czech), and he was a century later referenced as a &quot;Bohemian goose&quot; in a dream given to Frederick, the Elector of Saxony. Nearly all other information known about Hus&#x27;s very early life is unsubstantiated. Similarly, we know little of Hus&#x27;s family. His father&#x27;s name was Michael; his mother&#x27;s name is unknown. It is known that Hus had a brother due to him expressing concerns for his nephew while awaiting execution at Constance. Whether or not Hus had any other family is unknown.

At the age of roughly 10, Hus was sent away to a monastery. The exact reason is not known; some claim that his father had died, others say he went there due to his devotion to God. He impressed the teachers with his studies, and they recommended him to move to Prague, one of the largest cities in Bohemia at that time. Hus apparently supported himself by securing employment in Prague, which allowed him to fulfill his basic necessities, and access to the Prague Library.

Three years later, he was admitted to the University of Prague. Though not an exceptional student, he pursued his studies with ferocity. In 1393, Hus earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Prague, and he earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1396. The strongly anti-papal views that were held by many of the professors there likely influenced Hus&#x27;s future works. During his studies, he served as a choir boy, to supplement his earnings.

==Career==
Hus began teaching at the University of Prague in 1398 and in 1399, he first publicly defended propositions of Wycliffe. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1400. In 1401, his students and faculty promoted him to dean of the philosophical department, and a year later, he became a rector of the University of Prague. He was appointed a preacher at the Bethlehem Chapel in 1402. Hus was a strong advocate for the Czechs and the Realists, and he was influenced by the writings of John Wycliffe. Although Church authorities banned many of Wycliffe&#x27;s works in 1403, Hus translated &quot;Trialogus&quot; into Czech and helped to distribute it.

Hus denounced the moral failings of clergy, bishops, and even the papacy from his pulpit. Archbishop Zbyněk Zajíc tolerated this, and even appointed Hus a preacher at the clergy&#x27;s biennial synod. On 24 June 1405, Pope Innocent VII directed the Archbishop to counter Wycliffe&#x27;s teachings, especially the idea of impanation in the Eucharist. The archbishop complied by issuing a synod decree against Wycliffe, as well as forbidding any further attacks on the clergy.

In 1406, two Bohemian students brought to Prague a document bearing the seal of the University of Oxford and praising Wycliffe. Hus proudly read the document from his pulpit. Then, in 1408, Pope Gregory XII warned Archbishop Zajic that the Church in Rome had been informed of Wycliffe&#x27;s heresies and of the sympathies of King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia for nonconformists. In response, the king and university ordered all of Wycliffe&#x27;s writings surrendered to the archdiocesan chancery for correction. Hus obeyed, declaring that he condemned the errors in those writings.

===Papal Schism===
In 1408, the Charles University in Prague was divided by the Western Schism, in which Gregory XII in Rome and Benedict XIII in Avignon both claimed the papacy. Wenceslaus felt Gregory XII might interfere with his plans to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor. He denounced Gregory, ordered the clergy in Bohemia to observe a strict neutrality in the schism and said that he expected the same of the university. Archbishop Zajíc remained faithful to Gregory. At the University, only the scholars of the Bohemian &quot;nation&quot; (one of the four governing sections), with Hus as their leader, vowed neutrality.

====Kutná Hora Decree====

In January 1409, Wenceslaus summoned representatives of the four nations comprising the university to the Czech city of Kutná Hora to demand statements of allegiance. The Czech nation agreed, but the other three nations declined. The king then decreed that the Czech nation would have three votes in university affairs, while the &quot;German nation&quot; (composed of the former Bavarian, Saxon, and Polish nations) would have one vote in total. Due to the change in voting structure by May 1409 the German dean and rector were deposed and replaced by Czechs. The Palatine Elector called the Germans to his own University of Heidelberg, while the Margrave of Meissen started a new university in Leipzig. It is estimated that over one thousand students and masters left Prague. The emigrants also spread accusations of Bohemian heresy.

====Antipope Alexander V====

In 1409, the Council of Pisa tried to end the schism by electing Alexander V as Pope, but Gregory and Benedict did not submit. (Alexander was declared an &quot;antipope&quot; by the Council of Constance in 1418.) Hus, his followers, and Wenceslaus IV transferred their allegiance to Alexander V. Under pressure from
King Wenceslaus IV, Archbishop Zajíc did the same. Zajíc then lodged an accusation of &quot;ecclesiastical disturbances&quot; against Wycliffites in Prague with Alexander V.

On 20 December 1409, Alexander V issued a papal bull that empowered the Archbishop to proceed against Wycliffism in Prague. All copies of Wycliffe&#x27;s writings were to be surrendered and his views repudiated, and free preaching discontinued. After the publication of the bull in 1410, Hus appealed to Alexander V, but in vain. The Wycliffe books and valuable manuscripts were burned, and Hus and his adherents were excommunicated by Alexander V.

====Crusade against Naples====
Alexander V died in 1410, and was succeeded by John XXIII (also later declared an antipope). In 1411, John XXIII proclaimed a crusade against King Ladislaus of Naples, the protector of rival Pope Gregory XII. This crusade was preached in Prague as well. John XXIII also authorized indulgences to raise money for the war. Priests urged the people on, and they crowded into churches to give their offerings. This traffic in indulgences was a sign of the corruption of the Church needing remediation.

====Condemnation of indulgences and Crusade====
Archbishop Zajíc died in 1411 and with his death the religious movement in Bohemia entered a new phase during which the disputes concerning indulgences assumed great importance. Hus spoke out against indulgences, but he could not carry with him the men of the university. In 1412, a dispute took place, on which occasion Hus delivered his address &quot;Quaestio magistri Johannis Hus de indulgentiis&quot;. It was taken literally from the last chapter of Wycliffe&#x27;s book, &quot;De ecclesia&quot;, and his treatise, &quot;De absolutione a pena et culpa&quot;. Hus asserted that no pope or bishop had the right to take up the sword in the name of the Church; he should pray for his enemies and bless those who curse him; man obtains forgiveness of sins by true repentance, not money. The doctors of the theological faculty replied, but without success. A few days afterward some of Hus followers led by Vok Voksa z Valdštejna, burned the Papal bulls. Hus, they said, should be obeyed rather than the Church, which they considered a fraudulent mob of adulterers and Simonists.

In response, three men from the lower classes who openly called the indulgences a fraud were beheaded. They were later considered the first martyrs of the Hussite Church. In the meantime, the faculty had condemned the forty-five articles of Wycliffe and added several other theses, deemed heretical, which had originated with Hus. The king forbade the teaching of these articles but neither Hus nor the university complied with the ruling. They requested that the articles should be first proven to be un-scriptural. The tumults at Prague had stirred up a sensation. Papal legates and Archbishop Albik tried to persuade Hus to give up his opposition to the papal bulls and the king made an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the two parties.

====Attempts at reconciliation====
King Wenceslaus IV made efforts to harmonize the opposing parties. In 1412, he convoked the heads of his kingdom for a consultation and, at their suggestion, ordered a synod to be held at Český Brod on 2 February 1412. The synod was instead held in the palace of the archbishops at Prague in order to exclude Hus from participation. Propositions were made to restore peace in the Church. Hus declared that Bohemia should have the same freedom in regard to ecclesiastical affairs as other countries and that approbation and condemnation should therefore be announced only with the permission of the state power. This was the view of Wycliffe (&quot;Sermones&quot;, iii. 519, etc.).

There followed treatises from both parties, but no harmony was obtained. &quot;Even if I should stand before the stake which has been prepared for me,&quot; Hus wrote at the time, &quot;I would never accept the recommendation of the theological faculty.&quot; The synod did not produce any results but the king ordered a commission to continue the work of reconciliation. The doctors of the university demanded Hus and his followers approve the university&#x27;s conception of the Church. According to this conception, the pope is the head of the Church and the Cardinals are the body of the Church. Hus protested vigorously. The Hussite party seems to have made a great effort toward reconciliation. To the article that the Roman Church must be obeyed, they added only &quot;so far as every pious Christian is bound&quot;. Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán Páleč protested against this addition and left the convention; they were exiled by the king, with two others.

==== Hus leaves Prague and appeals to Jesus Christ ====
By this time, Hus&#x27;s ideas had become widely accepted in Bohemia and there was broad resentment against the Church hierarchy. The attack on Hus by the pope and archbishop caused riots in parts of Bohemia. King Wenceslaus IV and his government took the side of Hus and the power of his adherents increased from day to day. Hus continued to preach in the Bethlehem Chapel. The churches of the city were put under the ban, and an interdict was pronounced against Prague. To protect the city, Hus left and went into the countryside where he continued to preach and write.

Before Hus left Prague, he decided to take a step which gave a new dimension to his endeavors. He wanted to become a preacher and then taught at the university he studied at before. He no longer put his trust in an indecisive king, a hostile pope or an ineffective council. On 18 October 1412, he appealed to Jesus Christ as the supreme judge. By appealing directly to the highest Christian authority, Christ himself, he bypassed the laws and structures of the medieval Church. For the Bohemian Reformation, this step was as significant as the Ninety-five Theses posted in Wittenberg by Martin Luther in 1517.

After Hus left Prague for the country, he realized what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care. Therefore he started to write many texts in Czech, such as basics of the Christian faith or preachings, intended mainly for the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.

====Writings of Hus and Wycliffe====
Of the writings occasioned by these controversies, those of Hus on the Church, entitled &quot;De Ecclesia&quot;, were written in 1413 and have been most frequently quoted and admired or criticized, yet their first ten chapters are an epitome of Wycliffe&#x27;s work of the same title and the following chapters are an abstract of another of Wycliffe&#x27;s works (&quot;De potentate papae&quot;) on the power of the pope. Wycliffe had written his book to oppose the common position that the Church consisted primarily of the clergy, and Hus now found himself making the same point. He wrote his work at the castle of one of his protectors in Kozí Hrádek and sent it to Prague where it was publicly read in the Bethlehem Chapel. It was answered by Stanislav ze Znojma and Štěpán z Pálče (also Štěpán Páleč) with treatises of the same title.

After the most vehement opponents of Hus had left Prague, his adherents occupied the whole ground. Hus wrote his treatises and preached in the neighborhood of Kozí Hrádek. Bohemian Wycliffism was carried into Poland, Hungary, Croatia, and Austria. But in January 1413, a general council in Rome condemned the writings of Wycliffe and ordered them to be burned.

===Council of Constance===
King Wenceslaus&#x27;s brother Sigismund of Hungary, who was &quot;King of the Romans&quot; (that is, head of the Holy Roman Empire though not then Emperor) and heir to the Bohemian crown, was anxious to put an end to religious dissension within the Church. To put an end to the papal schism and to take up the long-desired reform of the Church, he arranged for a general council to convene on 1 November 1414, at Konstanz (Constance). The Council of Constance (1414–1418) became the 16th ecumenical council recognized by the Catholic Church. Hus, willing to make an end to all dissensions, agreed to go to Constance, under Sigismund&#x27;s promise of safe-conduct.

====Imprisonment and preparations for trial====
It is not known whether Hus knew what his fate would be, however, he made his will before setting out. He started on his journey on 11 October 1414, arriving in Constance on 3 November 1414. The following day, the bulletins on the church doors announced that Michal z Německého Brodu (Michal de Causis) would be opposing Hus. In the beginning, Hus was at liberty under his safe-conduct from Sigismund and lived at the house of a widow. But he continued celebrating mass and preaching to the people, in violation of restrictions decreed by the Church. After a few weeks on 28 November 1414, his opponents succeeded in imprisoning him on the strength of a rumor that he intended to flee. He was first brought into the residence of a canon and then on 6 December 1414 into the prison of the Dominican monastery. Sigismund, as the guarantor of Hus&#x27;s safety, was greatly angered and threatened the prelates with dismissal. The prelates convinced him that he could not be bound by promises to a heretic.

On 4 December 1414, John XXIII entrusted a committee of three bishops with a preliminary investigation against Hus. As was common practice, witnesses for the prosecution were heard but Hus was not allowed an advocate for his defense. His situation became worse after the downfall of John XXIII, who had left Constance to avoid abdicating. Hus had been the captive of John XXIII and in constant communication with his friends, but now he was delivered to the bishop of Constance and brought to his castle, &quot;Gottlieben on the Rhine&quot;. Here he remained for 73 days, separated from his friends, chained day and night, poorly fed, and ill.

===Trial===

On 5 June 1415, he was tried for the first time and was transferred to a Franciscan monastery, where he spent the last weeks of his life. Extracts from his works were read and witnesses were heard. He refused all formulae of submission but declared himself willing to recant if his errors should be proven to him from the Bible. Hus conceded his veneration of Wycliffe and said that he could only wish his soul might some time attain unto that place where Wycliffe&#x27;s was. On the other hand, he denied having defended Wycliffe&#x27;s view of The Lord&#x27;s Supper or the forty-five articles; he had only opposed their summary condemnation. King Sigismund admonished him to deliver himself up to the mercy of the council, as he did not desire to protect a heretic.

At the last trial, on 8 June 1415, thirty-nine sentences were read to him. Of these, twenty-six had been excerpted from his book on the Church (&quot;De ecclesia&quot;), seven from his treatise against Páleč (Contra Palecz), and six from that against Stanislav ze Znojma (&quot;Contra Stanislaum&quot;). The danger of some of these views to worldly power was explained to Sigismund to incite him against Hus. Hus again declared himself willing to submit if he could be convinced of errors. This declaration was considered an unconditional surrender, and he was asked to confess:
1. That he had erred in the theses which he had hitherto maintained;
2. That he renounced them for the future;
3. That he recanted them; and
4. That he declared the opposite of these sentences.

He asked to be exempted from recanting teachings which he had never taught. Other views, which the assembly considered erroneous, he was not willing to revoke and to act differently would be against his conscience. These words found no favorable reception. After the trial on 8 June, several other attempts were purportedly made to induce him to recant, which he resisted.

====Condemnation====
The condemnation of Jan Hus took place on 6 July 1415 in the presence of the assembly of the council in the cathedral. After the High Mass and Liturgy, Hus was led into the church. The Bishop of Lodi (then Giacomo Balardi Arrigoni) delivered an oration on the duty of eradicating heresy; various theses of Hus and Wycliffe and a report of his trial were then read.

An Italian prelate pronounced the sentence of condemnation upon Hus and his writings. Hus protested, saying that even at this hour he did not wish anything but to be convinced from Scripture. He fell upon his knees and asked God with a soft voice to forgive all his enemies. Then followed his degradation from the priesthood. He was dressed in priestly vestments and again asked to recant and again he refused. With curses, Hus&#x27;s ornaments were taken from him, his priestly tonsure was destroyed. The judgment of the Church was pronounced:

A tall paper hat was allegedly put upon his head with the inscription &quot;Haeresiarcha&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the leader of a heretical movement). Hus was led away to the stake under a strong guard of armed men.

Before his execution, Hus is said to have declared, &quot;You may kill a weak goose [&quot;Hus&quot; is Czech for &quot;goose&quot;], but more powerful birds, eagles and falcons, will come after me.&quot; Luther modified the statement and reported that Hus had said that they might have roasted a goose, but that in a hundred years a swan would sing to whom they be forced to listen. In 1546, in his funeral sermon for Luther, Johannes Bugenhagen gave a further twist to Hus&#x27;s declaration: &quot;You may burn a goose, but in a hundred years will come a swan you will not be able to burn.&quot; Twenty years later, in 1566, Johannes Mathesius, Luther&#x27;s first biographer, found Hus&#x27;s prophecy to be evidence of Luther&#x27;s divine inspiration.

===Execution===

At the place of execution, he knelt down, spread out his hands and prayed aloud. The executioner undressed Hus and tied his hands behind his back with ropes. His neck was bound with a chain to a stake around which wood and straw had been piled up so that it covered him to the neck. At the last moment, the imperial marshal, von Pappenheim, in the presence of the Count Palatine, asked Hus to recant and thus save his own life. Hus declined, stating:

Anecdotally, it has been said that the executioners had trouble intensifying the fire. An old woman then came to the stake and threw a relatively small amount of brushwood on it. Upon seeing her act, a suffering Hus then exclaimed, &quot;O &quot;Sancta Simplicitas!&quot;&quot; (&quot;O holy simplicity!&quot;). It is said that when he was about to expire, he cried out, &quot;Christ, son of the Living God, have mercy on us!&quot; (a variant of the Jesus Prayer). Hus&#x27;s ashes were later thrown into the Rhine river as a means of preventing the veneration of his remains.

==Aftermath==

=== Bohemian Protest ===
As news of Hus&#x27;s death spread outrage was brewing from the local nobles and doctors. On 2 September 1415, a document now called the Bohemian Protest was signed with corresponding attached wax seals by 100 notable people from Bohemia and Moravia in protest of Jan Hus&#x27;s burning. There is evidence that four documents of this kind were made in total, however only this one is known to survive and is currently held at the University of Edinburgh. The statement inside reads that &quot;Master John Hus was a good, just and catholic man&quot; that &quot;consistently detested all error and heresies&quot; and that anyone that believed that heresy was arising within Bohemia or Moravia to be &quot;the worst of traitors&quot;.

===Hussite Wars===

Responding with horror to the execution of Hus, the people of Bohemia moved even more rapidly away from Papal teachings. Rome then pronounced a crusade against them (1 March 1420): Pope Martin V issued a Papal bull authorizing the execution of all supporters of Hus and Wycliffe. King Wenceslaus IV died in August 1419, and his brother, Sigismund of Hungary, was unable to establish a real government in Bohemia due to the Hussite revolt.

The Hussite community included most of the Czech population of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Under the leadership of Jan Žižka (c. 1360–1424) and later of Prokop the Great (c. 1380–1434)—both excellent commanders—the Hussites defeated the crusade and the other three crusades that followed (1419–1434). Fighting ended after a compromise between the Utraquist Hussites and the Catholic Council of Basel in 1436. It resulted in the Basel Compacts, in which the Catholic Church officially allowed Bohemia to practice its own version of Christianity (Hussitism). A century later as much as ninety percent of the inhabitants of the Czech Crown lands still followed Hussite teachings.

===Hus&#x27;s scholarship and teachings===
Hus left reformatory writings. He translated Wycliffe&#x27;s &quot;Trialogus&quot; and was very familiar with his works on the body of Jesus, the Church, and the power of the pope, as well as and especially with his sermons. There are reasons to suppose that Wycliffe&#x27;s view of the Lord&#x27;s Supper (consubstantiation rather than transubstantiation) had spread to Prague as early as 1399, with strong evidence that students returning from England had brought the work back with them. It gained an even wider circulation after it had been prohibited in 1403, and Hus preached and taught it. The view was seized eagerly by the Taborites, who made it the central point of their system. According to their book, the Church is not the clerical hierarchy that was generally accepted as &#x27;the Church&#x27;; the Church is the entire body of those who from eternity have been predestined for salvation. Christ, not the pope, is its head. It is no article of faith that one must obey the pope to be saved. Neither internal membership in the Church nor churchly offices and dignities are a surety that the persons in question are members of the true Church.

Hus&#x27;s efforts were designed to rid the Church of its ethical abuses. The seeds of the Reformation are clear in Hus&#x27;s and Wycliffe&#x27;s writings. In explaining the plight of the average Christian in Bohemia, Hus wrote, &quot;One pays for confession, for Mass, for the sacrament, for indulgences, for churching a woman, for a blessing, for burials, for funeral services and prayers. The very last penny which an old woman has hidden in her bundle for fear of thieves or robbery will not be saved. The villainous priest will grab it.&quot; After Hus&#x27;s death, his followers, known as Hussites, split off into several groups including the Utraquists, Taborites and Orphans.

===Apology of the Catholic Church===
Nearly six centuries later in 1999, Pope John Paul II expressed &quot;deep regret for the cruel death inflicted&quot; on Hus and added &quot;deep sorrow&quot; for Hus&#x27;s death and praised his &quot;moral courage&quot;. Cardinal Miloslav Vlk of the Czech Republic was instrumental in crafting John Paul II&#x27;s statement. Members of the Moravian Church believe that it remains for God to judge those who were involved in the death of Hus.

===Hus and the Czech language===
The works of Jan Hus incorporate reforms to medieval Czech orthography, including the &quot;hook&quot; (háček) diacritic which was used to form the graphemes , , , and , which replaced digraphs like , , , and ; the &quot;dot&quot; above letters for strong accent, as well as the acute accent to mark long vowels , , , , and , in order to represent each phoneme by a single symbol. Some sources mention documented use of the special symbols in Bible translations (1462), the Schaffhausen Bible, and handwritten notes in the Bible. The symbol (instead of ) came later. The book &quot;Orthographia Bohemica&quot; (1406) was attributed to Hus by František Palacký, but it is possible that it was compiled by another author from Charles University.

==Legacy==

A century after the Hussite Wars began, as many as 90% of inhabitants of the Czech lands were Hussites (although in the Utraquist tradition following a joint Utraquist—Catholic victory in the Hussite Wars). Bohemia was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, and there are still Protestant adherents remaining in modern times; though they no longer comprise the majority: suggested historical reasons include the persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, particularly after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620; restrictions during the Communist rule; and also the ongoing secularization. Modern Czechs exhibit very high distrust of religious and other institutions.

Jan Hus was a key contributor to Protestantism, whose teachings had a strong influence on the states of Europe and on Martin Luther. The Hussite Wars resulted in the Basel Compacts, which allowed for a reformed Church in the Kingdom of Bohemia—almost a century before such developments would take place in the Lutheran Reformation. The Unitas Fratrum (or Moravian Church) is the modern-day home of Hus&#x27;s followers. Hus&#x27;s extensive writings earned him a prominent place in Czech literary history.

In 1883 the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák composed his Hussite Overture based on melodies used by Hussite soldiers. It was often performed by the German conductor Hans von Bülow.

Professor Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk used Hus&#x27;s name in his speech at Geneva University on 6 July 1915, for defense against Austria and in July 1917 for the title of the first corps of troops of his legions in Russia.

Today, the Jan Hus Memorial is located at the Prague Old Town Square (), and there are many smaller memorials in other towns throughout the Czech Republic.

In New York City, a church in Brooklyn (located at 153 Ocean Avenue) and a church and a theatre in Manhattan (located at 351 East 74th Street) are named for Hus, the John Hus Moravian Church and the Jan Hus Playhouse, respectively. Although Manhattan&#x27;s church and theatre share a single building and management, the playhouse&#x27;s productions are usually nonreligious or nondenominational.

A statue of Jan Hus was erected at the Union Cemetery in Bohemia, New York (on Long Island) by Czech immigrants to the New York area in 1893.

In contrast to the popular perception that Hus was a proto-Protestant, some Eastern Orthodox Christians have argued that his theology was far closer to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Jan Hus is considered a martyr saint in some jurisdictions of the Orthodox Church. The Czechoslovak Hussite Church claims to trace its origin to Hus, to be &quot;neo-Hussite&quot;, and contains mixed Eastern Orthodox and Protestant elements. Nowadays, he is considered a saint by the Orthodox churches of Greece, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, and several others.

Hus was voted the greatest hero of the Czech nation in a 2015 survey by Czech Radio.

==In popular culture==

<text>The Juruá River ( ; ) is a southern affluent river of the Amazon River west of the Purus River, sharing with this the bottom of the immense inland Amazon depression, and having all the characteristics of the Purus as regards curvature, sluggishness and general features of the low, half-flooded forest country it traverses.

For most of its length, the river flows through the Purus várzea ecoregion.
This is surrounded by the Juruá-Purus moist forests ecoregion.
It rises among the Ucayali highlands, and is navigable and unobstructed for a distance of above its junction with the Amazon. It has a total length of approximately , and is one of the longest tributaries of the Amazon.

The Médio Juruá Extractive Reserve, created in 1997, is on the left bank of the river as it meanders in a generally northeast direction through the municipality of Carauari.
The lower Juruá River forms the western boundary of the Baixo Juruá Extractive Reserve, created in 2001. Since 2018, the lower portion of the river in Brazil has been designated a protected Ramsar site.
