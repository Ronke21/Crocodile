<text>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.

As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging &quot;musician&#x27;s music&quot; which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.

The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music&#x27;s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.

== Etymology and definition==

The origin of the word &quot;jazz&quot; has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to &quot;jasm&quot;, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning . The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a &#x27;jazz ball&#x27; &quot;because it wobbles and you simply can&#x27;t do anything with it&quot;.

The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune.&quot; Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916, &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; article about &quot;jas bands&quot;. In an interview with National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the slang connotations of the term, saying: &quot;When Broadway picked it up, they called it &#x27;J-A-Z-Z&#x27;. It wasn&#x27;t called that. It was spelled &#x27;J-A-S-S&#x27;. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn&#x27;t say it in front of ladies.&quot; The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th Century.

Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a &quot;form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music&quot; and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a &quot;special relationship to time defined as &#x27;swing. Jazz involves &quot;a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role&quot; and contains a &quot;sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician&quot;.

A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: &quot;it is music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an &#x27;individual voice&#x27;, and being open to different musical possibilities&quot;. Krin Gibbard argued that &quot;jazz is a construct&quot; which designates &quot;a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition&quot;. Duke Ellington, one of jazz&#x27;s most famous figures, said, &quot;It&#x27;s all music.&quot;

==Elements==

===Improvisation===

Although jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it contains many subgenres, improvisation is one of its defining elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. Classical music performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer&#x27;s goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer. The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer&#x27;s mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.

In early Dixieland, a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising countermelodies. In the swing era of the 1920s–40s, big bands relied more on arrangements which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the bebop era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the piece was improvised. Modal jazz abandoned chord progressions to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the composition structure and complement the soloist. In avant-garde and free jazz, the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.

===Traditionalism===
Since the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a &quot;tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form&quot;. Regarding the Dixieland jazz revival of the 1940s, Black musicians rejected it as being shallow nostalgia entertainment for white audiences. On the other hand, traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An alternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles. By avoiding the creation of norms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.

== Diversity in jazz ==

===Jazz and race===
For some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to African-American contributions to culture and history. For others, jazz is a reminder of &quot;an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions&quot;. Amiri Baraka argues that there is a &quot;white jazz&quot; genre that expresses whiteness. White jazz musicians appeared in the Midwest and in other areas throughout the U.S. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was called &quot;the father of white jazz&quot;. The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the 1920s. The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians such as Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of swing during the 1930s. Many bands included both Black and white musicians. These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the U.S.

===Roles of women===
Female jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz throughout its history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O&#x27;Day, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters were recognized for their vocal talent, less familiar were bandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, trumpeter Valaida Snow, and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early 1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano.

When male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II, many all-female bands replaced them. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, which was founded in 1937, was a popular band that became the first all-female integrated band in the U.S. and the first to travel with the USO, touring Europe in 1945. Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson. Beginning in the 1950s, many women jazz instrumentalists were prominent, some sustaining long careers. Some of the most distinctive improvisers, composers, and bandleaders in jazz have been women. Trombonist Melba Liston is acknowledged as the first female horn player to work in major bands and to make a real impact on jazz, not only as a musician but also as a respected composer and arranger, particularly through her collaborations with Randy Weston from the late 1950s into the 1990s.

===Jews in jazz===


Jewish Americans played a significant role in jazz. As jazz spread, it developed to encompass many different cultures, and the work of Jewish composers in Tin Pan Alley helped shape the many different sounds that jazz came to incorporate.

Jewish Americans were able to thrive in Jazz because of the probationary whiteness that they were allotted at the time. George Bornstein wrote that African Americans were sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish American and vice versa. As disenfranchised minorities themselves, Jewish composers of popular music saw themselves as natural allies with African Americans.

&quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; with Al Jolson is one example of how Jewish Americans were able to bring jazz, music that African Americans developed, into popular culture. Benny Goodman was a vital Jewish American to the progression of Jazz. Goodman was the leader of a racially integrated band named King of Swing. His jazz concert in the Carnegie Hall in 1938 was the first ever to be played there. The concert was described by Bruce Eder as &quot;the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history&quot;.

Shep Fields also helped to popularize &quot;Sweet&quot; Jazz music through his appearances and big band remote broadcasts from such landmark venues as Chicago&#x27;s Palmer House, Broadway&#x27;s Paramount Theater and the Starlight Roof at the famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He entertained audiences with a light elegant musical style which remained popular with audiences for nearly three decades from the 1930s until the late 1950s.

== Early development ==
Jazz originated in the late-19th to early-20th century. It developed out of many forms of music, including blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. It also incorporated interpretations of American and European classical music, entwined with African and slave folk songs and the influences of West African culture. Its composition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each performer&#x27;s personal interpretation and improvisation, which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre.

===Blended African and European music sensibilities===

By the 18th century, slaves in the New Orleans area gathered socially at a special market, in an area which later became known as Congo Square, famous for its African dances.

By 1866, the Atlantic slave trade had brought nearly 400,000 Africans to North America. The slaves came largely from West Africa and the greater Congo River basin and brought strong musical traditions with them. The African traditions primarily use a single-line melody and call-and-response pattern, and the rhythms have a counter-metric structure and reflect African speech patterns.

An 1885 account says that they were making strange music (Creole) on an equally strange variety of &#x27;instruments&#x27;—washboards, washtubs, jugs, boxes beaten with sticks or bones and a drum made by stretching skin over a flour-barrel.

Lavish festivals with African-based dances to drums were organized on Sundays at Place Congo, or Congo Square, in New Orleans until 1843. There are historical accounts of other music and dance gatherings elsewhere in the southern United States. Robert Palmer said of percussive slave music:

Usually such music was associated with annual festivals, when the year&#x27;s crop was harvested and several days were set aside for celebration. As late as 1861, a traveler in North Carolina saw dancers dressed in costumes that included horned headdresses and cow tails and heard music provided by a sheepskin-covered &quot;gumbo box&quot;, apparently a frame drum; triangles and jawbones furnished the auxiliary percussion. There are quite a few [accounts] from the southeastern states and Louisiana dating from the period 1820–1850. Some of the earliest [Mississippi] Delta settlers came from the vicinity of New Orleans, where drumming was never actively discouraged for very long and homemade drums were used to accompany public dancing until the outbreak of the Civil War.
Another influence came from the harmonic style of hymns of the church, which black slaves had learned and incorporated into their own music as spirituals. The origins of the blues are undocumented, though they can be seen as the secular counterpart of the spirituals. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, whereas the spirituals are homophonic, rural blues and early jazz &quot;was largely based on concepts of heterophony&quot;.

During the early 19th century an increasing number of black musicians learned to play European instruments, particularly the violin, which they used to parody European dance music in their own cakewalk dances. In turn, European American minstrel show performers in blackface popularized the music internationally, combining syncopation with European harmonic accompaniment. In the mid-1800s the white New Orleans composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other Caribbean islands into piano salon music. New Orleans was the main nexus between the Afro-Caribbean and African American cultures.

===African rhythmic retention===
The Black Codes outlawed drumming by slaves, which meant that African drumming traditions were not preserved in North America, unlike in Cuba, Haiti, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. African-based rhythmic patterns were retained in the United States in large part through &quot;body rhythms&quot; such as stomping, clapping, and patting juba dancing.

In the opinion of jazz historian Ernest Borneman, what preceded New Orleans jazz before 1890 was &quot;Afro-Latin music&quot;, similar to what was played in the Caribbean at the time. A three-stroke pattern known in Cuban music as &quot;tresillo&quot; is a fundamental rhythmic figure heard in many different slave musics of the Caribbean, as well as the Afro-Caribbean folk dances performed in New Orleans Congo Square and Gottschalk&#x27;s compositions (for example &quot;Souvenirs From Havana&quot; (1859)). Tresillo (shown below) is the most basic and most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music traditions and the music of the African Diaspora.

&lt;/score&gt;

Tresillo is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music and in other forms of popular music from that city from the turn of the 20th century to present. &quot;By and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns survived in jazz ... because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions,&quot; jazz historian Gunther Schuller observed. &quot;Some survived, others were discarded as the Europeanization progressed.&quot;

In the post-Civil War period (after 1865), African Americans were able to obtain surplus military bass drums, snare drums and fifes, and an original African-American drum and fife music emerged, featuring tresillo and related syncopated rhythmic figures. This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean counterparts, expressing a uniquely African-American sensibility. &quot;The snare and bass drummers played syncopated cross-rhythms,&quot; observed the writer Robert Palmer, speculating that &quot;this tradition must have dated back to the latter half of the nineteenth century, and it could have not have developed in the first place if there hadn&#x27;t been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured.&quot;

===Afro-Cuban influence===

African-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 19th century when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity. Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera &quot;reached the U.S. twenty years before the first rag was published.&quot; For the more than quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music.

Habaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically based on an African motif (1803). From the perspective of African-American music, the &quot;habanera rhythm&quot; (also known as &quot;congo&quot;), &quot;tango-congo&quot;, or tango. can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat. The habanera was the first of many Cuban music genres which enjoyed periods of popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo-based rhythms in African-American music.

&lt;/score&gt;

New Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Ojos Criollos (Danse Cubaine)&quot; (1860) was influenced by the composer&#x27;s studies in Cuba: the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand. In Gottschalk&#x27;s symphonic work &quot;A Night in the Tropics&quot; (1859), the tresillo variant cinquillo appears extensively. The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers.

&lt;/score&gt;

Comparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans &quot;clavé&quot;, a Spanish word meaning &quot;code&quot; or &quot;key&quot;, as in the key to a puzzle, or mystery. Although the pattern is only half a clave, Marsalis makes the point that the single-celled figure is the guide-pattern of New Orleans music. Jelly Roll Morton called the rhythmic figure the Spanish tinge and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz.

===Ragtime===
The abolition of slavery in 1865 led to new opportunities for the education of freed African Americans. Although strict segregation limited employment opportunities for most blacks, many were able to find work in entertainment. Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances, minstrel shows, and in vaudeville, during which time many marching bands were formed. Black pianists played in bars, clubs, and brothels, as ragtime developed.

Ragtime appeared as sheet music, popularized by African-American musicians such as the entertainer Ernest Hogan, whose hit songs appeared in 1895. Two years later, Vess Ossman recorded a medley of these songs as a banjo solo known as &quot;Rag Time Medley&quot;. Also in 1897, the white composer William Krell published his &quot;Mississippi Rag&quot; as the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece, and Tom Turpin published his &quot;Harlem Rag&quot;, the first rag published by an African-American.

Classically trained pianist Scott Joplin produced his &quot;Original Rags&quot; in 1898 and, in 1899, had an international hit with &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot;, a multi-strain ragtime march with four parts that feature recurring themes and a bass line with copious seventh chords. Its structure was the basis for many other rags, and the syncopations in the right hand, especially in the transition between the first and second strain, were novel at the time. The last four measures of Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; (1899) are shown below.

&lt;/score&gt;

African-based rhythmic patterns such as tresillo and its variants, the habanera rhythm and cinquillo, are heard in the ragtime compositions of Joplin and Turpin. Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Solace&quot; (1909) is generally considered to be in the habanera genre: both of the pianist&#x27;s hands play in a syncopated fashion, completely abandoning any sense of a march rhythm. Ned Sublette postulates that the tresillo/habanera rhythm &quot;found its way into ragtime and the cakewalk,&quot; whilst Roberts suggests that &quot;the habanera influence may have been part of what freed black music from ragtime&#x27;s European bass&quot;.

===Ragtime in other regions===
In the northeastern United States, a &quot;hot&quot; style of playing ragtime had developed, notably James Reese Europe&#x27;s symphonic Clef Club orchestra in New York City, which played a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in 1912. The Baltimore rag style of Eubie Blake influenced James P. Johnson&#x27;s development of stride piano playing, in which the right hand plays the melody, while the left hand provides the rhythm and bassline.

In Ohio and elsewhere in the mid-west the major influence was ragtime, until about 1919. Around 1912, when the four-string banjo and saxophone came in, musicians began to improvise the melody line, but the harmony and rhythm remained unchanged. A contemporary account states that blues could only be heard in jazz in the gut-bucket cabarets, which were generally looked down upon by the Black middle-class.

===Blues===
====African genesis====
Blues is the name given to both a musical form and a music genre, which originated in African-American communities of primarily the Deep South of the United States at the end of the 19th century from their spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants and rhymed simple narrative ballads.

The African use of pentatonic scales contributed to the development of blue notes in blues and jazz. As Kubik explains:

Many of the rural blues of the Deep South are &quot;stylistically&quot; an extension and merger of basically two broad accompanied song-style traditions in the west central Sudanic belt:
* A strongly Arabic/Islamic song style, as found for example among the Hausa. It is characterized by melisma, wavy intonation, pitch instabilities within a pentatonic framework, and a declamatory voice.
* An ancient west central Sudanic stratum of pentatonic song composition, often associated with simple work rhythms in a regular meter, but with notable off-beat accents.

====W. C. Handy: early published blues====

W. C. Handy became interested in folk blues of the Deep South while traveling through the Mississippi Delta. In this folk blues form, the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range, sounding like a field holler, and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed, like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents, functioning as another &quot;voice&quot;. Handy and his band members were formally trained African-American musicians who had not grown up with the blues, yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form.

Handy wrote about his adopting of the blues:

The primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ... , and I carried this device into my melody as well.

The publication of his &quot;Memphis Blues&quot; sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but &quot;more like a cakewalk&quot;). This composition, as well as his later &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot; and others, included the habanera rhythm, and would become jazz standards. Handy&#x27;s music career began in the pre-jazz era and contributed to the codification of jazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music.

===New Orleans origins===


The music of New Orleans, Louisiana had a profound effect on the creation of early jazz. In New Orleans, slaves could practice elements of their culture such as voodoo and playing drums. Many early jazz musicians played in the bars and brothels of the red-light district around Basin Street called Storyville. In addition to dance bands, there were marching bands which played at lavish funerals (later called jazz funerals). The instruments used by marching bands and dance bands became the instruments of jazz: brass, drums, and reeds tuned in the European 12-tone scale. Small bands contained a combination of self-taught and formally educated musicians, many from the funeral procession tradition. These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south. Beginning in 1914, Louisiana Creole and African-American musicians played in vaudeville shows which carried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U.S. Jazz became international in 1914, when the Creole Band with cornettist Freddie Keppard performed the first ever jazz concert outside the United States, at the Pantages Playhouse Theatre in Winnipeg, Canada.

In New Orleans, a white bandleader named Papa Jack Laine integrated blacks and whites in his marching band. He was known as &quot;the father of white jazz&quot; because of the many top players he employed, such as George Brunies, Sharkey Bonano, and future members of the Original Dixieland Jass Band. During the early 1900s, jazz was mostly performed in African-American and mulatto communities due to segregation laws. Storyville brought jazz to a wider audience through tourists who visited the port city of New Orleans. Many jazz musicians from African-American communities were hired to perform in bars and brothels. These included Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton in addition to those from other communities, such as Lorenzo Tio and Alcide Nunez. Louis Armstrong started his career in Storyville and found success in Chicago. Storyville was shut down by the U.S. government in 1917.

==== Syncopation ====

Cornetist Buddy Bolden played in New Orleans from 1895 to 1906. No recordings by him exist. His band is credited with creating the big four: the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.

Afro-Creole pianist Jelly Roll Morton began his career in Storyville. Beginning in 1904, he toured with vaudeville shows to southern cities, Chicago, and New York City. In 1905, he composed &quot;Jelly Roll Blues&quot;, which became the first jazz arrangement in print when it was published in 1915. It introduced more musicians to the New Orleans style.

Morton considered the tresillo/habanera, which he called the Spanish tinge, an essential ingredient of jazz. &quot;Now in one of my earliest tunes, &quot;New Orleans Blues,&quot; you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can&#x27;t manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz.&quot;

An excerpt of &quot;New Orleans Blues&quot; is shown below. In the excerpt, the left hand plays the tresillo rhythm, while the right hand plays variations on cinquillo.

Morton was a crucial innovator in the evolution from the early jazz form known as ragtime to jazz piano, and could perform pieces in either style; in 1938, Morton made a series of recordings for the Library of Congress in which he demonstrated the difference between the two styles. Morton&#x27;s solos, however, were still close to ragtime, and were not merely improvisations over chord changes as in later jazz, but his use of the blues was of equal importance.

====Swing in the early 20th century====
Morton loosened ragtime&#x27;s rigid rhythmic feeling, decreasing its embellishments and employing a swing feeling. Swing is the most important and enduring African-based rhythmic technique used in jazz. An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is: &quot;if you don&#x27;t feel it, you&#x27;ll never know it.&quot; &quot;The New Harvard Dictionary of Music&quot; states that swing is: &quot;An intangible rhythmic momentum in jazz...Swing defies analysis; claims to its presence may inspire arguments.&quot; The dictionary does nonetheless provide the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat contrasted with duple subdivisions: swing superimposes six subdivisions of the beat over a basic pulse structure or four subdivisions. This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in African-American music than in Afro-Caribbean music. One aspect of swing, which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics, places strokes in-between the triple and duple-pulse &quot;grids&quot;.

New Orleans brass bands are a lasting influence, contributing horn players to the world of professional jazz with the distinct sound of the city whilst helping black children escape poverty. The leader of New Orleans&#x27;s Camelia Brass Band, D&#x27;Jalma Ganier, taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet; Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing, and then expand it. Like Jelly Roll Morton, Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime&#x27;s stiffness in favor of swung notes. Armstrong, perhaps more than any other musician, codified the rhythmic technique of swing in jazz and broadened the jazz solo vocabulary.

The Original Dixieland Jass Band made the music&#x27;s first recordings early in 1917, and their &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; became the earliest released jazz record. That year, numerous other bands made recordings featuring &quot;jazz&quot; in the title or band name, but most were ragtime or novelty records rather than jazz. In February 1918 during World War I, James Reese Europe&#x27;s &quot;Hellfighters&quot; infantry band took ragtime to Europe, then on their return recorded Dixieland standards including &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;.

== The Jazz Age ==
From 1920 to 1933, Prohibition in the United States banned the sale of alcoholic drinks, resulting in illicit speakeasies which became lively venues of the &quot;Jazz Age&quot;, hosting popular music, dance songs, novelty songs, and show tunes. Jazz began to get a reputation as immoral, and many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old cultural values by promoting the decadent values of the Roaring 20s. Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote, &quot;... it is not music at all. It&#x27;s merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears, but the villagers had used pots and pans; another story claimed that the fatal heart attack of a celebrated conductor was caused by jazz.

In 1919, Kid Ory&#x27;s Original Creole Jazz Band of musicians from New Orleans began playing in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where in 1922 they became the first black jazz band of New Orleans origin to make recordings. During the same year, Bessie Smith made her first recordings. Chicago was developing &quot;Hot Jazz&quot;, and King Oliver joined Bill Johnson. Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.

Despite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco. He signed a contract with Victor and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white component, hiring white musicians such as Bix Beiderbecke, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Frankie Trumbauer, and Joe Venuti. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote, &quot;This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form. ... His first theme ... is no mere dance-tune ... it is an idea, or several ideas, correlated and combined in varying and contrasting rhythms that immediately intrigue the listener.&quot;

After Whiteman&#x27;s band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, including Fred Waring, Jean Goldkette, and Nathaniel Shilkret. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman&#x27;s success was based on a &quot;rhetoric of domestication&quot; according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read &quot;white&quot;) a previously inchoate (read &quot;black&quot;) kind of music.

Whiteman&#x27;s success caused black artists to follow suit, including Earl Hines (who opened in The Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago in 1928), Washington, D.C.-native Duke Ellington (who opened at the Cotton Club in Harlem in 1927), Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, Claude Hopkins, and Don Redman, with Henderson and Redman developing the &quot;talking to one another&quot; formula for &quot;hot&quot; swing music.

In 1924, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as featured soloist. By 1924, one of Armstrong&#x27;s favorite &quot;Sweet Jazz&quot; Big bands was also formed in Canada by Guy Lombardo. His Royal Canadians Orchestra specialized in performances of &quot;the Sweetest music this side of Heaven&quot; which transcended racial boundaries. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson&#x27;s band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong&#x27;s solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong&#x27;s bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded &quot;stiff, stodgy&quot;, with &quot;jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality&quot;. The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of &quot;Mandy, Make Up Your Mind&quot; by George W. Meyer and Arthur Johnston (top), compared with Armstrong&#x27;s solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924). Armstrong&#x27;s solos were a significant factor in making jazz a true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson&#x27;s group, Armstrong formed his Hot Five band, where he popularized scat singing.

===Swing in the 1920s and 1930s===

The 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some virtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing the &quot;big&quot; jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry James, Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to &quot;solo&quot; and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex &quot;important&quot; music.

Over time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as &quot;jumping the blues&quot; or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on boogie-woogie from the 1930s.

===The influence of Duke Ellington===
While swing was reaching the height of its popularity, Duke Ellington spent the late 1920s and 1930s in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s jazz scene, developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and musical form with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became hits, and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.

Ellington called his music &quot;American Music&quot;, rather than &quot;jazz&quot;, and liked to describe those who impressed him as &quot;beyond category&quot;. These included many musicians from his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most popular jazz orchestras in the history of jazz. He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals, such as &quot;Jeep&#x27;s Blues&quot; for Johnny Hodges, &quot;Concerto for Cootie&quot; for Cootie Williams (which later became &quot;Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me&quot; with Bob Russell&#x27;s lyrics), and &quot;The Mooche&quot; for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also recorded compositions written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol&#x27;s &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;Perdido&quot;, which brought the &quot;Spanish Tinge&quot; to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.

===Beginnings of European jazz===
As only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and Lonnie Johnson, who visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences&#x27; interest in jazz, as well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time. The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period.

British jazz began with a tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. In 1926, Fred Elizalde and His Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras, and jazz instrumentalists became numerous.

This style entered full swing in France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which began in 1934. Much of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well-trained; in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since his style was also a fusion of the two. Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz, a mix of 1930s American swing, French dance hall &quot;musette&quot;, and Eastern European folk with a languid, seductive feel; the main instruments were steel stringed guitar, violin, and double bass. Solos pass from one player to another as guitar and bass form the rhythm section. Some researchers believe Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti pioneered the guitar-violin partnership characteristic of the genre, which was brought to France after they had been heard live or on Okeh Records in the late 1920s.

== Post-war jazz ==

The outbreak of World War II marked a turning point for jazz. The swing-era jazz of the previous decade had challenged other popular music as being representative of the nation&#x27;s culture, with big bands reaching the height of the style&#x27;s success by the early 1940s; swing acts and big bands traveled with U.S. military overseas to Europe, where it also became popular. Stateside, however, the war presented difficulties for the big-band format: conscription shortened the number of musicians available; the military&#x27;s need for shellac (commonly used for pressing gramophone records) limited record production; a shortage of rubber (also due to the war effort) discouraged bands from touring via road travel; and a demand by the musicians&#x27; union for a commercial recording ban limited music distribution between 1942 and 1944.

Many of the big bands who were deprived of experienced musicians because of the war effort began to enlist young players who were below the age for conscription, as was the case with saxophonist Stan Getz&#x27;s entry in a band as a teenager. This coincided with a nationwide resurgence in the Dixieland style of pre-swing jazz; performers such as clarinetist George Lewis, cornetist Bill Davison, and trombonist Turk Murphy were hailed by conservative jazz critics as more authentic than the big bands. Elsewhere, with the limitations on recording, small groups of young musicians developed a more uptempo, improvisational style of jazz, collaborating and experimenting with new ideas for melodic development, rhythmic language, and harmonic substitution, during informal, late-night jam sessions hosted in small clubs and apartments. Key figures in this development were largely based in New York and included pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, drummers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, saxophonist Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. This musical development became known as bebop.

Bebop and subsequent post-war jazz developments featured a wider set of notes, played in more complex patterns and at faster tempos than previous jazz. According to Clive James, bebop was &quot;the post-war musical development which tried to ensure that jazz would no longer be the spontaneous sound of joy ... Students of race relations in America are generally agreed that the exponents of post-war jazz were determined, with good reason, to present themselves as challenging artists rather than tame entertainers.&quot; The end of the war marked &quot;a revival of the spirit of experimentation and musical pluralism under which it had been conceived&quot;, along with &quot;the beginning of a decline in the popularity of jazz music in America&quot;, according to American academic Michael H. Burchett.

With the rise of bebop and the end of the swing era after the war, jazz lost its cachet as pop music. Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers; these included Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Dick Haymes, and Doris Day. Older musicians who still performed their pre-war jazz, such as Armstrong and Ellington, were gradually viewed in the mainstream as passé. Other younger performers, such as singer Big Joe Turner and saxophonist Louis Jordan, who were discouraged by bebop&#x27;s increasing complexity, pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, jump blues, and eventually rock and roll. Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable pieces for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences&#x27; purview. &quot;The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences&quot;, Burchett said. &quot;The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its artistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz.&quot; During its swing period, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to Paul Trynka, this changed in the post-war years:

===Bebop===

In the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging &quot;musician&#x27;s music&quot;. The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.

Composer Gunther Schuller wrote: &quot;In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was &#x27;bop&#x27; and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.&quot;

Dizzy Gillespie wrote: &quot;People talk about the Hines band being &#x27;the incubator of bop&#x27; and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.&quot;

Since bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.

Bebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note; bebop also uses &quot;passing&quot; chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. New forms of chromaticism and dissonance were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant tritone (or &quot;flatted fifth&quot;) interval became the &quot;most important interval of bebop&quot; Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era tunes and reused with a new and more complex melody or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I–IV–V, but often infused with ii–V motion) and &quot;rhythm changes&quot; (I-vi-ii-V) – the chords to the 1930s pop standard &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;. Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.

The harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing &quot;Cherokee&quot; at Clark Monroe&#x27;s Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. &quot;I&#x27;d been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used...and I kept thinking there&#x27;s bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn&#x27;t play it...I was working over &#x27;Cherokee,&#x27; and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I&#x27;d been hearing. It came alive.&quot; Gerhard Kubik postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and African-related tonal sensibilities rather than 20th-century Western classical music. &quot;Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker&#x27;s] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.&quot;

Samuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle. Kubik wrote:

While for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western &quot;serious&quot; music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke&#x27;s piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions.

These divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed filled with &quot;racing, nervous phrases&quot;. But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.

===Afro-Cuban jazz (cu-bop)===

====Machito and Mario Bauza====
The general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was &quot;Tanga&quot; (1943), composed by Cuban-born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. &quot;Tanga&quot; began as a spontaneous descarga (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.

This was the birth of Afro-Cuban jazz. The use of clave brought the African &quot;timeline&quot;, or &quot;key pattern&quot;, into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African cross-rhythm. Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic &quot;one&quot; is always understood to be &quot;one&quot;. If the progression begins on the &quot;three-side&quot; of clave, it is said to be in &quot;3–2 clave&quot; (shown below). If the progression begins on the &quot;two-side&quot;, it is in &quot;2–3 clave&quot;.

&lt;/score&gt;

====Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo====

Mario Bauzá introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer Chano Pozo. Gillespie and Pozo&#x27;s brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. &quot;Manteca&quot; (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: &quot;If I&#x27;d let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn&#x27;t have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.&quot; The bridge gave &quot;Manteca&quot; a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza&#x27;s modal &quot;Tanga&quot; of a few years earlier.

Gillespie&#x27;s collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, &quot;cu-bop&quot; also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of &quot;Manteca&quot;, &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;, &quot;Tin Tin Deo&quot;, and &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot;.

==== &quot;Un Poco Loco&quot; ====
Another jazz composition critical to the development of Afro-Cuban jazz was Bud Powell&#x27;s &quot;Un Poco Loco,&quot; recorded with Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums. Noted for its &quot;frenetic energy&quot; and &quot;clanging cowbell and polyrhythmic accompaniment,&quot; the composition combined Afro-Cuban rhythm with polytonality and preceded further use of modality and avant-garde harmony in Latin jazz.

====African cross-rhythm====

Cuban percussionist Mongo Santamaria first recorded his composition &quot;Afro Blue&quot; in 1959.
&quot;Afro Blue&quot; was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The piece begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of , or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats—6:4 (two cells of 3:2).

The following example shows the original ostinato &quot;Afro Blue&quot; bass line. The cross noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes).

&lt;/score&gt;

When John Coltrane covered &quot;Afro Blue&quot; in 1963, he inverted the metric hierarchy, interpreting the tune as a jazz waltz with duple cross-beats superimposed (2:3). Originally a B pentatonic blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of &quot;Afro Blue&quot;.

Perhaps the most respected Afro-cuban jazz combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist Cal Tjader&#x27;s band. Tjader had Mongo Santamaria, Armando Peraza, and Willie Bobo on his early recording dates.

===Dixieland revival===
In the late 1940s, there was a revival of Dixieland, harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as Bob Crosby&#x27;s Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the Lu Watters band, Conrad Janis, and Ward Kimball and his Firehouse Five Plus Two Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong&#x27;s Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.

===Hard bop===
Hard bop is an extension of bebop (or &quot;bop&quot;) music that incorporates influences from blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel, especially in saxophone and piano playing. Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. It has been described as &quot;funky&quot; and can be considered a relative of soul jazz. Some elements of the genre were simplified from their bebop roots.

Miles Davis&#x27;s 1954 performance of &quot;Walkin&#x27;&quot; at the first Newport Jazz Festival introduced the style to the jazz world. Further leaders of hard bop&#x27;s development included the Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet, Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers, the Horace Silver Quintet, and trumpeters Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard. The late 1950s to early 1960s saw hard boppers form their own bands as a new generation of blues- and bebop-influenced musicians entered the jazz world, from pianists Wynton Kelly and Tommy Flanagan to saxophonists Joe Henderson and Hank Mobley. Coltrane, Johnny Griffin, Mobley, and Morgan all participated on the album &quot;A Blowin&#x27; Session&quot; (1957), considered by Al Campbell to have been one of the high points of the hard bop era.

Hard bop was prevalent within jazz for about a decade spanning from 1955 to 1965, but has remained highly influential on mainstream or &quot;straight-ahead&quot; jazz. It went into decline in the late 1960s through the 1970s due to the emergence of other styles such as jazz fusion, but again became influential following the Young Lions Movement and the emergence of neo-bop.

===Modal jazz===

Modal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given chord progression, but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody: &quot;Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale)&quot;, explained pianist Mark Levine.

The modal theory stems from a work by George Russell. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis&#x27;s earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.

&quot;I didn&#x27;t write out the music for &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,&quot; recalled Davis. The track &quot;So What&quot; has only two chords: D-7 and E-7.

Other innovators in this style include Jackie McLean, and two of the musicians who had also played on &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;: John Coltrane and Bill Evans.

===Free jazz===
Free jazz, and the related form of avant-garde jazz, broke through into an open space of &quot;free tonality&quot; in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of world music from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing. While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist Charles Mingus is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.

The first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of Ornette Coleman (whose 1960 album &quot;Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation&quot; coined the term) and Cecil Taylor. In the 1960s, exponents included Albert Ayler, Gato Barbieri, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, John Coltrane, Bill Dixon, Jimmy Giuffre, Steve Lacy, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, Roswell Rudd, Pharoah Sanders, and John Tchicai. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler&#x27;s trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, a rhythm section honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic &quot;Chasin&#x27; the &#x27;Trane&quot;, which &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine panned as &quot;anti-jazz&quot;. On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new Impulse! Records in 1960 and turning it into &quot;the house that Trane built&quot;, while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably Archie Shepp, who often played with trumpeter Bill Dixon, who organized the 4-day &quot;October Revolution in Jazz&quot; in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.

A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane&#x27;s playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, utilization of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane&#x27;s sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom. The group&#x27;s evolution can be traced through the recordings &quot;The John Coltrane Quartet Plays&quot;, &quot;Living Space&quot; and &quot;Transition&quot; (both June 1965), &quot;New Thing at Newport&quot; (July 1965), &quot;Sun Ship&quot; (August 1965), and &quot;First Meditations&quot; (September 1965).

In June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded &quot;Ascension&quot;, a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avant-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. Dave Liebman later called it &quot;the torch that lit the free jazz thing&quot;. After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.

====Free jazz in Europe====
Free jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, Steve Lacy, and Eric Dolphy spent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as Michael Mantler and John Tchicai traveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand. European contemporary jazz was shaped by Peter Brötzmann, John Surman, Krzysztof Komeda, Zbigniew Namysłowski, Tomasz Stańko, Lars Gullin, Joe Harriott, Albert Mangelsdorff, Kenny Wheeler, Graham Collier, Michael Garrick and Mike Westbrook. They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage.

Since the 1960s, creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. Following the work of drummer Han Bennink and pianist Misha Mengelberg, musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form (melody, rhythm, a famous song) is found Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book &quot;New Dutch Swing&quot;. Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism. British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory.

===Latin jazz===
Latin jazz is jazz that employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be &quot;Afro-Latin jazz&quot;, as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are Afro-Cuban jazz and Brazilian jazz.

In the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as &quot;Latin tunes&quot;, with no distinction between a Cuban son montuno and a Brazilian bossa nova. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Styles: History and Analysis&quot;, a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a &quot;Latin bass figure&quot;. It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban tumbao while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as &quot;Manteca&quot;, &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; and &quot;Song for My Father&quot; have a &quot;Latin&quot; A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth &quot;Latin&quot; feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like Cal Tjader tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;, pianist Vince Guaraldi soloed through the entire form over an authentic mambo.

====Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance====
For most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both salsa dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass). During 1974–1976, they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri&#x27;s most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.

This occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba The first Cuban band of this new wave was Irakere. Their &quot;Chékere-son&quot; (1976) introduced a style of &quot;Cubanized&quot; bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker&#x27;s composition &quot;Billie&#x27;s Bounce&quot;, jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines. In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere&#x27;s Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as timba.

====Afro-Brazilian jazz====
Brazilian jazz, such as bossa nova, is derived from samba, with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related jazz-samba is an adaptation of street samba into jazz.

The bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim and was made popular by Elizete Cardoso&#x27;s recording of &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; on the &quot;Canção do Amor Demais&quot; LP. Gilberto&#x27;s initial releases, and the 1959 film &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, achieved significant popularity in Latin America; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova&#x27;s popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963&#x27;s &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra, and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.

Brazilian percussionists such as Airto Moreira and Naná Vasconcelos also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.

While bossa nova has been labeled as jazz by music critics, namely those from outside of Brazil, it has been rejected by many prominent bossa nova musicians such as Jobim, who once said &quot;Bossa nova is not Brazilian jazz.&quot;

===African-inspired===

====Rhythm====
The first jazz standard composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African cross-rhythm was Wayne Shorter&#x27;s &quot;Footprints&quot; (1967). On the version recorded on &quot;Miles Smiles&quot; by Miles Davis, the bass switches to a tresillo figure at 2:20. &quot;Footprints&quot; is not, however, a Latin jazz tune: African rhythmic structures are accessed directly by Ron Carter (bass) and Tony Williams (drums) via the rhythmic sensibilities of swing. Throughout the piece, the four beats, whether sounded or not, are maintained as the temporal referent. The following example shows the and forms of the bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where one ordinarily taps their foot to &quot;keep time&quot;.

 } »
&lt;/score&gt;

====Pentatonic scales====
The use of pentatonic scales was another trend associated with Africa. The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.

McCoy Tyner perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos, and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.

The minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by Joe Henderson on Horace Silver&#x27;s &quot;African Queen&quot; (1965).

Jazz pianist, theorist, and educator Mark Levine refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the &quot;V pentatonic scale&quot;.

Levine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II–V–I jazz progression. This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Tune Up&quot;. The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II–V–I progression.

Accordingly, John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Giant Steps&quot; (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied Nicolas Slonimsky&#x27;s &quot;Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns&quot;, which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of &quot;Giant Steps&quot;. The harmonic complexity of &quot;Giant Steps&quot; is on the level of the most advanced 20th-century art music. Superimposing the pentatonic scale over &quot;Giant Steps&quot; is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification, but also a sort of &quot;Africanizing&quot; of the piece, which provides an alternate approach for soloing. Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional &quot;playing the changes&quot;, pentatonic scales provide &quot;structure and a feeling of increased space&quot;.

===Sacred and liturgical jazz===

As noted above, jazz has incorporated from its inception aspects of African-American sacred music including spirituals and hymns. Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals and hymns as part of their repertoire or isolated compositions such as &quot;Come Sunday&quot;, part of &quot;Black and Beige Suite&quot; by Duke Ellington. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black gospel music. However, it was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings or as religious expression. Since the 1950s, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. The &quot;Abyssinian Mass&quot; by Wynton Marsalis (Blueengine Records, 2016) is a recent example.

Relatively little has been written about sacred and liturgical jazz. In a 2013 doctoral dissertation, Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of musicology and history. He noted that the traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce a new genre, &quot;sacred jazz&quot;. Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams, known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and Duke Ellington. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, Duke Ellington wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 – A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 – Second Sacred Concert; 1973 – Third Sacred Concert.

The most prominent form of sacred and liturgical jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was Mary Lou Williams. Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957, and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom. One was composed in 1968 to honor the recently assassinated Martin Luther King Jr. and the third was commissioned by a pontifical commission. It was performed once in 1975 in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City. However the Catholic Church has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship. In 1966 Joe Masters recorded &quot;Jazz Mass&quot; for Columbia Records. A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass. Other examples include &quot;Jazz Mass in Concert&quot; by Lalo Schiffrin (Aleph Records, 1998, UPC 0651702632725) and &quot;Jazz Mass&quot; by Vince Guaraldi (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical composer Will Todd recorded his &quot;Jazz Missa Brevis&quot; with a jazz ensemble, soloists and the St Martin&#x27;s Voices on a 2018 Signum Records release, &quot;Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis&quot; also released as &quot;Mass in Blue&quot;, and jazz organist James Taylor composed &quot;The Rochester Mass&quot; (Cherry Red Records, 2015). In 2013, Versace put forth bassist Ike Sturm and New York composer Deanna Witkowski as contemporary exemplars of sacred and liturgical jazz.

===Jazz fusion===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock fusion was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.

According to AllMusic:

... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with hard bop and did not want to play strictly avant-garde music, the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.

====Miles Davis&#x27;s new directions====
In 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer Teo Macero, this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of ambient music.

As Davis recalls:

The music I was really listening to in 1968 was James Brown, the great guitar player Jimi Hendrix, and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;, Sly and the Family Stone ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.

Two contributors to &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; also joined organist Larry Young to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1969) by The Tony Williams Lifetime.

====Psychedelic-jazz====

=====Weather Report=====
Weather Report&#x27;s self-titled electronic and psychedelic &quot;Weather Report&quot; debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group&#x27;s members (including percussionist Airto Moreira), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing soprano saxophone, and with no synthesizers involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which Joe Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement – but took the music further. To emphasize the group&#x27;s rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece &quot;Milky Way&quot;, which featured by Shorter&#x27;s extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul&#x27;s piano strings while the latter pedaled the instrument. &quot;DownBeat&quot; described the album as &quot;music beyond category&quot;, and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine&#x27;s polls that year.

Weather Report&#x27;s subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.

====Jazz-rock====
Although some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, &quot;fuzz&quot; pedals, wah-wah pedals and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, Eddie Harris, keyboardists Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist Gary Burton, drummer Tony Williams, violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, guitarists Larry Coryell, Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, Ryo Kawasaki, and Frank Zappa, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band Casiopea released more than thirty fusion albums.

According to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, &quot;just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same&quot; with albums such as Williams&#x27;s &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1970) and Davis&#x27;s &quot;Agharta&quot; (1975), which Nicholson said &quot;suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.&quot; This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre &quot;mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio&quot; at the end of the 1970s.

==== Electronic music ====
Although jazz-rock fusion reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include Pat Metheny, John Abercrombie, John Scofield and the Swedish group e.s.t. Since the beginning of the 1990s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz). Artists such as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Flying Lotus and sub genres like IDM, drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass, jungle and techno ended up incorporating a lot of these elements. Squarepusher being cited as one big influence for jazz performers drummer Mark Guiliana and pianist Brad Mehldau, showing the correlations between jazz and electronic music are a two-way street.

===Jazz-funk===

By the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and, often, the presence of electronic analog synthesizers. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican reggae, notably Kingston bandleader Sonny Bradshaw. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of funk, soul, and R&amp;B music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.

Early examples are Herbie Hancock&#x27;s Headhunters band and Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;On the Corner&quot; album, which, in 1972, began Davis&#x27;s foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the &quot;musique concrète&quot; approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero had begun to explore in the late 1960s.

===Straight-ahead jazz===

The 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis&#x27;s critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.

For example, several musicians who had been prominent in the fusion genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, Bill Evans, Joe Henderson, and Stan Getz. Even the 1980s music of Miles Davis, although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognizably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.

A similar reaction took place against free jazz. According to Ted Gioia:the very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. Cecil Taylor played duets in concert with Mary Lou Williams, and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or Don Pullen may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.

Pianist Keith Jarrett—whose bands of the 1970s had played only original compositions with prominent free jazz elements—established his so-called &#x27;Standards Trio&#x27; in 1983, which, although also occasionally exploring collective improvisation, has primarily performed and recorded jazz standards. Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.

In 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative John Conyers Jr. to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating &quot;jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.&quot; It passed in the House on September 23, 1987, and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.

In 2001, Ken Burns&#x27;s documentary &quot;Jazz&quot; premiered on PBS, featuring Wynton Marsalis and other experts reviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time. It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.

==== Neo-bop ====

The emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians&#x27; groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of Betty Carter and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as hard bop and bebop. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey&#x27;s band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as Valery Ponomarev and Bobby Watson, Dennis Irwin and James Williams. In the 1980s, in addition to Wynton and Branford Marsalis, the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as Donald Brown, Mulgrew Miller, and later, Benny Green, bassists such as Charles Fambrough, Lonnie Plaxico (and later, Peter Washington and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as Bill Pierce, Donald Harrison and later Javon Jackson and Terence Blanchard emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in the 1990s and 2000s.

The young Jazz Messengers&#x27; contemporaries, including Roy Hargrove, Marcus Roberts, Wallace Roney and Mark Whitfield were also influenced by Wynton Marsalis&#x27;s emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and early recordings of the first Miles Davis quintet. This group of &quot;Young Lions&quot; sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.

In addition, Betty Carter&#x27;s rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York&#x27;s preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni Benny Green, Branford Marsalis and Ralph Peterson Jr., as well as Kenny Washington, Lewis Nash, Curtis Lundy, Cyrus Chestnut, Mark Shim, Craig Handy, Greg Hutchinson and Marc Cary, Taurus Mateen and Geri Allen. O.T.B. ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as Kenny Garrett, Steve Wilson, Kenny Davis, Renee Rosnes, Ralph Peterson Jr., Billy Drummond, and Robert Hurst.

Starting in the 1990s, a number of players from largely straight-ahead or post-bop backgrounds emerged as a result of the rise of neo-traditionalist jazz, including pianists Jason Moran and Vijay Iyer, guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, vibraphonist Stefon Harris, trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Terence Blanchard, saxophonists Chris Potter and Joshua Redman, clarinetist Ken Peplowski and bassist Christian McBride.

===Smooth jazz===

In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called &quot;pop fusion&quot; or &quot;smooth jazz&quot; became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in &quot;quiet storm&quot; time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including Al Jarreau, Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, and Sade, as well as saxophonists including Grover Washington Jr., Kenny G, Kirk Whalum, Boney James, and David Sanborn. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90–105 beats per minute), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and legato electric guitar are popular).

In his &quot;Newsweek&quot; article &quot;The Problem With Jazz Criticism&quot;, Stanley Crouch considers Miles Davis&#x27;s playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz. Critic Aaron J. West has countered the often negative perceptions of smooth jazz, stating:

I challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.

===Acid jazz, nu jazz, and jazz rap===

Acid jazz developed in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by jazz-funk and electronic dance music. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including sampling or live DJ cutting and scratching), but it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic considers Roy Ayers &quot;one of the prophets of acid jazz&quot;.

Nu jazz is influenced by jazz harmony and melodies, and there are usually no improvisational aspects. It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz house (as exemplified by St Germain, Jazzanova, and Fila Brazillia) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kobol and the Norwegian &quot;future jazz&quot; style pioneered by Bugge Wesseltoft, Jaga Jazzist, and Nils Petter Molvær).

Jazz rap developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into hip-hop. In 1988, Gang Starr released the debut single &quot;Words I Manifest&quot;, which sampled Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;, and Stetsasonic released &quot;Talkin&#x27; All That Jazz&quot;, which sampled Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr&#x27;s debut LP &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; (1989) and their 1990 track &quot;Jazz Thing&quot; sampled Charlie Parker and Ramsey Lewis. The groups which made up the Native Tongues Posse tended toward jazzy releases: these include the Jungle Brothers&#x27; debut &quot;Straight Out the Jungle&quot; (1988), and A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; (1990) and &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; (1991). Rap duo Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut &quot;Mecca and the Soul Brother&quot;. Rapper Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.

Although jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis&#x27;s final album &quot;Doo-Bop&quot; (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip-hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Davis&#x27;s ex-bandmate Herbie Hancock also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album &quot;Dis Is da Drum&quot; in 1994.

The mid-2010s saw an increased influence of R&amp;B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, Kendrick Lamar released his third studio album, &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;. The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as Thundercat and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist Kamasi Washington released his nearly three-hour long debut, &quot;The Epic&quot;. Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&amp;B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant, but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet.

===Punk jazz and jazzcore===

The relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with post-punk in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz. In London, the Pop Group began to mix free jazz and dub reggae into their brand of punk rock. In New York, No Wave took direct inspiration from both free jazz and punk. Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch&#x27;s &quot;Queen of Siam&quot;, Gray, the work of James Chance and the Contortions (who mixed Soul with free jazz and punk) and the Lounge Lizards (the first group to call themselves &quot;punk jazz&quot;).

John Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock, and incorporated this into free jazz with the release of the &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; album in 1986, a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes done in the contemporary thrashcore style. In the same year, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit, a similarly aggressive blend of thrash and free jazz. These developments are the origins of &quot;jazzcore&quot;, the fusion of free jazz with hardcore punk.

===M-Base===
The M-Base movement started in the 1980s, when a loose collective of young African-American musicians in New York which included Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Gary Thomas developed a complex but grooving sound.

In the 1990s, most M-Base participants turned to more conventional music, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued developing his music in accordance with the M-Base concept.

Coleman&#x27;s audience decreased, but his music and concepts influenced many musicians, according to pianist Vijay Iver and critic Ben Ratlifff of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

M-Base changed from a movement of a loose collective of young musicians to a kind of informal Coleman &quot;school&quot;, with a much advanced but already originally implied concept. Steve Coleman&#x27;s music and M-Base concept gained recognition as &quot;next logical step&quot; after Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman.

=== Jazz pluralism ===
Since the 1990s, jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates, but rather a wide range of styles and genres are popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist Brad Mehldau and The Bad Plus have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists Greg Osby and Charles Gayle, while others, such as James Carter, have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.

Harry Connick Jr. began his career playing stride piano and the Dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was 10 years old. Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist Ellis Marsalis. Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;, which sold over two million copies. Crossover success has also been achieved by Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Cassandra Wilson, Kurt Elling, and Jamie Cullum.

Additionally, the era saw the release of recordings and videos from the previous century, such as a Just Jazz tape broadcast by a band led by Gene Ammons and studio archives such as &quot;Just Coolin&quot;&#x27; by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.

==== Social media ====
An internet-aided trend of 2010&#x27;s jazz was that of extreme reharmonization, inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as Art Tatum, as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans. Supergroup Snarky Puppy adopted this trend, allowing players like Cory Henry to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing. YouTube phenomenon Jacob Collier also gained recognition for his ability to play an incredibly large number of instruments and his ability to use microtones, advanced polyrhythms, and blend a spectrum of genres in his largely homemade production process.

Other jazz musicians gained popularity through social media during the 2010s and 2020s. These included Joan Chamorro, a bassist and bandleader based in Barcelona whose big band and jazz combo videos have received tens of millions of views on YouTube, and Emmet Cohen, who broadcast a series of performances live from New York starting in March 2020.

<doc id="15614" wikidata="Q41166" url="?curid=15614" title="Jonathan Swift">
<text>Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745) was an Anglo-Irish writer and satirist who became the Dean of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, and hence his common sobriquet, &quot;Dean Swift&quot;. His deadpan, ironic writing style, particularly in &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;, has led to such satire being subsequently termed &quot;Swiftian&quot;. He is best remembered for his satirical book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, first published in 1726. Following its publication and success, he came to be regarded as, &quot;the foremost prose satirist in the English language.&quot; 

Swift also authored works such as &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; (1704), &quot;An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity&quot; (1712), and &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; (1729). He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms—including Lemuel Gulliver, Isaac Bickerstaff, M. B. Drapier—or anonymously. He was a master of two styles of satire, the Horatian and Juvenalian styles.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in Dublin in the Kingdom of Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640–1667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake in Leicestershire. His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their royalist father&#x27;s estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of Thornton in Leicestershire. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Sometime thereafter, Ericke and his family, including his young daughter Abigail, fled to Ireland.

Swift&#x27;s father joined his elder brother, Godwin, in the practice of law in Ireland. He died in Dublin about seven months before his namesake was born. He died of syphilis, which he said he got from dirty sheets when out of town.

His mother returned to England after his birth, leaving him in the care of his uncle Godwin Swift (1628–1695), a close friend and confidant of Sir John Temple, whose son later employed Swift as his secretary.

At the age of one, child Jonathan was taken by his wet nurse to her hometown of Whitehaven, Cumberland, England. He said that there he learned to read the Bible. His nurse returned him to his mother, still in Ireland, when he was three.&lt;br&gt;
Swift&#x27;s family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth (Dryden) Swift was the niece of Sir Erasmus Dryden, grandfather of poet John Dryden. The same grandmother&#x27;s aunt Katherine (Throckmorton) Dryden was a first cousin of Elizabeth, wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. His great-great-grandmother Margaret (Godwin) Swift was the sister of Francis Godwin, author of &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; which influenced parts of Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir William Davenant, a godson of William Shakespeare.

Swift&#x27;s benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift took primary responsibility for the young man, sending him with one of his cousins to Kilkenny College (also attended by philosopher George Berkeley). He arrived there at the age of six, where he was expected to have already learned the basic declensions in Latin. He had not and thus began his schooling in a lower form. Swift graduated in 1682, when he was 15.

He attended Trinity College Dublin in 1682, financed by Godwin&#x27;s son Willoughby. The four-year course followed a curriculum largely set in the Middle Ages for the priesthood. The lectures were dominated by Aristotelian logic and philosophy. The basic skill taught to students was debate, and they were expected to be able to argue both sides of any argument or topic. Swift was an above-average student but not exceptional, and received his B.A. in 1686 &quot;by special grace&quot;.

===Adult life===
Swift was studying for his master&#x27;s degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park, Farnham. Temple was an English diplomat who had arranged the Triple Alliance of 1668. He had retired from public service to his country estate, to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employer&#x27;s confidence, Swift &quot;was often trusted with matters of great importance.&quot; Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple introduced his secretary to William III and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments.

Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson, then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple&#x27;s sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname &quot;Stella&quot;, and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther&#x27;s life.

In 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health, but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness, now believed to be Ménière&#x27;s disease, and it continued to plague him throughout his life. During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M.A. from Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1692. He then left Moor Park, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple&#x27;s patronage, in order to become an ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland. He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in 1694, with his parish located at Kilroot, near Carrickfergus in County Antrim.

Swift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot, however, he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called &quot;Varina&quot;, the sister of an old college friend. A letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple&#x27;s service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temple&#x27;s death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple&#x27;s memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time, Swift wrote &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot;, a satire responding to critics of Temple&#x27;s &quot;Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning&quot; (1690), though &quot;Battle&quot; was not published until 1704.

Temple died on 27 January 1699. Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple. He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temple&#x27;s memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. His eventual publication of the third volume of Temple&#x27;s memoirs, in 1709, made enemies among some of Temple&#x27;s family and friends, in particular Temple&#x27;s formidable sister Martha, Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs. Moreover, she noted that Swift had borrowed from her own biography, an accusation that Swift denied. Swift&#x27;s next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However, when he reached Ireland, he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another, though he soon obtained the living of Laracor, Agher, and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin.

Swift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at Laracor, which was just over from Summerhill, County Meath, and from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park, planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701, he anonymously published the political pamphlet &quot;A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome&quot;.

====Writer====
Swift resided in Trim, County Meath after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this period. In February 1702, Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College Dublin. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson—now 20—and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple&#x27;s household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift&#x27;s relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed &quot;Stella&quot;. Many, notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan, believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift&#x27;s housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley, who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland, dismissed the story as absurd. Yet Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an &quot;interloper&quot;, and they were estranged for many years.

During his visits to England in these years, Swift published &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; and &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot; (1704) and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close, lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot, forming the core of the Martinus Scriblerus Club (founded in 1713).

Swift became increasingly active politically in these years. Swift had supported the Glorious Revolution and early in his life belonged to the Whigs. As a member of the Anglican Church, he feared a return of the Catholic monarchy and &quot;Papist&quot; absolutism. From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of Lord Godolphin the claims of the Irish clergy to the First-Fruits and Twentieths (&quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Bounty&quot;), which brought in about £2,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition Tory leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of &quot;The Examiner&quot;. In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet &quot;The Conduct of the Allies&quot;, attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret (and illegal) negotiations with France, resulting in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ending the War of the Spanish Succession.

Swift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government, and often acted as mediator between Henry St John (Viscount Bolingbroke), the secretary of state for foreign affairs (1710–15), and Robert Harley (Earl of Oxford), lord treasurer and prime minister (1711–14). Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as &quot;A Journal to Stella&quot;. The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of Queen Anne and the accession of George I that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France.

Swift has been described by scholars as &quot;a Whig in politics and Tory in religion&quot; and Swift related his own views in similar terms, stating that as &quot;a lover of liberty, I found myself to be what they called a Whig in politics ... But, as to religion, I confessed myself to be an High-Churchman.&quot; In his &quot;Thoughts on Religion&quot;, fearing the intense partisan strife waged over religious belief in seventeenth-century England, Swift wrote that &quot;Every man, as a member of the commonwealth, ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private.&quot; However, it should be borne in mind that, during Swift&#x27;s time period, terms like &quot;Whig&quot; and &quot;Tory&quot; both encompassed a wide array of opinions and factions, and neither term aligns with a modern political party or modern political alignments.

Also during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family, Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland, then moved to London, and &quot;became involved with&quot; one of the daughters, Esther. Swift furnished Esther with the nickname &quot;Vanessa&quot;—derived by adding &quot;Essa&quot;, a pet form of Esther, to the &quot;Van&quot; of her surname, Vanhomrigh—and she features as one of the main characters in his poem &quot;Cadenus and Vanessa&quot;. This poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship. Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714 and settled at her old family home, Celbridge Abbey. Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, after having destroyed the will she had made in Swift&#x27;s favour. Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was Anne Long, a &quot;toast&quot; of the Kit-Cat Club.

====Final years====

Before the fall of the Tory government, Swift had hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, which she thought blasphemous, compounded by &quot;The Windsor Prophecy&quot;, where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust. The best position his friends could secure for him was the Deanery of St Patrick&#x27;s; while this appointment was not in the Queen&#x27;s gift, Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it. With the return of the Whigs, Swift&#x27;s best move was to leave England, and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live &quot;like a rat in a hole&quot;.

Once in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: &quot;Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture&quot; (1720), &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot; (1724), and &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; (1729), earned him the status of an Irish patriot. This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of seditious libel in 1720, but four years later a grand jury refused to find that the &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;, which though written under a pseudonym were universally known to be Swift&#x27;s work, were seditious. Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the &quot;vile and profligate villain&quot; William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.

Also during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, &quot;Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships&quot;, better known as &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories&#x27; illegal peace treaty, a treaty he regarded as a good thing accomplished in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London, taking with him the manuscript of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. During his visit, he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope, John Arbuthnot and John Gay, who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book in November 1726 It was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland.

In 1727, Swift returned to England one more time and stayed once again with Alexander Pope. The visit was cut short when Swift, receiving word that Esther Johnson was dying, rushed back home to be with her. On 28 January 1728, Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his &quot;The Death of Mrs Johnson&quot;. He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick&#x27;s. Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Johnson&#x27;s, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, &quot;Only a woman&#x27;s hair.&quot;

=====Death=====

Death became a persistent preoccupation in Swift&#x27;s mind from this point. In 1731 he wrote &quot;Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift&quot;, his own obituary, published in 1739. In 1732, his good friend and collaborator John Gay had died. In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, also died, nd in 1738 Swift too began to show signs of illness, perhaps even suffering a stroke in 1742, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. (&quot;I shall be like that tree&quot;, he once said. &quot;I shall die at the top.&quot;) He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers-ons, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of &quot;unsound mind and memory.&quot; However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book &quot;Literature and Western Man&quot;, author J. B. Priestley even cites the final chapters of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; as proof of Swift&#x27;s approaching &quot;insanity&quot;. Bewley attributes his decline to &#x27;terminal dementia&#x27;.

In part VIII of his series, &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot;, Will Durant describes the final years of Swift&#x27;s life as exhibiting:

Definite symptoms of madness ... [first appearing] in 1738. In 1741, guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence, he should do himself harm. In 1742, he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of ... [a chicken&#x27;s] egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He went a whole year without uttering a word.

In 1744, Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745, Swift died, at nearly 78. After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson&#x27;s side, in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune (£12,000) was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which still exists as a psychiatric hospital.

Jonathan Swift wrote his own epitaph:
W. B. Yeats poetically translated it from the Latin as:

: Swift has sailed into his rest;
: Savage indignation there
: Cannot lacerate his breast.
: Imitate him if you dare,
: World-besotted traveller; he
: Served human liberty.

His library is known through sale catalogues.

====Swift, Stella and Vanessa – an alternative view====
British politician Michael Foot was a great admirer of Swift and wrote about him extensively. In &quot;Debts of Honour&quot; he cites with approbation an explanation propounded by Denis Johnston of Swift&#x27;s behaviour towards Stella and Vanessa.

Pointing to contradictions in the received information about Swift&#x27;s origins and parentage, Johnston postulates that Swift&#x27;s real father was Sir William Temple&#x27;s father, Sir John Temple, who was Master of the Rolls in Dublin at the time. It is widely thought that Stella was Sir William Temple&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. So, if these speculations are to be credited, Swift was Sir William&#x27;s brother and Stella&#x27;s uncle. Marriage or close relations between Swift and Stella would therefore have been incestuous, an unthinkable prospect.

It follows that Swift could not have married Vanessa without Stella appearing to be a cast-off mistress, which appearance he would not contemplate leaving. Johnston&#x27;s theory is expounded fully in his book &quot;In Search of Swift&quot;. He is also cited in the &quot;Dictionary of Irish Biography&quot; and the theory is presented without attribution in the &quot;Concise Cambridge History of English Literature&quot;.

==Works==
Swift was a prolific writer. The collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed. Basil Blackwell, 1965–) comprises fourteen volumes. A 1983 edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed. Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed. P. Lang, 1999) fills three volumes.

===Major prose works===

Swift&#x27;s first major prose work, &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;, demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread, the &quot;Tale&quot; recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their father&#x27;s will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their father&#x27;s admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical &quot;digressions&quot; on various subjects.

In 1690, Sir William Temple, Swift&#x27;s patron, published &quot;An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning&quot; a defence of classical writing (see Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns), holding up the &quot;Epistles of Phalaris&quot; as an example. William Wotton responded to Temple with &quot;Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning&quot; (1694), showing that the &quot;Epistles&quot; were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by Charles Boyle (later the 4th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift&#x27;s first biographer). A further retort on the Modern side came from Richard Bentley, one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay &quot;Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris&quot; (1699). The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his &quot;Battle of the Books&quot; (1697, published 1704) in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients.
In 1708, a cobbler named John Partridge published a popular almanac of astrological predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in &quot;Predictions for the Ensuing Year&quot; by Isaac Bickerstaff, a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridge&#x27;s statements to the contrary. According to other sources, Richard Steele used the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff, and was the one who wrote about the &quot;death&quot; of John Partridge and published it in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, not Jonathan Swift.

The &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot; (1724) was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to mint copper coinage for Ireland. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these &quot;letters&quot; Swift posed as a shopkeeper—a draper—to criticise the plan. Swift&#x27;s writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret (on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England, Swift was greeted with a banner, &quot;Welcome Home, Drapier&quot;) no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher John Harding. Thanks to the general outcry against the coinage, Wood&#x27;s patent was rescinded in September 1725 and the coins were kept out of circulation. In &quot;Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift&quot; (1739) Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements.

&quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726. It is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings, the &quot;Travels&quot; was published under a pseudonym, the fictional Lemuel Gulliver, a ship&#x27;s surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benj. Motte and Gulliver&#x27;s also-fictional cousin negotiating the book&#x27;s publication has survived. Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in bowdlerised form as a children&#x27;s book, it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swift&#x27;s experience of his times. &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; is an anatomy of human nature, a sardonic looking-glass, often criticised for its apparent misanthropy. It asks its readers to refute it, to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society. Each of the four books—recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands—has a different theme, but all are attempts to deflate human pride. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought.

In 1729, Swift&#x27;s &quot;A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick&quot; was published in Dublin by Sarah Harding. It is a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Ireland&#x27;s poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: &quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food ...&quot; Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:
Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients ... taxing our absentees ... using [nothing] except what is of our own growth and manufacture ... rejecting ... foreign luxury ... introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance ... learning to love our country ... quitting our animosities and factions ... teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. ... Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.

==Legacy==
===Literary===
 John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him. George Orwell named him as one of the writers he most admired, despite disagreeing with him on almost every moral and political issue. Modernist poet Edith Sitwell wrote a fictional biography of Swift, titled &quot;I Live Under a Black Sun&quot; and published in 1937. A. L. Rowse wrote a biography of Swift, essays on his works, and edited the Pan Books edition of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

Literary scholar Frank Stier Goodwin wrote a full biography of Swift: &quot;Jonathan Swift – Giant in Chains&quot;, issued by Liveright Publishing Corporation, New York (1940, 450pp, with Bibliography).

In 1982, Soviet playwright Grigory Gorin wrote a theatrical fantasy called &quot;The House That Swift Built&quot; based on the last years of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s life and episodes of his works. The play was filmed by director Mark Zakharov in the 1984 two-part television movie of the same name. Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel &quot;The Fatal Tree&quot;. A 2017 analysis of library holdings data revealed that Swift is the most popular Irish author, and that &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; is the most widely held work of Irish literature in libraries globally.

The first woman to write a biography of Swift was Sophie Shilleto Smith, who published &quot;Dean Swift&quot; in 1910.

===Eponymous places===
Swift crater, a crater on Mars&#x27;s moon Deimos, is named after Jonathan Swift, who predicted the existence of the moons of Mars.

In honour of Swift&#x27;s long-term residence in Trim, there are several monuments in the town. Most notable is Swift&#x27;s Street, named after him. Trim also held a recurring festival in honour of Swift, called the Trim Swift Festival. In 2020, the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has not been held since.

<text>Eric Reed Boucher (born June 17, 1958), known professionally as Jello Biafra, is an American singer, spoken word artist and political activist. He is the former lead singer and songwriter for the San Francisco punk rock band Dead Kennedys.

Initially active from 1979 to 1986, Dead Kennedys were known for rapid-fire music topped with Biafra&#x27;s sardonic lyrics and biting social commentary, delivered in his &quot;unique quiver of a voice&quot;. When the band broke up in 1986, he took over the influential independent record label Alternative Tentacles, which he had founded in 1979 with Dead Kennedys bandmate East Bay Ray. In a 2000 lawsuit, upheld on appeal in 2003 by the California Supreme Court, Biafra was found liable for breach of contract, fraud, and malice in withholding a decade&#x27;s worth of royalties from his former bandmates and ordered to pay over $200,000 in compensation and punitive damages; the band subsequently reformed without Biafra. Although now focused primarily on spoken word performances, Biafra has continued as a musician in numerous collaborations. From 1979 to 1981, he contributed to the San Francisco punk zine &quot;Damage&quot;. He has also occasionally appeared in cameo roles in films.

Politically, Biafra is a member of the Green Party of the United States and supports various political causes. He ran for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in the 2000 presidential election, finishing a distant second to Ralph Nader. In 1979 he ran for mayor of San Francisco, California. He is a supporter of a free society and utilizes shock value and advocates direct action and pranksterism in the name of political causes. Biafra uses absurdist media tactics, in the leftist tradition of the Yippies, to highlight issues of civil rights and social justice.

==Early life==
Eric Reed Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Virginia Boucher (née Parker), a librarian, and Stanley Wayne Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet. His sister, Julie J. Boucher, was Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library; she died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996. 

As a child, Boucher developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. Boucher became a fan of rock music after his parents accidentally tuned in to a rock radio station. As a teenager, his high school guidance counselor advised him to spend his adolescence preparing to become a dental hygienist.

==Musical career==
===Colorado bands===
In 1977, he worked as a roadie for a local band called The Ravers (who later changed their name to The Nails), helping set up their equipment at shows, including as an opener for the Ramones. The job ended shortly after the Ramones show, when The Ravers were offered a record contract and left Colorado. Boucher credits seeing Joey Ramone as inspiration to become a singer, and the Ramones lyrics for inspiring the use of humor in his own songs.

Shortly after graduating high school, he formed a band called The Healers, with John Greenway and an unknown third member. Boucher has described The Healers&#x27; music as &quot;banging on instruments we didn&#x27;t know how to play when our parents weren&#x27;t home&quot;. While never playing a show, the band made recordings, including an early version of &quot;California Über Alles&quot;, but did not want any of it to be released to the public. Some of their music was made available on a 2009 compilation of late 1970s Colorado punk bands titled &quot;Rocky Mountain Low&quot;, including the original version of &quot;California Über Alles&quot;, which Maximum Rocknroll described as experimental improv in their review.

Boucher left Boulder to attend the University of California, Santa Cruz but dropped out after the first quarter of the school year.

===Dead Kennedys===

In June 1978, Boucher responded to an advertisement placed in a store by guitarist East Bay Ray, stating &quot;guitarist wants to form punk band&quot;, and together they formed the Dead Kennedys. He began performing with the band under the stage name Occupant, but soon began to use the stage name Jello Biafra, a combination of the brand name Jell-O and the short-lived African state of Biafra.

Biafra initially attempted to compose music on guitar, but his lack of experience on the instrument and his own admission of being &quot;a fumbler with my hands&quot; led Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Flouride to suggest that Biafra simply sing the parts he envisioned to the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;re/search&quot;&gt;V. Vale, &quot;Incredibly Strange Music, Vol. 2&quot;, RE/Search Publications, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra sang his riffs and melodies into a tape recorder, which he brought to the band&#x27;s rehearsal and/or recording sessions. By all accounts, including his own, Biafra is not a conventionally skilled musician, though he and his collaborators (Joey Shithead of D.O.A. in particular) attest that he is a skilled composer and his work, particularly with the Dead Kennedys, is highly respected by punk-oriented critics and fans.
The first single by Dead Kennedys was &quot;California Über Alles&quot;. The song, which spoofed California governor Jerry Brown, was the first of many political songs by the group and Biafra. Its popularity resulted in being covered by other musicians, such as The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who rewrote the lyrics to parody Pete Wilson), John Linnell of They Might Be Giants and Six Feet Under on their &quot;Graveyard Classics&quot; album of cover versions. Not long after, the Dead Kennedys had a second and bigger hit with &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; from their debut album &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; cites this song as &quot;possibly the most successful single of the American hardcore scene&quot; and Biafra counts it as his personal favorite Dead Kennedy&#x27;s song.

The Dead Kennedys received some controversy in the spring of 1981 over the single &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot;. The song became a hit in Britain, and the BBC feared that it would manage to be a big enough hit to appear among the top 30 songs on the national charts, requiring a mention on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. However, the single peaked at number 36 in the charts.

The EP &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; contained the song &quot;Nazi Punks Fuck Off!&quot; as well as &quot;We&#x27;ve Got A Bigger Problem Now&quot;, a rewritten version of &quot;California über alles&quot; about Ronald Reagan. Punk musician and scholar Vic Bondi considers the latter song to be the song that &quot;defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music, and represented its break with punk&quot;. The band&#x27;s most controversial album, &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, brought with it the song &quot;MTV Get Off the Air,&quot; which accused MTV of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public. The album also contained a controversial poster by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger entitled &quot;Penis Landscape&quot;.

The Dead Kennedys toured widely during their career, starting in the late 1970s. They began playing at San Francisco&#x27;s Mabuhay Gardens (their home base) and other Bay Area venues, later branching out to shows in southern Californian clubs (most notably the Whisky a Go Go), but eventually they moved to major clubs across the country, including CBGB in New York. Later, they played to larger audiences such as at the 1980 Bay Area Music Awards (where they played the notorious &quot;Pull My Strings&quot; for the only time), and headlined the 1983 Rock Against Reagan festival.

On May 7, 1994, punk rock fans who believed Biafra was a &quot;sell out&quot; attacked him at the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. Biafra claims that he was attacked by a man nicknamed Cretin, who crashed into him while moshing. The crash injured Biafra&#x27;s leg, causing an argument between the two men. During the argument, Cretin pushed Biafra to the floor and five or six friends of Cretin assaulted Biafra while he was down, yelling &quot;Sellout rock star, kick him&quot;, and attempting to pull out his hair. Biafra was later hospitalized with serious injuries. The attack derailed Biafra&#x27;s plans for both a Canadian spoken-word tour and an accompanying album, and the production of &quot;Pure Chewing Satisfaction&quot; was halted. However, Biafra returned to the Gilman club a few months after the incident to perform a spoken-word performance as an act of reconciliation with the club.

Biafra has been a prominent figure in the Californian punk scene and was one of the third-generation members of the San Francisco punk community. Many later hardcore bands have cited the Dead Kennedys as a major influence. Hardcore punk author Steven Blush describes Biafra as hardcore&#x27;s &quot;biggest star&quot; who was a &quot;powerful presence whose political insurgence and rabid fandom made him the father figure of a burgeoning subculture [and an] inspirational force [who] could also be a real prick ... Biafra was a visionary, incendiary [performer].&quot;

After the Dead Kennedys disbanded, Biafra&#x27;s new songs were recorded with other bands, and he released only spoken word albums as solo projects. These collaborations had less popularity than Biafra&#x27;s earlier work. However, his song &quot;That&#x27;s Progress&quot;, originally recorded with D.O.A. for the album &quot;Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors&quot;, received considerable exposure when it appeared on the album &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1&quot;.

====Obscenity prosecution====
In April 1986, police officers raided Biafra&#x27;s house in response to complaints by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In June 1986, L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under City Attorney James Hahn, brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing &quot;harmful material to minors&quot; in the Dead Kennedys album &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;. However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster &quot;Landscape XX&quot; (&quot;Penis Landscape&quot;) included with the album.

Music author Reebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a &quot;small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle.&quot; Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine, Biafra, Dirk Dirksen, and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to retry the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances.

Biafra has a cameo role in the 1988 film &quot;Tapeheads&quot;. He plays an FBI agent who arrests the two protagonists (played by Tim Robbins and John Cusack). While arresting them, his character asks &quot;Remember what we did to Jello Biafra?&quot; lampooning the obscenity prosecution.

On March 25, 2005, Biafra appeared on the U.S. radio program &quot;This American Life&quot;, &quot;Episode 285: Know Your Enemy&quot;, which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the &quot;Frankenchrist&quot; trial.

&quot;Porn Rock: The Obscenity Trial of Jello Biafra&quot;, a play written by Lawrence Meyers, was staged in Los Angeles in February 2025, depicting the obscenity prosecution and its implications.

====Lawsuit and reunion activities====
In October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some $75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band.

According to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band&#x27;s most well-known singles, &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot;, to be used in a commercial for Levi&#x27;s Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi&#x27;s because of his belief that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or &quot;posthumous&quot; live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band.

In May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles liable by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra&#x27;s lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeals unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works—which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra&#x27;s former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.

===Other bands===
In the early 1980s, Biafra collaborated with musicians Christian Lunch and Adrian Borland (of The Sound) and Morgan Fisher (of Mott the Hoople) for the electropunk musical project The Witch Trials, releasing one self-titled EP in its lifetime.

In 1988, Biafra, with Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker of the band Ministry, and Jeff Ward, formed Lard. The band became yet another side project for Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics. According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which is being recorded in Jourgensen&#x27;s El Paso studio. Jourgensen also claimed in 2021 that Biafra was in the works on a new Lard album. While working on the film &quot;Terminal City Ricochet&quot; in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film&#x27;s soundtrack with D.O.A.. As a result, Biafra worked with D.O.A. on the album &quot;Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors&quot;. Biafra also worked with Nomeansno on the soundtrack, which led to their collaboration on the album &quot;The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy&quot; the following year. Biafra also provided lyrics for the song &quot;Biotech is Godzilla&quot; for Sepultura&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot;.

In 1999, Biafra and other members of the anti-globalization movement protested the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Along with other prominent West Coast musicians, he formed the short-lived band No WTO Combo to help promote the movement&#x27;s cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed a short set the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside the designated area), along with the hip-hop group Spearhead. No WTO Combo later released a CD of recordings from the concert, entitled &quot;Live from the Battle in Seattle&quot;.

As of late 2005, Biafra was performing with the band The Melvins under the name &quot;Jello Biafra and the Melvins&quot;, though fans sometimes refer to them as &quot;The Jelvins&quot;. Together they have released two albums, and worked on material for a third collaborative release, much of which was premiered live at two concerts at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco during an event called Biafra Five-O, commemorating Biafra&#x27;s 50th birthday, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Dead Kennedys, and the beginning of legalized same-sex marriage in California. Biafra was also working with a band known as Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, which included Ralph Spight of Victims Family on guitar and Billy Gould of Faith No More on bass. This group debuted during Biafra Five-O.

In 2011, Biafra appeared in a singular concert event with an all-star cast of Southern musicians including members from Cowboy Mouth, Dash Rip Rock, Mojo Nixon, and Down entitled, &quot;Jello Biafra and the New Orleans Raunch &amp; Soul All Stars&quot; who performed an array of classic Soul covers to a packed house at the 12-Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. He would later reunite with many of the same musicians during the Carnival season 2014 to revisit many of these classics in Siberia, New Orleans. A live album from the 2011 performance, &quot;Walk on Jindal&#x27;s Splinters&quot;, and a companion single, &quot;Fannie May&quot;/&quot;Just a Little Bit&quot;, were released in 2015.

===Alternative Tentacles===
In June 1979, Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles, with which the Dead Kennedys released their first single, &quot;California über alles&quot;. The label was created to allow the band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from major labels to change their music, although the major labels were not willing to sign the band due to their songs being deemed too controversial. After dealing with Cherry Red in the UK and IRS Records in the US for their first album &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot;, the band released all later albums, and later pressings of &quot;Fresh Fruit&quot; on Alternative Tentacles. The exception was live albums released after the band&#x27;s break-up, which the other band members compiled from recordings in the band partnership&#x27;s vaults without Biafra&#x27;s input or endorsement.. Biafra has been the owner of the company since its founding, though he does not receive a salary for his position; Biafra has referred to his position in the company as &quot;absentee thoughtlord&quot;.

Biafra is an collector of unusual vinyl records of all kinds, from 1950s and 1960s ethno-pop recordings by the likes of Les Baxter and Esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to German crooner Heino (for whom he would later participate in the documentary &quot;Heino: Made In Germany&quot;); he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to RE/Search Publications for their second &quot;Incredibly Strange Music&quot; book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of Fuse TV&#x27;s program &quot;Crate Diggers&quot; on the same subject. His interest in such recordings, often categorized as outsider music, led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist Wesley Willis, whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis&#x27; major label deal with American Recordings. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in Emeryville, California.

In 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and The Frisk lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting &quot;The Alternative Tentacles Batcast&quot;, a downloadable podcast hosted by alternativetentacles.com. The show primarily focuses on interviews with artists and bands that are currently signed to the Alternative Tentacles label, although there are also occasional episodes where Biafra devoted the show to answering fan questions.

==Spoken word==
Biafra became a spoken word artist in January 1986 with a performance at University of California, Los Angeles. In his performance, he combined humor with his political beliefs, much in the same way that he did with the lyrics to his songs. Despite his continued spoken word performances, he did not begin recording spoken word albums until after the disbanding of the Dead Kennedys.

His ninth spoken word album, &quot;In the Grip of Official Treason&quot;, was released in October 2006.

Biafra was also featured in the British band Pitchshifter&#x27;s song &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; reciting the words of dystopian futuristic radio advertisements.

==Politics==

Biafra has resisted identifying with any particular ideology, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t label myself strictly an anarchist or a socialist or let alone a libertarian or something like that,&quot; In a 2012 interview, Biafra said &quot;I&#x27;m very pro-tax as long as it goes for the right things. I don&#x27;t mind paying more money as long as it&#x27;s going to provide shelter for people sleeping in the street or getting the schools fixed back up, getting the infrastructure up to the standards of other countries, including a high-speed rail system. I&#x27;m totally down with that.&quot; 

===Mayoral campaign===
In the autumn of 1979, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco, using the Jell-O ad campaign catchphrase, &quot;There&#x27;s always room for Jello&quot;, as his campaign slogan. Having entered the race before creating a campaign platform, Biafra later wrote his platform on a napkin while attending a Pere Ubu concert where Dead Kennedys drummer Ted told Biafra, &quot;Biafra, you have such a big mouth that you should run for Mayor.&quot; As he campaigned, Biafra wore campaign T-shirts from his opponent Quentin Kopp&#x27;s previous campaign and at one point vacuumed leaves off the front lawn of another opponent, Dianne Feinstein, to mock her publicity stunt of sweeping streets in downtown San Francisco for a few hours. He also made a whistlestop campaign tour along the BART line. Supporters committed equally odd actions; two well-known signs held by supporters said &quot;If he doesn&#x27;t win I&#x27;ll kill myself&quot; and &quot;What if he does win?&quot;

At the time, in San Francisco, any individual could legally run for mayor if a petition was signed by 1500 people or if $1500 was paid. Biafra paid $900 and got signatures over time and eventually became a legal candidate, meaning he received statements put in voters&#x27; pamphlets and equal news coverage.

His platform included unconventional points such as forcing businessmen to wear clown suits within city limits, erecting statues of Dan White, who assassinated Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978, around the city and allowing the parks department to sell eggs and tomatoes with which people could pelt the statues, hiring workers who had lost their jobs due to a tax initiative to panhandle in wealthy neighborhoods (including Feinstein&#x27;s), and a citywide ban on cars. Biafra has expressed irritation that these parts of his platform attained such notoriety, preferring instead to be remembered for serious proposals such as legalizing squatting in vacant, tax-delinquent buildings and requiring police officers to run for election by the people of the neighborhoods they patrol.

Biafra finished fourth out of a field of ten in the first round of voting, receiving 3.79 percent of the vote (6,591 votes); he failed to advance to the runoff and Dianne Feinstein won the second round of the voting. 

===Presidential campaign===

In 2000, the New York State Green Party drafted Biafra as a candidate for the Green Party presidential nomination, and a few supporters were elected to the party&#x27;s nominating convention in Denver, Colorado. Biafra chose death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal as his running mate. The party overwhelmingly chose Ralph Nader as the presidential candidate with 295 of the 319 delegate votes. Biafra received 10 votes.

Biafra, along with a camera crew (dubbed by Biafra as &quot;The Camcorder Truth Jihad&quot;), later reported for the Independent Media Center at the Republican and Democratic conventions.

===Post-2000===
After losing the 2000 nomination, Biafra became highly active in Nader&#x27;s presidential campaign, as well as in 2004 and 2008. During the 2008 campaign Jello played at rallies and answered questions for journalists in support of Nader. When gay rights activists accused Nader of costing Al Gore the 2000 election, Biafra reminded them that Tipper Gore&#x27;s Parents Music Resource Center wanted warning stickers on albums with content referencing homosexuality.

After Barack Obama won the general election, Biafra wrote an open letter making suggestions on how to run his term as president. Biafra criticized Obama during his term, stating that &quot;Obama even won the award for best advertising campaign of 2008.&quot; Biafra dubbed Obama &quot;Barackstar O&#x27;Bummer&quot;. Biafra refused to support Obama in 2012. Biafra has stated that he feels that Obama continued many of George W. Bush&#x27;s policies, summarizing Obama&#x27;s policies as containing &quot;worse and worse laws against human rights and more and more illegal unconstitutional spying.&quot;

On September 18, 2015, it was announced that Biafra would be supporting Bernie Sanders in his campaign for the 2016 presidential election. He has strongly criticized the political position of Donald Trump, saying &quot;how can people be so fucking stupid&quot; on hearing the election result. He also criticized Trump&#x27;s cabinet picks, saying of then-Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, &quot;The last person we want with their finger on the nuclear button is somebody connected to this extreme Christianist doomsday cult.&quot;

On February 28, 2020, Jello announced that he would be supporting both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election. &quot;I personally like Warren slightly better than Bernie because: 1) She’s done her homework. Bernie too, but not to quite the same depth or degree. 2) Think about it—who really has a better chance of actually beating Trump, and helping flip Congress and state legislatures? It’s Elizabeth Warren, hands down.&quot; He went on to say that he considered Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg &quot;almost as bad as Trump&quot;.

On April 12, 2020, Biafra expressed disappointment that Sanders had suspended his campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

=== Boycott of Israel ===
In mid-2011 Jello Biafra and his band were scheduled to play at the Barby Club in Tel Aviv. They came under pressure by the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, and finally decided to cancel the concert – after a debate which according to Biafra &quot;deeply tore at the fabric of our band ... This whole controversy has been one of the most intense situations of my life – and I thrive on intense situations&quot;.

Biafra then decided to travel to Israel and the Palestinian Occupied Territories, at his own expense, and talk with Israeli and Palestinian activists as well as with fans disappointed at his cancellation. In the article stating his conclusions he wrote:
&quot;I will not perform in Israel unless it is a pro-human rights, anti-occupation event, that does not violate the spirit of the boycott. Each musician, artist, etc. must decide this for themselves. I am staying away for now, but am also really creeped out by the attitudes of some of the hardliners and hope someday to find a way to contribute something positive here. I will not march or sign on with anyone who runs around calling people Zionazis and is more interested in making threats than making friends.&quot;

===Electoral history===






==Personal life==
Biafra married Theresa Soder, a.k.a. Ninotchka, lead singer of San Francisco-area punk band the Situations, on October 31, 1981. The wedding was conducted by Flipper vocalist/bassist Bruce Loose, who became a Universal Life Church minister specifically to conduct the ceremony, which took place in a graveyard. The wedding reception, which members of Flipper, Black Flag, and D.O.A. attended, was held at director Joe Rees&#x27; Target Video studios. The marriage ended in divorce.

Biafra identifies as agnostic. He has a Jewish great-grandparent, but was unaware of this until he was in his mid-40s. Due to his secular upbringing and lack of knowledge of his distant Jewish ancestry until adulthood, he does not consider himself Jewish.

He lives in San Francisco, California.

<doc id="15621" wikidata="Q1700285" url="?curid=15621" title="John Grierson">
<text>John Grierson (26 April 1898 – 19 February 1972) was a Scottish documentary maker, often considered the father of British and Canadian documentary film. In 1926, Grierson coined the term &quot;documentary&quot; in a review of Robert J. Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Moana&quot;. In 1939, Grierson established the all-time Canadian film institutional production and distribution company The National Film Board of Canada controlled by the Government of Canada.

== Early life ==
Grierson was born in the old schoolhouse in Deanston, near Doune, Scotland, to schoolmaster Robert Morrison Grierson from Boddam, near Peterhead, and Jane Anthony, a teacher from Ayrshire. His mother, a suffragette and ardent Labour Party activist, often took the chair at Tom Johnston&#x27;s election meetings.

The family moved to Cambusbarron, Stirling, in 1900, when the children were still young, after Grierson&#x27;s father was appointed headmaster of Cambusbarron school. When the family moved, John had three elder sisters, Agnes, Janet, and Margaret, and a younger brother, Anthony. John and Anthony were enrolled at Cambusbarron school in November 1903. His sister Margaret died in 1906; however, the family continued to grow as John gained three younger sisters, Dorothy, Ruby, and finally Marion in 1907.

Both parents steeped their son in liberal politics, humanistic ideals, and Calvinist moral and religious philosophies, particularly that education was essential to individual freedom and that hard and meaningful work was the way to prove oneself worthy in the sight of God. John was enrolled in the High School at Stirling in September 1908, and he played football and rugby for the school.

=== World War I ===
In July 1915, Grierson left school with an overall subject mark of 82%; John had sat the bursary examination at Gilmorehill the month before, as his parents wanted him to follow his elder sisters, Janet and Agnes, in going to the University of Glasgow. The results for the bursary examination were not posted until October 1915; Grierson applied to work at the munitions at Alexandria; the munitions building had been the original home of the Argyll Motor Company which had earlier in the twentieth century built the first complete motor car in Scotland.

Grierson was the second name on the bursary list and received the John Clark bursary, which was tenable for four years. Grierson entered the University of Glasgow in 1916; however, he was unhappy that his efforts to help in World War I were only through his work at the munitions. Grierson wanted to join the navy; his family on his father&#x27;s side had long been lighthouse keepers, and John had many memories of visiting lighthouses and being beside the sea. He went to the Crystal Palace in London to train with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In his recruitment letter he had added a year to his age so that he could attend.

On 7 January 1916, Grierson was sent to the wireless telegraphy station at Aultbea, Cromarty, as an ordinary telegraphist but was promoted to telegraphist on 2 June 1916. On 23 January 1917, he became a telegraphist on the minesweeper H.M.S &quot;Surf&quot; and served there until 13 October 1917. The next day he joined H.M.S &quot;Rightwhale&quot;, where he was promoted to leading telegraphist on 2 June 1918 and remained on the vessel until he was demobilised with a British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

=== University of Glasgow ===
Grierson returned to university in 1919; he joined the Fabian Society in 1919 and dissolved it in 1921. The New University Labour Club was initiated by John as well as the Critic&#x27;s Club; he also had poetry published in the Glasgow University magazine from November 1920 until February 1923. Grierson received the Buchan Prize in the Ordinary Class of English Language in the academic year of 1919–20, he also received the prize and first-class certificate in the academic year of 1920–21 in the Ordinary Class of Moral Philosophy and graduated with a Master of Arts in English and moral philosophy in 1923.

In 1923, Grierson received a Rockefeller Research Fellowship to study in the United States at the University of Chicago, and later at Columbia and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His research focus was the psychology of propaganda—the impact of the press, film, and other mass media on forming public opinion. Grierson was particularly interested in the popular appeal and influence of the &quot;yellow&quot; (tabloid) press, and the influence and role of these journals on the education of new American citizens from abroad.

== Social critic ==
In his review of Robert Flaherty&#x27;s film &quot;Moana&quot; (1926) in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; (8 February 1926), Grierson wrote that it had &#x27;documentary&#x27; value.
In his essay &quot;First Principles of Documentary&quot; (1932), Grierson argued that the principles of documentary were that cinema&#x27;s potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the &quot;original&quot; actor and &quot;original&quot; scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials &quot;thus taken from the raw&quot; can be more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson&#x27;s views align with the Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov&#x27;s contempt for dramatic fiction as &quot;bourgeois excess&quot;, though with considerably more subtlety. Grierson&#x27;s definition of documentary as &quot;creative treatment of actuality&quot; has gained some acceptance, though it presents philosophical questions about documentaries containing stagings and reenactments.

Like many social critics of the time, Grierson was profoundly concerned about what he perceived to be clear threats to democracy. In the US, he encountered a marked tendency toward political reaction, anti-democratic sentiments, and political apathy. He read and agreed with the journalist and political philosopher Walter Lippmann&#x27;s book &quot;Public Opinion&quot; which blamed the erosion of democracy in part on the fact that the political and social complexities of contemporary society made it difficult if not impossible for the public to comprehend and respond to issues vital to the maintenance of democratic society.

In Grierson&#x27;s view, a way to counter these problems was to involve citizens in their government with the kind of engaging excitement generated by the popular press, which simplified and dramatized public affairs. It was during this time that Grierson developed a conviction that motion pictures could play a central role in promoting this process. (It has been suggested that some of Grierson&#x27;s notions regarding the social and political uses of film were influenced by reading Lenin&#x27;s writing about film as education and propaganda.)

Grierson&#x27;s emerging view of film was as a form of social and political communication—a mechanism for social reform, education, and perhaps spiritual uplift. His view of Hollywood movie-making was considerably less sanguine:

:&quot;In an age when the faiths, the loyalties, and the purposes have been more than usually undermined, mental fatigue--or is it spiritual fatigue?--represents a large factor in everyday experience. Our cinema magnate does no more than exploit the occasion. He also, more or less frankly, is a dope pedlar.&quot;

== Film critic ==
Grierson&#x27;s emerging and outspoken film philosophies caught the attention of New York film critics at the time. He was asked to write criticism for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. At the &quot;Sun&quot;, Grierson wrote articles on film aesthetics and audience reception, and developed broad contacts in the film world. According to popular myth, in the course of this writing stint, Grierson coined the term &quot;documentary&quot; in writing about Robert J. Flaherty&#x27;s film &quot;Moana&quot; (1926): &quot;Of course &quot;Moana&quot;, being a visual account of events in the daily life of a Polynesian youth and his family, has documentary value.&quot;

During this time, Grierson was also involved in scrutinizing the film industries of other countries. He may have been involved in arranging to bring Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s groundbreaking film &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot; (1925) to US audiences for the first time. Eisenstein&#x27;s editing techniques and film theories, particularly the use of montage, would have a significant influence on Grierson&#x27;s own work.

== Filmmaker ==
Grierson returned to Great Britain in 1927 armed with the sense that film could be enlisted to build national morale and consensus, and to deal with social problems, a theory he would enact especially during the Great Depression. Filmmaking for Grierson was an exalted, patriotic calling. Grierson&#x27;s thinking was elitist in some ways, which he exposed with his many dicta of the time, such as &quot;The elect have their duty&quot; and &quot;I look on cinema as a pulpit, and use it as a propagandist.&quot;

Grierson was also a cultural relativist. In the US, he had met pioneering documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty and respected Flaherty immensely for his contributions to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and events. Less commendable in Grierson&#x27;s view was Flaherty&#x27;s invalidating focus on exotic and faraway cultures. (&quot;In the profounder kind of way&quot;, wrote Grierson of Flaherty, &quot;we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other&quot;). In Grierson&#x27;s view, the focus of film should be on the everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: &quot;Beware the ends of the earth and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty.&quot; &quot;&#x27;You keep your savages in the far place Bob; we are going after the savages of Birmingham,&#x27; I think I said to him pretty early on. And we did.&quot;)

=== Empire Marketing Board ===
On his return to England, Grierson was employed on a temporary basis as an Assistant Films Officer of the Empire Marketing Board (EMB), a governmental agency which had been established in 1926 to promote British world trade and British unity throughout the empire. One of the major functions of the EMB was publicity, which the Board accomplished through exhibits, posters, and publications and films. It was within the context of this State-funded organisation that the &quot;documentary&quot; as we know it today got its start.

In late 1929 Grierson and his cameraman, Basil Emmott completed his first film, &quot;Drifters&quot;, which he wrote, produced and directed. The film, which follows the heroic work of North Sea herring fishermen, was a radical departure from anything being made by the British film industry or Hollywood. A large part of its innovation lies in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat in the middle of a gale while leaving relatively less of the action staged. The choice of topic was chosen less from Grierson&#x27;s curiosity than the fact that he discovered that the Financial Secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse. It premiered in a private film club in London in November 1929 on a double-bill with Eisenstein&#x27;s -then controversial- film &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot; (which was banned from general release in Britain until 1954) and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press. The film was shown from 9 December 1929, in the Stoll in Kingsway and then was later screened throughout Britain.

After this success, Grierson moved away from film direction into a greater focus on production and administration within the EMB. He became a tireless organizer and recruiter for the EMB, enlisting a stable of energetic young filmmakers into the film unit between 1930 and 1933. Those enlisted included filmmakers Basil Wright, Edgar Anstey, Stuart Legg, Paul Rotha, Arthur Elton, Humphrey Jennings, Harry Watt, and Alberto Cavalcanti. This group formed the core of what was to become known as the British Documentary Film Movement. Robert Flaherty himself also worked briefly for the unit. In 1933 the EMB Film Unit was disbanded, a casualty of Depression-era economics.

=== General Post Office ===
Grierson&#x27;s boss at the EMB moved to the General Post Office (GPO) as its first public relations officer, with the stipulation that he could bring the EMB film unit with him. Grierson&#x27;s crew were charged with demonstrating how the Post Office facilitated modern communication and brought the nation together, a task aimed as much at GPO workers as the general public. During Grierson&#x27;s administration, the GPO Film Unit produced a series of groundbreaking films, including &quot;Night Mail&quot; (dir. Basil Wright and Harry Watt, 1936) and &quot;Coal Face&quot; (dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1935). In 1934 he produced at the GPO Film Unit the award-winning &quot;The Song of Ceylon&quot; (dir. Basil Wright) which was sponsored jointly by the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Bureau and the EMB.

In 1934, Grierson sailed on the &quot;Isabella Greig&quot; out of Granton to film &quot;Granton Trawler&quot; on Viking Bank which is between Shetland and the Norwegian coast. The footage from his voyage was handed over to Edgar Anstey, who pulled footage of when the camera had fallen over on the deck of the boat to create a storm scene. &quot;Granton Trawler&quot; was a favourite film of Grierson&#x27;s, he saw it as a homage to the &quot;Isabella Greig&quot; that was sunk in 1941 by German bombs when it went out to fish and was never seen again. &quot;The Private Life of Gannets&quot; was also filmed on the &quot;Isabella Greig;&quot; the film was shot on Grassholm with Grierson shooting the slow-motion sequence of the gannets diving for fish which took only one afternoon to shoot near Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The Private Life of Gannets went on to pick up an Academy Award in 1937.

Grierson eventually grew restless with having to work within the bureaucratic and budgetary confines of government sponsorship. Grierson resigned from the G.P.O. on 30 June 1937, which gave him more time to pursue his passions and the freedom to speak his mind on issues around the world. In response, he sought out private industry sponsorship for film production. He was finally successful in getting the British gas industry to underwrite an annual film program. Perhaps the most significant works produced during this time were &quot;Housing Problems&quot; (dir. Arthur Elton, Edgar Anstey, John Taylor, and Grierson&#x27;s sister Ruby Grierson, 1935).
=== Canada ===
In 1938, Grierson was invited by the Canadian government to study the country&#x27;s film production. Grierson sailed at the end of May in 1938 for Canada and arrived on 17 June. Grierson met with the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King and also spoke with many important figures across Canada, they were all in agreement of the importance of film in reducing sectionalism and in promoting the relationship of Canada between home and abroad. The head of the Motion Picture Bureau for Canada, Frank Badgley, did not appreciate Grierson&#x27;s assessment and criticism of the films made by the Bureau which was that they focused too much on Canada as a place to holiday. Grierson delivered his report on government film propaganda and the weaknesses he had found in Canadian film production; his suggestion was to create a national coordinating body for the production of films. An abridged version of the report ran to 66 pages, which was prepared by August in London. Grierson returned to Britain but was invited back to Canada on 14 October 1938; he returned in November.

==== National Film Board of Canada and Wartime Information Board ====
In 1939, Canada created the National Film Commission, which would later become the National Film Board of Canada. The bill to create a National Film Board was drafted by Grierson; the bill was introduced in March 1939 and given Royal Assent on 2 May 1939. Grierson was appointed the first Commissioner of the National Film Board in October 1939. When Canada entered World War II in 1939, the NFB focused on the production of propaganda films, many of which Grierson directed. For example, captured footage of German war activity was incorporated in documentaries that were distributed to the then-neutral United States.

Grierson grieved the death of his sister Ruby in 1940; she was on the &quot;SS City of Benares&quot; while it was evacuating one hundred children to Canada. The &quot;Benares&quot; was torpedoed four days after its sailing, and sank within thirty-one minutes in a Force 10 Gale. Ruby Grierson had managed to enter Lifeboat 8, full with more than thirty people, including eighteen girls and two female escorts, but as it was lowering, a wave crashed into the lifeboat, sending it into a vertical position, and throwing everyone in that boat into the sea. No one from Boat 8 survived. In the end, of 406 people on board, only 148 people survived, including only 19 of 100 children. Grierson resigned from his position in January 1941. Over his year as Commissioner at the National Film Board 40 films were made; the year before the Motion Picture Bureau had made only one and a half. Recommendations for the future running were made for the National Film Board, and Grierson was persuaded to stay for a further six months to oversee the changes.

During WWII, Grierson was a consultant to prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King as a minister of the Wartime Information Board. He remained on the National Film Board and managed to complete his duties to Wartime Information Board as well through his deputies that aided him in the task. Grierson was asked to keep his dual role until January 1944, however, he resigned in 1943 as the job he had been asked to complete had been finished as far as he was concerned. Before he finished with the Wartime Information Bureau Grierson was also offered the role of chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation but turned it down as he believed that this would give him too much power.

On 26 February 1942, Grierson attended the Academy Awards and received the award on behalf of the National Film Board for &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Island&quot;. Grierson also presented the award for the best documentary, the first time that this award was given by the Academy. After the Dieppe Raid, there were reports that Canadians that had been taken as prisoners of war had been manacled under Hitler&#x27;s orders. Grierson proposed that the Film Board show how the German prisoners of war were being treated in Canada through a film. Ham Wright directed the film showing the German sailors that had been captured; playing football, enjoying meals and looking healthy. Only one copy of the film was made, it was sent to the Swiss Red Cross who deliberately let it fall into German hands. Grierson was to learn at a later date that Hitler had indeed watched the film and ordered that the Canadian prisoners of war released from their manacles.

After the war, the National Film Board focused on producing documentaries that reflected the lives of Canadians. The National Film Board has become recognized around the world for producing quality films, some of which have won Academy Awards. The National Film Board had become one of the largest film studios and was respected around the world for what it had achieved; it had especially had influence in Czechoslovakia and China.

In December 1943 Grierson was elected by the Permanent Film Committee of the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship to become honorary chairman. One of the tasks at the National Film Board that Grierson strongly pushed for the films being produced to be in French as well as English. He also pushed for a French unit in the National Film Board.

Grierson concentrated on documentary film production in New York after resigning his post following in August 1945; his resignation was to take effect in November 1945. In 1946 Grierson was asked to testify as part of the investigation of the Gouzenko Affair regarding communist spies in the National Film Board and the Wartime Information Board, rumours spread that he had been a leader of a spy ring during his offices with the Canadian government, a rumour he denied. Due to the rumours, the projects that Grierson had been trying to put together were not commissioned and he was barred from taking an important position at the United Nations.

=== Commission on Freedom of the Press ===
Grierson was appointed as a foreign adviser to the Commission on Freedom of the Press in December 1943, which had been set up by the University of Chicago. Grierson was able to make a large contribution to the committee which included Robert M. Hutchins, William E. Hocking, Harold D. Lasswell, Archibald McLeish and Charles Merriam. &quot;A Free and Responsible Press&quot; was published in 1947.

=== UNESCO ===
Grierson was offered the position of head of information at UNESCO at the end of 1946; he attended the first General Conference of UNESCO from 26 November until 10 December in Paris. He had the idea for the &quot;Unesco Courier&quot; which was published in several languages across the world, first as a tabloid and later as a magazine. Grierson was invited to open the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 1947, from 31 August to 7 September. At the start of 1948 he resigned from his position as director for Mass Communications and Public Information, he left in April to return to Britain.

=== Central Office of Information ===
In February 1948, Grierson was appointed the controller of the Central Office of Information&#x27;s film operations to co-ordinate the work of the Crown Film Unit and Films Division, and to take overall charge of the planning, production and distribution of government films. On 23 June 1948, he accepted an honorary degree, an LL.D from the University of Glasgow. He left in 1950 due to financial restrictions on the documentaries that he wished to make.

=== Group 3 ===
Grierson was appointed to the position of executive producer of Group 3 at the end of 1950; it was a film production enterprise that received loans of government money through the National Film Finance Corporation. They filmed at Southall Studios in West London but later moved to Beaconsfield Studios. Group 3 was to have continuous production from 1951 until 1955 when it stopped producing films, the organisation had made a loss of over £400,000 as production of the films usually ran over the time allocated, and there had also been difficulty getting the films shown in cinemas.

During this time Grierson had been diagnosed with tuberculosis in May 1953, he spent a fortnight in hospital and then had a year of convalescing at his home, Tog Hill in Calstone. Grierson spent much of his time corresponding with the directors at Group 3, as well as commenting on scripts and story ideas. He had recovered enough to attend the Cannes Film Festival in April 1954, taking the production of &quot;Man of Africa&quot;. At the Edinburgh Film Festival in the same year, a dinner was held in Grierson&#x27;s honour to celebrate twenty-five years of documentary.

=== Films of Scotland Committee ===
Grierson joined the newly revived Films of Scotland Committee in 1955. Also on the committee were Norman Wilson, Forsyth Hardy, George Singleton, C. A. Oakley and Neil Paterson. In 1956, Grierson was the president of the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s jury; he was also jury president at the Cork Film Festival and the South American Film Festival in 1958. In 1957, Grierson received a special Canadian Film Award. Grierson wrote the script for, &quot;Seawards the Great Ships,&quot; which was directed by Hilary Harris and awarded an Academy Award in 1961, a feat for the Films of Scotland Committee.

=== This Wonderful World ===
The first programme of This Wonderful World was aired on 11 October 1957 in Scotland; it was on &quot;The Culbin Sands&quot; which focused on how the Forestry Commission had replanted six thousand acres of woodland along the mouth of Findhorn. In the seventeenth century wild sand had blown into the mouth and covered the land, the successful replanting of the forest was a great success for the commission. This Wonderful World was shown weekly, other topics for episodes included Leonardo da Vinci, ballet, king penguins and Norman McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Doodle&quot;.

This Wonderful World began to be aired in England in February 1959, it ran for a further eight years and was in the Top Ten programmes for the week for the UK in 1960. In 1961, Grierson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In 1962, he was a member of the jury for the Vancouver Film Festival, during his visit to Canada he also received the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Medal for his contribution to the visual arts. In 1963, he was busy with This Wonderful World and the Films of Scotland Committee but still found time to attend the twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Film Board in Montreal.

In 1965, Grierson was the patron of the Commonwealth Film Festival which took place in Cardiff in that year. In 1966, he was offered the role of Governor of the British Film Institute; however, he turned down the position. This Wonderful World changed the title to John Grierson Presents.

In 1967, after returning from the Oberhausen Film Festival where he had been the President of Honour of the jury, Grierson suffered a bout of bronchitis which lasted eight days. His brother Anthony, who had trained to be a doctor was called and diagnosed Grierson with emphysema, his coughing fits were a cause for concern, and he was admitted to Manor Hospital. Grierson decided to give up smoking and drinking to benefit his health.

===Later life===
Grierson opened the new primary school at Cambusbarron on 10 October 1967; his sister Dorothy attended the day with him. The BBC expressed their wishes to make a programme about Grierson in the year of his seventieth birthday, which he turned down three times In the year of his seventieth birthday, Grierson received many tributes from across the globe. He was made an honorary member of the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians; he pressed for the ceremony to be held in Glasgow. He also received the Golden Thistle Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Art of Cinema at the Edinburgh Film Festival.

In January 1969, Grierson left for Canada to lecture at McGill University; enrollment for his classes grew to around seven hundred students. He also lectured at Carleton University once a fortnight. At Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh on 8 July 1969, Grierson received an Honorary Doctorate of Literature. A few days earlier on 4 July 1969, Grierson had opened the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther.

Grierson was a member of the jury for the Canadian Film Awards in 1970. He spent a few months in 1971, travelling around India instilling the importance of having small production units throughout the country. He returned to the UK in December 1971 and was meant to travel back to India; however, his trip was delayed by the Indo-Pakistani War. Grierson went into hospital for a health check-up in January 1972; he was diagnosed with lung and liver cancer and was given months to live. During his time in hospital he spent time dictating letters to his wife, Margaret, and received visitors; however, he fell unconscious on 18 February and died on the 19th. In his wishes for his funeral he had detailed his desire to be cremated. Also according to his wishes, his urn was placed in the sea off the Old Head in Kinsale, and his brother Anthony, who had died in August 1971, had his ashes placed at the same time. A small flotilla followed the &quot;Able Seaman&quot;, which carried the ashes, and when the urns were lowered into the water, the fishing boats sounded their sirens.

The Grierson Archive at the University of Stirling Archives was opened by Angus Macdonald in October 1977.

<doc id="15622" wikidata="Q42574" url="?curid=15622" title="James Cameron">
<text>James Francis Cameron (born August 16, 1954) is a Canadian filmmaker. He is a major figure in the post-New Hollywood era and often uses novel technologies with a classical filmmaking style. Cameron first gained recognition for writing and directing &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), and found further success with &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), and &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), as well as &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) and its sequels. He directed, wrote, co-produced, and co-edited &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing. He is a recipient of various other industry accolades, and three of his films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

Cameron co-founded the production companies Lightstorm Entertainment, Digital Domain, and Earthship Productions. In addition to filmmaking, he is a National Geographic explorer-in-residence and has produced many documentaries on deep-ocean exploration, including &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot; (2003) and &quot;Aliens of the Deep&quot; (2005). Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies and helped create the digital 3D Fusion Camera System. In 2012, Cameron became the first person to do a solo descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth&#x27;s ocean, in the &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot; submersible.

Cameron&#x27;s films have grossed over $8 billion worldwide, making him the second-highest-grossing film director of all time. Three of Cameron&#x27;s films are amongst the top four highest-grossing films of all time; &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009), &quot;&quot; (2022) and &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) are the highest, third-highest and fourth-highest-grossing films of all time, respectively. Cameron directed the first film to gross over $1 billion, the first two films to gross over $2 billion, and is the only director to have had three films gross over $2 billion. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Cameron is also an environmentalist and runs several sustainability businesses.

== Early life ==
James Francis Cameron was born on August 16, 1954, in Kapuskasing, Ontario, to Philip Cameron, an electrical engineer, and Shirley (), an artist and nurse. He is the first of five children, with two brothers and two sisters. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron spent summers on his grandfather&#x27;s farm in southern Ontario. He attended Stamford Collegiate in Niagara Falls. At age 17, Cameron and his family moved from Chippawa to Brea, California. He attended Sonora High School and then moved to Brea Olinda High School. Classmates recalled that he was not a sportsman but instead enjoyed building things that &quot;either went up into the air or into the deep&quot;.

After high school, Cameron enrolled at Fullerton College, a community college in 1973 to study physics. He switched subjects to English, but left the college at the end of 1974. Cameron worked odd jobs, including as a truck driver and a high school janitor. He drank beer, frequently consumed cannabis and LSD, and wrote in his free time. During this period, he learned about special effects by reading other students&#x27; work on &quot;optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology&quot; at the USC library. After the excitement of seeing &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1977, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry.

==Film career==
=== Early work and 1980s ===

Cameron&#x27;s directing career began in 1978. After borrowing money from a consortium of dentists, he learned to direct, write and produce his first short film, &quot;Xenogenesis&quot; (1978) with a friend. Learning as he went, Cameron said he felt like a doctor doing his first surgical procedure. He then served as a production assistant for &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; (1979). While educating himself about filmmaking techniques, Cameron started a job as a miniature model maker at Roger Corman Studios. He was soon employed as an art director for the science-fiction film &quot;Battle Beyond the Stars&quot; (1980). He carried out the special effects for John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), served as production designer for &quot;Galaxy of Terror&quot; (1981), and consulted on the design for &quot;Android&quot; (1982).

Cameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to &quot;Piranha&quot; (1978), titled &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot; in 1982. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer Ovidio Assonitis. Shot in Rome, Italy, and on Grand Cayman Island, the film gave Cameron the opportunity to become director for a major film for the first time. Cameron later said that it did not feel like his first film due to power-struggles with Assonitis. Upon release of &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot;, critics were not impressed; author Tim Healey called it &quot;a marvellously bad movie which splices clichés from every conceivable source&quot;.

In 1982, inspired by John Carpenter&#x27;s horror film &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978), as well as a nightmare about an invincible robot hit-man sent from the future to assassinate him, Cameron wrote the script for &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), a sci-fi action film about a cyborg sent from the future to carry out a lethal mission. Cameron wanted to sell the script so that he could direct the film. Whilst some film studios expressed interest in the project, many executives were unwilling to let a new and unfamiliar director make the film. Gale Anne Hurd, a colleague and founder of Pacific Western Productions, agreed to buy Cameron&#x27;s script for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. He convinced the president of Hemdale Pictures to make the film, with Cameron as director and Hurd as a producer. Lance Henriksen, who starred in &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot;, was considered for the lead role, but Cameron decided that Arnold Schwarzenegger was more suitable as the cyborg villain due to his bodybuilder appearance. Henriksen was given a smaller role instead. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also joined the cast. &quot;The Terminator&quot; was a box office success, exceeding expectations set by Orion Pictures, and earning over $78 million worldwide. George Perry of the BBC praised Cameron&#x27;s direction, writing &quot;Cameron laces the action with ironic jokes, but never lets up on hinting that the terror may strike at any moment&quot;. In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 1984, Cameron was hired to write a sequel to &quot;First Blood&quot;; it was rewritten by Sylvester Stallone and released as &quot;&quot;. Cameron was then hired to write and direct a sequel to &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), a science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott. Like the original, the sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) featured Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. &quot;Aliens&quot; follows Ripley as she helps a group of marines fight off extraterrestrials. Despite conflicts with cast and crew during production, and having to replace one of the lead actors — James Remar with Michael Biehn — &quot;Aliens&quot; was a box office success, generating over $130 million worldwide. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1987; Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Sound. It won awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, Weaver and the film made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in July 1986.

After &quot;Aliens&quot;, Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd decided to make &quot;The Abyss&quot;, a story about oil-rig workers who discover strange intelligent life in the ocean. Based on an idea which Cameron had conceived of during high school, the film was initially budgeted at $41 million, although it ran considerably over this amount. It starred Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The production process began in the Cayman Islands and in South Carolina, in two huge water tanks &quot;reclaimed from&quot; an unfinished nuclear power plant. The cast and crew recall Cameron&#x27;s dictatorial behavior, and the filming of water scenes which were mentally and physically exhausting. Upon the film&#x27;s release, &quot;The Abyss&quot; was praised for its special effects, and earned $90 million at the worldwide box office. &quot;The Abyss&quot; received four Academy Award nominations, and won Best Visual Effects.

===1990s===

In 1990, Cameron co-founded the firm Lightstorm Entertainment with partner Lawrence Kasanoff. In 1991, Cameron served as executive producer for &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), directed by Kathryn Bigelow. After the success of &quot;The Terminator&quot;, there were discussions for a sequel, and by the late 1980s, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to begin production of the film, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991). Written by Cameron and William Wisher Jr., Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles. The story follows on from &quot;Terminator&quot;, depicting a new villain (T-1000), with shape-shifting abilities who hunts for Sarah Connor&#x27;s son, John (Edward Furlong). Cameron cast Robert Patrick as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance — a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained: &quot;I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche&quot;. &quot;Terminator 2&quot; was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $ ($ in ). Despite the challenging use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991. &quot;Terminator 2&quot; broke box office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $ in North America and being the first to earn over $ worldwide (respectively over $ and $ in ). It won four Academy Awards: Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. It also received nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, but lost both to political thriller &quot;JFK&quot; (1991).

In subsequent years, Cameron planned to do a third &quot;Terminator&quot; film, but plans never materialized. The rights to the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise were eventually purchased by Kassar from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco&#x27;s assets. Cameron moved on to other projects and, in 1993, co-founded Digital Domain, a visual effects production company. In 1994, Cameron and Schwarzenegger reunited for their third collaboration, &quot;True Lies,&quot; a remake of the 1991 French comedy &quot;La Totale!&quot; The story depicts an American secret agent who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. The film co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Eliza Dushku and Tom Arnold. Cameron&#x27;s Lightstorm Entertainment signed a deal with 20th Century Fox for the production of &quot;True Lies&quot;. Budgeted at a minimum of $100 million, the film earned $146 million in the United States and Canada. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and Curtis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. It was during the production of &quot;True Lies&quot; that he would first meet Jon Landau, who at the time oversaw the film&#x27;s production for Fox. In July 2024, Cameron stated that he &quot;lured&quot; Landau away from Fox to Lightstorm.
In 1995, Cameron co-produced &quot;Strange Days&quot;, a science fiction thriller. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by Jay Cocks, &quot;Strange Days&quot; was critically and financially unsuccessful. In 1996, Cameron reunited with the cast of &quot;Terminator 2&quot; to film &quot;T2 3-D: Battle Across Time&quot;, an attraction at Universal Studios Florida, and in other parks around the world.

His next major project was &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), an epic about , which sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. With a production budget of $200 million, at the time it was the most expensive film ever made. Starting in 1995, Cameron took several dives to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to capture footage of the wreck, which would later be used in the film. A replica of the ship was built in Rosarito Beach and principal photography began in September 1996. &quot;Titanic&quot; made headlines before its release, for being over-budget and exceeding its schedule. Cameron&#x27;s completed screenplay depicts two star-crossed lovers, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, from different social classes who fall in love amid the backdrop of the tragedy; a radical departure from his previous work. The supporting cast includes Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton. The film was also Cameron&#x27;s first large scale production with Landau as a co-producer.

After months of delay, &quot;Titanic&quot; premiered on December 19, 1997. The film received strong critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of all time, holding this position for twelve years, until Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; beat the record in 2010. The costumes and sets were praised, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considered the CGI graphics to be spectacular. &quot;Titanic&quot; received a record-tying fourteen nominations (tied with &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950) at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won eleven of the awards, tying the record for most wins with 1959&#x27;s &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Score and Best Original Song. Upon receiving Best Picture, Cameron and producer Jon Landau asked for a moment of silence to remember the 1,500 people who died when the ship sank. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Cameron&#x27;s storytelling, writing: &quot;It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding&quot;. Authors Kevin Sandler and Gaylyn Studlar wrote in 1999 that the romance, historical nostalgia and James Horner&#x27;s music contributed to the film&#x27;s cultural phenomenon. In 2017, on its 20th anniversary, &quot;Titanic&quot; became Cameron&#x27;s second film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

After the huge success of &quot;Titanic&quot;, Cameron kept a low profile. In 1998, he and his brother, John, formed Earthship Productions, to stream documentaries about the deep sea, one of Cameron&#x27;s interests. Again during 1998, Cameron considered doing a large-scale technological/religious film by an unknown writer, but after three tries was forced to personally pass on the project &quot;due to his secular nature.&quot; Cameron had also planned to make a film about Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron&#x27;s ideas into a screenplay, but due to various disagreements, Cameron abandoned the project. In 2002, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was released with the screenplay credited solely to Koepp.

===2000s===
In 2000, Cameron made his debut in television and co-created &quot;Dark Angel&quot; with Charles H. Eglee, a television series influenced by cyberpunk, biopunk, contemporary superheroes and third-wave feminism. &quot;Dark Angel&quot; starred Jessica Alba as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced super-soldier created by a secretive organization. While the first season was moderately successful, the second season did less well, which led to its cancellation.

In 2002, Cameron served as producer on the 2002 film &quot;Solaris&quot;, a science fiction drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film gained mixed reviews and failed at the box office. Keen to make documentaries, Cameron directed &quot;&quot;, about the German Battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;. In 2003, he directed &quot;Ghosts of the Abyss&quot;, a documentary about RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; which was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, and designed for 3D theaters. Cameron told &quot;The Guardian&quot; his intention for filming everything in 3D. In 2005, Cameron co-directed &quot;Aliens of the Deep&quot;, a documentary about the various forms of life in the ocean. He also starred in &quot;Titanic Adventure&quot; with Tony Robinson&quot;,&quot; another documentary about the &quot;Titanic&quot; shipwreck. In 2006, Cameron co-created and narrated &quot;The Exodus Decoded&quot;, a documentary exploring the Biblical account of the Exodus. In 2007, Cameron and fellow director Simcha Jacobovici, produced &quot;The Lost Tomb of Jesus&quot;. It was broadcast on Discovery Channel on March 4, 2007; the documentary was controversial for arguing that the Talpiot Tomb was the burial place of Jesus of Nazareth.

By the mid-2000s, Cameron returned to directing and producing another mainstream film since &quot;Titanic&quot;. Cameron had displayed interest in making &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009) and &quot;&quot; (2019) as early as June 2005, with both films to be shot using 3D technology. He wanted to make &quot;Alita: Battle Angel&quot; first, followed by &quot;Avatar&quot;, but switched the order in February 2006. Although Cameron had written an 80-page treatment for &quot;Avatar&quot; in 1995, Cameron stated that he wanted the necessary technology to improve before starting production. &quot;Avatar&quot;, with the story line set in the mid-22nd century, had an estimated budget in excess of $300 million. The cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. It was composed with a mix of live-action footage and computer-generated animation, using an advanced version of the performance capture technique, previously used by director Robert Zemeckis in &quot;The Polar Express&quot;. Cameron intended &quot;Avatar&quot; to be 3D-only but decided to adapt it for conventional viewing as well.

Intended for release in May 2009, &quot;Avatar&quot; premiered on December 18, 2009. This delay allowed more time for post-production and the opportunity for theaters to install 3D projectors. &quot;Avatar&quot; broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed $749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than $2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing &quot;Titanic&quot;. It was the first film to earn more than $2 billion worldwide. &quot;Avatar&quot; was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three: Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. In July 2010, an extended theatrical re-release generated an additional $33.2 million worldwide () at the box office. In his mixed review, Sukhdev Sandhu of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; complimented the 3D, but opined that Cameron &quot;should have been more brutal in his editing&quot;. That year, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported that Cameron&#x27;s earnings were US$257 million, making him the highest earner in Hollywood. As of 2022, &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; hold the achievement for being the first two of the six films in history to gross over $2 billion worldwide. As with &quot;Titanic&quot;, Landau would greatly assist Cameron as the co-producer of the &quot;Avatar&quot; films as well.

=== 2010s and 2020s ===

In 2011, Cameron served as an executive producer for &quot;Sanctum&quot;, a disaster-survival film about a cave diving expedition which turns deadly. Although receiving mixed reviews, the film earned a fair $108 million at the worldwide box office. Cameron re-investigated the sinking of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; with eight experts in a 2012 TV documentary special, &quot;Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron&quot;, which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic channel. In the feature, the experts revised the CGI animation of the sinking conceived in 1995. In March 2010, Cameron announced that &quot;Titanic&quot; will be converted and re-released in 3D to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the tragedy. On March 27, 2012, &quot;Titanic&quot; 3D premiered at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. He also served as executive producer of &quot;Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away&quot; and &quot;Deepsea Challenge 3D&quot; in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Cameron starred in the 2017 documentary &quot;Atlantis Rising,&quot; with collaborator Simcha Jacobovici. The pair go on an adventure to explore the existence of the city of Atlantis. The programme aired on January 29 on National Geographic. Next, Cameron produced and appeared in a documentary about the history of science fiction. &quot;James Cameron&#x27;s Story of Science Fiction,&quot; the six-episodic series was broadcast on AMC in 2018. The series featured interviews with guests including Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan. He stated &quot;Without Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, there wouldn&#x27;t have been Ray Bradbury or Robert A. Heinlein, and without them, there wouldn&#x27;t be [George] Lucas, [Steven] Spielberg, Ridley Scott or me&quot;.

&quot;&quot; was finally released in 2019, after being in parallel development with &quot;Avatar&quot;. Written by Cameron and friend Jon Landau, the film was directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by Cameron. The film is based on a 1990s Japanese manga series &quot;Battle Angel Alita,&quot; depicting a cyborg who cannot remember anything of her past life and tries to uncover the truth. Produced with similar techniques and technology as in &quot;Avatar,&quot; the film starred Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson. The film premiered on January 31, 2019, to generally positive reviews and $404 million () at the worldwide box office. In her review, Monica Castillo of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; called it &quot;an awe-inspiring jump for [Rodriguez]&quot; and &quot;a visual bonanza&quot;, despite the bulky script. Cameron then returned to the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise as producer and writer for Tim Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2019).

In August 2013, Cameron announced plans to direct three sequels to &quot;Avatar&quot; simultaneously, for release in December 2016, 2017, and 2018. However, the release dates were adjusted due to Cameron&#x27;s other priorities, with &quot;Avatar&quot; &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot; to be released, respectively, on December 20, 2024, December 18, 2026, and December 22, 2028. &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; estimated that the budget for these would be over $1 billion. &quot;Avatar 2&quot; (later given the subtitle &quot;&quot;) and &quot;Avatar 3&quot; (later given the subtitle &quot;&quot;) began simultaneous production in Manhattan Beach, California on August 15, 2017. Principal photography began in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Parts of &quot;Avatar 4&quot; were also filmed during this time. Cameron stated in a 2017 interview: &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, if &quot;Avatar 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; don&#x27;t make enough money, there&#x27;s not going to be a &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot;&quot;. &quot;Avatar: The Way of Water&quot; had its world premiere in London on December 6, 2022. It became the highest-grossing film released in 2022, and as of 2023 stood as the 3rd highest-grossing film of all time, behind only &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and just ahead of &quot;Titanic&quot;.

Lightstorm Entertainment bought the film rights to the Taylor Stevens novel &quot;The Informationist&quot;, a thriller set in Africa with Cameron planning to direct. In 2010, he indicated he would adapt the Charles R. Pellegrino book &quot;The Last Train from Hiroshima&quot;, which is about the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron met with survivor Tsutomu Yamaguchi before his death in 2010. In 2024, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; confirmed that Cameron had purchased the rights of not only &quot;The Last Train from Hiroshima&quot;, but also of Pellegrino&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;Ghosts of Hiroshima&quot;, to make a &quot;uncompromising theatrical epic motion picture&quot; titled &quot;Last Train From Hiroshima&quot; about a Japanese man who survives Hiroshima&#x27;s bombing at the height of World War II only to then take a train to Nagasaki&#x27;s bombing, which he will shoot as soon as the &quot;Avatar&quot; sequels&#x27; production permits. Feeling that he and Pellegrino owe Yamaguchi for handing the baton of his personal story to them so they could pass his unique and harrowing experience to future generations, Cameron was assisted by the &quot;Avatar&quot; sequels co-writer Shane Salerno and Pellegrino, who previously served as Cameron&#x27;s science consultant on &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;.

In June 2010, Cameron met with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss possible solutions to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It was reported that he offered his assistance to help stop the oil well from leaking. He is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and he worked with the space agency to build cameras for the Curiosity rover sent for Mars. NASA launched the rover without Cameron&#x27;s technology due to a lack of time during testing. He has expressed interest in a project about Mars, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement ... and I&#x27;ve done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3D film.&quot; Cameron is a member of the Mars Society, a non-profit organization lobbying for the colonization of Mars. Cameron endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2016 United States presidential election.

===Deep-sea exploration===
Cameron has experience with deep-sea exploration, in part because of his work on &quot;The Abyss,&quot; &quot;Titanic&quot;, and &quot;Avatar: The Way of Water&quot; and his childhood fascination with shipwrecks. He has contributed to advancements in underwater filming and remotely operated vehicles, and helped develop the 3D Fusion Camera System. In 2011, Cameron became a &quot;National Geographic&quot; explorer-in-residence. In this role, on March 7, 2012, he dived five miles deep to the bottom of the New Britain Trench with the &quot;Deepsea Challenger&quot;. 19 days later, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench. He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor, becoming the first to accomplish the trip alone. During his dive to the Challenger Deep, he discovered new species of sea cucumber, squid worm and a giant single-celled amoeba. He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009, as well as by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot; in 1960.

In the aftermath of the &quot;Titan&quot; submersible implosion, Cameron made appearances in multiple news outlets where he criticized OceanGate and its co-founder Stockton Rush for failing to certify the company&#x27;s submersibles for safety. He was also critical of the use of carbon-fiber composite in the company&#x27;s &quot;Titan&quot; submersible, stating that the material has &quot;no strength in external compression&quot; when withstanding the pressure in deep-sea environments. On July 15, Cameron stated that he had no plans for an OceanGate documentary.

==Personal life==
Cameron has been married five times. He was married to Sharon Williams from 1978 to 1984. A year after he and Williams divorced, Cameron married film producer Gale Anne Hurd, a close collaborator for his 1980s films. They divorced in 1989. Soon after separating from Hurd, Cameron met the director Kathryn Bigelow, whom he wed in 1989; they divorced in 1991. Cameron then began a relationship with Linda Hamilton, the lead actress in &quot;The Terminator&quot; series. Their daughter was born in 1993. Cameron married Hamilton in 1997. Amid speculation of an affair between Cameron and actress Suzy Amis, Cameron and Hamilton separated after two years of marriage, with Hamilton receiving a settlement of $50 million. He married Amis, his fifth wife, in 2000. They have one son and two daughters together.

Cameron applied for American citizenship in 2004, but withdrew his application after George W. Bush won the presidential election. Cameron resided in the United States, but after filming &quot;Avatar&quot; in New Zealand, Cameron bought a home and a farm there in 2012. He divided his time between Malibu, California and New Zealand until 2020, after which he sold his Malibu home and decided to live in New Zealand permanently. He said in August 2020: &quot;I plan to make all my future films in New Zealand, and I see the country having an opportunity to demonstrate to the international film industry how to safely return to work. Doing so with &quot;Avatar&quot; [sequels] will be a beacon that, when this is over [COVID-19 pandemic], will attract more production to New Zealand and continue to stimulate the screen industry and the economy for years.&quot; In February 2025, Cameron was planning to formally become a New Zealand citizen.

Cameron is an atheist; he formerly associated himself with agnosticism, a stance he said he had come to see as &quot;cowardly atheism.&quot; Since 2011, he is vegan. Cameron met close friend Guillermo del Toro on the production of his 1993 film, &quot;Cronos&quot;. In 1998, del Toro&#x27;s father Federico was kidnapped in Guadalajara and Cameron gave del Toro more than $1 million () in cash to pay a ransom and have his father released. Cameron had been friends with &quot;Titanic&quot; expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet for over 25 years before the latter&#x27;s death.

Cameron had a strong interest in visiting the space stations Mir and International Space Station (ISS). He spent the summer of 2000 in Moscow getting ready for a potential trip to space, and was offered an opportunity to go by NASA. However, the trip did not include a visit to the space station, so he declined the offer as it did not align with his terms. The shuttle flight he turned down was the tragic 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Cameron attended the memorial service for the victims of the disaster.

In June 2013, British artist Roger Dean filed a copyright complaint against Cameron, seeking damages of $50 million (). Relating to &quot;Avatar&quot;, Cameron was accused of &quot;wilful and deliberate copying, dissemination and exploitation&quot; of Dean&#x27;s original images; the case was dismissed by US district judge Jesse Furman in 2014. In 2016, Premier Exhibitions, owner of many RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; artifacts, filed for bankruptcy. Cameron supported the UK&#x27;s National Maritime Museum and National Museums Northern Ireland decision to bid for the artifacts, but they were acquired by an investment group before a formal bid took place.

Cameron joined the board of directors of AI company Stability AI in September 2024.

== Filmmaking style ==
=== Themes ===
Cameron&#x27;s films are often based on themes which explore the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity or nature, dangers of corporate greed, strong female characters, and a romance subplot. Cameron has further stated in an interview with The Talks, &quot;All my movies are love stories&quot;. Both &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot; are noted for featuring star-crossed lovers. Characters suffering from emotionally intense and dramatic environments in the sea wilderness are explored in &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;. The &quot;Terminator&quot; series amplifies technology as an enemy which could lead to devastation of mankind. Similarly, &quot;Avatar&quot; views tribal people as an honest group, whereas a &quot;technologically advanced imperial culture is fundamentally evil&quot;. A danger for nuclear war, as featured in &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot; and in his forthcoming &quot;Last Train From Hiroshima&quot; film, has been one of Cameron&#x27;s fears since he watched the Cuban Missile Crisis unfold when he was eight years old.

=== Method ===
Cameron is regarded as an innovative filmmaker in the industry, with a classical filmmaking style, as well as not easy to work for. &quot;Radio Times&quot; critic John Ferguson described Cameron as &quot;the king of hi-tech thrillers&quot;. Dalin Rowell of &quot;/Film&quot; stated: &quot;Known for his larger-than-life creations and unique filmmaking style, director James Cameron is in a league all of his own. With his genre-spanning work, lofty ambitions, and unrestrained energy, Cameron has carved out a name for himself in Hollywood as an artist willing to do anything to see his vision come true.&quot; Rebecca Keegan, author of &quot;The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron,&quot; describes Cameron as &quot;comically hands-on&quot;, and would try to do every job on the set. Andrew Gumbel of &quot;The Independent&quot; says Cameron &quot;is a nightmare to work with. Studios fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper&quot;. Author Alexandra Keller writes that Cameron is an egomaniac, obsessed with vision, but praises his &quot;technological ingenuity&quot; at creating a &quot;visceral viewing experience&quot;.

According to Ed Harris, who starred in Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;The Abyss&quot;, Cameron behaved in an autocratic manner. Orson Scott Card, who novelized &quot;The Abyss&quot;, stated that Cameron &quot;made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better&quot;. Harris later said: &quot;I like Jim. He&#x27;s an incredibly talented, intelligent guy&quot;, adding that &quot;it was always good to see him&quot; in later years. Speaking of her experience on &quot;Titanic&quot;, Kate Winslet said that she admired Cameron, but &quot;there were times I was genuinely frightened of him&quot;. Describing him as having &quot;a temper like you wouldn&#x27;t believe&quot;, she had said she would not work with him again unless it was &quot;for a lot of money&quot;. Despite this, Winslet and Cameron still looked for future projects, and Winslet was eventually cast in &quot;Avatar 2&quot;. Her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio told &quot;Esquire&quot;: &quot;When somebody felt a different way on the set, there was a confrontation. He lets you know exactly how he feels&quot;, but complimented Cameron, &quot;he&#x27;s of the lineage of John Ford. He knows what he wants his film to be.&quot; Sam Worthington, who starred in &quot;Avatar&quot;, said that if a mobile phone rang during filming, Cameron would &quot;nail it to the wall with a nail gun&quot;. Composer James Horner was also not immune to Cameron&#x27;s demands; he recalls having to write music in a short time frame for &quot;Aliens.&quot; After the experience, Horner did not work with Cameron for a decade. In 1996, they reconciled their friendship and Horner produced the soundtracks for &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;.

Despite this reputation, Sigourney Weaver has praised Cameron&#x27;s perfectionism and attention to detail, saying: &quot;He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn&#x27;t mind risking his own&quot;. In 2015, Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis both applauded Cameron in an interview. Curtis remarked: &quot;He can do every other job [than acting]. I&#x27;m talking about every single department, from art direction to props to wardrobe to cameras, he knows more than everyone doing the job&quot;. Curtis also said Cameron &quot;loves actors&quot;, while Weaver referred to Cameron as &quot;so generous to actors&quot; and a &quot;genius&quot;. Michael Biehn, a frequent collaborator, also praised Cameron, saying he &quot;is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies&quot;, adding, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen him yell at anybody&quot;. Biehn acknowledged that Cameron is &quot;not real sensitive when it comes to actors and their trailers, and waiting for actors to come to the set&quot;. Worthington commented: &quot;He demands excellence. If you don&#x27;t give it to him, you&#x27;re going to get chewed out. And that&#x27;s a good thing&quot;. When asked in 2012 about his reputation, Cameron dryly responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t have to shout any more, because the word is out there already&quot;.

In 2021, while giving a MasterClass during a break from his work on the &quot;Avatar&quot; sequels, Cameron acknowledged his past demanding behaviour, opining that if he could go back in time, he would improve the working relationship with his cast and crew members by being less autocratic, thinking of himself as a &quot;tinpot dictator&quot;; Cameron stated that when he visited one of Ron Howard&#x27;s sets, he was &quot;dumbfounded&quot; at how much time Howard took to compliment his crew, aspiring to become &quot;his inner Ron Howard&quot;.

=== Influence ===
Cameron&#x27;s work has had an impact in the Hollywood film industry. &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, was inspired by Cameron&#x27;s approach to action sequences. Whedon also admires Cameron&#x27;s ability for writing heroic female characters such as Ellen Ripley of &quot;Aliens&quot;, adding that he is &quot;the leader and the teacher and the Yoda&quot;. Director Michael Bay idolizes Cameron and was convinced by him to use 3D cameras for filming &quot;&quot; (2011). Cameron&#x27;s approach to 3D inspired Baz Luhrmann during the production of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2013). Other directors that have been inspired by Cameron include Peter Jackson, Neill Blomkamp, and Xavier Dolan.

<doc id="15624" wikidata="Q9268" url="?curid=15624" title="Judaism">
<text>Judaism () is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, ethnic religion that comprises the collective spiritual, cultural, and legal traditions of the Jewish people. Religious Jews regard Judaism as their means of observing the Mosaic covenant, which was established between God and the Israelites, their ancestors. The religion is considered one of the earliest monotheistic religions.

Jewish religious doctrine encompasses a wide body of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Among Judaism&#x27;s core texts is the Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, and a collection of ancient Hebrew scriptures. The Tanakh, known in English as the Hebrew Bible, has the same contents as the Old Testament in Christianity. In addition to the original written scripture, the supplemental Oral Torah is represented by later texts, such as the Midrash and the Talmud. The Hebrew-language word &quot;torah&quot; can mean &quot;teaching&quot;, &quot;law&quot;, or &quot;instruction&quot;, although &quot;Torah&quot; can also be used as a general term that refers to any Jewish text that expands or elaborates on the original Five Books of Moses. Representing the core of the Jewish spiritual and religious tradition, the Torah is a term and a set of teachings that are explicitly self-positioned as encompassing at least seventy, and potentially infinite, facets and interpretations. Judaism&#x27;s texts, traditions, and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity and Islam. Hebraism, like Hellenism, played a seminal role in the formation of Western civilization through its impact as a core background element of Early Christianity.

Within Judaism, there are a variety of religious movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. Historically, all or part of this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites during the early and later medieval period; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Some modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be considered secular or nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi and Modern Orthodox), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law), the authority of the rabbinic tradition, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and &quot;halakha&quot; are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism&#x27;s requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that &quot;halakha&quot; should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, special courts enforced &quot;halakha&quot;; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary. Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them.

Jews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jewish, in addition to converts to Judaism. In 2021, the world Jewish population was estimated at 15.2 million, or roughly 0.195% of the total world population, although religious observance varies from strict to none.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Judaism&quot; derives from &quot;Iudaismus&quot;, a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek &quot;Ioudaismos&quot; (, from the verb , &quot;to side with or imitate the [Judeans]&quot;). Its ultimate source was Judah&quot;, which is also the source of the Hebrew term for Judaism, &quot;Yahaḏuṯ&quot;. The term &quot;Ἰουδαϊσμός&quot; first appears in the Koine Greek book of 2 Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE (i.e. 2 Maccabees 2:21, 8:1 and 14:38) . In the context of the age and period it meant &quot;seeking or forming part of a cultural entity&quot;. It resembled its antonym &quot;hellenismos&quot;, a word signifying people&#x27;s submission to Hellenistic cultural norms. The conflict between &quot;iudaismos&quot; and &quot;hellenismos&quot; lay behind the Maccabean Revolt and hence the invention of the term &quot;iudaismos&quot;.

Shaye J. D. Cohen writes in his book &quot;The Beginnings of Jewishness&quot;:
Daniel R. Schwartz, however, argues that &quot;Judaism&quot;, especially in the context of the Book of Maccabees, refers to the religion, as opposed to the culture and politics of the Judean state. He believes it reflected the ideological divide between the Pharisees and Sadducees and, implicitly, anti-Hasmonean and pro-Hasmonean factions in Judean society.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the earliest citation in English where the term was used to mean &quot;the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews&quot; is Robert Fabyan&#x27;s &quot;The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce&quot; (1516). &quot;Judaism&quot; as a direct translation of the Latin &quot;Iudaismus&quot; first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the Biblical apocrypha (the Deuterocanonical books in the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy), 2 Macc. ii. 21: &quot;Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme.&quot;

==History==


===Origins===


==== &#x27;The Covenant&#x27; with Abraham in the book of Genesis ====
A significant part of the Hebrew Bible or &quot;Tanakh&quot; is an account of the Israelites&#x27; relationship with religion and God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple (). Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people. In Genesis, three men, speculated to be God or Archangels, commanded Abraham to circumcise himself and his sons as a sign of the covenant, and was promised by the angels that Isaac, his second son, would inherit the Land of Israel (then called Canaan) and renamed his Wife from &#x27;Sarai&#x27;, which meant Mockery, to &#x27;Sarah&#x27;, which meant Princess, and that she would bear him a son in her old age and his descendants shall also be blessed and keep &#x27;the covenant&#x27;.

==== The Torah, Nevi&#x27;im, and Ketuvim ====
In Exodus, the second book of the bible, the descendants of Isaac&#x27;s son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt, and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt in a vision. Rules and commandments were conveyed to Moses at Sinai; accounted in the Torah, or five books of Moses. These books, together with the Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim, are known as &quot;Torah Shebikhtav&quot;, as opposed to the Oral Torah, which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. The Nevi&#x27;im details historical narratives, and prophetic writings, focusing on the Isrelites settlements in Canaan. While the Ketuvim, a diverse collection of books including the Psalms, Proverbs, and Esther, covers poetic and prose philisophical writings which deviates from the more literalist style of the other books.
==== The Talmud ====
Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the Law, called the Oral Torah or &quot;Oral Law,&quot; were originally unwritten traditions based on the Law given to Moses at Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by Judah ha-Nasi in the Mishnah, redacted . The Talmud was a compilation of the Mishnah and Gemara, rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, Palestine and Babylonia (Lower Mesopotamia). Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Palestine.

==== Historical Analysis ====
According to critical scholars, the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Several of these scholars, such as Professor Martin Rose and John Bright, suggest that during the First Temple period the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own version of a god viewed as superior to all other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenistic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed. John Day argues that the origins of biblical Yahweh, El, Asherah, and Ba&#x27;al, may be rooted in earlier Canaanite religion, which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like in Greek mythology.

===Antiquity===
According to the Hebrew Bible, a United Monarchy was established under Saul and continued under King David and Solomon with its capital in Jerusalem. After Solomon&#x27;s reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel (in the north) and the Kingdom of Judah (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire; many people were taken captive from the capital Samaria to Media and the Khabur River valley. The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the First Temple, which was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judeans were exiled to Babylon, in what is regarded as the first Jewish diaspora. Later, many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylon by the Persian Achaemenid Empire seventy years later, an event known as the Return to Zion. A Second Temple was constructed and old religious practices were resumed.

During the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra the Scribe. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed. Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE, and its creation sparked widespread controversy in Jewish communities, starting &quot;conflicts within Jewish communities about accommodating the cultures of occupying powers.&quot;

During the Great Jewish Revolt (66–73 CE), the Romans sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Second Temple. Later, Roman emperor Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple Mount and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE), after which the Romans banned the study of the Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a &quot;religio licita&quot; (&quot;legitimate religion&quot;) until the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity in the fourth century.

Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities.

Judaism in pre-Islamic Arabia goes back to the pre-Christian period, and was concentrated in the northwest and south. In the fourth century, the ruling class of the Himyarite Kingdom of pre-Islamic South Arabia converted to Judaism. This situation lasted until the early sixth century, when the Aksumite invasion of Himyar instigated by the massacre of Najran led to a change into Christian rulership.

==Defining characteristics and principles of faith==
Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God&#x27;s principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created. Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind. According to the Hebrew Bible, God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation. Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God&#x27;s concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God&#x27;s love for people.

Thus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism in Kabbalah, Rabbinic scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as &quot;normal mysticism&quot;, because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews. This is played out through the observance of the &quot;halakha&quot;, or Jewish law, and given verbal expression in the Birkat Ha-Mizvot, the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled:
Whereas Jewish philosophers often debate whether God is immanent or transcendent, and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, &quot;halakha&quot; is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world.

Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Hebrew Bible (or &quot;Tanakh&quot;) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel. In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.

Moreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God. For some, observance of &quot;halakha&quot; is more important than belief in God &quot;per se&quot;. The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.

In continental Europe, Judaism is heavily associated with and most often thought of as Orthodox Judaism.

===Core tenets===

In the strict sense, in Judaism, unlike Christianity and Islam, there are no fixed universally binding articles of faith, due to their incorporation into the liturgy. Scholars throughout Jewish history have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism&#x27;s core tenets, all of which have met with criticism. The most popular formulation is Maimonides&#x27; thirteen principles of faith, developed in the 12th century. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic. Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides&#x27; principles. Thus, within Reform Judaism only the first five principles are endorsed.

In Maimonides&#x27; time, his list of tenets was criticized by Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo. Albo and the Raavad argued that Maimonides&#x27; principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith

Along these lines, the ancient historian Josephus emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating apostasy with a failure to observe &quot;halakha&quot; and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides&#x27; principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries. Later, two poetic restatements of these principles (&quot;&quot;Ani Ma&#x27;amin&quot; and &quot;Yigdal&quot;&quot;) became integrated into many Jewish liturgies, leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.

The oldest non-Rabbinic instance of articles of faith were formulated, under Islamic influence, by the 12th century Karaite figure Judah ben Elijah Hadassi:
In modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma. Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism. Even so, all Jewish religious movements are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the Hebrew Bible or various commentaries such as the Talmud and Midrash. Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical Covenant between God and the Patriarch Abraham as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to Moses, who is considered Judaism&#x27;s greatest prophet. In the Mishnah, a core text of Rabbinic Judaism, acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the World to Come.

Establishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary Jewish denominations. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus, for instance, Joseph Soloveitchik&#x27;s (associated with the Modern Orthodox movement) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the &quot;halakha&quot; whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist Judaism, abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with civilization and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, Solomon Schechter&#x27;s Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, David Philipson draws the outlines of the Reform movement in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.

===Legal literature===

The basis of &quot;halakha&quot; and tradition is the Torah (also known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are 613 commandments in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the Kohanim and Leviyim (members of the tribe of Levi), some only to farmers within the Land of Israel. Many laws were only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.

While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the Sadducees, and the Karaites), most Jews believe in the oral law. These oral traditions were transmitted by the Pharisee school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.

According to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the Torah) and the Oral Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages (rabbinic leaders) of each subsequent generation.

For centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi Judah haNasi undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the &quot;Mishnah&quot;.

The Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying &quot;halakha&quot;, which are the basis of the Talmud. According to Abraham ben David, the &quot;Mishnah&quot; was compiled by Rabbi Judah haNasi after the destruction of Jerusalem, in anno mundi 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.

Over the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world&#x27;s major Jewish communities (in Israel and Babylonia). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two Talmuds, the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Talmud Yerushalmi&quot;) and the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Talmud Bavli&quot;). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.

In the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined, and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.

&quot;Halakha&quot;, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic Midrash, the Talmud and its commentaries. The &quot;halakha&quot; has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as responsa (Hebrew ). Over time, as practices develop, codes of &quot;halakha&quot; are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the Shulchan Aruch, largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.

===Jewish philosophy===
Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include Philo of Alexandria, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Saadia Gaon, Judah Halevi, Maimonides, and Gersonides. Major changes occurred in response to the Enlightenment (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Yitzchok Hutner. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Mordecai Kaplan, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Will Herberg, and Emmanuel Lévinas.

===Rabbinic hermeneutics===
Orthodox and many other Jews do not believe that the revealed Torah consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of Torah (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud, and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God&#x27;s revelation, but an end in itself. According to the Talmud:
In Judaism, &quot;the study of Torah can be a means of experiencing God&quot;. Reflecting on the contribution of the Amoraim and Tanaim to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:

To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study &quot;how&quot; to study the word of God.

In the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:
These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud:
Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations.

According to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the written Torah were revealed to Moses at Sinai in oral form, and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.

Thus, Hillel called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws (baraita at the beginning of Sifra); R. Ishmael, thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel). Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in &quot;Ayyelet ha-Shachar&quot;, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael&#x27;s 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism&#x27;s earliest, contributions to logic, hermeneutics, and jurisprudence. Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael&#x27;s principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century. Today R. Ishmael&#x27;s 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.

==Jewish identity==

===Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism===
According to Daniel Boyarin, the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism. Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism&#x27;s more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Jewish diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. Thus, Boyarin has argued that &quot;Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.&quot;

In contrast to this point of view, practices such as Humanistic Judaism reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.

===Who is a Jew?===

According to Rabbinic Judaism, a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who converted to Judaism in accordance with &quot;halakha&quot;. Reconstructionist Judaism and the larger denominations of worldwide Progressive Judaism (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches. All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge. Converts are called &quot;ben Abraham&quot; or &quot;bat Abraham&quot;, (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel&#x27;s highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.

Rabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew, and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes. However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism &quot;without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community&quot; and &quot;A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew&quot;.

Karaite Judaism believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.

The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, David Ben-Gurion requested opinions on &quot;mihu Yehudi&quot; (&quot;Who is a Jew&quot;) from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in Israeli politics.

Historical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on &quot;halakhic&quot; definitions of matrilineal descent, and &quot;halakhic&quot; conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud, around 200 CE. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because &quot;[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.&quot; Leviticus 24 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is &quot;of the community of Israel.&quot; This is complemented by Ezra 10, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period. Since the anti-religious &quot;Haskalah&quot; movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, &quot;halakhic&quot; interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.

===Jewish demographics===

The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of &quot;who is a Jew&quot; is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the &quot;Jewish Year Book&quot; (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3 million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million. It is 0.25% of world population.

Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001. The overall growth rate of Jews in Israel is 1.7% annually, and is consistently growing through natural population growth and extensive immigration. The diaspora countries, by contrast, have low Jewish birth rates, an increasingly elderly age composition, high rates of interreligious marriage and a negative balance of people leaving Judaism versus those joining.

In 2022, the world Jewish population was estimated at 15.2 million, with the majority living in one of two countries: Israel and the United States. About 46.6% of all Jews resided in Israel (6.9 million) and another 6 million Jews resided in the United States, with most of the remainder living in Europe, and other groups spread throughout Canada, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.
Jewish demographics represent diverse historical and cultural trajectories. Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel), Mizrahi Jews, and Romaniote Jews, may possess unique customs and practices.

In Israel, the classification of Jewish observance into categories like Haredi, Dati, Masorti, and Hiloni was developed by sociologists and researchers studying the religious and cultural landscape of Israeli society. These distinctions emerged from surveys and studies conducted by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and scholars such as Shmuel Sandler, who explored how religious practices varied among different segments of the Jewish population. The categories were created to better understand the range of religious adherence, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredim to the secular Hilonim, with Dati and Masorti representing intermediary groups.

==Jewish religious movements==
===Rabbinic Judaism===
Rabbinic Judaism (or in some older sources, Rabbinism; Hebrew: &quot;Yahadut Rabanit&quot; – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the Talmud. It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the Law.

The Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century resulted in the division of Western Jewry (primarily, the Ashkenazi, but also western part of Sephardim and Italian rite Jews, a.k.a. &quot;Italkim&quot;, and Greek Romaniote Jews—both last groups are considered distinct from Ashkenazim and Sephardim) into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. The notion &quot;traditional Judaism&quot; includes the Orthodox with Conservative or solely the Orthodox Jews:
* Orthodox Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Torah were divinely revealed to Moses and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (a condensed codification of &quot;halakha&quot; that largely favoured Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of &quot;halakha&quot;. Orthodoxy places a high importance on Maimonides&#x27; 13 principles as a definition of Jewish faith.

:Orthodoxy is often divided into Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism. Haredi is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from Modern Orthodox Judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of Haredi Judaism along both ethnic and ideological lines include Hardal (&quot;Nationalist Haredi&quot; within Religious Zionism); Hasidic Judaism, which is rooted in the Kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a Rebbe or religious teacher; their traditionalist opponents the &quot;Misnagdim&quot; (also known as Lithuanian or &quot;Lita&#x27;im&quot;); and Sephardic Haredi Judaism, which emerged among Sephardic and Mizrahi (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel. &quot;Centrist&quot; Orthodoxy (Joseph B. Soloveitchik) is sometimes also distinguished.

* Conservative Judaism (known as &quot;Masorti Judaism&quot; outside North America and Israel) is characterized by a commitment to traditional &quot;halakha&quot; and customs, including observance of Shabbat and kashrut, a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that &quot;halakha&quot; is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses. Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.
* Reform Judaism, called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the Prophets. Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with Hebrew in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.
* Reconstructionist Judaism, like Reform Judaism, does not hold that &quot;halakha&quot;, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow. It is sometimes recognized as the fourth major stream of Judaism.
* Jewish Renewal is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of &quot;halakha&quot;. Men and women participate equally in prayer.
* Humanistic Judaism is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.
* Subbotniks (Sabbatarians) are a movement of Jews of Russian ethnic origin in the 18th–20th centuries, the majority of whom belonged to Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism. Many settled in the Holy Land as part of the Zionist First Aliyah in order to escape oppression in the Russian Empire and later mostly intermarried with other Jews, their descendants included Alexander Zaïd, Major-General Alik Ron, and the mother of Ariel Sharon.

====Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism====
While traditions and customs vary between discrete communities, it can be said that Sephardi (Iberian, for example, most Jews from France and the Netherlands) and Mizrahi (Oriental) Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the &quot;movement&quot; framework popular in and among Ashkenazi Jewry. Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a &quot;big tent&quot; approach. This is particularly the case in contemporary Israel, which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews or some their communities may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) Among the pioneers of Reform Judaism in the 1820s there was the Sephardic congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina. A part of the European Sephardim were also linked with the Judaic modernization.

Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the traditional (Orthodox) and prayer rites are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel.

====Jewish movements in Israel====

In Israel, as in the West, Judaism is also divided into major Orthodox, Conservative and Reform traditions. At the same time, for statistical and practical purposes, a different division of society is used there on the basis of a person&#x27;s attitude to religion.

Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as &quot;secular&quot; (&quot;hiloni&quot;), &quot;traditional&quot; (&quot;masorti&quot;), &quot;religious&quot; (&quot;dati&quot;) or &quot;ultra-religious&quot; (&quot;haredi&quot;). The term &quot;secular&quot; is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).

The term &quot;traditional&quot; (&quot;masorti&quot;) is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of &quot;eastern&quot; origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with Conservative Judaism, which also names itself &quot;Masorti&quot; outside North America. Only a few authors, like Elliot Nelson Dorff, consider the American Conservative (masorti) movement and Israeli masorti sector to be one and the same. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways &quot;secular&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot; are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term &quot;Orthodox&quot; is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the Jewish diaspora. What would be called &quot;Orthodox&quot; in the diaspora includes what is commonly called &quot;dati&quot; (religious, including religious zionist) or &quot;haredi&quot; (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called &quot;religious Zionism&quot; or the &quot;National Orthodox&quot; community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as &quot;haredi-leumi&quot; (nationalist &quot;haredi&quot;), or &quot;Hardal&quot;, which combines a largely &quot;haredi&quot; lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in Yiddish, also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as &quot;frum&quot;, as opposed to &quot;frei&quot; (more liberal Jews)).

===Karaites and Samaritans===
Karaite Judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the Second Temple period, such as the Sadducees. The Karaites (&quot;Scripturalists&quot;) accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat (&quot;simple&quot; meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.

The Samaritans, a very small community located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus/Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon, near Tel Aviv in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written Torah (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua).
===Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)===

Haymanot (meaning &quot;religion&quot; in Ge&#x27;ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge&#x27;ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like Sigd.

=== Noahide (&quot;B&#x27;nei Noah&quot; movement) ===

Noahidism is a Jewish religious movement based on the Seven Laws of Noah and their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism. According to the &quot;halakha&quot;, non-Jews (gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba), the final reward of the righteous. The divinely ordained penalty for violating any of the Laws of Noah is discussed in the Talmud, but in practical terms it is subject to the working legal system which is established by the society at large. Those who subscribe to the observance of the Noahic Covenant are referred to as (Hebrew: , &#x27;Children of Noah&#x27;) or &quot;Noahides&quot; (). Supporting organizations have been established around the world over the past decades by both Noahides and Orthodox Jews.

Historically, the Hebrew term &quot;B&#x27;nei Noach&quot; has applied to all non-Jews as descendants of Noah. However, nowadays it&#x27;s primarily used to refer specifically to those non-Jews who observe the Seven Laws of Noah.

==Jewish observances==

===Jewish ethics===

Jewish ethics may be guided by &quot;halakhic&quot; traditions, by customs of etiquette, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness (chesed), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity (tzedakah) and refraining from negative speech (lashon hara). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.

===Prayers===
Traditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma&#x27;ariv with a fourth prayer, Mussaf added on Shabbat and holidays. At the heart of each service is the &quot;Amidah&quot; or &quot;Shemoneh Esrei&quot;. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; (or &quot;Shema&quot;). The &quot;Shema&quot; is the recitation of a verse from the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4): &quot;Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad&quot;—&quot;Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!&quot;
Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult Jews, called a &quot;minyan&quot;. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a &quot;minyan&quot;; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.

In addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts. Prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning, before eating or drinking different foods, after eating a meal, and so on.

The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as reading from the Torah. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.

===Religious clothing===

A &quot;kippah&quot; (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural &quot;kippot&quot;; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, &quot;yarmulke&quot;) is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. &quot;Kippot&quot; range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.

&quot;Tzitzit&quot; (Hebrew: צִיציִת) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: &quot;tzitzis&quot;) are special knotted &quot;fringes&quot; or &quot;tassels&quot; found on the four corners of the &quot;tallit&quot; (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: &quot;tallis&quot;), or prayer shawl. The &quot;tallit&quot; is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A &quot;tallit katan&quot; (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.

Tefillin (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning &quot;safeguard&quot; or &quot;amulet&quot;), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.

A &quot;kittel&quot; (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the High Holidays. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a &quot;tallit&quot; and sometimes also a &quot;kittel&quot; which are part of the &quot;tachrichim&quot; (burial garments).

===Jewish holidays===

Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as creation, revelation, and redemption.

====Shabbat====
&quot;Shabbat&quot;, the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God&#x27;s day of rest after six days of creation. It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have challah, two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of &quot;melakhah&quot;, translated literally as &quot;work&quot;. In fact, the activities banned on the Sabbath are not &quot;work&quot; in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.

====Three pilgrimage festivals====

Jewish holy days (&quot;chaggim&quot;), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called &quot;regalim&quot; (derived from the Hebrew word &quot;regel&quot;, or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple:
* Passover (&quot;Pesach&quot;) is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of Nisan (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the Seder. Leavened products (chametz) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. Matzo is eaten instead of bread.
* Shavuot (&quot;Pentecost&quot; or &quot;Feast of Weeks&quot;) celebrates the revelation of the Torah to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.
* Sukkot (&quot;Tabernacles&quot; or &quot;The Festival of Booths&quot;) commemorates the Israelites&#x27; forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called &quot;sukkot&quot; (sing. &quot;sukkah&quot;) that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in &quot;sukkot&quot; for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with Shemini Atzeret, where Jews begin to pray for rain and Simchat Torah, &quot;Rejoicing of the Torah&quot;, a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.

====High Holy Days====

The High Holidays (&quot;Yamim Noraim&quot; or &quot;Days of Awe&quot;) revolve around judgment and forgiveness:
* Rosh Hashanah, (also &quot;Yom Ha-Zikkaron&quot; or &quot;Day of Remembrance&quot;, and &quot;Yom Teruah&quot;, or &quot;Day of the Sounding of the Shofar&quot;). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, &quot;head of the year&quot;), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar, Tishri. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram&#x27;s horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.
* Yom Kippur, (&quot;Day of Atonement&quot;) is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one&#x27;s sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a &quot;Machzor&quot;. Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the &quot;seuda mafseket&quot;, is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called &quot;Ne&#x27;ilah&quot;, ends with a long blast of the shofar.

====Purim====

Purim (Hebrew: &quot;lots&quot;) is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from the plot of the evil Haman, who sought to exterminate them, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, charity to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called hamantashen, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.

Purim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of Adar, which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.

====Hanukkah====

Hanukkah (, &quot;dedication&quot;) also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of Kislev (Hebrew calendar). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival&#x27;s eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.

The holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning &quot;dedication&quot;) because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the &quot;Miracle of the Oil&quot;. According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem following the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire, there was only enough consecrated oil to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days—which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.

Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.

====Fast days====

Tisha B&#x27;Av ( or , &quot;the Ninth of Av&quot;) is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples, and in later times, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.

There are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the 17th Tamuz, the 10th of Tevet and Tzom Gedaliah (the 3rd of Tishrei).

====Israeli holidays====

The modern holidays of Yom Ha-shoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day), Yom Hazikaron (Israeli Memorial Day) and Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust, the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.

There are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the 10th of Tevet.
===Torah readings===

The core of festival and Shabbat prayer services is the public reading of the Torah, along with connected readings from the other books of the Tanakh, called Haftarah. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on Simchat Torah.

===Synagogues and religious buildings===

Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:

* The ark (called &quot;aron ha-kodesh&quot; by Ashkenazim and &quot;hekhal&quot; by Sephardim) where the Torah scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (&quot;parochet&quot;) outside or inside the ark doors);
* The elevated reader&#x27;s platform (called &quot;bimah&quot; by Ashkenazim and &quot;tebah&quot; by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);
* The eternal light (&quot;ner tamid&quot;), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem
* The pulpit, or &quot;amud&quot;, a lectern facing the Ark where the hazzan or prayer leader stands while praying.

In addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include yeshivas, or institutions of Jewish learning, and mikvahs, which are ritual baths.

===Dietary laws: &quot;kashrut&quot;===

The Jewish dietary laws are known as &quot;kashrut&quot;. Food prepared in accordance with them is termed kosher, and food that is not kosher is also known as &quot;treifah&quot; or &quot;treif&quot;. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be &quot;keeping kosher&quot;.

Many of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, mammals must have split hooves and chew their cud. The pig is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal. Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud. For seafood to be kosher, the animal must have fins and scales. Certain types of seafood, such as shellfish, crustaceans, and eels, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the Torah. The exact translations of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds&#x27; identities are no longer certain. However, traditions exist about the &quot;kashrut&quot; status of a few birds. For example, both chickens and turkeys are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as amphibians, reptiles, and most insects, are prohibited altogether.

In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as &quot;shechitah&quot;. Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered &quot;treif&quot;. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the blood, some fats, and the area in and around the sciatic nerve.

&quot;Halakha&quot; also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother&#x27;s milk, this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah, the Talmud and Rabbinic law. Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot;, but the prohibition is rabbinic, not biblical.

The use of dishes, serving utensils, and ovens may make food &quot;treif&quot; that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food &quot;treif&quot; under certain conditions.

Furthermore, all Orthodox and some Conservative authorities forbid the consumption of processed grape products made by non-Jews, due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals. Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.

The Torah does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot;. However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community. The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained. In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because &quot;they are unclean&quot;. The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.

Survival concerns supersede all the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot;, as they do for most &quot;halakhot&quot;.

===Laws of ritual purity===

The Tanakh describes circumstances in which a person who is &quot;tahor&quot; or ritually pure may become &quot;tamei&quot; or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human corpses or graves, seminal flux, vaginal flux, menstruation, and contact with people who have become impure from any of these. In Rabbinic Judaism, Kohanim, members of the hereditary caste that served as priests in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies. During the Temple period, such priests (Kohanim) were required to eat their bread offering (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as hand-washing which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.

====Family purity====

An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating women. These laws are also known as &quot;niddah&quot;, literally &quot;separation&quot;, or family purity. Vital aspects of &quot;halakha&quot; for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.

Especially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary &quot;niddah&quot; with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as &quot;zavah&quot;, and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh

Traditional Ethiopian Jews keep menstruating women in separate huts and, similar to Karaite practice, do not allow menstruating women into their temples because of a temple&#x27;s special sanctity. Emigration to Israel and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.
===Life-cycle events===
Life-cycle events, or rites of passage, occur throughout a Jew&#x27;s life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community:
*  – Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of circumcision on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named &quot;zeved habat&quot; or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.
* Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah – This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a &quot;portion&quot; of the Torah.
* Marriage – Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event and an ideal human state. A wedding takes place under a &quot;chuppah&quot;, or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people. An intermarriage is prohibited, except as within Reform Judaism:

* Divorce – Divorce is allowed in accordance with Halakha. The divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the short document written in Aramaic into the hand of the wife in rabbinical court, that is all. But, since the 11th century among the Ashkenazim and many Sephardim a divorce became prohibited against will of a wife, than a man had way for polygamy. The &quot;get&quot; contains declaration: &quot;You are hereby permitted to all men.&quot;

* Death and Mourning () – The &quot;Torah&quot; requires burial as soon as possible, even for executed criminals. Judaism has a multi-staged mourning practice. The first stage is called the shiva (literally &quot;seven&quot;, observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the &quot;shloshim&quot; (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, &quot;avelut yud bet chodesh&quot;, which is observed for eleven months. A cremation within Orthodox Judaism permitted only by some leading rabbis in West Europe.

==Community leadership==
===Classical priesthood===

The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honoured in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty:
* Kohen (priest) – patrilineal descendant of Aaron, brother of Moses. In the Temple, the &quot;kohanim&quot; were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the Priestly Blessing, as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.
* Levi (Levite) – Patrilineal descendant of Levi the son of Jacob. In the Temple in Jerusalem, the levites sang Psalms, performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.

===Prayer leaders===

From the time of the Mishnah and Talmud to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities—reading the Torah and &quot;haftarah&quot; (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require a &quot;minyan&quot;, the presence of ten Jews.

The most common professional clergy in a synagogue are:
* Rabbi of a congregation – Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation&#x27;s preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as &quot;shatz&quot; or &quot;baal kriyah&quot; (see below).
** Hassidic &quot;Rebbe&quot; – rabbi who is the head of a Hasidic dynasty.
* Hazzan (note: the &quot;h&quot; denotes voiceless pharyngeal fricative) (cantor) – a trained vocalist who acts as &quot;shatz&quot;. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.

Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:
* Shaliach tzibur or &quot;Shatz&quot; (leader—literally &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;representative&quot;—of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a &quot;shatz&quot; recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is &quot;not&quot; acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying &quot;amen&quot; at their conclusion; it is with this act that the &quot;shatz&#x27;s&quot; prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as &quot;shatz&quot;. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all Progressive communities now allow women to serve in this function.
* The Baal kriyah or &quot;baal koreh&quot; (master of the reading) reads the weekly Torah portion. The requirements for being the &quot;baal kriyah&quot; are the same as those for the &quot;shatz&quot;. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.

Many congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:
* Gabbai (sexton) – Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the &quot;shatz&quot; for each prayer session if there is no standard &quot;shatz&quot;, and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.

The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honour. Since the Enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as &quot;shatz&quot; and &quot;baal kriyah&quot;, and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.
===Specialized religious roles===
* &quot;Dayan&quot; (judge) – An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a &quot;beth din&quot; (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.
* Mohel (circumciser) – An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified &quot;mohel&quot; and performs the &quot;brit milah&quot; (circumcision).
* Shochet (ritual slaughterer) – In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a &quot;shochet&quot; who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another &quot;shochet.&quot;
* Sofer (scribe) – Torah scrolls, &quot;tefillin&quot; (phylacteries), &quot;mezuzot&quot; (scrolls put on doorposts), and &quot;gittin&quot; (bills of divorce) must be written by a &quot;sofer&quot; who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.
* Rosh yeshiva – A Torah scholar who runs a yeshiva.
* Mashgiach/Mashgicha of a yeshiva – Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on mussar (Jewish ethics).
* Mashgiach/Mashgicha – Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of kashrut and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself or herself.

===Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)===
Around the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, Essenes, and Christians. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished. Christianity survived, but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion; the Pharisees survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism (today, known simply as &quot;Judaism&quot;). The Sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the Prophets and the Writings, relying only on the Torah as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees&#x27; belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The Samaritans practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)

Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law as recorded in the Mishnah (and developed by later rabbis in the two Talmuds), relying instead only upon the Tanakh. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the Malikites, and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the Karaite sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.

Over a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the Ashkenazi Jews (of central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardi Jews (of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, the Yemenite Jews from the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula and the Malabari and Cochin Jews from Kerala . Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.

===Persecutions===

Antisemitism arose during the Middle Ages, in the form of persecutions, pogroms, forced conversions, expulsions, social restrictions and ghettoization.

This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism. During the Middle Ages, Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration, but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad&#x27;s persecutions.

===Hasidism===

Hasidic Judaism was founded by Yisroel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), also known as the &quot;Ba&#x27;al Shem Tov&quot; (or &quot;Besht&quot;). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too &quot;academic&quot;, and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favoured small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel, which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing. Ba&#x27;al Shem Tov&#x27;s disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a &quot;refreshment&quot; of original Judaism. As some have put it: &quot;they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost&quot;. Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim, (lit. &quot;opponents&quot;). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism.

===The Enlightenment and new religious movements===

In the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, Haskalah or the &quot;Jewish Enlightenment&quot;, began, especially in Central Europe and Western Europe, in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe &quot;halakha&quot; and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.

In Central Europe, followed by Great Britain and the United States, Reform (or Liberal) Judaism developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating Protestant decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism&#x27;s Prophetic tradition. Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of &quot;halakha&quot;. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that &quot;halakha&quot; should not be entirely abandoned, to form the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism. After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel, these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.

===Spectrum of observance===

Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the National Jewish Population Survey, in the United States&#x27; Jewish community—the world&#x27;s second largest—4.3 million Jews out of 5.1 million had some sort of connection to the religion. Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.

==Judaism and other religions==

===Christianity and Judaism===

Christianity was originally a sect of Second Temple Judaism, but the two religions diverged in the first century. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of atonement and sin, the status of God&#x27;s commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the nature of God himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as Shituf or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in dual-covenant theology emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi Holocaust.

Since the time of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church upheld the &quot;Constitutio pro Judæis&quot; (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated: 

Until their emancipation in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the Jewish hat and the yellow badge, restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns (ghettos), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, England in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and Spain in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 Asser Levy was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America. In 1791, Revolutionary France was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by Prussia in 1848. Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by Isaac Lyon Goldsmid with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the Jews Relief Act 1858. The newly created German Empire in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the Nuremberg Laws in 1935.

Jewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. Religious prejudice was an underlying source against Jews in Europe. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the early years of Christianity and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the Holocaust. These attitudes were reinforced by Christian preaching, in art and popular teaching for two millennia which expressed contempt for Jews, as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews. The Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian Churches; many of them, such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church, as well as Quakers and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious régime.

The attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism have changed in a mostly positive direction since World War II. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church have &quot;upheld the Church&#x27;s acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people&quot; as well as a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and the Jews. In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.

===Islam and Judaism===

Both Judaism and Islam track their origins from the patriarch Abraham, and they are therefore considered Abrahamic religions. In both Jewish and Muslim tradition, the Jewish and Arab peoples are descended from the two sons of Abraham—Isaac and Ishmael, respectively. While both religions are monotheistic and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider Jesus or Muhammad to be prophets. The religions&#x27; adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century, when Islam originated and spread in the Arabian peninsula. The period under the Ummayad and the Abbasid caliphates between 712 and 1066 has been called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as &quot;dhimmis&quot;. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims. For example, they had to pay the jizya, a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males, and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims. Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear distinctive clothing, a practice not found in either the Quran or the hadiths but invented in early medieval Baghdad and inconsistently enforced. Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in Persia, and by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in North Africa and Al-Andalus, as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see Mawza Exile). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in Morocco, for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters (mellahs) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.

In the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries. Most have chosen to live in Israel. Today, antisemitic themes including Holocaust denial have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as Hizbullah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi.

===Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism===
There are some movements in other religions that include elements of Judaism. Among Christianity these are a number of denominations of ancient and contemporary Judaizers. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, In this, elements of the messianic traditions in Judaism, are incorporated in, and melded with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one&#x27;s savior. Some members of Messianic Judaism argue that it is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity, and because the conditions for Messiah to have come accordingly within traditional Jewish thought have not yet been met. Another religious movement is the Black Hebrew Israelite group, which not to be confused with less syncretic Black Judaism (a constellation of movements which, depending on their adherence to normative Jewish tradition, receive varying degrees of recognition by the broader Jewish community).

Other examples of syncretism include Semitic neopaganism, loosely organized sects which incorporate pagan, Goddess movement or Wiccan beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; Jewish Buddhists, another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Buddhism and other Asian spirituality in their faith.

Some Renewal Jews borrow freely and openly from Buddhism, Sufism, Native American religions, and other faiths.

The Kabbalah Centre, which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a one of &quot;New Age Judaism&quot; movements that claims to popularize the kabbalah, part of the Jewish esoteric tradition.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Judaism may include those that require revisionism to classical Orthodox Judaism, such as that of the modernized denomination of Reconstructionist Judaism as established by American rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, who believed that classical Orthodox Judaism is outdated as a religious belief on its own, and should represent the Jewish culture as a progressive civilization.

On the other hand, proponents of classical Orthodox Judaism such as Neturei Karta and similar groups strongly oppose the growing accommodation to political Zionism by Haredi Jewish groups such as Agudat Yisrael; a previously anti-Zionist proponent of Orthodox Haredi Judaism whom the Neturei Karta see as betrayal by the Agudat Yisrael against the Orthodoxy, in the belief that Judaism should never be conflated with the politics of Zionism.

Orthodox Jewish public intellectual and polymath Yeshayahu Leibowitz believed in the separation of church and state, and regarded Reform Judaism as a &quot;historical distortion of the Jewish religion&quot;.

<text>John Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 – 7 May 1873) was an English philosopher, political economist, politician and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of liberalism, he contributed widely to social theory, political theory, and political economy. Dubbed &quot;the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century&quot; by the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, he conceived of liberty as justifying the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control. He advocated political and social reforms such as proportional representation, the emancipation of women, and the development of labour organisations and farm cooperatives. The &quot;Columbia Encyclopedia&quot; 5th ed. says of him &quot;at times Mill came close to socialism, a theory repugnant to his predecessors&quot;. He was a proponent of utilitarianism, an ethical theory developed by his predecessor Jeremy Bentham. He contributed to the investigation of scientific methodology, though his knowledge of the topic was based on the writings of others, notably William Whewell, John Herschel, and Auguste Comte, and research carried out for Mill by Alexander Bain. He engaged in written debate with Whewell.

A member of the Liberal Party and author of the early feminist work &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, Mill was also the second Member of Parliament to call for women&#x27;s suffrage after Henry Hunt in 1832.

==Biography==
John Stuart Mill was born at 13 Rodney Street in Pentonville, then on the edge of the capital and now in central London, the eldest son of Harriet Barrow and the Scottish philosopher, historian, and economist James Mill. John Stuart was educated by his father, with the advice and assistance of Jeremy Bentham and Francis Place. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing, and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father, a follower of Bentham and an adherent of associationism, had as his explicit aim to create a genius intellect that would carry on the cause of utilitarianism and its implementation after he and Bentham had died.

Mill was a notably precocious child. He describes his education in his autobiography. At the age of three he was taught Greek. By the age of eight, he had read &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis&quot;, and the whole of Herodotus, and was acquainted with Lucian, Diogenes Laërtius, Isocrates and six dialogues of Plato. He had also read a great deal of history in English and had been taught arithmetic, physics and astronomy.

At the age of eight, Mill began studying Latin, the works of Euclid, and algebra, and was appointed schoolmaster to the younger children of the family. His main reading was still history, but he went through all the commonly taught Latin and Greek authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and Demosthenes with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of his earliest poetic compositions was a continuation of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In his spare time he also enjoyed reading about natural sciences and popular novels, such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

His father&#x27;s work, &quot;The History of British India&quot;, was published in 1818; immediately thereafter, at about the age of twelve, Mill began a thorough study of the scholastic logic, at the same time reading Aristotle&#x27;s logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied Adam Smith and David Ricardo with his father, ultimately completing their classical economic view of factors of production. Mill&#x27;s &quot;comptes rendus&quot; of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing &quot;Elements of Political Economy&quot; in 1821, a textbook to promote the ideas of Ricardian economics; however, the book lacked popular support. Ricardo, who was a close friend of his father, used to invite the young Mill to his house for a walk to talk about political economy.

At the age of fourteen, Mill stayed a year in France with the family of Sir Samuel Bentham, brother of Jeremy Bentham and in the company of George Ensor, then pursuing his polemic against the political economy of Thomas Malthus. The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In Montpellier, he attended the winter courses on chemistry, zoology, logic of the &quot;Faculté des Sciences&quot;, as well as taking a course in higher mathematics. While coming and going from France, he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist Jean-Baptiste Say, a friend of Mill&#x27;s father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party, as well as other notable Parisians, including Henri Saint-Simon.

Mill went through months of sadness and contemplated suicide at twenty years of age. According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V of his autobiography, he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society, his life&#x27;s objective, would actually make him happy. His heart answered &quot;no&quot;, and unsurprisingly he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective. Eventually, the poetry of William Wordsworth showed him that beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy. With renewed vigour, he continued to work towards a just society, but with more relish for the journey. He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking. In fact, many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy.

Mill met Thomas Carlyle during one of the latter&#x27;s visits to London in the early 1830s, and the two quickly became companions and correspondents. Mill offered to print Carlyle&#x27;s works at his own expense and encouraged Carlyle to write his &quot;French Revolution&quot;, supplying him with materials in order to do so. In March 1835, while the manuscript of the completed first volume was in Mill&#x27;s possession, Mill&#x27;s housemaid unwittingly used it as tinder, destroying all &quot;except some three or four bits of leaves&quot;. Mortified, Mill offered Carlyle £200 (£17,742.16 in 2021) as compensation (Carlyle would only accept £100). Ideological differences would put an end to the friendship during the 1840s, though Carlyle&#x27;s early influence on Mill would colour his later thought.

Mill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte&#x27;s &quot;sociologie&quot; was more an early philosophy of science than modern sociology is. Comte&#x27;s positivism motivated Mill to eventually reject Bentham&#x27;s psychological egoism and what he regarded as Bentham&#x27;s cold, abstract view of human nature focused on legislation and politics, instead coming to favour Comte&#x27;s more sociable view of human nature focused on historical facts and directed more towards human individuals in all their complexities.

As a nonconformist who refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, Mill was not eligible to study at the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge. Instead he followed his father to work for the East India Company, and attended University College, London, to hear the lectures of John Austin, the first Professor of Jurisprudence. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856.

Mill&#x27;s career as a colonial administrator at the East India Company spanned from when he was 17 years old in 1823 until 1858, when the company&#x27;s territories in India were directly annexed by the Crown, establishing direct Crown control over India. In 1836, he was promoted to the company&#x27;s political department, where he was responsible for correspondence pertaining to the company&#x27;s relations with the princely states, and, in 1856, was finally promoted to the position of Examiner of Indian Correspondence. In &quot;On Liberty&quot;, &quot;A Few Words on Non-Intervention&quot;, and other works, he opined that &quot;To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject.&quot; (However, Mill immediately added that &quot;A violation of the great principles of morality it may easily be.&quot;) Mill viewed places such as India as having once been progressive in their outlook, but had now become stagnant in their development; he opined that this meant these regions had to be ruled via a form of &quot;benevolent despotism...provided the end is improvement.&quot; When the Crown proposed to take direct control over the territories of the East India Company, Mill was tasked with defending Company rule and penned &quot;Memorandum on the Improvements in the Administration of India during the Last Thirty Years&quot;, among other petitions. He was offered a seat on the Council of India, the body created to advise the new Secretary of State for India, but declined, citing disapproval of the new system of administration in India.

On 21 April 1851, Mill married Harriet Taylor after 21 years of intimate friendship. Taylor was married when they met, and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died in 1849. The couple waited two years before marrying in 1851. Upon marriage, he made a declaration to repudiate the rights conferred upon him over her by virtue of the marriage under Victorian law. Accomplished in her own right, Taylor was a significant influence on Mill&#x27;s work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Taylor reinforced Mill&#x27;s advocacy of women&#x27;s rights. He said that in his stand against domestic violence, and for women&#x27;s rights he was &quot;chiefly an amanuensis to my wife&quot;. He called her mind a &quot;perfect instrument&quot;, and said she was &quot;the most eminently qualified of all those known to the author&quot;. He cites her influence in his final revision of &quot;On Liberty&quot;, which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe lung congestion, after only seven years of marriage to Mill.

Between the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews. At his inaugural address, delivered to the University on 1 February 1867, he made the now-famous (but often wrongly attributed) remark that &quot;Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.&quot; That Mill included that sentence in the address is a matter of historical record, but it by no means follows that it expressed a wholly original insight. During the same period, 1865–68, he was also a Member of Parliament (MP) for City of Westminster. He was sitting for the Liberal Party. During his time as an MP, Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland. In 1866, he became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote, vigorously defending this position in subsequent debate. He also became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In &quot;Considerations on Representative Government&quot;, he called for various reforms of Parliament and voting, especially proportional representation, the single transferable vote, and the extension of suffrage. In April 1868, he favoured in a Commons debate the retention of capital punishment for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition &quot;an effeminacy in the general mind of the country&quot;. (It is said in 1868, when his first term ended, no party would nominate him due to his independent spirit.)

He was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society in 1867.

He was godfather to the philosopher Bertrand Russell.

In his views on religion, Mill was an agnostic and a sceptic.

Like other philosophers of his time, Mill was interested in botany. It is believed that approximately 1,000 of his specimens are held by the Museum Requien in Avignon, France, and Mill&#x27;s stepdaughter Helen donated specimens to the Kew Herbarium after his death. In the southern hemisphere, there are also specimens at the National Herbarium of Victoria, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, Australia.

Mill died on 7 May 1873, at the age of 66, of erysipelas in Avignon, where his body was buried alongside his wife&#x27;s.

==Works and theories==

===&quot;A System of Logic&quot;===

Mill joined the debate over the scientific method which followed on from John Herschel&#x27;s 1830 publication of &quot;A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy&quot;, which incorporated inductive reasoning from the known to the unknown, discovering general laws in specific facts and verifying these laws empirically. William Whewell expanded on this in his 1837 &quot;History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time&quot;, followed in 1840 by &quot;The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon their History&quot;, presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths, which could be known without need for empirical verification.

Mill countered this in 1843 in &quot;A System of Logic&quot; (fully titled &quot;A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive, Being a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence, and the Methods of Scientific Investigation&quot;). In &quot;Mill&#x27;s Methods&quot; (of induction), as in Herschel&#x27;s, laws were discovered through observation and induction, and required empirical verification. Matilal remarks that Dignāga analysis is much like John Stuart Mill&#x27;s Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive. He suggested that it was very likely that during his stay in India he came across the tradition of logic, in which scholars started taking interest after 1824, though it is unknown whether it influenced his work.

===Theory of liberty===

Mill&#x27;s &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859) addresses the nature and limits of the power that can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. Mill&#x27;s idea is that only if a democratic society follows the Principle of Liberty can its political and social institutions fulfill their role of shaping national character so that its citizens can realise the permanent interests of people as progressive beings. (Rawls, Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy, p. 289)

Mill states the Principle of Liberty as: &quot;the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.&quot; &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.&quot;

One way to read Mill&#x27;s Principle of Liberty as a principle of public reason is to see it excluding certain kinds of reasons from being taken into account in legislation, or in guiding the moral coercion of public opinion. (Rawls, Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy, p. 291) These reasons include those founded in other persons good; reasons of excellence and ideals of human perfection; reasons of dislike or disgust, or of preference.

Mill states that &quot;harms&quot; which may be prevented include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus, failing to rescue a drowning child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay taxes, or failing to appear as a witness in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill. By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if—without force or fraud—the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved. He does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to sell themselves into slavery.

The question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. He did not consider giving offence to constitute &quot;harm&quot;; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society.
====Social liberty and tyranny of majority====
Mill believed that &quot;the struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history.&quot; For him, liberty in antiquity was a &quot;contest...between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government.&quot;

Mill defined &quot;social liberty&quot; as protection from &quot;the tyranny of political rulers&quot;. He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. &quot;Social liberty&quot; for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler&#x27;s power so that he would not be able to use that power to further his own wishes and thus make decisions that could harm society. In other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government&#x27;s decisions. He said that &quot;social liberty&quot; was &quot;the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.&quot; It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities (called &quot;political liberties&quot; or &quot;rights&quot;); and second, by establishment of a system of &quot;constitutional checks&quot;.

However, in Mill&#x27;s view, limiting the power of government was not enough:Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.

====Liberty====
Mill&#x27;s view on liberty, which was influenced by Joseph Priestley and Josiah Warren, is that individuals ought to be free to do as they wished unless they caused harm to others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well-being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained:

The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. ... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.

====Freedom of speech====
&quot;On Liberty&quot; involves an impassioned defence of free speech. Mill argues that free discourse is a necessary condition for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere dogma. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one. Along those same lines Mill wrote, &quot;unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them.&quot;

As an influential advocate of freedom of speech, Mill objected to censorship:

I choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me—in which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief in God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality. ... But I must be permitted to observe, that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question &quot;for others&quot;, without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However positive any one&#x27;s persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of the pernicious consequences–not only of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment, though backed by the public judgment of his country or his contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal.

Mill outlines the benefits of &quot;searching for and discovering the truth&quot; as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false, he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions. Worried about minority views being suppressed, he argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds, stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have to empower debate over public policy. He also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a person&#x27;s potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that eccentricity was preferable to uniformity and stagnation.

====Harm principle====
The belief that freedom of speech would advance society presupposed a society sufficiently culturally and institutionally advanced to be capable of progressive improvement. If any argument is really wrong or harmful, the public will judge it as wrong or harmful, and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government should not be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him, if rebellion is really necessary, people should rebel; if murder is truly proper, it should be allowed. However, the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing, not in a way that causes actual harm to others. Such is the &quot;harm principle&quot;: &quot;That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.&quot;

At the beginning of the 20th century, Associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of &quot;clear and present danger&quot; based on Mill&#x27;s idea. In the majority opinion, Holmes writes:

 The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.

Holmes suggested that falsely shouting out &quot;Fire!&quot; in a dark theatre, which evokes panic and provokes injury, would be such a case of speech that creates an illegal danger. But if the situation allows people to reason by themselves and decide to accept it or not, any argument or theology should not be blocked.

Here is Mill on the same topic: &quot;No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard&quot; (&quot;On LIberty&quot;, chapter 3). 

Mill&#x27;s argument is now generally accepted by many democratic countries, and they have laws at least guided by the harm principle. For example, in American law some exceptions limit free speech such as obscenity, defamation, breach of peace, and &quot;fighting words&quot;.

====Freedom of the press====

In &quot;On Liberty&quot;, Mill thought it was necessary for him to restate the case for press freedom. He considered that argument already won. Almost no politician or commentator in mid-19th-century Britain wanted a return to Tudor and Stuart-type press censorship. However, Mill warned new forms of censorship could emerge in the future. Indeed, in 2013 the Cameron Tory government considered setting up an independent official regulator of the UK press. This prompted demands for better basic legal protection of press freedom. A new British Bill of Rights could include a US-type constitutional ban on governmental infringement of press freedom and block other official attempts to control freedom of opinion and expression.

===Colonialism===
Mill was a member of Edward Gibbon Wakefield&#x27;s Colonization Society. In his &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; (1848) he praised Wakefield for his &quot;important writings on colonization&quot;.

Mill, an employee of the East India Company from 1823 to 1858, argued in support of what he called a &quot;benevolent despotism&quot; with regard to the administration of overseas colonies. Mill argued:To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error. ... To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject.

For Mill India was &quot;a burden&quot; for England and British colonialism &quot;a blessing of unspeakable magnitude to the population&quot; of India. He also stated his support for settler colonialism.

Mill expressed general support for Company rule in India, but expressed reservations on specific Company policies in India which he disagreed with.

He also supported colonialism in other places, such as Australia. Mill was among the founding members of the South Australian Association in 1833, which was set up to lobby the government to establish colonies in Australia.

===Slavery and racial equality===
In 1850, Mill sent an anonymous letter (which came to be known under the title &quot;The Negro Question&quot;), in rebuttal to Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s letter to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine for Town and Country&quot; in which Carlyle argued for slavery. Mill supported abolishing slavery in the United States, expressing his opposition to slavery in his essay of 1869, &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;:

This absolutely extreme case of the law of force, condemned by those who can tolerate almost every other form of arbitrary power, and which, of all others, presents features the most revolting to the feeling of all who look at it from an impartial position, was the law of civilized and Christian England within the memory of persons now living: and in one half of Anglo-Saxon America three or four years ago, not only did slavery exist, but the slave trade, and the breeding of slaves expressly for it, was a general practice between slave states. Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence.

Mill corresponded with John Appleton, an American legal reformer from Maine, extensively on the topic of racial equality. Appleton influenced Mill&#x27;s work on such, especially swaying him on the optimal economic and social welfare plan for the Antebellum South. In a letter sent to Appleton in response to a previous letter, Mill expressed his view on antebellum integration:I cannot look forward with satisfaction to any settlement but complete emancipation—land given to every negro family either separately or in organized communities under such rules as may be found temporarily necessary—the schoolmaster set to work in every village &amp; the tide of free immigration turned on in those fertile regions from which slavery has hitherto excluded it. If this be done, the gentle &amp; docile character which seems to distinguish the negroes will prevent any mischief on their side, while the proofs they are giving of fighting powers will do more in a year than all other things in a century to make the whites respect them &amp; consent to their being politically &amp; socially equals.Unlike many of his peers, Mill supported the Union in the American Civil War, seeing it as a necessary evil that would deliver a vital &quot;salutary shock&quot; to the national conscience and help preserve liberal ideals while eradicating the &quot;stain&quot; of slavery in the United States. Mill expressed his views in an article for &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, arguing against the defenders of the Confederate States of America.There are people who tell us that, on the side of the North, the question is not one of slavery at all. The North, it seems, have no more objection to slavery than the South have. [...] If this be the true state of the case, what are the Southern chiefs fighting about? Their apologists in England say that it is about tariffs, and similar trumpery. They say nothing of the kind. They tell the world, and they told their own citizens when they wanted their votes, that the object of the fight was slavery. [...] The world knows what the question between the North and South has been for many years, and still is. Slavery alone was thought of, alone talked of.

===Women&#x27;s rights===

Mill&#x27;s view of history was that right up until his time &quot;the whole of the female&quot; and &quot;the great majority of the male sex&quot; were simply &quot;slaves&quot;. He countered arguments to the contrary, arguing that relations between sexes simply amounted to &quot;the legal subordination of one sex to the other – [which] is wrong itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality.&quot; Here, then, we have an instance of Mill&#x27;s use of &quot;slavery&quot; in a sense which, compared to its fundamental meaning of absolute unfreedom of person, is an extended and arguably a rhetorical rather than a literal sense.

With this, Mill can be considered among the earliest male proponents of gender equality, having been recruited by American feminist John Neal during his stay in London circa 1825–1827. His book &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot; (1861, publ.1869) is one of the earliest written on this subject by a male author. In &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, Mill attempts to make a case for perfect equality.

In his proposal for a universal education system sponsored by the state, Mill expands benefits for many marginalized groups, especially for women. For Mill, a universal education held the potential to create new abilities and novel types of behaviour of which the current receiving generation and their descendants could both benefit from. Such a pathway to opportunity would enable women to gain &quot;industrial and social independence&quot; that would allow them the same movement in their agency and citizenship as men. Mill&#x27;s view of opportunity stands out in its reach, but even more so for the population he foresees who could benefit from it. Mill was hopeful of the autonomy such an education could allow for its recipients and especially for women. Through the consequential sophistication and knowledge attained, individuals are able to properly act in ways that recedes away from those leading towards overpopulation. This stands directly in contrast with the view held by many of Mill&#x27;s contemporaries and predecessors who viewed such inclusive programs to be counter-intuitive. Aiming such help at marginalized groups, such as the poor and working class, would only serve to reward them with the opportunity to move to a higher status, thus encouraging greater fertility which at its extreme could lead to overproduction.

He talks about the role of women in marriage and how it must be changed. Mill comments on three major facets of women&#x27;s lives that he felt are hindering them:

# society and gender construction;
# education; and
# marriage.

He argues that the oppression of women was one of the few remaining relics from ancient times, a set of prejudices that severely impeded the progress of humanity. As a Member of Parliament, Mill introduced an unsuccessful amendment to the Reform Bill to substitute the word &quot;person&quot; in place of &quot;man&quot;.

===&quot;Utilitarianism&quot;===
The canonical statement of Mill&#x27;s utilitarianism can be found in his book, &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;. Although this philosophy has a long tradition, Mill&#x27;s account is primarily influenced by Jeremy Bentham and Mill&#x27;s father James Mill.

John Stuart Mill believed in the philosophy of &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, which he would describe as the principle that holds &quot;that actions are right in the proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.&quot; By &quot;happiness&quot; he means, &quot;intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure&quot;. It is clear that we do not all value virtues as a path to happiness and that we sometimes only value them for selfish reasons. However, Mill asserts that upon reflection, even when we value virtues for selfish reasons we are in fact cherishing them as a part of our happiness.

Bentham&#x27;s famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the &quot;greatest-happiness principle&quot;. It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason. In a similar vein, Mill&#x27;s method of determining the best utility is that a moral agent, when given the choice between two or more actions, ought to choose the action that contributes most to (maximizes) the total happiness in the world. &quot;Happiness&quot;, in this context, is understood as the production of pleasure or privation of pain. Given that determining the action that produces the most utility is not always so clear cut, Mill suggests that the utilitarian moral agent, when attempting to rank the utility of different actions, should refer to the general experience of persons. That is, if people generally experience more happiness following action &quot;X&quot; than they do action &quot;Y&quot;, the utilitarian should conclude that action &quot;X&quot; produces more utility than action &quot;Y&quot;, and so is to be preferred.

Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory, meaning that it holds that acts are justified insofar as they produce a desirable outcome. The overarching goal of utilitarianism—the ideal consequence—is to achieve the &quot;greatest good for the greatest number as the result of human action&quot;. In &quot;Utilitarianism,&quot; Mill states that &quot;happiness is the sole end of human action.&quot; This statement aroused some controversy, which is why Mill took it a step further, explaining how the very nature of humans wanting happiness, and who &quot;take it to be reasonable under free consideration&quot;, demands that happiness is indeed desirable. In other words, free will leads everyone to make actions inclined on their own happiness, unless reasoned that it would improve the happiness of others, in which case, the greatest utility is still being achieved. To that extent, the &quot;utilitarianism&quot; that Mill is describing is a default lifestyle that he believes is what people who have not studied a specific opposing field of ethics would naturally and unconsciously use when faced with a decision.

Utilitarianism is thought of by some of its activists to be a more developed and overarching ethical theory of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s belief in goodwill, and not just some default cognitive process of humans. Where Kant (1724–1804) would argue that reason can only be used properly by goodwill, Mill would say that the only way to universally create fair laws and systems would be to step back to the consequences, whereby Kant&#x27;s ethical theories become based around the ultimate good—utility. By this logic the only valid way to discern what is the proper reason would be to view the consequences of any action and weigh the good and the bad, even if on the surface, the ethical reasoning seems to indicate a different train of thought.

==== Higher and lower pleasures ====
Mill&#x27;s major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (&quot;higher pleasures&quot;) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (&quot;lower pleasures&quot;). He distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that, &quot;it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.&quot;

This made Mill believe that &quot;our only ultimate end&quot; is happiness. One unique part of his utilitarian view, that is not seen in others, is the idea of higher and lower pleasures. Mill explains the different pleasures as:

He defines &quot;higher pleasures&quot; as mental, moral, and aesthetic pleasures, and &quot;lower pleasures&quot; as being more sensational. He believed that higher pleasures should be seen as preferable to lower pleasures since they have a greater quality in virtue. He holds that pleasures gained in activity are of a higher quality than those gained passively.

Mill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is, perhaps, in direct contrast with Bentham&#x27;s statement that &quot;Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry&quot;, that, if a simple child&#x27;s game like hopscotch causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house, it is more incumbent upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mill&#x27;s argument is that the &quot;simple pleasures&quot; tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to judge. He also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practise philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agent&#x27;s own greatest happiness that matters &quot;but the greatest amount of happiness altogether&quot;.

====Chapters====
Mill separated his explanation of Utilitarianism into five different sections:

# General Remarks;
# What Utilitarianism Is;
# Of the Ultimate Sanction of the Principle of Utility;
# Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible; and
# Of the Connection between Justice and Utility.

In the &quot;General Remarks&quot; portion of his essay, he speaks how next to no progress has been made when it comes to judging what is right and what is wrong of morality and if there is such a thing as moral instinct (which he argues that there may not be). However, he agrees that in general &quot;Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments.&quot;

In &quot;What Utilitarianism Is&quot;, he focuses no longer on background information but utilitarianism itself. He quotes utilitarianism as &quot;the greatest happiness principle&quot;, defining this theory by saying that pleasure and no pain are the only inherently good things in the world and expands on it by saying that &quot;actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.&quot; He views it not as an animalistic concept because he sees seeking out pleasure as a way of using our higher facilities. He also says in this chapter that the happiness principle is based not exclusively on the individual but mainly on the community.

Mill also defends the idea of a &quot;strong utilitarian conscience (i.e. a strong feeling of obligation to the general happiness)&quot;. He argued that humans have a desire to be happy and that that desire causes us to want to be in unity with other humans. This causes us to care about the happiness of others, as well as the happiness of complete strangers. But this desire also causes us to experience pain when we perceive harm to other people. He believes in internal sanctions that make us experience guilt and appropriate our actions. These internal sanctions make us want to do good because we do not want to feel guilty for our actions. Happiness is our ultimate end because it is our duty. He argues that we do not need to be constantly motivated by the concern of people&#x27;s happiness because most of the actions done by people are done out of good intention, and the good of the world is made up of the good of the people.

In Mill&#x27;s fourth chapter, &quot;Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible&quot;, he speaks of what proofs of Utility are affected. He starts this chapter off by saying that all of his claims cannot be backed up by reasoning. He claims that the only proof that something brings one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next, he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that &quot;it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired disinterestedly, for itself.&quot; In his final chapter he looks at the connection between utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for utility, but in others, social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that &quot;justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case.&quot;

The qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. As he suggests in that text, utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity &quot;as a progressive being&quot;, which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a &quot;higher mode of existence&quot;. The rejection of censorship and paternalism is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities.

Mill redefines the definition of happiness as &quot;the ultimate end, for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments.&quot; He firmly believed that moral rules and obligations could be referenced to promoting happiness, which connects to having a noble character. While Mill is not a standard act utilitarian or rule utilitarian, he is a minimizing utilitarian, which &quot;affirms that it would be &quot;desirable&quot; to maximize happiness for the greatest number, but not that we are morally &quot;required&quot; to do so.&quot;

===Achieving happiness===
Mill believed that for the majority of people (those with but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment) happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on one&#x27;s happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would &quot;inhale happiness with the air you breathe.&quot;

===Economic philosophy===

Mill&#x27;s early economic philosophy was one of free markets. However, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare. He originally believed that &quot;equality of taxation&quot; meant &quot;equality of sacrifice&quot; and that progressive taxation penalized those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore &quot;a mild form of robbery&quot;.

Given an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that inheritance should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes—some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.

Later he altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit altered in the third edition of the &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on &quot;unearned&quot; incomes, which he favoured, and those on &quot;earned&quot; incomes, which he did not favour.

In his autobiography, Mill stated that in relation to his later views on political economy, his &quot;ideal of ultimate improvement... would class [him] decidedly under the general designation of Socialists.&quot; His views shifted partly due to reading the works of utopian socialists, but also from the influence of Harriet Taylor. In his 1879 work &quot;Socialism&quot;, Mill argued that the prevalence of poverty in contemporary industrial capitalist societies was &quot;&quot;pro tanto&quot; a failure of the social arrangements&quot;, and that attempts to condone this state of affairs as being the result of individual failings did not represent a justification of them but instead were &quot;an irresistible claim upon every human being for protection against suffering&quot;.

Mill&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot;, first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period. As Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; had during an earlier period, &quot;Principles&quot; came to dominate economics teaching. In the case of Oxford University it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Economics&quot;.

==== Criticism ====
Karl Marx, in his critique of political economy, mentioned Mill in the &quot;Grundrisse&quot;. Marx contended that Mill&#x27;s thinking posited the categories of capital in an ahistorical fashion.

====Economic democracy====
Mill&#x27;s main objection to socialism focused on what he saw as its destruction of competition. He wrote, &quot;[W]hile I agree and sympathize with socialists in this practical portion of their aims, I utterly dissent from the most conspicuous and vehement part of their teaching—their declamations against competition.&quot; Though he was an egalitarian, Mill argued more for equal opportunity and placed meritocracy above all other ideals in this regard. He further argued that a socialist society would only be attainable through the provision of basic education for all, promoting economic democracy instead of capitalism, in the manner of substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives. He says:

====Political democracy====
Mill&#x27;s major work on political democracy, &quot;Considerations on Representative Government&quot;, defends two fundamental principles: extensive participation by citizens and enlightened competence of rulers. The two values are obviously in tension, and some readers have concluded that he is an elitist democrat, while others count him as an earlier participatory democrat. In one section, he appears to defend a type of plural voting where more competent citizens are given extra votes (a view he later repudiated). However, in another chapter he argues cogently for the value of participation by all citizens. He believed that the incompetence of the masses could eventually be overcome if they were given a chance to take part in politics, especially at the local level.

Mill is one of the few political philosophers ever to serve in government as an elected official. In his three years in Parliament, he was more willing to compromise than the &quot;radical&quot; principles expressed in his writing would lead one to expect.

Mill was a major proponent of the diffusion and use of public education to the working class. He saw the value of the individual person, and believed that &quot;man had the inherent capability of guiding his own destiny-but only if his faculties were developed and fulfilled&quot;, which could be achieved through education. He regarded education as a pathway to improve human nature which to him meant &quot;to encourage, among other characteristics, diversity and originality, the energy of character, initiative, autonomy, intellectual cultivation, aesthetic sensibility, non-self-regarding interests, prudence, responsibility, and self-control.&quot; Education allowed for humans to develop into full informed citizens that had the tools to improve their condition and make fully informed electoral decisions. The power of education lay in its ability to serve as a great equalizer among the classes allowing the working class the ability to control their own destiny and compete with the upper classes. Mill recognised the paramount importance of public education in avoiding the tyranny of the majority by ensuring that all the voters and political participants were fully developed individuals. It was through education, he believed, that an individual could become a full participant within representative democracy.

In regards to higher education, Mill defended liberal education against contemporary arguments for models of higher education focused on religion or science. His 1867 St. Andrews Address called on elites educated in reformed universities to work towards education policy committed to liberal principles.

====Theories of wealth and income distribution====
In &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;, Mill offered an analysis of two economic phenomena often linked together: the laws of production and wealth and the modes of its distribution. Regarding the former, he believed that it was not possible to alter to laws of production, &quot;the ultimate properties of matter and mind... only to employ these properties to bring about events we are interested.&quot; The modes of distribution of wealth is a matter of human institutions solely, starting with what Mill believed to be the primary and fundamental institution: Individual Property. He believed that all individuals must start on equal terms, with division of the instruments of production fairly among all members of society. Once each member has an equal amount of individual property, they must be left to their own exertion not to be interfered with by the state. Regarding inequality of wealth, Mill believed that it was the role of the government to establish both social and economic policies that promote the equality of opportunity.

The government, according to Mill, should implement three tax policies to help alleviate poverty:

# fairly assessed income tax;
# an inheritance tax; and
# a policy to restrict sumptuary consumption.

Inheritance of capital and wealth plays a large role in development of inequality, because it provides greater opportunity for those receiving the inheritance. Mill&#x27;s solution to inequality of wealth brought about by inheritance was to implement a greater tax on inheritances, because he believed the most important authoritative function of the government is taxation, and taxation judiciously implemented could promote equality.

====The environment====
In Book IV, chapter VI of &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot;: &quot;Of the Stationary State&quot;, Mill recognised wealth beyond the material and argued that the logical conclusion of unlimited growth was destruction of the environment and a reduced quality of life. He concluded that a stationary state could be preferable to unending economic growth:

I cannot, therefore, regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school.

If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it.

====Rate of profit====
According to Mill, the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate.

<doc id="15627" wikidata="Q1373356" url="?curid=15627" title="Junk science">
<text>Junk science is or fraudulent scientific data, research, or analysis. The concept is often invoked in political and legal contexts where facts and scientific results have a great amount of weight in making a determination. It usually conveys a pejorative connotation that the research has been untowardly driven by political, ideological, financial, or otherwise unscientific motives.

The concept was popularized in the 1990s in relation to expert testimony in civil litigation. More recently, invoking the concept has been a tactic to criticize research on the harmful environmental or public health effects of corporate activities, and occasionally in response to such criticism.

In some contexts, junk science is counterposed to the &quot;sound science&quot; or &quot;solid science&quot; that favors one&#x27;s own point of view. Junk science has been criticized for undermining public trust in real science. Junk science is not the same as pseudoscience.

==Definition==
Junk science has been defined as:

* &quot;science done to establish a preconceived notion—not to test the notion, which is what proper science tries to do, but to establish it regardless of whether or not it would hold up to real testing.&quot; 
* &quot;opinion posing as empirical evidence, or through evidence of questionable warrant, based on inadequate scientific methodology.&quot;
* &quot;methodologically sloppy research conducted to advance some extrascientific agenda or to prevail in litigation.&quot;

== Motivations ==
Junk science happens for different reasons: researchers believing that their ideas are correct before proper analysis (a sort of scientific self-delusion or drinking the Kool-Aid), researchers biased with their study designs, and/or a &quot;plain old lack of ethics&quot;. Being overly attached to one&#x27;s own ideas can cause research to veer from ordinary junk science (e.g., designing an experiment that is expected to produce the desired results) into scientific fraud (e.g., lying about the results) and pseudoscience (e.g., claiming that the unfavorable results actually proved the idea correct).

Junk science can occur when the perpetrator has something to gain from arriving at the desired conclusion. It can often happen in the testimony of expert witnesses in legal proceedings, and especially in the self-serving advertising of products and services. These situations may encourage researchers to make sweeping or overstated claims based on limited evidence.

==History==
The phrase &quot;junk science&quot; appears to have been in use prior to 1985. A 1985 United States Department of Justice report by the Tort Policy Working Group noted:
The use of such invalid scientific evidence (commonly referred to as &#x27;junk science&#x27;) has resulted in findings of causation which simply cannot be justified or understood from the standpoint of the current state of credible scientific or medical knowledge.

In 1989, the climate scientist Jerry Mahlman (Director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) characterized the theory that global warming was due to solar variation (presented in &quot;Scientific Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem&quot; by Frederick Seitz et al.) as &quot;noisy junk science.&quot;

Peter W. Huber popularized the term with respect to litigation in his 1991 book &quot;Galileo&#x27;s Revenge: Junk Science in the Courtroom.&quot; The book has been cited in over 100 legal textbooks and references; as a consequence, some sources cite Huber as the first to coin the term. By 1997, the term had entered the legal lexicon as seen in an opinion by Supreme Court of the United States Justice John Paul Stevens:
An example of &#x27;junk science&#x27; that should be excluded under the Daubert standard as too unreliable would be the testimony of a phrenologist who would purport to prove a defendant&#x27;s future dangerousness based on the contours of the defendant&#x27;s skull. Lower courts have subsequently set guidelines for identifying junk science, such as the 2005 opinion of United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook:
Positive reports about magnetic water treatment are not replicable; this plus the lack of a physical explanation for any effects are hallmarks of junk science.

As the subtitle of Huber&#x27;s book, &quot;Junk Science in the Courtroom&quot;, suggests, his emphasis was on the use or misuse of expert testimony in civil litigation. One prominent example cited in the book was litigation over casual contact in the spread of AIDS. A California school district sought to prevent a young boy with AIDS, Ryan Thomas, from attending kindergarten. The school district produced an expert witness, Steven Armentrout, who testified that a possibility existed that AIDS could be transmitted to schoolmates through yet undiscovered &quot;vectors&quot;. However, five experts testified on behalf of Thomas that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact, and the court affirmed the &quot;solid science&quot; (as Huber called it) and rejected Armentrout&#x27;s argument.

In 1999, Paul Ehrlich and others advocated public policies to improve the dissemination of valid environmental scientific knowledge and discourage junk science:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports offer an antidote to junk science by articulating the current consensus on the prospects for climate change, by outlining the extent of the uncertainties, and by describing the potential benefits and costs of policies to address climate change.

In a 2003 study about changes in environmental activism regarding the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, Pedynowski noted that junk science can undermine the credibility of science over a much broader scale because misrepresentation by special interests casts doubt on more defensible claims and undermines the credibility of all research.

In his 2006 book &quot;Junk Science&quot;, Dan Agin emphasized two main causes of junk science: fraud, and ignorance. In the first case, Agin discussed falsified results in the development of organic transistors:
As far as understanding junk science is concerned, the important aspect is that both Bell Laboratories and the international physics community were fooled until someone noticed that noise records published by Jan Hendrik Schön in several papers were identical—which means physically impossible.

In the second case, he cites an example that demonstrates ignorance of statistical principles in the lay press:
Since no such proof is possible [that genetically modified food is harmless], the article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; was what is called a &quot;bad rap&quot; against the U.S. Department of Agriculture—a bad rap based on a junk-science belief that it&#x27;s possible to prove a null hypothesis.

Agin asks the reader to step back from the rhetoric, as &quot;how things are labeled does not make a science junk science.&quot; In its place, he offers that junk science is ultimately motivated by the desire to hide undesirable truths from the public.

The rise of open source (free to read) journals has resulted in economic pressure on academic publishers to publish junk science. Even when the journal is peer-reviewed, the authors, rather than the readers, become the customer and the source of funding for the journal, so the publisher is incentivized to publish as many papers as possible, including those that are methodologically unsound.

==Misuse in public relations==

John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton of &quot;PR Watch&quot; say the concept of junk science has come to be invoked in attempts to dismiss scientific findings that stand in the way of short-term corporate profits. In their book &quot;Trust Us, We&#x27;re Experts&quot; (2001), they write that industries have launched multimillion-dollar campaigns to position certain theories as junk science in the popular mind, often failing to employ the scientific method themselves. For example, the tobacco industry has described research demonstrating the harmful effects of smoking and second-hand smoke as junk science, through the vehicle of various astroturf groups.

Theories more favorable to corporate activities are portrayed in words as &quot;sound science&quot;. Past examples where &quot;sound science&quot; was used include the research into the toxicity of Alar, which was heavily criticized by antiregulatory advocates, and Herbert Needleman&#x27;s research into low dose lead poisoning. Needleman was accused of fraud and personally attacked.

Fox News commentator Steven Milloy often denigrates credible scientific research on topics like global warming, ozone depletion, and passive smoking as &quot;junk science&quot;. The credibility of Milloy&#x27;s website junkscience.com was questioned by Paul D. Thacker, a writer for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, in the wake of evidence that Milloy had received funding from Philip Morris, RJR Tobacco, and Exxon Mobil. Thacker also noted that Milloy was receiving almost $100,000 a year in consulting fees from Philip Morris while he criticized the evidence regarding the hazards of second-hand smoke as junk science. Following the publication of this article, the Cato Institute, which had hosted the junkscience.com site, ceased its association with the site and removed Milloy from its list of adjunct scholars.

Tobacco industry documents reveal that Philip Morris executives conceived of the &quot;Whitecoat Project&quot; in the 1980s as a response to emerging scientific data on the harmfulness of second-hand smoke. The goal of the Whitecoat Project, as conceived by Philip Morris and other tobacco companies, was to use ostensibly independent &quot;scientific consultants&quot; to spread doubt in the public mind about scientific data through invoking concepts like junk science. According to epidemiologist David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environment, Safety, and Health in the Clinton Administration, the tobacco industry invented the &quot;sound science&quot; movement in the 1980s as part of their campaign against the regulation of second-hand smoke.

David Michaels has argued that, since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&quot;, lay judges have become &quot;gatekeepers&quot; of scientific testimony and, as a result, respected scientists have sometimes been unable to provide testimony so that corporate defendants are &quot;increasingly emboldened&quot; to accuse adversaries of practicing junk science.

== Notable cases ==
American psychologist Paul Cameron has been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as an anti-gay extremist and a purveyor of &quot;junk science&quot;. Cameron&#x27;s research has been heavily criticized for unscientific methods and distortions which attempt to link homosexuality with pedophilia. In one instance, Cameron claimed that lesbians are 300 times more likely to get into car accidents. The SPLC states his work has been continually cited in some sections of the media despite being discredited. Cameron was expelled from the American Psychological Association in 1983.

==Combatting junk science==
In 1995, the Union of Concerned Scientists launched the Sound Science Initiative, a national network of scientists committed to debunking junk science through media outreach, lobbying, and developing joint strategies to participate in town meetings or public hearings. In its newsletter on Science and Technology in Congress, the American Association for the Advancement of Science also recognized the need for increased understanding between scientists and lawmakers: &quot;Although most individuals would agree that sound science is preferable to junk science, fewer recognize what makes a scientific study &#x27;good&#x27; or &#x27;bad&#x27;.&quot; The American Dietetic Association, criticizing marketing claims made for food products, has created a list of &quot;Ten Red Flags of Junk Science&quot;.

<doc id="15630" wikidata="Q7324" url="?curid=15630" title="James Cook">
<text>Captain James Cook ( – 14 February 1779) was a British explorer, cartographer, and naval officer famous for his three voyages between 1768 and 1779 in the Pacific Ocean and to New Zealand and Australia in particular. He made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand.

Cook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He served during the Seven Years&#x27; War and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the St. Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec, which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and the Royal Society. This acclaim came at a crucial moment for the direction of British overseas exploration, and it led to his commission in 1768 as commander of for the first of three Pacific voyages.

In these voyages, Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously charted by Western explorers. He surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage, and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions.

In January 1778, while en route to explore the Pacific coast of North America on his third voyage, Cook became the first known European to encounter the Hawaiian islands. He returned to Hawaii the following year and was killed when a dispute with indigenous Hawaiians turned violent. Cook left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge that influenced his successors well into the 20th century, and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him. He remains controversial for his occasionally violent encounters with indigenous peoples and there is debate on whether he can be held responsible for paving the way for British imperialism and colonialism.

==Early life and family==
James Cook was born on in the village of Marton in the North Riding of Yorkshire and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the parish church of St Cuthbert, where his name can be seen in the church register. He was the second of eight children of James Cook (1693–1779), a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace (1702–1765), from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father&#x27;s employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years of schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. Despite not being formally educated, he became capable in mathematics, astronomy and charting by the time of his &quot;Endeavour&quot; voyage. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude.

In 1745, when he was 16, Cook moved to the fishing village of Staithes, to be apprenticed as a shop boy to grocer and haberdasher William Sanderson. Historian Vanessa Collingridge has speculated that this is where Cook first felt the lure of the sea while gazing out of the shop window.
After 18 months, not proving suited for shop work, Cook travelled to the nearby port town of Whitby to be introduced to Sanderson&#x27;s friends John and Henry Walker. The Walkers, who were Quakers, were prominent local ship-owners in the coal trade. Their house is now the Captain Cook Memorial Museum. Cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels, plying coal along the English coast. His first assignment was aboard the collier &quot;Freelove&quot;, and he spent several years on this and various other coasters, sailing between the Tyne and London. As part of his apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, navigation and astronomy – all skills he would need one day to command his own ship.

His three-year apprenticeship completed, Cook began working on merchant ships in the Baltic Sea. After passing his examinations in 1752, he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks, starting with his promotion in that year to mate aboard the collier brig &quot;Friendship&quot;. In 1755, within a month of being offered command of this vessel, he volunteered for service in the Royal Navy, when Britain was re-arming for what was to become the Seven Years&#x27; War. Despite the need to start back at the bottom of the naval hierarchy, Cook realised his career would advance more quickly in military service and entered the Navy at Wapping on 17 June 1755.

Cook married Elizabeth Batts, the daughter of Samuel Batts, keeper of the Bell Inn in Wapping and one of his mentors, on 21 December 1762 at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Barking, Essex. The couple had six children: James (1763–1794), Nathaniel (1764–1780, lost aboard which foundered with all hands in a hurricane in the West Indies), Elizabeth (1767–1771), Joseph (1768–1768), George (1772–1772) and Hugh (1776–1793, who died of scarlet fever while a student at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge). When not at sea, Cook lived in the East End of London. He attended St Paul&#x27;s Church, Shadwell, where his son James was baptised. Cook has no direct descendants – all of his children died before having children of their own.

Sir Walter Besant, a biographer of Cook, described Cook as being &quot;over six feet high&quot; with &quot;dark brown hair&quot;, &quot;bushy eyebrows&quot;, and &quot;small brown eyes&quot;.

==Start of Royal Navy career==
Cook&#x27;s first posting was with , serving as able seaman and master&#x27;s mate under Captain Joseph Hamar for his first year aboard, and Captain Hugh Palliser thereafter. In October and November 1755, he took part in &quot;Eagle&quot;&#x27;s capture of one French warship and the sinking of another, following which he was promoted to boatswain in addition to his other duties. His first temporary command was in March 1756 when he was briefly master of &quot;Cruizer&quot;, a small cutter attached to &quot;Eagle&quot; while on patrol.

In June 1757, Cook formally passed his master&#x27;s examinations at Trinity House, Deptford, qualifying him to navigate and handle a ship of the King&#x27;s fleet. He then joined the frigate HMS &quot;Solebay&quot; as master under Captain Robert Craig.

===Canada===
During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Cook served in North America as master aboard the fourth-rate Navy vessel . With others in &quot;Pembroke&quot;″s crew, he took part in the major amphibious assault that captured the Fortress of Louisbourg from the French in 1758, and in the siege of Quebec City in 1759. Throughout his service he demonstrated a talent for surveying and cartography and was responsible for mapping much of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River during the siege, thus allowing General Wolfe to make his famous stealth attack during the 1759 Battle of the Plains of Abraham.

Cook&#x27;s surveying ability was also put to use in mapping the jagged coast of Newfoundland in the 1760s, aboard . He surveyed the northwest stretch in 1763 and 1764, the south coast between the Burin Peninsula and Cape Ray in 1765 and 1766, and the west coast in 1767. At this time, Cook employed local pilots to point out the &quot;rocks and hidden dangers&quot; along the south and west coasts. During the 1765 season, four pilots were engaged at a daily pay of 4 shillings each: John Beck for the coast west of &quot;Great St Lawrence&quot;, Morgan Snook for Fortune Bay, John Dawson for Connaigre and Hermitage Bay, and John Peck for the &quot;Bay of Despair&quot;.

While in Newfoundland, Cook also conducted astronomical observations, in particular of the eclipse of the sun on 5 August 1766. By obtaining an accurate estimate of the time of the start and finish of the eclipse, and comparing these with the timings at a known position in England, it was possible to calculate the longitude of the observation site in Newfoundland. This result was communicated to the Royal Society in 1767.

His five seasons in Newfoundland produced the first large-scale and accurate maps of the island&#x27;s coasts and were the first scientific, large-scale, hydrographic surveys to use precise triangulation to establish land outlines. They also gave Cook his mastery of practical surveying, achieved under often adverse conditions, and brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and Royal Society at a crucial moment both in his career and in the direction of British overseas discovery. Cook&#x27;s maps were used into the 20th century, with copies being referenced by those sailing Newfoundland&#x27;s waters for 200 years.

Following his exertions in Newfoundland, Cook wrote that he intended to go not only &quot;farther than any man has been before me, but as far as I think it is possible for a man to go&quot;.

==First voyage (1768–1771)==
On 25 May 1768, the Admiralty commissioned Cook to command a scientific voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The purpose of the voyage was to observe and record the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun which, when combined with observations from other places, would help to determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Cook, at age 39, was promoted to lieutenant to grant him sufficient status to take the command. For its part, the Royal Society agreed that Cook would receive a one hundred guinea gratuity in addition to his Naval pay.

The expedition sailed aboard , departing England on 26 August 1768. Cook and his crew rounded Cape Horn and continued westward across the Pacific, arriving at Tahiti on 13 April 1769, where the observations of the transit were made. However, the result of the observations was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped. Once the observations were completed, Cook opened the sealed orders, which were additional instructions from the Admiralty for the second part of his voyage: to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated rich southern continent of &quot;Terra Australis&quot;.
Cook then sailed to New Zealand where he mapped the complete coastline, making only some minor errors. With the aid of Tupaia, a Tahitian priest who had joined the expedition, Cook was the first European to communicate with the Māori. However, at least eight Māori were killed in violent encounters. Cook then voyaged west, reaching the southeastern coast of Australia near today&#x27;s Point Hicks on 19 April 1770, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline.On 23 April, he made his first recorded direct observation of Aboriginal Australians at Brush Island near Bawley Point, noting in his journal: &quot;... and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea beach they appear&#x27;d to be of a very dark or black Colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the C[l]othes they might have on I know not.&quot; 

&quot;Endeavour&quot; continued northwards along the coastline, keeping the land in sight with Cook charting and naming landmarks as he went. On 29 April, Cook and crew made their first landfall on the continent at a beach now known as Silver Beach on Botany Bay (Kamay Botany Bay National Park). Two Gweagal men of the Dharawal / Eora nation opposed their landing and in the confrontation one of them was shot and wounded.

Cook and his crew stayed at Botany Bay for a week, collecting water, timber, fodder and botanical specimens and exploring the surrounding area. Cook sought to establish relations with the Indigenous population without success. At first Cook named the inlet &quot;Sting-Ray Harbour&quot; after the many stingrays found there. This was later changed to &quot;Botanist Bay&quot; and finally &quot;Botany Bay&quot; after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander. This first landing site was later to be promoted (particularly by Joseph Banks) as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and British colonial outpost.After his departure from Botany Bay, he continued northwards. He stopped at Bustard Bay (now known as Seventeen Seventy) on 23 May 1770. On 24 May, Cook and Banks and others went ashore. Continuing north, on 11 June a mishap occurred when &quot;Endeavour&quot; ran aground on a shoal of the Great Barrier Reef, and then &quot;nursed into a river mouth on 18 June 1770&quot;. The ship was badly damaged, and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern Cooktown, Queensland, at the mouth of the Endeavour River). The crew&#x27;s encounters with the local Aboriginal people were mostly peaceful, although following a dispute over green turtles Cook ordered shots to be fired and one local was lightly wounded.

The voyage then continued and at about midday on 22 August 1770, they reached the northernmost tip of the coast and, without leaving the ship, Cook named it York Cape (now Cape York). Leaving the east coast, Cook turned west and nursed his battered ship through the dangerously shallow waters of Torres Strait. Searching for a vantage point, Cook saw a steep hill on a nearby island from the top of which he hoped to see &quot;a passage into the Indian Seas&quot;. Cook named the island Possession Island, where he claimed the entire coastline that he had just explored as British territory. 

===Return to England===
Cook returned to England via Batavia (modern Jakarta, Indonesia), where many in his crew succumbed to malaria, and then the Cape of Good Hope, arriving at the island of Saint Helena on 30 April 1771. The ship finally returned to England on 12 July 1771, anchoring in The Downs, with Cook going to Deal.

===Interlude===
Cook&#x27;s journals were published upon his return, and he became something of a hero among the scientific community. Among the general public, however, the aristocratic botanist Joseph Banks was a greater hero. Banks even attempted to take command of Cook&#x27;s second voyage but removed himself from the voyage before it began, and Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg Forster were taken on as scientists for the voyage. Cook&#x27;s son George was born five days before he left for his second voyage.

==Second voyage (1772–1775)==

Shortly after his return from the first voyage, Cook was promoted in August 1771 to the rank of commander. In 1772, he was commissioned to lead another scientific expedition on behalf of the Royal Society, to search for the hypothetical Terra Australis. On his first voyage, Cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating New Zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south. Although he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia, showing it to be continental in size, the Terra Australis was believed to lie further south. Despite this evidence to the contrary, Alexander Dalrymple and others of the Royal Society still believed that a massive southern continent should exist.

Cook commanded on this voyage, while Tobias Furneaux commanded its companion ship, . Cook&#x27;s expedition circumnavigated the globe at an extreme southern latitude, becoming one of the first to cross the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773. In the Antarctic fog, &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; became separated. Furneaux made his way to New Zealand, where he lost some of his men during an encounter with Māori, and eventually sailed back to Britain, while Cook continued to explore the Antarctic, reaching 71°10&#x27;S on 31 January 1774.
Cook almost encountered the mainland of Antarctica but turned towards Tahiti to resupply his ship. He then resumed his southward course in a second fruitless attempt to find the supposed continent. On this leg of the voyage, he brought a young Tahitian named Omai, who proved to be somewhat less knowledgeable about the Pacific than Tupaia had been on the first voyage. On his return voyage to New Zealand in 1774, Cook landed at the Friendly Islands, Easter Island, Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, and Vanuatu.

Before returning to England, Cook made a final sweep across the South Atlantic from Cape Horn and surveyed, mapped, and took possession for Britain of South Georgia, which had been explored by the English merchant Anthony de la Roché in 1675. Cook also discovered and named Clerke Rocks and the South Sandwich Islands (&quot;Sandwich Land&quot;). He then turned north to South Africa and from there continued back to England. His reports upon his return home put to rest the popular myth of Terra Australis.
Cook&#x27;s second voyage marked a successful employment of Larcum Kendall&#x27;s K1 copy of John Harrison&#x27;s H4 marine chronometer, which enabled Cook to calculate his longitudinal position with much greater accuracy. Cook&#x27;s log was full of praise for this time-piece which he used to make charts of the southern Pacific Ocean that were so remarkably accurate that copies of them were still in use in the mid-20th century.

Upon his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of post-captain and given an honorary retirement from the Royal Navy, with a posting as an officer of the Greenwich Hospital. He reluctantly accepted, insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if an opportunity for active duty should arise. His fame extended beyond the Admiralty; he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded the Copley Gold Medal for completing his second voyage without losing a man to scurvy. Nathaniel Dance-Holland painted his portrait; he dined with James Boswell; he was described in the House of Lords as &quot;the first navigator in Europe&quot;. But he could not be kept away from the sea. A third voyage was planned, and Cook volunteered to find the Northwest Passage. He travelled to the Pacific and hoped to travel east to the Atlantic, while a simultaneous voyage travelled the opposite route.

==Third voyage (1776–1779)==
===Hawaii===
On his last voyage, Cook again commanded HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, while Captain Charles Clerke commanded . The voyage was ostensibly planned to return the Pacific Islander Omai to Tahiti, or so the public was led to believe. The trip&#x27;s principal goal was to locate a Northwest Passage around the American continent. After dropping Omai at Tahiti, Cook travelled north and in 1778 became the first European to begin formal contact with the Hawaiian Islands. After his initial landfall in January 1778 at Waimea harbour, Kauai, Cook named the archipelago the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot; after the fourth Earl of Sandwich—the acting First Lord of the Admiralty.

===North America===
From the Sandwich Islands, Cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He sighted the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming Cape Foulweather, after the bad weather which forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward. He unknowingly sailed past the Strait of Juan de Fuca and soon after entered Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. He anchored near the First Nations village of Yuquot. Cook&#x27;s two ships remained in Nootka Sound from 29 March to 26 April 1778, in what Cook called Ship Cove, now Resolution Cove, at the south end of Bligh Island. Relations between Cook&#x27;s crew and the people of Yuquot were cordial but sometimes strained. In trading, the people of Yuquot demanded much more valuable items than the usual trinkets that had been acceptable in Hawaii. Metal objects were much desired, but the lead, pewter, and tin traded at first soon fell into disrepute. The most valuable items which the British received in trade were sea otter pelts. During the stay, the Yuquot &quot;hosts&quot; essentially controlled the trade with the British vessels; the natives usually visited the British vessels at Resolution Cove instead of the British visiting the village of Yuquot at Friendly Cove.

After leaving Nootka Sound in search of the Northwest Passage, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the Bering Strait, on the way identifying what came to be known as Cook Inlet in Alaska. In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American northwest coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the west) and Spanish (from the south) exploratory probes of the northern limits of the Pacific.
By the second week of August 1778, Cook was through the Bering Strait, sailing into the Chukchi Sea. He headed northeast up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice at a latitude of 70°44′ north. Cook then sailed west to the Siberian coast, and then southeast down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. By early September 1778, he was back in the Bering Sea to begin the trip to the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. He became increasingly frustrated on this voyage and perhaps began to suffer from a stomach ailment; it has been speculated that this led to irrational behaviour towards his crew, such as forcing them to eat walrus meat, which they had pronounced inedible.

===Return to Hawaii===
Cook returned to Hawaii in 1779. After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at Kealakekua Bay on Hawai&#x27;i Island, the largest island in the Hawaiian Archipelago. Cook&#x27;s arrival coincided with the &quot;Makahiki&quot;, a Hawaiian harvest festival of worship for the Polynesian god Lono. Coincidentally the form of Cook&#x27;s ship, HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship. Similarly, Cook&#x27;s clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals. It has been argued (most extensively by Marshall Sahlins) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook&#x27;s (and to a limited extent, his crew&#x27;s) initial deification by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono. Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook&#x27;s expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, was challenged in 1992 by Gananath Obeyesekere in the so-called Sahlins–Obeyesekere debate.

===Death===

After a month&#x27;s stay, Cook attempted to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, &quot;Resolution&quot;″s foremast broke, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs.

Tensions rose, and quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians at Kealakekua Bay, including the theft of wood from a Hawaiian burial ground under Cook&#x27;s orders. On 13 February 1779, an unknown group of Hawaiians stole one of Cook&#x27;s cutters. By then the Hawaiian people had become &quot;insolent&quot;, even with threats to fire upon them. Cook responded to the theft by attempting to kidnap and ransom the &quot;Aliʻi nui&quot; (King) of Hawaii, Kalaniʻōpuʻu.

The following day, 14 February 1779, Cook and a small party marched through the village to retrieve the king. Cook led Kalaniʻōpuʻu away; as they got to the boats, one of Kalaniʻōpuʻu&#x27;s favourite wives, Kānekapōlei, and two chiefs approached the group. They pleaded with the king not to go and a large crowd began to form at the shore. News reached the Hawaiians that on the other side of the bay, high-ranking Hawaiian chief Kalimu had been shot whilst trying to break through a British blockade. This exacerbated the tense situation. As the Europeans launched the boats to leave, Cook was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kanaʻina) and then stabbed by one of the king&#x27;s attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others wounded in the confrontation.
===Aftermath===
The esteem which the islanders nevertheless held for Cook caused them to retain his body. Following their practice of the time, they prepared his body with funerary rituals usually reserved for the chiefs and highest elders of the society. The body was disembowelled and baked to facilitate removal of the flesh, and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation as religious icons in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the treatment of European saints in the Middle Ages. Some of Cook&#x27;s remains, thus preserved, were eventually returned to his crew for a formal burial at sea.

Clerke assumed leadership of the expedition and made a final attempt to pass through the Bering Strait. He died of tuberculosis on 22 August 1779 and John Gore, a veteran of Cook&#x27;s first voyage, took command of &quot;Resolution&quot; and of the expedition. James King replaced Gore in command of &quot;Discovery&quot;. The expedition returned home, reaching England in October 1780. After their arrival in England, King completed Cook&#x27;s account of the voyage.

==Legacy==

===Ethnographic collections===

The Australian Museum acquired its &quot;Cook Collection&quot; in 1894 from the Government of New South Wales. At that time the collection consisted of 115 artefacts collected on Cook&#x27;s three voyages throughout the Pacific Ocean, during the period 1768–1780, along with documents and memorabilia related to these voyages. Many of the ethnographic artefacts were collected at a time of first contact between Pacific Peoples and Europeans. In 1935 most of the documents and memorabilia were transferred to the Mitchell Library in the State Library of New South Wales. The provenance of the collection shows that the objects remained in the hands of Cook&#x27;s widow Elizabeth Cook, and her descendants, until 1886. In this year John Mackrell, the great-nephew of Isaac Smith, Elizabeth Cook&#x27;s cousin, organised the display of this collection at the request of the NSW Government at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London. In 1887 the London-based Agent-General for the New South Wales Government, Saul Samuel, bought John Mackrell&#x27;s items and also acquired items belonging to the other relatives Reverend Canon Frederick Bennett, Mrs Thomas Langton, H.M.C. Alexander, and William Adams. The collection remained with the Colonial Secretary of NSW until 1894, when it was transferred to the Australian Museum.

===Navigation and science===

Cook&#x27;s 12 years sailing around the Pacific Ocean contributed much to Europeans&#x27; knowledge of the area. Several islands, such as the Hawaiian group, were encountered for the first time by Europeans, and his more accurate navigational charting of large areas of the Pacific was a major achievement. To create accurate maps, latitude and longitude must be accurately determined. Navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a backstaff or quadrant. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the Earth. The Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the Sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes. Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage from his navigational skills, with the help of astronomer Charles Green, and by using the newly published &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; tables, via the lunar distance method – measuring the angular distance from the Moon to either the Sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the Sun, Moon, or stars.

On his second voyage, Cook used the K1 chronometer made by Larcum Kendall, which was the shape of a large pocket watch, in diameter. It was a copy of the H4 clock made by John Harrison, which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship &quot;Deptford&quot;″s journey to Jamaica in 1761–62. He succeeded in circumnavigating the world on his first voyage without losing a single man to scurvy, an unusual accomplishment at the time. He tested several preventive measures, most importantly the frequent replenishment of fresh food. For presenting a paper on this aspect of the voyage to the Royal Society he was presented with the Copley Medal in 1776. Cook became the first European to have extensive contact with various people of the Pacific. He correctly postulated a link among all the Pacific peoples, despite their being separated by great ocean stretches . Cook theorised that Polynesians originated from Asia, which scientist Bryan Sykes later verified. In New Zealand the coming of Cook is often used to signify the onset of the colonisation.
Cook carried several scientists on his voyages; they made significant observations and discoveries. Two botanists, Joseph Banks and the Swede Daniel Solander, sailed on the first voyage. The two collected over 3,000 plant species. Banks subsequently strongly promoted British settlement of Australia, leading to the establishment of New South Wales as a penal settlement in 1788. Artists also sailed on Cook&#x27;s first voyage. Sydney Parkinson was heavily involved in documenting the botanists&#x27; findings, completing 264 drawings before his death near the end of the voyage. They were of immense scientific value to British botanists. Cook&#x27;s second expedition included William Hodges, who produced notable landscape paintings of Tahiti, Easter Island, and other locations. Several officers who served under Cook went on to distinctive accomplishments. William Bligh, Cook&#x27;s sailing master, was given command of in 1787 to sail to Tahiti and return with breadfruit. Bligh became known for the mutiny of his crew, which resulted in his being set adrift in 1789. He later became Governor of New South Wales, where he was the subject of another mutiny—the 1808 Rum Rebellion. George Vancouver, one of Cook&#x27;s midshipmen, led a voyage of exploration to the Pacific Coast of North America from 1791 to 1794. In honour of Vancouver&#x27;s former commander, his ship was named . George Dixon, who sailed under Cook on his third expedition, later commanded his own. 

Cook&#x27;s contributions to knowledge gained international recognition during his lifetime. In 1779, while the American colonies were fighting Britain for their independence, Benjamin Franklin wrote to captains of colonial warships at sea, recommending that if they came into contact with Cook&#x27;s vessel, they were to &quot;not consider her an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of the effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate return to England by detaining her or sending her into any other part of Europe or to America; but that you treat the said Captain Cook and his people with all civility and kindness ... as common friends to mankind.&quot;

===Memorials===
A U.S. coin, the 1928 Hawaii Sesquicentennial half-dollar, carries Cook&#x27;s image. Minted for the 150th anniversary of his discovery of the islands, its low mintage (10,008) has made this example of an early United States commemorative coin both scarce and expensive. The site where he was killed in Hawaii was marked in 1874 by a white obelisk. This land, although in Hawaii, was deeded to the United Kingdom by Princess Likelike and her husband, Archibald Scott Cleghorn, to the British Consul to Hawaii, James Hay Wodehouse, in 1877. A nearby town is named Captain Cook, Hawaii; several Hawaiian businesses also carry his name. The Apollo 15 Command/Service Module &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the , and the Crew Dragon &quot;Endeavour&quot;; are named after Cook&#x27;s ship. Another Space Shuttle, &quot;Discovery&quot;, was named after Cook&#x27;s .

Cooks&#x27; Cottage, his parents&#x27; last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England at the behest of the Australian philanthropist Sir Russell Grimwade in 1934. The first institution of higher education in North Queensland, Australia, was named after him, with James Cook University opening in Townsville in 1970. Numerous institutions, landmarks and place names reflect the importance of Cook&#x27;s contributions, including the Cook Islands, Cook Strait, Cook Inlet and the Cook crater on the Moon. Aoraki / Mount Cook, the highest summit in New Zealand, is named for him. Another Mount Cook is on the border between the U.S. state of Alaska and the Canadian Yukon territory, and is designated Boundary Peak 182 as one of the official Boundary Peaks of the Hay–Herbert Treaty.

There are statues of Cook in Hyde Park in Sydney, and at St Kilda in Melbourne.

One of the earliest monuments to Cook in the United Kingdom is located at The Vache, erected in 1780 by Admiral Hugh Palliser, a contemporary of Cook and one-time owner of the estate. A large obelisk was built in 1827 as a monument to Cook on Easby Moor overlooking his boyhood village of Great Ayton, along with a smaller monument at the former location of Cook&#x27;s cottage. There is also a monument to Cook in the church of St Andrew the Great, St Andrew&#x27;s Street, Cambridge, where his sons Hugh, a student at Christ&#x27;s College, and James were buried. Cook&#x27;s widow Elizabeth was also buried in the church and in her will left money for the memorial&#x27;s upkeep. The 250th anniversary of Cook&#x27;s birth was marked at the site of his birthplace in Marton by the opening of the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum, located within Stewart Park (1978). A granite vase just to the south of the museum marks the approximate spot where he was born. Tributes also abound in post-industrial Middlesbrough, including a primary school, shopping square and the &quot;Bottle &#x27;O Notes&quot;, a public artwork by Claes Oldenburg, that was erected in the town&#x27;s Central Gardens in 1993. Also named after Cook is James Cook University Hospital, a major teaching hospital which opened in 2003 with a railway station serving it called James Cook opening in 2014. The Royal Research Ship RRS &quot;James Cook&quot; was built in 2006 to replace the RRS &quot;Charles Darwin&quot; in the UK&#x27;s Royal Research Fleet, and Stepney Historical Trust placed a plaque on Free Trade Wharf in the Highway, Shadwell to commemorate his life in the East End of London. A statue erected in his honour can be viewed near Admiralty Arch on the south side of The Mall in London. In 2002, Cook was placed at number 12 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.
In 1959, the Cooktown Re-enactment Association first performed a re-enactment of Cook&#x27;s 1770 landing at the site of modern Cooktown, Australia, and have continued the tradition each year, with the support and participation of many of the local Guugu Yimithirr people. They celebrate the first act of reconciliation between Indigenous Australians and non-Indigenous people, when a Guugu Yimithirr elder stepped in after some of Cook&#x27;s men had violated custom by taking green turtles from the river and not sharing with the local people. He presented Cook with a broken-tipped spear as a peace offering, thus preventing possible bloodshed. Cook recorded the incident in his journal.

===Culture===
Cook was a subject in many literary creations. Letitia Elizabeth Landon, a popular poet known for her sentimental romantic poetry, published a poetical illustration to a portrait of Captain Cook in 1837. In 1931, Kenneth Slessor&#x27;s poem &quot;Five Visions of Captain Cook&quot; was the &quot;most dramatic break-through&quot; in Australian poetry of the 20th century according to poet Douglas Stewart.

Cook appears as a symbolic and generic figure in several Aboriginal myths, often from regions where Cook did not encounter Aboriginal people. Maddock states that Cook is usually portrayed as the bringer of Western colonialism to Australia and is presented as a villain who brings immense social change.

Cook has been depicted in numerous films, documentaries and dramas. The Australian slang phrase &quot;Have a Captain Cook&quot; means to have a look or conduct a brief inspection.

===Controversy===
The period 2018 to 2021 marked the 250th anniversary of Cook&#x27;s first voyage of exploration. Several countries, including Australia and New Zealand, arranged official events to commemorate the voyage, leading to widespread public debate about Cook&#x27;s legacy and the violence associated with his contacts with Indigenous peoples. In the lead-up to the commemorations, various memorials to Cook in Australia and New Zealand were vandalised, and there were public calls for their removal or modification due to their alleged promotion of colonialist narratives. There were also campaigns for the return of Indigenous artefacts taken during Cook&#x27;s voyages (see Gweagal shield).

In July 2021, a statue of Cook in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, was torn down in protests about the deaths of Indigenous residential school children in Canada. In January 2024, a statue of Cook in St Kilda, Melbourne was cut down in a protest against colonialism; the premier of Victoria pledged to work with the local council to repair the statue.

Alice Proctor argues that the controversies over public representations of Cook and the display of Indigenous artefacts from his voyages are part of a broader debate over the decolonisation of museums and public spaces and resistance to colonialist narratives. While a number of commentators argue that Cook enabled British imperialism and colonialism in the Pacific, Geoffrey Blainey, among others, notes that Banks promoted Botany Bay as a site for colonisation after Cook&#x27;s death. Robert Tombs has defended Cook, arguing: &quot;He epitomized the Age of Enlightenment in which he lived&quot; and in conducting his first voyage &quot;was carrying out an enlightened mission, with instructions from the Royal Society to show &#x27;patience and forbearance&#x27; towards native peoples&quot;.

<doc id="15632" wikidata="Q455265" url="?curid=15632" title="John Baskerville">
<text>John Baskerville (baptised 28 January 1707 – 8 January 1775) was an English businessman, in areas including japanning and papier-mâché, but he is best remembered as a printer and type designer. He was also responsible for inventing &quot;wove paper&quot;, which was considerably smoother than &quot;laid paper&quot;, allowing for sharper printing results.

== Life ==

Baskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and baptised on 28 January 1706OS(1707 NS) at Wolverley church. Baskerville established an early career teaching handwriting, and is known to have offered his services cutting gravestones (a demonstration slab by him survives in the Library of Birmingham) before making a considerable fortune from the manufacture of lacquerwork items (japanning).

He practised as a printer in Birmingham, England. Baskerville was a member of the Royal Society of Arts, and an associate of some of the members of the Lunar Society. 

Baskerville directed his punchcutter, John Handy, in the design of many typefaces of broadly similar appearance. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a fellow printer, but were criticised by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and leading between each line.

In 1757, Baskerville published a remarkable quarto edition of Virgil on wove paper, using his own type. It took three years to complete, but it made such an impact that he was appointed printer to the University of Cambridge the following year. An atheist, he nonetheless printed &quot;The Book of Common Prayer&quot; in 1762 and a splendid folio Bible in 1763. 

Baskerville innovated in printing, paper, and ink production. He worked with paper maker James Whatman to produce a smoother whiter paper, sometimes called wove paper, which showcased his strong black type.

== Death and interments ==

Baskerville died in January 1775 at his home, &quot;Easy Hill&quot;. He requested that his body be placed

However, in 1821 a canal was built through the land and his body was placed on show by the landowner until Baskerville&#x27;s family and friends arranged to have it moved to the crypt of Christ Church, Birmingham. Christ Church was demolished in 1897 so his remains were then moved, with other bodies from the crypt, to consecrated catacombs at Warstone Lane Cemetery. In 1963 a petition was presented to Birmingham City Council requesting that he be reburied in unconsecrated ground, according to his wishes.

== Legacy ==
The 20th century renewed interest in and appreciation for Baskerville&#x27;s typefaces. His most notable typeface, Baskerville, is held to represent the peak of transitional type face and a bridge between Old Style and Modern type design. Since the 1920s, many fonts based on his work—mostly called &#x27;Baskerville&#x27;— have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries. In 1996, Emigre released a popular revival of this typeface called Mrs Eaves after Baskerville&#x27;s wife, Sarah Eaves. 

== Commemoration ==

In the 1930s, Baskerville House was built on the grounds of &quot;Easy Hill&quot;.

In 1947, BBC radio broadcast a radio play about his burial, named &quot;Hic Jacet: or The Corpse in the Crescent&quot; by Neville Brandon Watts. The original recording was not preserved but a performance was staged by students at the Birmingham School of Acting in 2013 at the Typographic Hub Centre of Birmingham City University. A copy of the script is in the Norman Painting Archives at the University of Birmingham.

A Portland stone sculpture of the Baskerville typeface, &quot;Industry and Genius&quot;, in his honour stands in front of Baskerville House in Centenary Square, Birmingham. It was created by local artist David Patten in 1990.

<doc id="15641" wikidata="Q855" url="?curid=15641" title="Joseph Stalin">
<text>Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (born Dzhugashvili; 5 March 1953) was a Soviet politician, revolutionary and political theorist who led the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953. He held power as General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1922 to 1952 and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers from 1941 until his death. He initially governed as part of a collective leadership, but consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. Stalin codified his interpretation of Marxism as Marxism–Leninism, while the totalitarian political system he established is known as Stalinism.

Born into a poor Georgian family in Gori, Russian Empire, Stalin attended the Tiflis Theological Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He raised funds for Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik faction through robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets, and edited the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Pravda&quot;. Repeatedly arrested, he underwent internal exiles to Siberia. After the Bolsheviks seized power in the October Revolution of 1917, Stalin joined the governing Politburo, and following Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, won the struggle to lead the country. Under Stalin, the doctrine of socialism in one country became central to the party&#x27;s ideology. His five-year plans, launched in 1928, led to agricultural collectivisation and rapid industrialisation, establishing a centralised command economy. Resulting disruptions to food production contributed to a famine in 1932–1933 which killed millions, including in the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1936 and 1938, Stalin eradicated his political opponents and those deemed &quot;enemies of the working class&quot; in the Great Purge, after which he had absolute control of the party and government. Under his regime, an estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system of forced labour camps, and more than six million were deported to remote regions of the Soviet Union, which together resulted in millions of deaths. 

Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements. In 1939, his government signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, enabling the Soviet invasion of Poland after the start of World War II. Germany broke the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941, leading Stalin to join the Allies. The Red Army, with Stalin as its commander-in-chief, repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending the war in Europe. The Soviet Union, which had annexed the Baltic states and territories from Finland and from Romania amid the war, established Soviet-aligned states in Central and Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as global superpowers, and entered a period of tension known as the Cold War. Stalin presided over post-war reconstruction and the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. During these years, the country experienced another famine and a state-sponsored antisemitic campaign culminating in the &quot;doctors&#x27; plot&quot;. In 1953, Stalin died after suffering a stroke, and was succeeded as leader by Georgy Malenkov and later by Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin&#x27;s rule and initiated a campaign of &quot;de-Stalinisation&quot;.
Widely considered one of the 20th century&#x27;s most significant figures, Stalin was the subject of a pervasive personality cult within the international Marxist–Leninist movement, which revered him as a champion of socialism and the working class. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Stalin has retained a degree of popularity in post-Soviet states as an economic moderniser and victorious wartime leader who cemented the Soviet Union as a major world power. Conversely, his regime has been widely condemned for overseeing mass repressions, ethnic cleansing, and famines which caused the deaths of millions.


==Early life==
=== Early life ===

Stalin was born on in Gori, Georgia, then part of the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire. An ethnic Georgian, his birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili (Russified as Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili). His parents were Besarion Jughashvili and Ekaterine Geladze; Stalin was their third child and the only one to survive past infancy. After Besarion&#x27;s shoemaking workshop went into decline, the family fell into poverty, and he became an alcoholic who beat his wife and son. Ekaterine and her son left the home by 1883, moving through nine different rented rooms. In 1888, Stalin enrolled at the Gori Church School where he excelled. He faced health problems: an 1884 smallpox infection left him with facial scars, and at age 12 he was seriously injured when he was struck by a phaeton, causing a lifelong disability in his left arm.
In 1894, Stalin enrolled as a trainee Russian Orthodox priest at the Tiflis Theological Seminary, enabled by a scholarship. He initially achieved high grades, but lost interest in his studies. Stalin became influenced by Nikolay Chernyshevsky&#x27;s pro-revolutionary novel &quot;What Is To Be Done?&quot;, and Alexander Kazbegi&#x27;s &quot;The Patricide&quot;, with Stalin adopting the nickname &quot;Koba&quot; from its bandit protagonist. After reading &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, Stalin focused on Karl Marx&#x27;s philosophy of Marxism, which was on the rise as a variety of socialism opposed to the Tsarist authorities. He began attending secret workers&#x27; meetings, and left the seminary in April 1899.

=== 1899–1905: Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ===

During October 1899, he worked as a meteorologist at the Tiflis observatory. He attracted a group of socialist supporters, and co-organised a secret workers&#x27; meeting where he convinced many to strike on May Day 1900. The empire&#x27;s secret police, the Okhrana, became aware of Stalin&#x27;s activities and attempted to arrest him in March 1901, but he went into hiding during which he lived off donations from friends. He helped plan a demonstration in Tiflis on May Day 1901 at which 3,000 marchers clashed with the authorities. Stalin was elected to the Tiflis Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) –a Marxist party founded in 1898– in November 1901.

That month, he travelled to Batumi. His militant rhetoric proved divisive among the city&#x27;s Marxists, some of whom suspected that he was an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;. Stalin began working at the Rothschild refinery storehouse, where he co-organised two workers&#x27; strikes. After the strike leaders were arrested, he co-organised a mass demonstration which led to the storming of the prison. Stalin was arrested in April 1902 and sentenced to three years exile in Siberia, arriving in Novaya Uda in November 1903. After one failed attempt, Stalin escaped from his exile in January 1904 and travelled to Tiflis, where he co-edited the Marxist newspaper &quot;Proletariatis Brdzola&quot; (&quot;Proletarian Struggle&quot;) with Filipp Makharadze. During his exile, the RSDLP had become divided between Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s &quot;Bolshevik&quot; faction and Julius Martov&#x27;s &quot;Mensheviks&quot;. Stalin, who detested many Mensheviks in Georgia, aligned himself with the Bolsheviks.

=== 1905–1912: Revolution of 1905 and aftermath ===

In January 1905, government troops massacred protesters in Saint Petersburg spreading across the Empire in the Revolution of 1905. Stalin was in Baku in February when ethnic violence broke out between Armenians and Azeris, and he formed Bolshevik &quot;battle squads&quot; which he used to keep the city&#x27;s warring ethnic factions apart. His armed squads attacked local police and troops, raided arsenals, and raised funds via protection rackets. In November 1905, the Georgian Bolsheviks elected Stalin as one of their delegates to a Bolshevik conference in Tampere, Finland, where he met Lenin. Although Stalin held Lenin in deep respect, he vocally disagreed with his view that the Bolsheviks should field candidates for the 1906 election to the State Duma; Stalin viewed parliamentary process as a waste of time. In April 1906, he attended the RSDLP&#x27;s Fourth Congress in Stockholm, where the party—then led by a Menshevik majority—agreed that it would not raise funds using armed robbery. Lenin and Stalin disagreed with this, and privately discussed continuing the robberies for the Bolshevik cause.Stalin married Kato Svanidze in July 1906, and in March 1907 she gave birth to their son Yakov. Stalin, who by now had established himself as &quot;Georgia&#x27;s leading Bolshevik&quot;, organised the June 1907 robbery of a bank stagecoach in Tiflis to fund the Bolsheviks. His operatives ambushed the convoy in Erivansky Square with guns and home-made bombs; around 40 people were killed. Stalin settled in Baku with his wife and son, where Mensheviks confronted him about the robbery and voted to expel him from the RSDLP, but he ignored them. Stalin secured Bolshevik domination of Baku&#x27;s RSDLP branch and edited two Bolshevik newspapers. In November 1907, his wife died of typhus, and he left his son with her family in Tiflis. In Baku he reassembled his gang, which attacked Black Hundreds and raised money through racketeering, counterfeiting, robberies and kidnapping the children of wealthy figures for ransom.

In March 1908, Stalin was arrested and imprisoned in Baku. He led the imprisoned Bolsheviks, organised discussion groups, and ordered the killing of suspected informants. He was sentenced to two years of exile in Solvychegodsk in northern Russia, arriving there in February 1909. In June, Stalin escaped to Saint Petersburg, but was arrested again in March 1910 and sent back to Solvychegodsk. In June 1911, Stalin was given permission to move to Vologda where he stayed for two months. He then escaped to Saint Petersburg, where he was arrested again in September 1911 and sentenced to a further three years of exile in Vologda.

=== 1912–1917: Rise to the Central Committee and &quot;Pravda&quot; ===
In January 1912, the first Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference. Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev decided to co-opt Stalin to the committee, which Stalin (still in exile in Vologda) agreed to. Lenin believed that Stalin, as a Georgian, would help secure support from the empire&#x27;s minority ethnicities. In February 1912, Stalin again escaped to Saint Petersburg, where he was tasked with converting the Bolshevik weekly newspaper, &quot;Zvezda&quot; (&quot;Star&quot;) into a daily, &quot;Pravda&quot; (&quot;Truth&quot;). The new newspaper was launched in April 1912 and Stalin&#x27;s role as editor was kept secret. In May 1912, he was again arrested and sentenced to three years of exile in Siberia. In July, he arrived in Narym, where he shared a room with fellow Bolshevik Yakov Sverdlov. After two months, they escaped to Saint Petersburg, where Stalin continued work on &quot;Pravda&quot;.

After the October 1912 Duma elections, Stalin wrote articles calling for reconciliation between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks; Lenin criticised him and he relented. In January 1913, Stalin travelled to Vienna, where he researched the &quot;national question&quot; of how the Bolsheviks should deal with the Empire&#x27;s national and ethnic minorities. His article &quot;Marxism and the National Question&quot; was first published in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of the Bolshevik journal &quot;Prosveshcheniye&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;K. Stalin&quot;. The alias, which he had used since 1912, is derived from the Russian for steel (&quot;stal&quot;), and has been translated as &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. In February 1913, Stalin was again arrested in Saint Petersburg and sentenced to four years of exile in Turukhansk in Siberia, where he arrived in August. Still concerned over a potential escape, the authorities moved him to Kureika in March 1914.

=== 1917: Russian Revolution ===
While Stalin was in exile, Russia entered the First World War, and in October 1916 he and other exiled Bolsheviks were conscripted into the Russian Army. They arrived in Krasnoyarsk in February 1917, where a medical examiner ruled Stalin unfit for service due to his crippled arm. Stalin was required to serve four more months of his exile and successfully requested to serve it in Achinsk. Stalin was in the city when the February Revolution took place; the Tsar abdicated and the Empire became a &quot;de facto&quot; republic. In a celebratory mood, Stalin travelled by train to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg had been renamed) in March. He assumed control of &quot;Pravda&quot; alongside Lev Kamenev, and was appointed as a Bolshevik delegate to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet, an influential workers&#x27; council.

Stalin helped organise the July Days uprising, an armed display of strength by supporters of the Bolsheviks. After the demonstration was suppressed, the Provisional Government initiated a crackdown on the party, raiding &quot;Pravda&quot;. Stalin smuggled Lenin out of the paper&#x27;s office and took charge of his safety, moving him between Petrograd safe houses before smuggling him to nearby Razliv. In Lenin&#x27;s absence, Stalin continued editing &quot;Pravda&quot; and served as acting leader of the Bolsheviks, overseeing the party&#x27;s Sixth Congress. Lenin began calling for the Bolsheviks to seize power by toppling the Provisional Government, a plan which was supported by Stalin and fellow senior Bolshevik Leon Trotsky, but opposed by Kamenev, Zinoviev, and other members.

On 24 October, police raided the Bolshevik newspaper offices, smashing machinery and presses; Stalin salvaged some of the equipment. In the early hours of 25 October, Stalin joined Lenin in a Central Committee meeting in Petrograd&#x27;s Smolny Institute, from where the Bolshevik coup—the October Revolution—was directed. Bolshevik militia seized Petrograd&#x27;s power station, main post office, state bank, telephone exchange, and several bridges. A Bolshevik-controlled ship, the &quot;Aurora&quot;, opened fire on the Winter Palace; the Provisional Government&#x27;s assembled delegates surrendered and were arrested. Stalin, who had been tasked with briefing the Bolshevik delegates of the Second Congress of Soviets about the situation, had not played a publicly visible role. Trotsky and other later opponents used this as evidence his role had been insignificant, although historians reject this, citing his role as a member of the Central Committee and as an editor of &quot;Pravda&quot;.

==In Lenin&#x27;s government==
=== 1917–1918: People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities ===

On 26 October 1917, Lenin declared himself chairman of the new government, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom). Stalin supported Lenin&#x27;s decision not to form a coalition with the Socialist Revolutionary Party. He became part of an informal leadership group alongside Lenin, Trotsky, and Sverdlov, and his importance within the Bolshevik ranks grew. Stalin&#x27;s office was near Lenin&#x27;s in the Smolny Institute, and he and Trotsky had direct access to Lenin without an appointment. Stalin co-signed Lenin&#x27;s decrees shutting down hostile newspapers, and co-chaired the committee drafting a constitution for the newly-formed Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. He supported Lenin&#x27;s formation of the Cheka security service and the Red Terror, arguing that state violence was an effective tool for capitalist powers. Unlike some Bolsheviks, Stalin never expressed concern about the Cheka&#x27;s rapid expansion and the Red Terror.

Having left his role as &quot;Pravda&quot; editor, Stalin was appointed the People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities. He appointed Nadezhda Alliluyeva as his secretary, and married her in early 1919. In November 1917, he signed the Decree on Nationality, granting ethnic minorities the right to secession and self-determination. He travelled to Helsingfors to meet with the Finnish Social Democrats, and granted Finland&#x27;s request for independence from Russia in December. Due to the threats posed by the First World War, in March 1918 the government relocated from Petrograd to the Moscow Kremlin. Stalin supported Lenin&#x27;s desire to sign an armistice with the Central Powers; Stalin thought this necessary because he—unlike Lenin—was unconvinced that Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed in March 1918, ceding vast territories and angering many; the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries withdrew from the coalition government. The Bolsheviks were renamed the Russian Communist Party.

=== 1918–1921: Military command ===

In May 1918, during the intensifying Russian Civil War, Sovnarkom sent Stalin to Tsaritsyn to take charge of food procurement in Southern Russia. Eager to prove himself as a commander, he took control of regional military operations and befriended Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny, who later formed the core of his military support base. Stalin sent large numbers of Red Army troops to battle the region&#x27;s White armies, resulting in heavy losses and drawing Lenin&#x27;s concern. In Tsaritsyn, Stalin commanded the local Cheka branch to execute suspected counter-revolutionaries, often without trial, and purged the military and food collection agencies of middle-class specialists, who were also executed. His use of state violence was at a greater scale than most Bolshevik leaders approved of, for instance, he ordered several villages torched to ensure compliance with his food procurement program.

In December 1918, Stalin was sent to Perm to lead an inquiry into how Alexander Kolchak&#x27;s White forces had been able to decimate Red troops there. He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Red Third Regiment defected, he ordered the public execution of captured defectors. In September he returned to the Southern Front. During the war, Stalin proved his worth to the Central Committee by displaying decisiveness and determination. However, he also disregarded orders and repeatedly threatened to resign when affronted. In November 1919, the government awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his service.

The Bolsheviks won the main phase of the civil war by the end of 1919. By that time, Sovnarkom had turned its attention to spreading proletarian revolution abroad, forming the Communist International in March 1919; Stalin attended its inaugural ceremony. Although Stalin did not share Lenin&#x27;s belief that Europe&#x27;s proletariat were on the verge of revolution, he acknowledged that Soviet Russia remained vulnerable. In February 1920, he was appointed to head the Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Inspectorate (Rabkrin); that same month he was also transferred to the Caucasian Front.

The Polish–Soviet War broke out in early 1920, with the Poles invading Ukraine, and in May, Stalin was moved to the Southwest Front. Lenin believed that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support an invasion, but Stalin argued that nationalism would lead them to support their government&#x27;s war effort. Stalin lost the argument and accepted Lenin&#x27;s decision. On his front, Stalin became determined to conquer Lvov; in focusing on this goal, he disobeyed orders to transfer his troops to assist Mikhail Tukhachevsky&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Warsaw in early August, which ended in a major defeat for the Red Army. Stalin then returned to Moscow, where Tukhachevsky blamed him for the loss. Humiliated, he demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September. At the 9th Party Congress in late September, Trotsky accused Stalin of &quot;strategic mistakes&quot; and claimed that he had sabotaged the campaign; Lenin joined in the criticism. Stalin felt disgraced and his antipathy toward Trotsky increased.

=== 1921–1924: Lenin&#x27;s final years ===
The Soviet government sought to bring neighbouring states under its domination; in February 1921 it invaded the Menshevik-governed Georgia, and in April 1921, Stalin ordered the Red Army into Turkestan to reassert Soviet control. As People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities, Stalin believed that each ethnic group had the right to an &quot;autonomous republic&quot; within the Russian state in which it could oversee various regional affairs. In taking this view, some Marxists accused him of bending too much to bourgeois nationalism, while others accused him of remaining too Russo-centric. In his diverse native Caucasus, however, Stalin opposed the idea of separate autonomous republics, arguing that these would oppress ethnic minorities within their territories; instead, he called for a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian affair. In mid-1921, Stalin returned to the South Caucasus, calling on Georgian communists to reject the chauvinistic nationalism which he argued had marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities. In March 1921, Nadezhda gave birth to another of Stalin&#x27;s sons, Vasily.

After the civil war, workers&#x27; strikes and peasant uprisings broke out across Russia in opposition to Sovnarkom&#x27;s food requisitioning project; in response, Lenin introduced market-oriented reforms in the New Economic Policy (NEP). There was also turmoil within the Communist Party, as Trotsky led a faction calling for abolition of trade unions; Lenin opposed this, and Stalin helped rally opposition to Trotsky&#x27;s position. At the 11th Party Congress in March and April 1922, Lenin nominated Stalin as the party&#x27;s General Secretary, which was intended as a purely organisational role. Although concerns were expressed that adopting the new position would overstretch his workload and grant him too much power, Stalin was appointed to the post.

In May 1922, a massive stroke left Lenin partially paralysed. Residing at his Gorki dacha, his main connection to Sovnarkom was through Stalin. Despite their comradeship, Lenin disliked what he referred to as Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Asiatic&quot; manner and told his sister Maria that Stalin was &quot;not intelligent&quot;. The two men argued on the issue of foreign trade; Lenin believed that the Soviet state should have a monopoly on foreign trade, but Stalin supported Grigori Sokolnikov&#x27;s view that doing so was impractical. Another disagreement came over the Georgian affair, with Lenin backing the Georgian Central Committee&#x27;s desire for a Georgian Soviet Republic over Stalin&#x27;s idea of a Transcaucasian one. They also disagreed on the nature of the Soviet state; Lenin called for establishment of a new federation named the &quot;Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia&quot;, while Stalin believed that this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians. Lenin accused Stalin of &quot;Great Russian chauvinism&quot;, while Stalin accused Lenin of &quot;national liberalism&quot;. A compromise was reached in which the federation would be named the &quot;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; (USSR), whose formation was ratified in December 1922.

Their differences also became personal; Lenin was angered when Stalin was rude to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation. In the final years of his life, Krupskaya provided leading figures with Lenin&#x27;s Testament, which criticised Stalin&#x27;s rude manners and excessive power and suggested that he be removed as general secretary. Some historians have questioned whether Lenin wrote the document, suggesting that it was written by Krupskaya; Stalin never publicly voiced concerns about its authenticity. Most historians consider it an accurate reflection of Lenin&#x27;s views.

==Consolidation of power==
=== 1924–1928: Succeeding Lenin ===
Upon Lenin&#x27;s death in January 1924, Stalin took charge of the funeral and was a pallbearer. To bolster his image as a devoted Leninist amid his growing personality cult, Stalin gave nine lectures at Sverdlov University on the &quot;Foundations of Leninism&quot;, later published in book form. At the 13th Party Congress in May 1924, Lenin&#x27;s Testament was read only to the leaders of the provincial delegations. Embarrassed by its contents, Stalin offered his resignation as General Secretary; this act of humility saved him, and he was retained in the post.

As General Secretary, Stalin had a free hand in making appointments to his own staff, and implanted loyalists throughout the party. Favouring new members from proletarian backgrounds to &quot;Old Bolsheviks&quot;, who tended to be middle-class university graduates, he ensured that he had loyalists dispersed across the regions. Stalin had much contact with young party functionaries, and the desire for promotion led many to seek his favour. Stalin also developed close relations with key figures in the secret police: Felix Dzerzhinsky, Genrikh Yagoda, and Vyacheslav Menzhinsky. His wife gave birth to a daughter, Svetlana, in February 1926.

In the wake of Lenin&#x27;s death, a power struggle emerged to become his successor: alongside Stalin was Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky. Stalin saw Trotsky—whom he personally despised—as the main obstacle to his dominance, and during Lenin&#x27;s illness had formed an unofficial triumvirate (&quot;troika&quot;) with Kamanev and Zinoviev against him. Although Zinoviev was concerned about Stalin&#x27;s growing power, he rallied behind him at the 13th Congress as a counterweight to Trotsky, who now led a faction known as the Left Opposition. Trotsky&#x27;s supporters believed that the NEP conceded too much to capitalism, and they called Stalin a &quot;rightist&quot; for his support of the policy. Stalin built up a retinue of his supporters within the Central Committee as the Left Opposition were marginalised.

In late 1924, Stalin moved against Kamenev and Zinoviev, removing their supporters from key positions. In 1925, the two moved into open opposition to Stalin and Bukharin and launched an unsuccessful attack on their faction at the 14th Party Congress in December. Stalin accused Kamenev and Zinoviev of reintroducing factionalism, and thus instability. In mid-1926, Kamenev and Zinoviev joined with Trotsky to form the United Opposition against Stalin; in October the two agreed to stop factional activity under threat of expulsion, and later publicly recanted their views. The factionalist arguments continued, with Stalin threatening to resign in October and December 1926, and again in December 1927. In October 1927, Trotsky was removed from the Central Committee; he was later exiled to Kazakhstan in 1928 and deported from the country in 1929.

Stalin was now the supreme leader of the party and state. He entrusted the position of head of government to Vyacheslav Molotov; other important supporters on the Politburo were Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, and Sergo Ordzhonikidze, with Stalin ensuring his allies ran state institutions. His growing influence was reflected in naming of locations after him; in June 1924 the Ukrainian city of Yuzovka became Stalino, and in April 1925, Tsaritsyn was renamed Stalingrad. In 1926, Stalin published &quot;On Questions of Leninism,&quot; in which he argued for the concept of &quot;socialism in one country&quot;, which was presented as an orthodox Leninist perspective despite clashing with established Bolshevik views that socialism could only be achieved globally through the process of world revolution. In 1927, there was some argument in the party over Soviet policy regarding China. Stalin had called for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by Mao Zedong, to ally itself with Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists, viewing a CCP-KMT alliance as the best bulwark against Japanese imperial expansionism. Instead, the KMT repressed the CCP and a civil war broke out between the two sides.
=== 1928–1932: First five-year plan ===
====Economic policy====
The Soviet Union lagged far behind the industrial and agricultural development of the Western powers. Stalin&#x27;s government feared attack from capitalist countries, and many communists, including in Komsomol, OGPU, and the Red Army, were eager to be rid of the NEP and its market-oriented approach. They had concerns about those who profited from the policy: affluent peasants known as &quot;kulaks&quot; and small business owners, or &quot;NEPmen&quot;. At this point, Stalin turned against the NEP, which put him on a course to the &quot;left&quot; even of Trotsky or Zinoviev.

In early 1928, Stalin travelled to Novosibirsk, where he alleged that kulaks were hoarding grain and ordered them be arrested and their grain confiscated, with Stalin bringing much of the grain back to Moscow with him in February. At his command, grain procurement squads surfaced across West Siberia and the Urals, with violence breaking out between the squads and the peasantry. Stalin announced that kulaks and the &quot;middle peasants&quot; must be coerced into releasing their harvest. Bukharin and other Central Committee members were angered that they had not been consulted about the measure. In January 1930, the Politburo approved the &quot;liquidation&quot; of the kulak class, which was exiled to other parts of the country or concentration camps. By July 1930, over 320,000 households had been affected. According to Dmitri Volkogonov, de-kulakisation was &quot;the first mass terror applied by Stalin in his own country.&quot;

In 1929, the Politburo announced the mass collectivisation of agriculture, establishing both &quot;kolkhoz&quot; collective farms and &quot;sovkhoz&quot; state farms. Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face the fate of the kulaks. By 1932, about 62% of households involved in agriculture were part of collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%. Many collectivised peasants resented the loss of their private farmland, and productivity slumped. Famine broke out in many areas, with the Politburo frequently being forced to dispatch emergency food relief. Armed peasant uprisings broke out in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, Southern Russia, and Central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were suppressed by the army. Stalin responded with an article insisting that collectivisation was voluntary and blaming violence on local officials. Although he and Stalin had been close for many years, Bukharin expressed concerns and regarded them as a return to Lenin&#x27;s old &quot;war communism&quot; policy. By mid-1928, he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms; in November 1929, Stalin removed him from the Politburo.

Officially, the Soviet Union had replaced the &quot;irrationality&quot; and &quot;wastefulness&quot; of a market economy with a planned economy organised along a long-term and scientific framework; in reality, Soviet economics were based on &quot;ad hoc&quot; commandments issued often to make short-term targets. In 1928, the first five-year plan was launched by Stalin with a main focus on boosting Soviet heavy industry; it was finished a year ahead of schedule, in 1932. The country underwent a massive economic transformation: new mines were opened, new cities like Magnitogorsk constructed, and work on the White Sea–Baltic Canal began. Millions of peasants moved to the cities, and large debts were accrued purchasing foreign-made machinery.

Many major construction projects, including the White Sea–Baltic Canal and the Moscow Metro, were constructed largely through forced labour. The last elements of workers&#x27; control over industry were removed, with factory managers receiving privileges; Stalin defended wage disparity by pointing to Marx&#x27;s argument that it was necessary during the lower stages of socialism. To promote intensification of labour, medals and awards as well as the Stakhanovite movement were introduced. Stalin argued that socialism was being established in the USSR while capitalism was crumbling during the Great Depression. His rhetoric reflected his utopian vision of the &quot;new Soviet person&quot; rising to unparallelled heights of human development.
====Cultural and foreign policy====
In 1928, Stalin declared that class war between the proletariat and their enemies would intensify as socialism developed. He warned of a &quot;danger from the right&quot;, including from within the Communist Party. The first major show trial in the USSR was the Shakhty Trial of 1928, in which middle-class &quot;industrial specialists&quot; were convicted of sabotage. From 1929 to 1930, show trials were held to intimidate opposition; these included the Industrial Party Trial, Menshevik Trial, and Metro-Vickers Trial. Aware that the ethnic Russian majority may have concerns about being ruled by a Georgian, he promoted ethnic Russians throughout the state bureaucracy and made Russian compulsory in schools, albeit in tandem with local languages. Nationalist sentiment was suppressed. Conservative social policies were promoted to boost population growth; this included a focus on strong family units, re-criminalisation of homosexuality, restrictions on abortion and divorce, and abolition of the &quot;Zhenotdel&quot; women&#x27;s department.

Stalin desired a &quot;cultural revolution&quot;, entailing both the creation of a culture for the &quot;masses&quot; and the wider dissemination of previously elite culture. He oversaw a proliferation of schools, newspapers, and libraries, as well as advancement of literacy and numeracy. Socialist realism was promoted throughout the arts, while Stalin wooed prominent writers, namely Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Sholokhov, and Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. He expressed patronage for scientists whose research fit within his preconceived interpretation of Marxism; for instance, he endorsed the research of agrobiologist Trofim Lysenko despite the fact that it was rejected by the majority of Lysenko&#x27;s scientific peers as pseudo-scientific. The government&#x27;s anti-religious campaign was re-intensified, with increased funding given to the League of Militant Atheists. Priests, imams, and Buddhist monks faced persecution. Religious buildings were demolished, most notably Moscow&#x27;s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, destroyed in 1931 to make way for the Palace of the Soviets. Religion retained an influence over the population; in the 1937 census, 57% of respondents were willing to admit to being religious.

Throughout the 1920s, Stalin placed a priority on foreign policy. He personally met with a range of Western visitors, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, both of whom were impressed with him. Through the Communist International, Stalin&#x27;s government exerted a strong influence over Marxist parties elsewhere; he left the running of the organisation to Bukharin before his ousting. At its 6th Congress in July 1928, Stalin informed delegates that the main threat to socialism came from non-Marxist socialists and social democrats, whom he called &quot;social fascists&quot;; Stalin recognised that in many countries, these groups were Marxist–Leninists&#x27; main rivals for working-class support. This focus on opposing rival leftists concerned Bukharin, who regarded the growth of fascism and the far right across Europe as a greater threat.

In 1929, Stalin&#x27;s son Yakov unsuccessfully attempted suicide, shooting himself in the chest and narrowly missing his heart; his failure earned the contempt of Stalin, who is reported to have brushed off the attempt by saying &quot;He can&#x27;t even shoot straight.&quot; His relationship with Nadezhda was strained amid their arguments and her mental health problems. In November 1932, after a group dinner in the Kremlin in which Stalin flirted with other women, Nadezhda shot herself in the heart. Publicly, the cause of death was given as appendicitis; Stalin also concealed the real cause of death from his children. Stalin&#x27;s friends noted that he underwent a significant change following her suicide, becoming emotionally harder.

====Famine of 1932–1933====

Within the Soviet Union, civic disgruntlement against Stalin&#x27;s government was widespread. Social unrest in urban areas led Stalin to ease some economic policies in 1932. In May 1932, he introduced &quot;kolkhoz&quot; markets where peasants could trade surplus produce. However, penal sanctions became harsher; a decree in August 1932 made the theft of a handful of grain a capital offence. The second five-year plan reduced production quotas from the first, focusing more on improving living conditions through housing and consumer goods. Emphasis on armament production increased after Adolf Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.

The Soviet Union experienced a major famine which peaked in the winter of 1932–1933, with 5–7 million deaths. The worst affected areas were Ukraine (where the famine was called the Holodomor), Southern Russia, Kazakhstan and the North Caucasus. In the case of Ukraine, historians debate whether the famine was intentional, with the purpose of eliminating a potential independence movement; no documents show Stalin explicitly ordered starvation. Poor weather led to bad harvests in 1931 and 1932, compounded by years of declining productivity. Rapid industrialisation policies, neglect of crop rotation, and failure to build reserve grain stocks exacerbated the crisis. Stalin blamed hostile elements and saboteurs among the peasants. The government provided limited food aid to famine-stricken areas, prioritising urban workers; for Stalin, Soviet industrialisation was more valuable than peasant lives. Grain exports declined heavily. Stalin did not acknowledge his policies&#x27; role in the famine, which was concealed from foreign observers.

====Ideological and foreign affairs====
In 1936, Stalin oversaw the adoption of a new constitution with expansive democratic features; it was designed as propaganda, as all power rested in his hands. He declared that &quot;socialism, the first phase of communism, has been achieved&quot;. In 1938, the &quot;History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)&quot; was released; commonly known as the &quot;Short Course&quot;, it became the central text of Stalinism. Authorised Stalin biographies were also published, though Stalin preferred to be viewed as the embodiment of the Communist Party, rather than have his life story explored.

Seeking better international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations, from which it had previously been excluded. Stalin initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter came to power. Stalin admired Hitler, particularly his manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives. Stalin nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the liberal democracies of Western Europe; in May 1935, the Soviets signed treaties of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. At the Communist International&#x27;s 7th Congress in July–August 1935, the Soviet Union encouraged Marxist–Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism. In response, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact.

When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936, the Soviets sent military aid to the Republican faction, including 648 aircraft and 407 tanks, along with 3,000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades. Stalin took a personal involvement in the Spanish situation. Germany and Italy backed the Nationalist faction, which was ultimately victorious in March 1939. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937, the Soviet Union and China signed a non-aggression pact. Stalin aided the Chinese as the KMT and the Communists suspended their civil war and formed his desired United Front against Japan.

====Great Purge====

Stalin&#x27;s approach to state repression was often contradictory. In May 1933, he released many convicted of minor offences, ordering the security services not to enact further mass arrests and deportations, and in September 1934, he launched a commission to investigate false imprisonments. That same month, he called for the execution of workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory accused of spying for Japan. After Sergei Kirov was murdered in December 1934, Stalin became increasingly concerned about assassination threats, and state repression intensified. Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could issue rapid and severe sentences without involving the courts. In 1935, he ordered the NKVD to expel suspected counterrevolutionaries from urban areas; over 11,000 were expelled from Leningrad alone in early 1935.
In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the NKVD, after which Stalin move to orchestrate the arrest and execution of his remaining opponents in the Communist Party in the Great Purge. The first Moscow Trial in August 1936 saw Kamenev and Zinoviev executed. The second trial took place in January 1937, and the third in March 1938, with Bukharin and Rykov executed. By late 1937, all remnants of collective leadership were gone from the Politburo, which was now effectively under Stalin&#x27;s control. There were mass expulsions from the party, with Stalin also ordering foreign communist parties to purge anti-Stalinist elements. These purges replaced most of the party&#x27;s old guard with younger officials loyal to Stalin. Party functionaries readily carried out their commands and sought to ingratiate themselves with Stalin, to avoid becoming victims. Such functionaries often carried out more arrests and executions than their quotas set by government.

Repressions intensified further from December 1936 until November 1938. In May 1937, Stalin ordered the arrest of much of the army&#x27;s high command, and mass arrests in the military followed. By late 1937, purges extended beyond the party to the wider population. In July 1937, the Politburo ordered a purge of &quot;anti-Soviet elements&quot;, targeting anti-Stalin Bolsheviks, former Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries, priests, ex–White Army soldiers, and common criminals. Stalin initiated &quot;national operations&quot;, the ethnic cleansing of non-Soviet ethnic groups — among them Poles, Germans, Latvians, Finns, Greeks, Koreans, and Chinese — through internal or external exile. More than 1.6 million people were arrested, 700,000 shot, and an unknown number died under torture. The NKVD also assassinated defectors and opponents abroad; in August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Mexico, eliminating Stalin&#x27;s last major opponent.

Stalin initiated all key decisions during the purge, and personally directed many operations. Historians debate his motives, noting his personal writings from the period were &quot;unusually convoluted and incoherent&quot;, filled with claims about enemies encircling him. He feared a domestic fifth column in the event of war with Japan and Germany, particularly after right-wing forces overthrew the leftist Spanish government. The Great Purge ended when Yezhov was replaced by Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian completely loyal to Stalin. Yezhov himself was arrested in April 1939 and executed in 1940. The purge damaged the Soviet Union&#x27;s reputation abroad, particularly among leftist sympathisers. As it wound down, Stalin sought to deflect his responsibility, blaming its &quot;excesses&quot; and &quot;violations of law&quot; on Yezhov.

==World War II==
=== 1939–1941: Pact with Nazi Germany ===
As a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin considered conflict between competing capitalist powers inevitable; after Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he recognised a major war was looming. He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality, hoping that a German war against France and the United Kingdom would lead to Soviet dominance in Europe. The Soviets faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese in the latter part of the 1930s, culminating in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939. Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in haste many of its officers were poorly trained. Between 1940 and 1941 Stalin purged the military, leaving it with a severe shortage of trained officers when war eventually broke out.
As Britain and France seemed unwilling to commit to an alliance with the Soviet Union, Stalin saw a better deal with the Germans. On 3 May 1939, he replaced his Western-oriented foreign minister Maxim Litvinov with Vyacheslav Molotov. Germany began negotiations with the Soviets, proposing that Eastern Europe be divided between the two powers. In August 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, a non-aggression pact negotiated by Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop with a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe. On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland, leading the UK and France to declare war on Germany. On 17 September, the Red Army entered eastern Poland, officially to restore order. On 28 September, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged some of their conquered territories, and a German–Soviet Frontier Treaty was signed shortly after in Stalin&#x27;s presence. The two states continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.

The Soviets further demanded parts of eastern Finland, but the Finnish government refused. The Soviets invaded Finland in November 1939, starting the Winter War; despite numerical inferiority, the Finns kept the Red Army at bay. International opinion backed Finland, with the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations. Embarrassed by their inability to defeat the Finns, the Soviets signed an interim peace treaty, in which they received territorial concessions. In June 1940, the Red Army occupied the Baltic states, which were forcibly merged into the Soviet Union in August; they also invaded and annexed Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, parts of Romania. The Soviets sought to forestall dissent in the new territories with mass repressions. A noted instance was the Katyn massacre of April and May 1940, in which around 22,000 members of the Polish armed forces, police, and intelligentsia were executed by the NKVD.

The speed of the German victory over and occupation of France in mid-1940 took Stalin by surprise. He seemingly focused on appeasement in order to delay conflict. After the Tripartite Pact was signed by the Axis Powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy in October 1940, Stalin proposed that the USSR also join the Axis alliance. To demonstrate peaceful intentions, in April 1941 the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Japan. Stalin, who had been the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; head of government for almost 15 years, concluded that relations with Germany had deteriorated to such an extent that he needed to become &quot;de jure&quot; head of government as well, and on 6 May, replaced Molotov as Premier of the Soviet Union.

=== 1941–1942: German invasion ===
In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union, initiating the war on the Eastern Front. Despite intelligence agencies repeatedly warning him of Germany&#x27;s intentions, Stalin was taken by surprise. He formed a State Defence Committee, which he headed as Supreme Commander, as well as a military Supreme Command (Stavka), with Georgy Zhukov as its Chief of Staff. The German tactic of &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; was initially highly effective; the Soviet air force in the western borderlands was destroyed within two days. The German Wehrmacht pushed deep into Soviet territory; soon, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and the Baltic states were under German occupation, and Leningrad was under siege; and Soviet refugees were flooding into Moscow and surrounding cities. By July, Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow, and by October the Wehrmacht was amassing for a full assault on the capital. Plans were made for the Soviet government to evacuate to Kuibyshev, although Stalin decided to remain in Moscow, believing his flight would damage troop morale. The German advance on Moscow was halted after two months of battle in increasingly harsh weather conditions.

Going against the advice of Zhukov and other generals, Stalin emphasised attack over defence. In June 1941, he ordered a scorched earth policy of destroying infrastructure and food supplies before the Germans could seize them, also commanding the NKVD to kill around 100,000 political prisoners in areas the Wehrmacht approached. He purged the military command; several high-ranking figures were demoted or reassigned and others were arrested and executed. With Order No. 270, Stalin commanded soldiers risking capture to fight to the death, describing the captured as traitors; among those taken as a prisoner of war was Stalin&#x27;s son Yakov, who died in German custody. Stalin issued Order No. 227 in July 1942, which directed that those retreating unauthorised would be placed in &quot;penal battalions&quot; and used as cannon fodder. Both the German and Soviet armies disregarded the laws of war in the Geneva Conventions; the Soviets heavily publicised Nazi massacres of communists, Jews, and Romani. In April 1942, Stalin sponsored the formation of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC) to garner global Jewish support for the war effort.
The Soviets allied with the UK and U.S.; although the U.S. joined the war against Germany in 1941, little direct American assistance reached the Soviets until late 1942. Responding to the invasion, the Soviets expanded their industry in central Russia, focusing almost entirely on military production. They achieved high levels of productivity, outstripping Germany. During the war, Stalin was more tolerant of the Russian Orthodox Church and allowed it to resume some of its activities. He also permitted a wider range of cultural expression, notably permitting formerly suppressed writers and artists like Anna Akhmatova and Dmitri Shostakovich to disperse their work more widely. &quot;The Internationale&quot; was dropped as the country&#x27;s national anthem, to be replaced with a more patriotic song. The government increasingly promoted Pan-Slavist sentiment, while encouraging increased criticism of cosmopolitanism, particularly &quot;rootless cosmopolitanism&quot;, an approach with particular repercussions for Soviet Jews. The Communist International was dissolved in 1943, and Stalin began encouraging foreign Marxist–Leninist parties to emphasise nationalism over internationalism in order to broaden their domestic appeal.

In April 1942, Stalin overrode Stavka by ordering the Soviets&#x27; first serious counter-attack, an attempt to seize German-held Kharkov in eastern Ukraine. This attack proved unsuccessful. That year, Hitler shifted his primary goal from an overall victory on the Eastern Front to the goal of securing the oil fields in the southern Soviet Union crucial to a long-term German war effort. While Red Army generals saw evidence that Hitler would shift efforts south, Stalin considered this to be a flanking move in a renewed effort to take Moscow. In June 1942, the German Army began a major offensive in Southern Russia, threatening Stalingrad; Stalin ordered the Red Army to hold the city at all costs, resulting in the protracted Battle of Stalingrad, which became the bloodiest and fiercest battle of the entire war. In February 1943, the German forces attacking Stalingrad surrendered. The Soviet victory there marked a major turning point in the war; in commemoration, Stalin declared himself Marshal of the Soviet Union in March.

=== 1942–1945: Soviet counter-attack ===
By November 1942, the Soviets had begun to repulse the German southern campaign and, although there were 2.5 million Soviet casualties in that effort, it permitted the Soviets to take the offensive for most of the rest of the war on the Eastern Front. In summer 1943, Germany attempted an encirclement attack at Kursk, which was successfully repulsed by the Soviets. By the end of the year, the Soviets occupied half of the territory taken by the Germans to that point. Soviet military industrial output also had increased substantially from late 1941 to early 1943 after Stalin had moved factories well to the east of the front, safe from invasion and aerial assault.

In Allied countries, Stalin was increasingly depicted in a positive light over the course of the war. In 1941, the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed a concert to celebrate his birthday, and in 1942, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. When Stalin learnt that people in Western countries affectionately called him &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; he was initially offended, regarding it as undignified. There remained mutual suspicions between Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, together known as the &quot;Big Three&quot;. Churchill flew to Moscow to visit Stalin in August 1942 and again in October 1944. Stalin scarcely left Moscow during the war, frustrating Roosevelt and Churchill with his reluctance to meet them.

In November 1943, Stalin met with Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, a location of Stalin&#x27;s choosing. There, Stalin and Roosevelt got on well, with both desiring the post-war dismantling of the British Empire. At Tehran, the trio agreed that to prevent Germany rising to military prowess yet again, the German state should be broken up. Roosevelt and Churchill also agreed to Stalin&#x27;s demand that the German city of Königsberg be declared Soviet territory. Stalin was impatient for the UK and U.S. to open up a Western Front to take the pressure off the East; they eventually did so in mid-1944. Stalin insisted that, after the war, the Soviet Union should incorporate the portions of Poland it had occupied in 1939, which Churchill opposed. Discussing the fate of the Balkans, later in 1944 Churchill agreed to Stalin&#x27;s suggestion that after the war, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia would come under the Soviet sphere of influence while Greece would come under that of the Western powers.

In 1944, the Soviet Union made significant advances across Eastern Europe toward Germany, including Operation Bagration, a massive offensive in the Byelorussian SSR against the German Army Group Centre. In 1944, the German armies were pushed out of the Baltic states, which were then re-annexed into the Soviet Union. As the Red Army reconquered the Caucasus and Crimea, various ethnic groups living in the region—the Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingushi, Karachai, Balkars, and Crimean Tatars—were accused of having collaborated with the Germans. Using the idea of collective responsibility as a basis, Stalin&#x27;s government abolished their autonomous republics and between late 1943 and 1944 deported the majority of their populations to Central Asia and Siberia. Over one million people were deported as a result of the policy, with high rates of mortality.

In February 1945, the three leaders met at the Yalta Conference. Roosevelt and Churchill conceded to Stalin&#x27;s demand that Germany pay the Soviet Union 20 billion dollars in reparations, and that his country be permitted to annex Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in exchange for entering the war against Japan. An agreement was also made that a post-war Polish government should be a coalition consisting of both communist and conservative elements. Privately, Stalin sought to ensure that Poland would come fully under Soviet influence. The Red Army withheld assistance to Polish resistance fighters battling the Germans in the Warsaw Uprising, with Stalin believing that any victorious Polish militants could interfere with his future aspirations to dominate Poland. Stalin placed great emphasis on capturing Berlin before the Western Allies, believing that this would enable him to bring more of Europe under long-term Soviet control. Churchill, concerned by this, unsuccessfully tried to convince the U.S. that they should pursue the same goal.

=== 1945: Victory ===
In April 1945, the Red Army seized Berlin, Hitler killed himself, and Germany surrendered in May. Stalin had wanted Hitler captured alive; he had his remains brought to Moscow in order to prevent them becoming a relic for Nazi sympathisers. Many Soviet soldiers engaged in looting, pillaging, and rape, both in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe. Stalin refused to punish the offenders. With Germany defeated, Stalin switched focus to the war with Japan, transferring half a million troops to the Far East. Stalin was pressed by his allies to enter the war and wanted to cement the Soviet Union&#x27;s strategic position in Asia. On 8 August, in between the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet army invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria and northern Korea, defeating the Kwantung Army. These events led to the Japanese surrender and the war&#x27;s end. The U.S. rebuffed Stalin&#x27;s desire for the Red Army to take a role in the Allied occupation of Japan.

At the Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, Stalin repeated previous promises that he would refrain from a &quot;Sovietisation&quot; of Eastern Europe. Stalin pushed for reparations from Germany without regard to the base minimum supply for German citizens&#x27; survival, which worried Harry Truman and Churchill, who thought that Germany would become a financial burden for the Western powers. Stalin also pushed for &quot;war booty&quot;, which would permit the Soviet Union to directly seize property from conquered nations without quantitative or qualitative limitation, and a clause was added permitting this to occur with some limitations. Germany was divided into four zones: Soviet, U.S., British, and French, with Berlin—located in the Soviet area—also divided thusly.

==Post-war era ==

=== 1945–1947: Post-war reconstruction ===
After the war, Stalin was at the apex of his career. Within the Soviet Union he was widely regarded as the embodiment of victory and patriotism, and his armies controlled Central and Eastern Europe up to the River Elbe. In June 1945, Stalin adopted the title of Generalissimo and stood atop Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum to watch a celebratory parade led by Zhukov through Red Square. At a banquet held for army commanders, he described the Russian people as &quot;the outstanding nation&quot; and &quot;leading force&quot; within the Soviet Union, the first time that he had unequivocally endorsed Russians over the other Soviet nationalities. In 1946, the state published Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;. In 1947, it brought out a second edition of his official biography, which glorified him to a greater extent than its predecessor. He was quoted in &quot;Pravda&quot; on a daily basis and pictures of him remained pervasive on the walls of workplaces and homes.
Despite his strengthened international position, Stalin was cautious about internal dissent and desire for change among the population. He was also concerned about his returning armies, who had been exposed to a wide range of consumer goods in Germany, much of which they had looted and brought back with them. In this he recalled the 1825 Decembrist Revolt by Russian soldiers returning from having defeated France in the Napoleonic Wars. He ensured that returning Soviet prisoners of war went through &quot;filtration&quot; camps as they arrived in the Soviet Union, in which 2,775,700 were interrogated to determine if they were traitors. About half were then imprisoned in labour camps. In the Baltic states, where there was much opposition to Soviet rule, de-kulakisation and de-clericalisation programmes were initiated, resulting in 142,000 deportations between 1945 and 1949. The Gulag system of forced labour camps was expanded further. By January 1953, three percent of the Soviet population was imprisoned or in internal exile, with 2.8 million in &quot;special settlements&quot; in isolated areas and another 2.5 million in camps, penal colonies, and prisons.

The NKVD were ordered to catalogue the scale of destruction during the war. It was established that 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages had been destroyed. The NKVD recorded that between 26 and 27 million Soviet citizens had been killed, with millions more being wounded, malnourished, or orphaned. In the war&#x27;s aftermath, some of Stalin&#x27;s associates suggested modifications to government policy. Post-war Soviet society was more tolerant than its pre-war phase in various respects. Stalin allowed the Russian Orthodox Church to retain the churches it had opened during the war, and academia and the arts were also allowed greater freedom. Recognising the need for drastic steps to be taken to combat inflation and promote economic recovery, in December 1947 Stalin&#x27;s government devalued the rouble and abolished the food rationing system. Capital punishment was abolished in 1947 but re-instituted in 1950. Stalin&#x27;s health deteriorated, and he grew increasingly concerned that senior figures might try to oust him. He demoted Molotov, and increasingly favoured Beria and Malenkov for key positions. In the Leningrad affair, the city&#x27;s leadership was purged amid accusations of treachery; executions of many of the accused took place in 1950.

In the post-war period there were often food shortages in Soviet cities, and the USSR experienced a major famine from 1946 to 1947. Sparked by a drought and ensuing bad harvest in 1946, it was exacerbated by government policy towards food procurement, including the state&#x27;s decision to build up stocks and export food rather than distributing it to famine-hit areas. Estimates indicate that between one million and 1.5 million people died from malnutrition or disease as a result. While agricultural production stagnated, Stalin focused on a series of major infrastructure projects, including the construction of hydroelectric plants, canals, and railway lines running to the polar north. Many of these were constructed through prison labour.

=== 1947–1950: Cold War policy ===
In the aftermath of the war, the British Empire declined, leaving the U.S. and USSR as the dominant world powers. Tensions among these former Allies grew, resulting in the Cold War. Although Stalin publicly described the British and U.S. governments as aggressive, he thought it unlikely that a war with them would be imminent, believing that several decades of peace was likely. He nevertheless secretly intensified Soviet research into nuclear weaponry, intent on creating an atom bomb. Still, Stalin foresaw the undesirability of a nuclear conflict, stating that &quot;atomic weapons can hardly be used without spelling the end of the world.&quot; He personally took a keen interest in the development of the weapon. In August 1949, the bomb was successfully tested in the deserts outside Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan. Stalin also initiated a new military build-up; the Soviet army was expanded from 2.9 million soldiers, as it stood in 1949, to 5.8 million by 1953.

The U.S. began pushing its interests on every continent, acquiring air force bases in Africa and Asia and ensuring pro-U.S. regimes took power across Latin America. It launched the Marshall Plan in June 1947, with which it sought to undermine Soviet hegemony throughout Eastern Europe. The U.S. offered financial assistance to countries on the condition that they opened their markets to trade, aware that the Soviets would never agree. The Allies demanded that Stalin withdraw the Red Army from northern Iran. He initially refused, leading to an international crisis in 1946, but relented one year later. Stalin also tried to maximise Soviet influence on the world stage, unsuccessfully pushing for Libya—recently liberated from Italian occupation—to become a Soviet protectorate. He sent Molotov as his representative to San Francisco to take part in negotiations to form the United Nations, insisting that the Soviets have a place on its Security Council. In April 1949, the Western powers established the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an anti-Soviet military alliance led by the U.S. In the West, Stalin was increasingly portrayed as the &quot;most evil dictator alive&quot; and compared to Hitler.

In 1948, Stalin edited and rewrote sections of &quot;Falsifiers of History&quot;, published as a series of &quot;Pravda&quot; articles in February 1948 and then in book form. Written in response to public revelations of the 1939 Soviet alliance with Germany, it focused on blaming the Western powers for the war. He also erroneously claimed that the initial German advance in the early part of the war, during Operation Barbarossa, was not a result of Soviet military weakness, but rather a deliberate Soviet strategic retreat. In 1949, celebrations took place to mark Stalin&#x27;s 70th birthday (although he actually was turning 71 at the time) at which Stalin attended an event at the Bolshoi Theatre alongside Marxist–Leninist leaders from across Europe and Asia.

====Eastern Bloc====
After the war, Stalin sought to retain Soviet dominance across Eastern Europe while expanding its influence in Asia. Cautiously regarding the responses from the Western Allies, Stalin avoided immediately installing Communist Party governments in Eastern Europe, instead initially ensuring that Marxist-Leninists were placed in coalition ministries. In contrast to his approach to the Baltic states, he rejected the proposal of merging the new communist states into the Soviet Union, rather recognising them as independent nation-states. He was faced with the problem that there were few Marxists left in Eastern Europe, with most having been killed by the Nazis. He demanded that war reparations be paid by Germany and its Axis allies Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic. Aware that the countries of Eastern Europe had been pushed to socialism through invasion rather than revolution, Stalin called them &quot;people&#x27;s democracies&quot; instead of &quot;dictatorships of the proletariat&quot;.

Churchill observed that an &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; had been drawn across Europe, separating the east from the west. In September 1947, a meeting of East European communist leaders established Cominform to co-ordinate the Communist Parties across Eastern Europe and also in France and Italy. Stalin did not personally attend the meeting, sending Andrei Zhdanov in his place. Various East European communists also visited Stalin in Moscow. There, he offered advice on their ideas; for instance, he cautioned against the Yugoslav idea for a Balkan Federation incorporating Bulgaria and Albania. Stalin had a particularly strained relationship with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito due to the latter&#x27;s continued calls for a Balkan federation and for Soviet aid for the communist forces in the ongoing Greek Civil War. In March 1948, Stalin launched an anti-Tito campaign, accusing the Yugoslav communists of adventurism and deviating from Marxist–Leninist doctrine. At the second Cominform conference, held in Bucharest in June 1948, East European communist leaders all denounced Tito&#x27;s government, accusing them of being fascists and agents of Western capitalism. Stalin ordered several assassination attempts on Tito&#x27;s life and even contemplated an invasion of Yugoslavia itself.

Stalin suggested that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral. When the U.S. and UK opposed this, Stalin sought to force their hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948. He gambled that the Western powers would not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Stalin relented and ended the blockade. In September 1949 the Western powers transformed their zones into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed theirs into the German Democratic Republic in October. In accordance with earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections. In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR), and vote rigging was used to ensure that the PZPR secured office. The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged by Stalin, with the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party taking control. In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946. Monarchy was abolished in Bulgaria and Romania. Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet model was enforced, with a termination of political pluralism, agricultural collectivisation, and investment in heavy industry. It was aimed at establishing economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc.

====Asia====

In October 1949, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took power in China and proclaimed the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Marxist governments now controlled a third of the world&#x27;s land mass. Privately, Stalin revealed that he had underestimated the Chinese Communists and their ability to win the civil war, instead encouraging them to make another peace with the KMT. In December 1949, Mao visited Stalin. Initially Stalin refused to repeal the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945, which significantly benefited the Soviet Union over China, although in January 1950 he relented and agreed to sign a new treaty. Stalin was concerned that Mao might follow Tito&#x27;s example by pursuing a course independent of Soviet influence, and made it known that if displeased he would withdraw assistance; the Chinese desperately needed said assistance after decades of civil war.

At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States divided up the Korean Peninsula, formerly a Japanese colonial possession, along the 38th parallel, setting up a communist government in the north and a pro-Western, anti-communist government in the south. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung visited Stalin in March 1949 and again in March 1950; he wanted to invade the south, and although Stalin was initially reluctant to provide support, he eventually agreed by May 1950. The North Korean Army launched the Korean War by invading South Korea in June 1950, making swift gains and capturing Seoul. Both Stalin and Mao believed that a swift victory would ensue. The U.S. went to the UN Security Council—which the Soviets were boycotting over its refusal to recognise Mao&#x27;s government—and secured international military support for the South Koreans. U.S. led forces pushed the North Koreans back. Stalin wanted to avoid direct Soviet conflict with the U.S., and convinced the Chinese to enter the war to aid the North in October 1950.

The Soviet Union was one of the first nations to extend diplomatic recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948, in hopes of obtaining an ally in the Middle East. When the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who gathered to greet her. He was further angered by Israel&#x27;s growing alliance with the U.S. After Stalin fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. In November 1948, he abolished the JAC, and show trials took place for some of its members. The Soviet press engaged in vituperative attacks on Zionism, Jewish culture, and &quot;rootless cosmopolitanism&quot;, with growing levels of antisemitism being expressed across Soviet society. Stalin&#x27;s increasing tolerance of antisemitism may have stemmed from his increasing Russian nationalism or from the recognition that antisemitism had proved a useful tool for Hitler; he may have increasingly viewed the Jewish people as a &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; nation. There were rumours that Stalin was planning on deporting all Soviet Jews to the Jewish Autonomous Region in Birobidzhan in Siberia.

=== 1950–1953: Final years ===
In his later years, Stalin was in poor health. He took increasingly long holidays; in 1950 and again in 1951 he spent almost five months on holiday at his Abkhazian dacha. Stalin nevertheless mistrusted his doctors; in January 1952 he had one imprisoned after they suggested that he should retire to improve his health. In September 1952, several Kremlin doctors were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill senior politicians in what came to be known as the doctors&#x27; plot; the majority of the accused were Jewish. Stalin ordered that the doctors be tortured to ensure confessions. In November, the Slánský trial took place in Czechoslovakia, in which 13 senior Communist Party figures, 11 of them Jewish, were accused and convicted of being part of a vast Zionist-American conspiracy to subvert the Eastern Bloc. The same month, a much publicised trial of accused Jewish industrial wreckers took place in Ukraine. In 1951, Stalin initiated the Mingrelian affair, a purge of the Georgian Communist Party which resulted in over 11,000 deportations.

From 1946 until his death, Stalin only gave three public speeches, two of which lasted only a few minutes. The amount of written material that he produced also declined. In 1950, Stalin issued the article &quot;Marxism and Problems of Linguistics&quot;, which reflected his interest in questions of Russian nationhood. In 1952, Stalin&#x27;s last book, &quot;Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR&quot;, was published. It sought to provide a guide to leading the country after his death. In October 1952, he gave an hour and a half speech at the Central Committee plenum. There, he emphasised what he regarded as necessary leadership qualities, and highlighted the weaknesses of potential successors, notably Molotov and Mikoyan. In 1952, he eliminated the Politburo and replaced it with a larger version he named the Presidium.

====Death, funeral and aftermath====
On 1 March 1953, Stalin&#x27;s staff found him semi-conscious on the bedroom floor of his Kuntsevo Dacha. He was moved onto a couch and remained there for three days, during which he was hand-fed using a spoon and given various medicines and injections. Stalin&#x27;s condition continued to deteriorate, and he died on 5 March. An autopsy revealed that he had died of a cerebral haemorrhage, and that his cerebral arteries had been severely damaged by atherosclerosis. Stalin&#x27;s death was announced on 6 March; his body was embalmed, and then displayed in Moscow&#x27;s House of Unions for three days. The crowds coming to view the body were so large and disorganised that many people were killed in a crowd crush. At the funeral on 9 March, attended by hundreds of thousands, Stalin was laid to rest in Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum in Red Square.

Stalin left neither a designated successor nor a framework within which a peaceful transfer of power could take place. The Central Committee met on the day of his death, after which Malenkov, Beria, and Khrushchev emerged as the party&#x27;s dominant figures. The system of collective leadership was restored, and measures introduced to prevent any one member from attaining autocratic domination. The collective leadership included Georgy Malenkov, Lavrentiy Beria, Vyacheslav Molotov, Kliment Voroshilov, Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Bulganin, Lazar Kaganovich and Anastas Mikoyan. Reforms to the Soviet system were immediately implemented. Economic reform scaled back mass construction projects, placed a new emphasis on house building, and eased the levels of taxation on the peasantry to stimulate production. The new leaders sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia and a less hostile relationship with the U.S., and they pursued a negotiated end to the Korean War in July 1953. The imprisoned doctors were released and the antisemitic purges ceased. A mass amnesty for certain convicts was issued, halving the country&#x27;s inmate population, and the state security and Gulag systems were reformed.

==Political ideology==

Stalin claimed to have embraced Marxism at the age of 15, and it served as the guiding philosophy throughout his adult life; according to Kotkin, Stalin held &quot;zealous Marxist convictions&quot;, while Montefiore suggested that Marxism held a &quot;quasi-religious&quot; value for Stalin. Although he never became a Georgian nationalist, during his early life elements from Georgian nationalist thought blended with Marxism in his outlook. Stalin believed in the need to adapt Marxism to changing circumstances; in 1917, he declared that &quot;there is dogmatic Marxism and there is creative Marxism. I stand on the ground of the latter&quot;. According to scholar Robert Service, Stalin&#x27;s &quot;few innovations in ideology were crude, dubious developments of Marxism&quot;.

Stalin believed in an inevitable &quot;class war&quot; between the world&#x27;s proletariat and bourgeoisie in which the working classes would prove victorious and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, regarding the Soviet Union as an example of such a state. He also believed that this proletarian state would need to introduce repressive measures against foreign and domestic &quot;enemies&quot; to ensure the full crushing of the propertied classes, and thus the class war would intensify with the advance of socialism. As a propaganda tool, the shaming of &quot;enemies&quot; explained all inadequate economic and political outcomes, the hardships endured by the populace, and military failures.

Stalin adhered to the Leninist variant of Marxism. In his book, &quot;Foundations of Leninism&quot;, he stated that &quot;Leninism is the Marxism of the epoch of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution&quot;. He claimed to be a loyal Leninist, although was—according to Service—&quot;not a blindly obedient Leninist&quot;. Stalin respected Lenin, but not uncritically, and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong. During the period of his revolutionary activity, Stalin regarded some of Lenin&#x27;s views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoilt émigré, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself. After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences, although Kotkin suggested that Stalin&#x27;s friendship with Lenin was &quot;the single most important relationship in Stalin&#x27;s life&quot;.

Stalin viewed nations as contingent entities which were formed by capitalism and could merge into others. Ultimately, he believed that all nations would merge into a single, global community, and regarded all nations as inherently equal. In his work, he stated that &quot;the right of secession&quot; should be offered to the ethnic minorities of the Russian Empire, but that they should not be encouraged to take that option. He was of the view that if they became fully autonomous, then they would end up being controlled by the most reactionary elements of their community. Stalin&#x27;s push for Soviet westward expansion into Eastern Europe resulted in accusations of Russian imperialism.

==Personal life and characteristics==
Ethnically Georgian, Stalin grew up speaking the Georgian language, and did not begin learning Russian until age eight or nine. It has been argued that his ancestry was genetically Ossetian, but he never acknowledged an Ossetian identity. He remained proud of his Georgian identity, and throughout his life retained a heavy Georgian accent when speaking Russian. Some colleagues described him as &quot;Asiatic&quot;, and he supposedly said that &quot;I am not a European man, but an Asian, a Russified Georgian&quot;.
Described as soft-spoken and a poor orator, Stalin&#x27;s style was &quot;simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform &quot;. He rarely spoke before large audiences and preferred to express himself in writing. In adulthood, Stalin measured . His moustached face was pock-marked from smallpox during childhood; this was airbrushed from published photographs. His left arm had been injured in childhood which left it shorter than his right and lacking in flexibility. Stalin was a lifelong smoker, who smoked both a pipe and cigarettes. Publicly, he lived relatively plainly, with simple and inexpensive clothing and furniture. As leader, Stalin rarely left Moscow unless for holiday; he disliked travel, and refused to travel by plane. In 1934, his Kuntsevo Dacha was built from the Kremlin and became his primary residence. He holidayed in the south USSR every year from 1925 to 1936 and 1945 to 1951, often in Abkhazia, being a friend of its leader, Nestor Lakoba.

===Personality===

Trotsky and several other Soviet figures promoted the idea that Stalin was a mediocrity, a characterisation which gained widespread acceptance outside of the Soviet Union during his lifetime. However, historians note that he possessed a complex mind, remarkable self-control, and excellent memory. Stalin was a diligent worker and an effective and strategic organiser, with a keen interest in learning. As a leader, he meticulously scrutinised details, from film scripts to military plans, and judged others by their inner strength and cleverness. He was skilled at playing different roles depending on the audience, as well as in deception. Although he could be rude, Stalin rarely raised his voice; however, as his health deteriorated, he became unpredictable and bad-tempered. He could be charming and enjoyed cracking jokes when relaxed. At social events, Stalin encouraged singing and drinking, hoping others would drunkenly reveal secrets to him.

Stalin lacked compassion, possibly exacerbated by his repeated imprisonments and exiles, though he occasionally showed kindness to strangers, even during the Great Purge. He could be self-righteous, resentful, and vindictive, often holding grudges for years. By the 1920s, he had become suspicious and conspiratorial, prone to believing in plots against him and international conspiracies. While he never attended torture sessions or executions, Stalin took pleasure in degrading and humiliating people and kept even close associates in a state of &quot;unrelieved fear&quot;. Service suggested he had tendencies toward a paranoid and sociopathic personality disorder. Historian E.A. Rees believed it was psychopathy that bred Stalin&#x27;s tyranny, citing a 1927 diagnosis by neuropathologist Vladimir Bekhterev that described him as a &quot;typical case of severe paranoia&quot;. Others have linked Stalin&#x27;s brutality to his commitment to the survival of the Soviet Union and Marxist–Leninist ideology.

Stalin had a keen interest in the arts. He protected certain Soviet writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, even when their work was criticised as harmful to his regime. Stalin enjoyed classical music, owned around 2,700 records, and often attended the Bolshoi Theatre in the 1930s and 40s. His taste was conservative, favouring classical drama, opera, and ballet over what he dismissed as experimental &quot;formalism&quot;, and disliked avant-garde in the visual arts. An autodidact, Stalin was a voracious reader who kept over 20,000 books, with little fiction. His favourite subject was history, and he was especially interested in the reigns of Russian leaders Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great. Lenin was his favourite author, but he read and appreciated works by Trotsky and other adversaries.

===Relationships and family===

Stalin married his first wife, Ekaterina Svanidze, in 1906. Volkogonov suggested that she was &quot;probably the one human being he had really loved&quot;. When she died, Stalin allegedly said: &quot;This creature softened my heart of stone. She died and with her died my last warm feelings for humanity.&quot; They had a son, Yakov, who frequently frustrated and annoyed Stalin. After Yakov was captured by the German Army during World War II, Stalin refused to agree to a prisoner exchange between him and German field marshal Friedrich Paulus, and Yakov died at a Nazi concentration camp in 1943.

In exile in Solvychegodsk in 1910, Stalin had an affair with his landlady, Maria Kuzakova, who in 1911 gave birth to his alleged second son, Konstantin Kuzakov, who later taught philosophy at the Leningrad Military Mechanical Institute, but never met Stalin. In 1914 in Kureika, Stalin, aged 35, had a relationship with Lidia Pereprygina, aged 14 (considered a minor at the time), who allegedly became pregnant with Stalin&#x27;s child. In December 1914, Pereprygina gave birth to the child, although the infant died soon after. In 1916, Pereprygina was pregnant again. She gave birth to their alleged son, Alexander Davydov, in around April 1917. He was raised as the son of a peasant fisherman; Stalin later came to know of the child&#x27;s existence but showed no interest in him.

Stalin&#x27;s second wife was Nadezhda Alliluyeva, whom he married in 1919; theirs was not an easy relationship, they often fought. They had two biological children—a son, Vasily, and daughter, Svetlana—and adopted another son, Artyom Sergeev, in 1921. It is unclear if Stalin had a mistress during or after this marriage. She suspected he was unfaithful, and committed suicide in 1932. Stalin regarded Vasily as spoilt and often chastised his behaviour; as Stalin&#x27;s son, he was swiftly promoted through the Red Army and allowed a lavish lifestyle. Conversely, Stalin had an affectionate relationship with Svetlana during her childhood, and was very fond of Artyom. He disapproved of Svetlana&#x27;s suitors and husbands, which put strain on their relationship. After World War II, he made little time for his children, and his family played a diminishing role in his life. After Stalin&#x27;s death, Svetlana changed her surname to Alliluyeva, and defected to the U.S.

==Legacy==
The historian Robert Conquest stated that Stalin perhaps &quot;determined the course of the twentieth century&quot; more than any other individual. Leninists remain divided in their views on Stalin; some view him as Lenin&#x27;s authentic successor, while others believe he betrayed Lenin&#x27;s ideas by deviating from them. For most Westerners and anti-communist Russians, he is viewed overwhelmingly negatively as a mass murderer; for significant numbers of Russians and Georgians, he is regarded as a great statesman and state-builder. The historian Dmitri Volkogonov characterised him as &quot;one of the most powerful figures in human history.&quot;

According to Service, Stalin strengthened and stabilised the Soviet Union. In under three decades, Stalin transformed the country into a major industrial world power, one which could &quot;claim impressive achievements&quot; in terms of urbanisation, military strength, education and Soviet pride. Under his rule, the average Soviet life expectancy grew due to improved living conditions, nutrition and medical care as mortality rates declined. Although millions of Soviet citizens despised him, support for Stalin was nevertheless widespread throughout Soviet society. Conversely, the historian Vadim Rogovin argued that Stalin&#x27;s purges &quot;caused losses to the communist movement both in the USSR and throughout the world from which the movement has not recovered to this very day&quot;. Similarly, Nikita Khrushchev believed his purges of the Old Bolsheviks and leading figures in the military and academia had &quot;undoubtedly&quot; weakened the nation.
Stalin&#x27;s necessity for the Soviet Union&#x27;s economic development has been questioned, and it has been argued that his policies from 1928 onwards may have been a limiting factor. Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union has been characterised as a totalitarian state, with Stalin its authoritarian leader. Various biographers have described him as a dictator, an autocrat, or accused him of practising Caesarism. Montefiore argued that while Stalin initially ruled as part of a Communist Party oligarchy, the government transformed into a personal dictatorship in 1934, with Stalin only becoming &quot;absolute dictator&quot; after March–June 1937, when senior military and NKVD figures were eliminated. In both the Soviet Union and elsewhere he came to be portrayed as an &quot;Oriental despot&quot;. McDermott nevertheless cautioned against &quot;over-simplistic stereotypes&quot;—promoted in the fiction of writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn—which portrayed Stalin as an omnipotent and omnipresent tyrant who controlled every aspect of Soviet life.

A vast literature devoted to Stalin has been produced. During Stalin&#x27;s lifetime, his approved biographies were largely hagiographic in content. Stalin ensured that these works gave very little attention to his early life, particularly because he did not wish to emphasise his Georgian origins in a state numerically dominated by Russians. Since his death many more biographies have been written, although until the 1980s these relied largely on the same sources of information. Under Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s Soviet administration various previously classified files on Stalin&#x27;s life were made available to historians, at which point he became &quot;one of the most urgent and vital issues on the public agenda&quot; in the Soviet Union. After the dissolution of the Union in 1991, the rest of the archives were opened to historians, resulting in much new information about Stalin coming to light, and producing a flood of new research.

===Death toll ===
 
Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the archival revelations, some Western historians estimated that the numbers killed by Stalin&#x27;s regime were 20 million or higher. The scholarly consensus affirms that Soviet archival materials declassified in 1991 contain irrefutable data much lower than Western sources used prior to 1991, such as statements from emigres and other informants.

After the Soviet Union dissolved, evidence from the Soviet archives was declassified, and researchers were allowed to study it. This contained official records of 799,455 executions (1921–1953), around 1.5 to 1.7 million deaths in the Gulag, some 390,000 deaths during the dekulakisation forced resettlement, and up to 400,000 deaths of persons deported during the 1940s, with a total of about 3.3 million officially recorded victims in these categories. According to historian Stephen Wheatcroft, approximately 1 million of these deaths were &quot;purposive&quot; while the rest happened through neglect and irresponsibility.
The deaths of at least 3.5 to 6.5 million persons in the Soviet famine of 1932–1933 are sometimes, though not always, included with the victims of the Stalin era. Stalin has also been accused of genocide in the cases of forced population transfer of ethnic minorities across the Soviet Union and the Holodomor famine However, British historian Michael Ellman argues that mass deaths from famines should be placed in a different category than the repression victims, mentioning that throughout Russian history famines and droughts have been a common occurrence. Famines were widespread throughout the world in the 19th and 20th centuries in countries such as China, India, Ireland, and Russia. Ellman compared the behaviour of the Stalinist regime to that of the British government (towards Ireland and India) and the G8 in contemporary times, and Stalin&#x27;s &quot;behaviour was no worse than that of many rulers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries&quot;.

===In the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states===
Shortly after his death, the Soviet Union went through a period of de-Stalinisation. Malenkov denounced the Stalin personality cult, and the cult was subsequently criticised in &quot;Pravda&quot;. In 1956, Khrushchev gave his &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, titled &quot;On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences&quot;, to a closed session of the Party&#x27;s 20th Congress. There, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for both his mass repression and his personality cult. He repeated these denunciations at the 22nd Party Congress in October 1962. In October 1961, Stalin&#x27;s body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, the location marked by a bust. Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd that year.

Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinisation process ended when he was replaced as leader by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964; the latter introduced a level of re-Stalinisation within the Soviet Union. In 1969 and again in 1979, plans were proposed for a full rehabilitation of Stalin&#x27;s legacy but on both occasions were halted due to fears of damaging the USSR&#x27;s public image. Mikhail Gorbachev saw the total denunciation of Stalin as necessary for the regeneration of Soviet society. 

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Boris Yeltsin continued Gorbachev&#x27;s denunciation of Stalin but added to it a denunciation of Lenin. His successor Vladimir Putin did not seek to rehabilitate Stalin but emphasised the celebration of Soviet achievements under Stalin&#x27;s leadership rather than the Stalinist repressions. In October 2017, Putin opened the Wall of Grief memorial in Moscow. In recent years, the government and general public of Russia has been accused of rehabilitating Stalin. 

Admiration for Stalin has remained consistently widespread in Georgia, although Georgian attitudes have been very divided. A number of Georgians resent criticism of Stalin, the most famous figure from their nation&#x27;s modern history.
