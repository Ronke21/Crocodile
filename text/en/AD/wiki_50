<text>Kid Icarus is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan and the Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe and North America. It was released in Japan in December 1986, in Europe in February 1987, and in North America in July.

The plot of &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; revolves around protagonist Pit&#x27;s quest for three sacred treasures, which he must equip to rescue the Greek-inspired fantasy world Angel Land and its ruler, the goddess Palutena. The player controls Pit through platform areas while fighting monsters and collecting items. The objective is to reach the end of the levels, and to find and defeat boss monsters that guard the three treasures. The game was developed by Nintendo&#x27;s Research and Development 1 division with assistance with an external company (later identified to be Tose), which helped with testing. It was designed by Toru Osawa and Yoshio Sakamoto, directed by Satoru Okada, and produced by Gunpei Yokoi.

&quot;Kid Icarus&quot; had a mixed critical reception but became a cult classic. Reviewers praised its music and its mixture of gameplay elements from different genres, but criticized its graphics and high difficulty level. It was included in several lists of the best games compiled by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;.

It was later re-released for the Game Boy Advance in Japan in 2004. It was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2007 and the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2013. A &quot;3D Classics&quot; remake was released in Japan in 2011 and in North America, Europe, and Australia in 2012. In 2016, &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; was included on the North American and PAL region releases of the NES Classic Edition. It was released on Nintendo Switch Online in 2019.

A sequel, &quot;Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters&quot;, was released for the Game Boy in 1991. A third entry in the series, &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in March 2012, after Pit&#x27;s inclusion as a playable character in the 2008 game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Kid Icarus&quot; is a side-scrolling platformer with role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist Pit through two-dimensional levels, which contain monsters, obstacles and items. Pit&#x27;s primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows that can be upgraded with three collectable power items: the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies, the flaming arrows hit multiple targets, and the holly bow increases the range of the arrows. These upgrades will work only if Pit&#x27;s health is high enough. The game keeps track of the player&#x27;s score, and increases Pit&#x27;s health bar at the end of a level if enough points were collected.

Throughout the stages, the player may enter doors to access seven different types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit&#x27;s health. In the god&#x27;s chamber, the strength of Pit&#x27;s bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors, such as the number of enemies defeated and the amount of damage taken in battle. In the training chamber, Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if he passes a test of endurance.

The game world is divided into three stages: the Underworld, the Overworld (Earth) and the Skyworld. Each stage encompasses three unidirectional area levels and a fortress. The areas of the Underworld and Skyworld stages have Pit climb to the top, while those of the surface world are side-scrolling levels. The fortresses at the end of the stages are labyrinths with non-scrolling rooms, in which the player must find and defeat a gatekeeper boss. Within a fortress, Pit may buy a check sheet, pencil, and torch to guide him through the labyrinth. A single-use item, the hammer, can destroy stone statues, which frees a flying soldier called a Centurion that will aid the player in boss battles. For each of the bosses destroyed, Pit receives one of three sacred treasures that are needed to access the fourth and final stage, the sky temple. This last portion abandons the platforming elements of the previous levels, and resembles a scrolling shooter.

==Plot==
The game is set in Angel Land, which is a fantasy world with a Greek mythology theme. Before the events of the game, Earth was ruled by Palutena (Goddess of Light) and Medusa (Goddess of Darkness). Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy. Medusa hated the humans, dried up their crop, and turned them to stone. Enraged by this, Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster and banished her to the Underworld. Out of revenge, Medusa conspired with the monsters of the Underworld to take over Palutena&#x27;s residence the Palace in the Sky. She launched a surprise attack, and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield, the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena&#x27;s army of its power. After her soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa, Palutena was defeated in battle and imprisoned deep inside the Palace in the Sky.

With her last power, she sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit. He escapes from his prison in the Underworld and sets out to save Palutena and Angel Land. Throughout the course of the story, Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at their respective fortresses in the Underworld, the Overworld, and the Skyworld. Afterward, he equips himself with the treasures and storms the sky temple where he defeats Medusa and rescues Palutena. The game has five different endings; depending on the player&#x27;s performance, Palutena may present Pit with headgear or transform him into a full-grown angel. In the Japanese version, the best ending from the English version does not exist, and instead another bad ending is present.

==Development==
The game was designed at Nintendo&#x27;s Research and Development 1 (R&amp;D1) division. It was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because its floppy disk, called Disk Card, has three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer&#x27;s cartridges of the time. Combined with the possibility to store the players&#x27; progress, the Disk Card format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; was the debut of Toru Osawa (credited as Inusawa) as a video game designer, and he was the only staff member working on the game at the beginning of the project. Originally he wanted to make an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. He drew the pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype. After Nintendo&#x27;s action-adventure &quot;Metroid&quot; had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;.

The game was directed by Satoru Okada (credited as S. Okada), and produced by the general manager of the R&amp;D1 division, Gunpei Yokoi (credited as G. Yokoi). Hirokazu Tanaka (credited as Hip Tanaka) composed the music. Yoshio Sakamoto (credited as Shikao.S) joined the team upon return from his vacation after the completion of &quot;Metroid&quot;. He streamlined the development process, and made many decisions that affected the design of &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;. Several out-of-place elements were included in the game, such as credit cards, a wizard turning player character Pit into an eggplant, and a large, moving nose that was meant to resemble composer Tanaka. Sakamoto attributed this unrestrained humor to the former personnel of the R&amp;D1 division, which he referred to as &quot;strange&quot;. Osawa said that he had originally tried to make &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; completely serious, but opted for a more humorous approach after objections from the team.

To meet the projected release date of December 19, 1986, the staff members worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night. They used torn cardboard boxes as beds, and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building. Eventually, &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; was finished and entered production a mere three days before the release date. Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts.

==Release==
In February and July 1987, respectively, a cartridge-based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America. For this release, the graphics of the ending were updated, and staff credits were added. Unlike the Japanese version, which saves the player&#x27;s progress on the Disk Card, the cartridge version uses a password system to restore progress, an almost unprecedented feature.

In August 2004, &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; was re-released in the &quot;Famicom Mini Disk System Selection&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. It was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console on January 23, 2007, in Japan, on February 12 in North America, and on February 23 in Europe and Australia; it was released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console on August 14, 2013, in Japan, on July 11 in Europe and Australia, and on July 25 in North America. Passwords from the NES version do not work in the Virtual Console version. In 2016, the game was included on the North American and PAL region releases of the NES Classic Edition. In 2019, it was released on Nintendo Switch Online.

===&quot;3D Classics&quot;===
A &quot;3D Classics&quot; remake of &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; was published for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console. The remake features stereoscopic 3D along with updated graphics including backgrounds. It uses the save system instead of passwords. It has the Family Computer Disk System&#x27;s extra sound channel for music and sound effects.

It became available on the Nintendo eShop on January 18, 2012, in Japan, on February 2 in Europe, on April 12 in Australia, and on April 19 in North America. It was available early for free via download code to users who registered two selected 3DS games with Nintendo in Japan, Europe, and Australia. In Japan, it was available to users who registered any two Nintendo 3DS games on Club Nintendo between October 1, 2011, and January 15, 2012, and became available for download starting on December 19, 2011; in Europe, it was available to users who registered any two of a selection of Nintendo 3DS games on Club Nintendo between November 1, 2011, and January 31, 2012, with the first batch of emails with codes being sent out on January 5, 2012; in Australia, it was available to users who registered any two of a selection of Nintendo 3DS games on Club Nintendo between November 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012, with the first batch of emails with codes being sent out in January 2012. In North America, download codes for the &quot;3D Classics&quot; version were given to customers who pre-ordered &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot; at select retailers when they picked up the game, which was released on March 23, 2012, allowing them to obtain the game early.

==Reception==

By late 2003, 1.76 million copies of &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; had been sold worldwide, with a cult following. It received mixed reviews from critics over the years. In October 1992, a staff writer of the UK publication &quot;Nintendo Magazine System&quot; said that it was &quot;pretty good fun&quot;, but did not &quot;compare too well&quot; to other platform games, due in part to its &quot;rather dated&quot; graphics. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine&#x27;s Stuart Hunt called it an &quot;unsung hero of the NES&quot; that &quot;looks and sounds pretty&quot;. He described the music as &quot;sublime&quot;, and the enemy characters as &quot;brilliantly drawn&quot;. Although he considered the blend of gameplay elements from different genres a success, he said that it suffered from &quot;frustrating&quot; design flaws, such as its high difficulty level. Jeremy Parish of &quot;1Up.com&quot; disagreed with the game&#x27;s status as an &quot;unfairly forgotten masterpiece&quot; among its substantial Internet following. He found it to be &quot;underwhelming&quot;, &quot;buggy&quot;, and &quot;pretty annoying&quot;, because of &quot;shrill music, loose controls, and some weird design decisions&quot;. He said that the game was &quot;[not] terrible, or even bad – just a little lacking&quot;. He recommended players to buy the Virtual Console version, if only because it allowed them to experience &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; &quot;with a fresh perspective&quot;.

&quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Frank Provo reviewed the Virtual Console version. He noted that the gameplay was &quot;[not] the most unique blueprint for a video game&quot;, but that it had been &quot;fairly fresh back in 1987&quot;. He considered the difficulty &quot;excessive&quot;, and found certain areas to be designed to frustrate players. He said that the presentation had not aged well. Though favoring the Grecian scenery, he criticized the graphics for the small, bicolored, and barely animated sprites, the black backgrounds, and the absence of multiple scrolling layers. He said the music was &quot;nicely composed&quot;, but the sound effects were &quot;all taps and thuds&quot;. He was dissatisfied with the emulation, because the Virtual Console release preserves the slowdown problems of the NES, and removed its cheat codes. He warned potential buyers that they might appreciate &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; for its &quot;straightforward gameplay and challenging level layouts&quot;, but might &quot;find nothing special in the gameplay and recoil in horror at the unflinching difficulty&quot;. Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the game design was &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;not Nintendo&#x27;s most focused&quot;. He said it had &quot;[not] aged in as timeless a manner as many other first-party Nintendo games from the NES era&quot;, and described it as &quot;one of those games that made a lot more sense back in the &#x27;80s, accompanied by a tips and tricks strategy sheet&quot;. He complimented the theme music, which he considered heroic and memorable. In his review of the Virtual Console release, Thomas criticized the removal of cheat codes as &quot;nonsensical&quot;. He found it to be &quot;not an issue worthy of a prolonged rant&quot;, but said that &quot;[Nintendo has] willfully edited its product, and damaged its nostalgic value in the process&quot;.

&quot;Kid Icarus&quot; is &quot;IGN&quot;″s 20th of the top 100 NES games and 84th of the top 100 games of all time. It is 34th on &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s 1997 &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;, which said it &quot;was one of the first big NES games to show that the system went way beyond offering the single-screen arcade-style experience&quot;. In 2001 &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it the 83rd best game ever made. They claimed that despite its high level of difficulty and frustration, it was fun enough to be worth playing. The game was inducted into &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, and was voted 54th place in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s top 200 Nintendo games. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also listed it as the 20th best NES video game, and praised it for its &quot;unique vertically scrolling stages, fun platforming, and infectious 8-bit tunes&quot;, but with &quot;unmerciful difficulty&quot;. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; placed the game 67th on a list of greatest Nintendo games.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
A Game Boy sequel to &quot;Kid Icarus&quot;, titled &quot;Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters&quot;, was released in North America in November 1991, and in Europe on May 21, 1992. It was developed by Nintendo and Tose, and largely adopts the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor. &quot;Of Myths and Monsters&quot; remained the last installment in the series for over 20 years.

In 2008, a 3D &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; game for the Wii was allegedly in development by the German American studio Factor 5, but was in production without the approval of Nintendo, and Factor 5 canceled multiple projects following the closure of its American branch in early 2009. In a 2010 interview, Yoshio Sakamoto was asked about a &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; game for the Wii, to which he replied that he was not aware of any plans to revive the franchise. A new series entry for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot;, was eventually released in 2012. The game is a third-person shooter, and was developed by Project Sora, the company of &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; designer Masahiro Sakurai.

===Other appearances===
Pit is a recurring character named &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; in the American animated television series &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot;, and made cameo appearances in Nintendo games such as &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;F-1 Race&quot;, and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

In May 2011, independent developer Flip Industries released &quot;Super Kid Icarus&quot;, an unofficial Flash game with a SNES style.

In &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, Mario is seen playing &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; in his room shortly after an argument with his family.

<doc id="16894" wikidata="Q11998" url="?curid=16894" title="Kylie Minogue">
<text>Kylie Ann Minogue (; born 28 May 1968), also known mononymously as Kylie, is an Australian singer, songwriter, and actress. Frequently referred to as the &quot;Princess of Pop&quot;, she has achieved recognition in both the music industry and fashion world as a major style icon. Her accolades include two Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards and eighteen ARIA Music Awards. Minogue is the highest-selling Australian female artist of all time, with sales surpassing 80 million records worldwide. In 2024, &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the most influential people in the world.

Born and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring as Charlene Robinson in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; (1986–1988). She began her music career in the late 1980s, releasing four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums under PWL. By the early 1990s, Minogue had amassed several hit singles in Australia and the UK, including &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;, &quot;Especially for You&quot;, &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot;, and &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;. Taking more creative control over her music, she signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released the albums &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; (1994) and &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997).

By joining Parlophone in 1999, Minogue returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with &quot;Light Years&quot; (2000), including the number-one hits &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;. The follow-up, &quot;Fever&quot; (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. The lead single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units. Follow-up singles &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; became hits as well. She continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as &quot;Slow&quot;, &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, &quot;2 Hearts&quot; and &quot;All the Lovers&quot;. In 2017, she signed with BMG Rights Management, leading to several number-one albums in Australia and the UK - &quot;Golden&quot; (2018), &quot;Step Back in Time: The Definitive Collection&quot; (2019), &quot;Disco&quot; (2020), &quot;Tension&quot; (2023) and &quot;Tension II&quot; (2024). She is the only female artist in the UK charts with chart-topping albums and a top ten single in five consecutive decades.

In film, Minogue made her debut in &quot;The Delinquents&quot; (1989), and appeared in &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1994), &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001), &quot;Holy Motors&quot; (2012) and &quot;San Andreas&quot; (2015). In reality television, she appeared as a judge on &quot;The Voice UK&quot; and &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;, both in 2014. Her other ventures include product endorsements, books, perfumes, charitable work and a wine brand. Minogue&#x27;s achievements include being an ARIA Hall of Fame inductee, Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Chevalier (knight) of the and an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.).

==Life and career==
===1968–1986: Early life and career beginnings===
Kylie Ann Minogue was born at Bethlehem Hospital in Caulfield South, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, on 28 May 1968, to car company accountant Ronald Charles Minogue and his wife Carol Ann (née Jones), a former ballet dancer. Her mother moved to Australia from Wales in 1958 as part of an assisted migration scheme on the ship &quot;Fairsea&quot;. Also aboard were the Gibb family of later Bee Gees fame. Minogue is of English and Welsh descent (though her surname is of Irish origin) and was named after the Nyungar word for &quot;boomerang&quot;. She is the eldest of three children: her brother, Brendan Minogue, is a news cameraman in Australia, and her sister, Dannii Minogue, is an actress, singer and television host. The family frequently moved around various suburbs in Melbourne to sustain their living expenses, which Minogue found unsettling as a child. She often stayed at home reading, sewing, and learning to play violin and piano. When they moved to Surrey Hills, Victoria, she went on to Camberwell High School. During her schooling years, she found it difficult to make friends. She got her HSC with subjects including Arts and Graphics and English. Minogue described herself as being of &quot;average intelligence&quot; and &quot;quite modest&quot; during her high school years. Growing up, she and her sister Dannii took singing and dancing lessons.

A 10-year-old Minogue accompanied Dannii to a hearing arranged by the sisters&#x27; aunt, Suzette, and, while producers found Dannii too young, Australian television producer Alan Hardy gave Minogue a minor role in soap opera &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (1979). She also appeared in another small role in soap opera &quot;Skyways&quot; (1980). In 1985, she was cast in one of the lead roles in the television series &quot;The Henderson Kids&quot;. Minogue took time off school to film &quot;The Henderson Kids&quot; and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt she needed the independence to make it into the entertainment industry. During filming, co-star Nadine Garner labelled Minogue &quot;fragile&quot; after producers yelled at her for forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set. Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after Hardy felt the need for her character to be &quot;written off&quot;. In retrospect, Hardy stated removing her from the show &quot;turned out to be the best thing for her&quot;. Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a demo tape for the producers of weekly music program &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Minogue gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985, and was not invited to join the cast.

She was cast in the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. The show achieved popularity in the UK and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20 million viewers. She became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one year and was the youngest recipient of the &quot;Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television&quot;, with the result determined by public vote.

===1987–1989: &quot;Kylie&quot; and &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;===
During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert, Minogue performed &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; as a duet with fellow actor John Waters, and &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; as an encore. Producer Greg Petherick arranged for Minogue to record a demo of the latter song, re-titled as &quot;Locomotion&quot;. The demo was sent to the head of Mushroom Records Michael Gudinski, who decided to sign Minogue in early 1987 based on her popularity from &quot;Neighbours&quot;. The track was first recorded in big band style, and was later given a completely new backing track by producer Mike Duffy, inspired by the hi-NRG sound of English band Dead or Alive. &quot;Locomotion&quot; was released as her debut single in Australia on 13 July 1987, the week after the wedding episode of &quot;Neighbours&quot; premiered. The single became the best-selling single of the decade in Australia, according to the Kent Music Report.

The success of the single resulted in Minogue travelling to London to work with record producing trio Stock Aitken Waterman in September 1987. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten she was arriving; as a result, they wrote &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; while she waited outside the studio. The track was written and recorded in under 40 minutes. The song reached number one in Australia, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Switzerland and the UK. Although Minogue needed to be convinced to work with Stock Aitken Waterman again after feeling she&#x27;d been disrespected during her first recording session, more sessions with the producers occurred from February to April 1988 in London and Melbourne, where the singer was filming her last episodes for &quot;Neighbours&quot;. The trio ended up composing and producing all the tracks on the forthcoming album and produced a new version of &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;. Producer Pete Waterman justified the highly controversial decision to re-record the latter track by claiming Minogue&#x27;s platinum-selling Australian version was poorly produced, but Mike Duffy instead blamed the decision on Waterman&#x27;s alleged wish to claim the prestige and royalties from the track&#x27;s placement on the soundtrack of the 1988 film &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks.&quot;
Minogue&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Kylie&quot;, was released in July 1988. The album is a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one, eventually becoming the best-selling album of the 1980s by a female artist. It went gold in the United States, while the single &quot;The Locomotion&quot; reached number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian dance chart. The single &quot;Got to Be Certain&quot; became her third consecutive number one single in Australia. Later in the year, she left &quot;Neighbours&quot; to focus on her music career. She collaborated with Jason Donovan on the song &quot;Especially for You&quot; after &quot;intense&quot; demand for the duet from the public, media and retailers overcame her initial reservations. The single peaked at number one in the UK. By December 2014, it sold its one-millionth copy in the country. She was sometimes referred to as &quot;the Singing Budgie&quot; by her detractors over the coming years. In a review of the album &quot;Kylie&quot; for AllMusic, Chris True described the tunes as &quot;standard, late-80s ... bubblegum&quot;, but added, &quot;her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable&quot;. She received the ARIA Award for the year&#x27;s highest-selling single. She won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year&#x27;s highest-selling single and received a &quot;Special Achievement Award&quot;.

Minogue&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;, was released in October 1989. The album was number-one in the UK, and spawned the number-one singles in the country such as &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Tears on My Pillow&quot;. In North America, it failed to sell well and she was dropped by American record label Geffen Records. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, stated &quot;there isn&#x27;t a lot to differentiate her sophomore effort from its predecessor by repeating the sonic template of her debut album.&quot; In support of the album, she embarked on her concert tour, the Enjoy Yourself Tour in Europe, Asia and Australia in February 1990. Minogue&#x27;s debut film, &quot;The Delinquents&quot;, was released in December 1989. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was popular with audiences. In the UK, it grossed more than £200,000, and in Australia, it was the fourth-highest-grossing local film of 1989 and the highest-grossing local film of 1990. From 1989 to 1991, Minogue dated Australian INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.

===1990–1992: &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
Unhappy with her level of creative input on her first two albums, Minogue worked with her manager Terry Blamey and her Australian label Mushroom Records to force a change in her relationship with SAW, and to push for a more mature sound. Minogue&#x27;s third album, &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot;, was released in November 1990 and was described as &quot;leaps and bounds more mature&quot; than her previous albums by AllMusic&#x27;s Chris True. The project contained more &quot;sophisticated&quot; themes and influences, with composer Mike Stock stating that &quot;Shocked&quot; was influenced by the writings of Virginia Woolf, and was meant to be evocative of &quot;a trip&quot;. Despite exhibiting creative growth, the album did not match the commercial success of its predecessors, peaking at number nine in the UK. However, Blamey described the album as a &quot;big success&quot; that &quot;made lots of money for PWL&quot;. Three of its singles – &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, &quot;Step Back in Time&quot; and &quot;Shocked&quot; – reached the top ten in Australia. In the UK, all four singles entered the top ten.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ernest Macias observed that, by the third album, Minogue &quot;presented a more mature and sexually-fuelled image&quot;. Macias also pointed out that the album &quot;showcases the beginning of Minogue&#x27;s career as a pop icon, propelled by her angelic vocals, sensual music videos, chic fashion, and distinct dance sound.&quot; Minogue&#x27;s relationship with Australian musician-actor Michael Hutchence was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona. The making of the music video for &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot; was the first time Minogue &quot;felt part of the creative process&quot;. She said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t in charge, but I had a voice. I&#x27;d bought some clothes on King&#x27;s Road for the video. I saw a new way to express my point of view creatively.&quot; To promote the album, she embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991.

Minogue&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;, was released in October 1991. It peaked at number fifteen in the UK, making it her first album to fail to reach the top ten. The first single from the album, &quot;Word Is Out&quot;, became her first one to miss the top ten in the UK. Subsequent singles &quot;If You Were with Me Now&quot;, &quot;Give Me Just a Little More Time&quot; and &quot;Finer Feelings&quot; – all reached the top eleven. Nick Levine of Digital Spy labelled the album &quot;lacking a moment of pure pop brilliance to match her [Minogue&#x27;s] previously released singles.&quot; In support of the album, she embarked on the Let&#x27;s Get to It Tour in October. She later expressed her opinion that Stock, Aitken and Waterman stifled her, saying, &quot;I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right.&quot;

Minogue&#x27;s first best-of compilation album, titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released in August 1992. Chris True of AllMusic called it &quot;an excellent overview of the first half of Minogue&#x27;s career.&quot; It reached number one in the UK and number three in Australia. The compilation&#x27;s singles – &quot;What Kind of Fool (Heard All That Before)&quot; and a cover of Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Celebration&quot;, both peaked outside of the top ten in the UK. By the end of 1992, PWL did not renew their contract with Minogue, believing the singer &quot;was [not] moving in a direction that was going to be successful&quot;.

===1993–1999: &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; and &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;===
Minogue&#x27;s signing with British record label Deconstruction Records in 1993 marked a new phase in her career. Her fifth studio album, &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot;, was released in September 1994 and was a departure from her previous efforts as it &quot;no longer featured the Stock-Aitken-Waterman production gloss&quot;, with critics noting Minogue&#x27;s vocals and the album production. It was produced by dance music producers the Brothers in Rhythm, namely Dave Seaman and Steve Anderson, who had previously produced &quot;Finer Feelings&quot;. As of 2015, Anderson continued to be Minogue&#x27;s musical director. The album peaked at number four in the UK. Its lead single, &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, spent four weeks at number one in Australia, and peaked at number two in the UK. The follow-up singles, &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; and &quot;Where Is the Feeling?&quot;, both reached the top twenty in the UK.

During this period, Minogue made a guest appearance as herself in an episode of the British sitcom, &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;. Director Steven E. de Souza saw her cover photo in Australia&#x27;s &quot;Who Magazine&quot; as one of &quot;The 30 Most Beautiful People in the World&quot; and offered her a role opposite Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme in the film &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. The film was a moderate success, earning US$70 million in the U.S. box-office, and received &quot;poor&quot; reviews, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Richard Harrington calling Minogue &quot;the worst actress in the English-speaking world&quot;. She had an affair with Van Damme while shooting the film in Thailand. She had a minor role in the 1996 film &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; starring American actors Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin. She also appeared in the 1995 short film &quot;Hayride to Hell&quot; and in the 1997 film &quot;Diana &amp; Me&quot;. In 1995, she collaborated with Australian artist Nick Cave for the song &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;. Cave had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, saying it contained &quot;one of pop music&#x27;s most violent and distressing lyrics&quot;. The music video for the song was inspired by John Everett Millais&#x27;s painting &quot;Ophelia&quot; (1851–52), and showed Minogue as the murdered woman, floating in a pond as a serpent swam over her body. The single received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and reached number two in Australia. The song won ARIA Awards for &quot;Song of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot;. Following concert appearances with Cave, Minogue recited the lyrics to &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; as poetry in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

By 1997, Minogue was in a relationship with French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui, who encouraged her to develop her creativity. Inspired by a mutual appreciation of Japanese culture, they created a visual combination of &quot;geisha and manga superheroine&quot; for the photographs taken for Minogue&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, and the music video for &quot;GBI (German Bold Italic)&quot;, her collaboration with Japanese musician Towa Tei. She drew inspiration from the music of artists such as Scottish singer Shirley Manson and American rock band Garbage, Icelandic singer Björk, British rapper Tricky and Irish rock band U2, and Japanese pop musicians such as Pizzicato Five and Towa Tei. The album featured collaborations with musicians including James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of the Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers. It garnered some negative reviews upon its release in 1997, but would be cited as her &quot;most personal&quot; and &quot;best&quot; work in retrospective reviews. In 2003, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani called it a &quot;deeply personal effort&quot; and &quot;Minogue&#x27;s best album to date&quot;, with the magazine later ranking it as her best album. Evan Sawdey, from &quot;PopMatters&quot;, described the album as &quot;one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created&quot; in a 2008 review. Mostly a dance album, she countered suggestions she was trying to become an indie artist.

Acknowledging Minogue had attempted to escape the perceptions of her that had developed during her early career, she commented she was ready to &quot;forget the painful criticism&quot; and &quot;accept the past, embrace it, use it&quot;. The music video for &quot;Did It Again&quot; paid homage to her earlier &quot;incarnations&quot;. Retitled &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; in the UK following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, it became the lowest-selling album of her career. At the end of the year, a campaign by &quot;Virgin Radio&quot; stated, &quot;We&#x27;ve done something to improve Minogue&#x27;s records: we&#x27;ve banned them.&quot; The lead single &quot;Some Kind of Bliss&quot; failed to reach the top twenty in the UK, whereas &quot;Did It Again&quot; fared better, reaching the top fifteen in both the UK and Australia. In Australia, the album was a success and spent 35 weeks on the album chart. After the album&#x27;s release, she was dropped by Deconstruction in 1998. Her Intimate and Live tour in 1998 was extended due to demand. She gave several live performances in Australia, including the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and the opening ceremonies of Melbourne&#x27;s Crown Casino, and Sydney&#x27;s Fox Studios in 1999 (where she performed Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;) as well as a Christmas concert in Dili, East Timor, in association with the United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces. She performed a duet with the English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys&#x27; on their &quot;Nightlife&quot; album and spent several months in Barbados performing in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. She then appeared in the film &quot;Sample People&quot; and recorded a cover version of Russell Morris&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot; for the soundtrack. 

===2000–2002: &quot;Light Years&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;===
Minogue signed with German–British record label Parlophone in April, who wanted to re-establish Minogue as a pop artist. Her seventh studio album, &quot;Light Years&quot;, was released in September 2000. &quot;NME&quot; magazine called it a &quot;fun, perfectly-formed&quot; record, which saw Minogue &quot;dropping her considerable concern for cool and bouncing back to her disco-pop roots&quot;. It was a commercial success, becoming her first number one album in her native Australia and charting at number two in the UK. The lead single, &quot;Spinning Around&quot;, debuted atop the UK in July, making her the second artist to have a number-one single in three consecutive decades, after American singer-songwriter Madonna. Its accompanying video featured Minogue in revealing gold hotpants, which came to be regarded as a &quot;trademark&quot;. Three other singles — &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, &quot;Kids&quot; with English singer Robbie Williams and &quot;Please Stay&quot; all peaked in the top ten in the UK, with the former becoming her sixth number-one in Australia.

An elaborate art book titled &quot;Kylie&quot;, featuring contributions by Minogue and creative director William Baker, was published by Booth-Clibborn in March 2000. At the time, she began a romantic relationship with model James Gooding. Their relationship ended after two and a half years. In October, she performed at both the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics and in the opening ceremony of the Paralympics, all held in Sydney. Her performance of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was chosen as one of the most memorable Olympic closing ceremony moments by Kate Samuelson of &quot;TNT&quot;. In March 2001, she embarked on the On a Night Like This Tour, which was inspired by the style of Broadway shows and the musicals of the 1930s. She also made a brief cameo as The Green Fairy in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s film, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;. It earned her an MTV Movie Award nomination in 2002. &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;Light Years&quot; consecutively won the ARIA Award for Best Pop Release in 2000 and 2001. In early 2001, she launched her own brand of underwear called &quot;Love Kylie&quot; in partnership with the Holeproof brand of Australian Pacific Brands.

In September 2001, Minogue released &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;, the lead single from her eighth studio album, &quot;Fever&quot;. It reached number one in over forty countries and sold five million copies, becoming her most successful single. The accompanying music video featured the singer sporting a hooded white jumpsuit with deep plunging neckline. The remaining singles — &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and &quot;Come into My World&quot; — all peaked in the top ten in Australia and the UK. The album was released in October and topped the charts in Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland, and the UK, eventually achieving worldwide sales in excess of six million. Dominique Leone from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; complimented its simple and &quot;comfortable&quot; composition, terming it a &quot;mature sound from a mature artist, and one that may very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation&quot;.
The warm reception towards the album led to its release in the U.S. in February 2002, through Capitol Records. Her first release in the U.S. in thirteen years led to her highest-charting album in the country, debuting at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On the Canadian Albums Chart, it peaked at number ten.

In April 2002, Minogue embarked on her KylieFever2002 tour in Europe and Australia, in support of the album. In the U.S., she performed several songs from the setlist in a series of KIIS-FM Jingle Ball concerts throughout 2002 and 2003. She received four accolades at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002, including Highest Selling Single and Single of the Year for &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. That same year, she won her first Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist and Best International Album for &quot;Fever&quot;. She also performed a mashup of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; and New Order&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; at the show, which was named one of the &quot;50 key events in the history of dance music&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

===2003–2006: &quot;Body Language&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; and &quot;Showgirl&quot;===
In 2003, for the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, Minogue received her first Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording for &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, before winning the award for &quot;Come into My World&quot; the following year. It marked the first time an Australian recording artist had won in a major category since Men at Work in 1983. She began a relationship with French actor Olivier Martinez after meeting him at the 2003 Grammy Awards ceremony. They ended their relationship in February 2007 and remained on friendly terms.

In November 2003, Minogue released her ninth studio album, &quot;Body Language&quot;, following an invitation-only concert titled &quot;Money Can&#x27;t Buy&quot;, at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. The album downplayed the disco style and was inspired by 1980s artists such as Scritti Politti, The Human League, Adam and the Ants and Prince, blending their styles with elements of hip hop. Andy Battaglia from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated the album &quot;shows Minogue as a surprisingly impressive presence in spurts, but she sounds better with her pleasure engine revving at full purr&quot;. The sales of the album were lower than anticipated after the success of &quot;Fever&quot;, peaking at number six in the UK. The album achieved first week sales of 43,000 and declined significantly in the second week. The lead single, &quot;Slow&quot;, was a number one hit in Australia and the UK. In the U.S., it received a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Dance Recording category. Two more singles were released – &quot;Red Blooded Woman&quot; and &quot;Chocolate&quot;, both charted within the top ten in the UK.

In November 2004, Minogue released her second greatest hits compilation album, &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot;. It peaked at number five in Australia and number four in the UK. &quot;The Guardian&quot; included the compilation in their &quot;1000 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; list in 2007. The album yielded two singles: &quot;I Believe in You&quot; and &quot;Giving You Up&quot;, which both entered the top ten in Australia and in the UK. &quot;I Believe in You&quot; was later nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot;. In the same month, she had a &quot;prominent&quot; guest star role in the season finale of the Australian sitcom &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, playing a grown up Epponnee-Rae Craig.

In February 2005, the animated film &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot; was released, in which she served as the voice actress for the role of Florence. She reprised the role in 2006 and recorded the theme song for the American edition, re-titled as &quot;Doogal&quot;. In March, Minogue commenced her . It initially had tour dates in Europe, Australia, Asia and a headlining appearance in Glastonbury Festival announced. In May, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel the remainder of the tour. In the same month, she underwent surgery and commenced chemotherapy treatment soon after.

In January 2006, it was announced Minogue had finished chemotherapy and the disease &quot;had no recurrence&quot; after the surgery. She would continue her treatment for the next months. Her children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Showgirl Princess&quot;, written during her period of convalescence, was published in October, and her perfume, Darling, was launched in November. The range was later augmented by eau de toilettes including Pink Sparkle, Couture and Inverse. She resumed her then cancelled tour in November, under the title . Her dance routines had been reworked to accommodate her medical condition, with slower costume changes and longer breaks between sections of the show to conserve her strength. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described the tour as an &quot;extravaganza&quot; and &quot;nothing less than a triumph&quot;.

===2007–2011: &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Aphrodite&quot;===
In October 2007, Minogue was featured in &quot;White Diamond: A Personal Portrait of Kylie Minogue&quot;, a documentary filmed during 2006 and 2007 as she embarked on her Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. In November, her tenth studio and &quot;comeback&quot; album, &quot;X&quot; was released. The electro-styled album included contributions from British producer Guy Chambers, British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis, Swedish production duo Bloodshy &amp; Avant and Scottish DJ-producer Calvin Harris. Both the album and its lead single, &quot;2 Hearts&quot;, entered at number one in Australia. The lead single and follow-up singles – &quot;In My Arms&quot; and &quot;Wow&quot;, all peaked inside the top ten in the UK. In the U.S., the album was nominated at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album, but lost to Daft Punk. She appeared on her own television special &quot;The Kylie Show&quot;, which featured music performances and comedy sketches. By December, she guest-starred in the British television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s Christmas special – &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; as Astrid Peth. 13.31 million viewers in the UK watched it, the series&#x27; highest viewing figure since 1979.

In February 2008, Minogue launched her range of home furnishings, Kylie Minogue at Home. Her business venture later went on to launch its newest collection by February 2018, for its tenth anniversary. In May, she embarked on the KylieX2008 tour, her most expensive tour to date with production costs of £10 million. It was considered a success, with ticket sales estimated at US$70 million.

She then embarked on the For You, for Me tour by September, her first concert tour in North America. In October, she was featured in the Hindi film, &quot;Blue&quot;, performing an A. R. Rahman song.

In July 2010, Minogue released her eleventh studio album, &quot;Aphrodite&quot;. The album featured work from English record producer Stuart Price, Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris, American musician Jake Shears, English singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot, Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel, Danish record producer Lucas Secon, English alternative rock band member Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane and British group Kish Mauve. Price served as an executive producer. Rob Sheffield from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labelled the album as Minogue&#x27;s &quot;finest work since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;.&quot; Tim Sendra from AllMusic commended Minogue&#x27;s choice of collaborators and producers, commenting it is the &quot;work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection.&quot; The album debuted at number-one in the UK. The lead single, &quot;All the Lovers&quot; peaked at number three in the UK. Subsequent singles from the album — &quot;Get Outta My Way&quot;, &quot;Better than Today&quot; and &quot;Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)&quot; followed.

===2012–2016: &quot;The Abbey Road Sessions&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Once&quot; and &quot;Kylie Christmas&quot;===


In 2012, Minogue began a year-long celebration of her 25 years in the music industry, which was often called &quot;K25&quot;. The anniversary started in March, with her embarking on the Anti Tour in England and Australia. The tour featured b-sides, demos and rarities from her music catalogue. The tour was positively received for its intimate atmosphere and was a commercial success. She released the single &quot;Timebomb&quot; in May and the greatest hits compilation album, &quot;The Best of Kylie Minogue&quot; in June. She performed at events such as Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, Elizabeth II&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Jubilee Concert&quot; and BBC Proms in the Park London 2012. In October, she released the compilation album &quot;The Abbey Road Sessions&quot;, which contained reworked and orchestral versions of her previously released songs. It was recorded at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios. It was produced by British record producer Steve Anderson and Colin Elliot. The album received favourable reviews from music critics. Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; called it &quot;a more traditional makeover, an attempt to give a more elegant lustre to callow pop kitsch, usually by slowing the song down and loading on strings.&quot; It debuted at number two in the UK. In film, she has appeared in the American independent film &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; for a cameo role, and a lead role in the French film &quot;Holy Motors&quot;. &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; opened at the Tribeca Festival in April, while &quot;Holy Motors&quot; opened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in May.

In January 2013, Minogue parted ways with manager Terry Blamey, who managed her since the start of her singing career. The following month, she signed to entertainment agency Roc Nation for a management deal. In September, she was featured on Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini&#x27;s single &quot;Limpido&quot;, which was a number-one hit in Italy and received a nomination for &quot;World&#x27;s Best Song&quot; at the 2013 World Music Awards. In the same month, she was hired as a coach for the third series of BBC One&#x27;s talent competition television show &quot;The Voice UK&quot;, alongside American record producer and The Black Eyed Peas member, will.i.am, English singer Ricky Wilson of Kaiser Chiefs and Welsh singer Tom Jones. The series opened with 9.35 million views in the UK, an increase from the previous series. It accumulated an estimated 8.10 million viewers on average. Ed Power from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented on Minogue for being &quot;glamorous, agreeably giggly [and] a card-carrying national treasure&quot;. In November, she was hired as a coach for the third season of Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;The Voice Australia&quot;.

In March 2014, Minogue released her twelfth studio album, &quot;Kiss Me Once&quot;. It featured contributions from Australian singer-songwriter Sia, American record producer Mike Del Rio, Danish record producer Cutfather, American multi-hyphenate Pharrell Williams, British record producer MNEK, American record producer Ariel Rechtshaid and Spanish singer-songwriter Enrique Iglesias. Kitty Empire from &quot;The Observer&quot; described it &quot;polished but kittenish... remains true to the effervescent dance-pop for which Minogue is known.&quot; The album peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the UK. Two singles were released, &quot;Into the Blue&quot; and &quot;I Was Gonna Cancel&quot;. In August, she performed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony, donning a custom Jean Paul Gaultier corset. In September, she embarked on the Kiss Me Once Tour.

In March 2015, Minogue left Parlophone Records and Roc Nation. She entered into a trademark dispute with reality television personality Kylie Jenner, in Jenner&#x27;s attempt to trademark the brand &quot;Kylie&quot;, which Minogue has been trading under since the 1990s. The dispute was eventually resolved in Minogue&#x27;s favour in 2017. In May, she appeared as Susan Riddick in the American film &quot;San Andreas&quot;, starring American actor Dwayne Johnson and American actress Carla Gugino. In September, an extended play with Mexican-American record producer Fernando Garibay titled &quot;Kylie + Garibay&quot; was released. Garibay and Moroder served as producers for the extended play.

In November, Minogue released her thirteenth studio album and first Christmas album, &quot;Kylie Christmas&quot;. It features work from actress-singer-presenter Dannii Minogue, English musician Chris Martin of Coldplay and record producing team Stargate. The album missed the top ten in the UK. Lauren Murphy from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; commented on her review, &quot;do we really need another pop star doing another bog-standard Christmas album with a sprinkling of festive cheese?... Minogue is better placed than most to do such an album, given her longevity in the business.&quot; The following year, it was re-released entitled as &quot;Kylie Christmas: Snow Queen Edition&quot;. A Christmas concert series in the Royal Albert Hall, London was held in both December 2015 and 2016, in support of the album. In 2016, she was engaged to British actor Joshua Sasse, with their relationship ending in 2017.

===2017–2021: &quot;Golden&quot;, &quot;Step Back in Time: The Definitive Collection&quot; and &quot;Disco&quot;===


In February 2017, Minogue signed a record deal with BMG Rights Management. In December 2017, she and BMG had struck a joint-deal with Mushroom Group — under the sub-division label, Liberator Music to release her next album in Australia and New Zealand. Throughout 2017, she worked with writers and producers for her fourteenth studio album, including Nigerian-German record producer Sky Adams and British record-producer Richard Stannard. It was recorded in London, Los Angeles and Nashville, with the latter profoundly influencing the record.

The album &quot;Golden&quot; was released in April 2018, with &quot;Dancing&quot; serving as its lead single. It debuted at number one in Australia and in the UK. Tim Sendra from AllMusic labelled the album a &quot;darn bold&quot; for an artist of Minogue&#x27;s longevity, stating &quot;the amazing thing about the album, and about her, is that she pulls off the country as well as she&#x27;s pulled off new wave, disco, electro, murder ballads, and everything else she&#x27;s done in her long career.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Ben Cardew stated it &quot;sounds like someone playing at country music, rather than someone who understands it.&quot; The album led several more singles such as &quot;Stop Me from Falling&quot;, the title track &quot;Golden&quot;, &quot;A Lifetime to Repair&quot; and &quot;Music&#x27;s Too Sad Without You&quot; featuring English singer Jack Savoretti. In support of the album, she embarked on Kylie Presents Golden and Golden Tour. She was among the performers at The Queen&#x27;s Birthday Party held at the Royal Albert Hall in April. In the same year, she began dating Paul Solomons, the creative director of &quot;British GQ&quot;. After five years, they split in February 2023.

In June 2019, Minogue released the greatest hits compilation album &quot;Step Back in Time: The Definitive Collection&quot;, featuring &quot;New York City&quot; as the lead single. Tim Sendra of AllMusic complimented the collection describing it as a &quot;truly definitive and essential for anyone who wants to look back on her [Minogue&#x27;s] brilliant career.&quot; It was number one in Australia and in the UK. In the same month, she embarked on her Summer 2019 tour, which included her debut performance at the Glastonbury Festival – fourteen years after her breast cancer diagnosis forced her to cancel her 2005 headlining slot. Performing in the &quot;Legends slot&quot;, her set featured appearances from Australian musician Nick Cave and English musician Chris Martin. &quot;The Guardian&quot; labeled it as &quot;solid-gold, peerless and phenomenal&quot;. Her set was the most watched of the BBC coverage, earning three million viewers and setting a history record for the most attended Glastonbury set. By December, she appeared in her own Christmas television special, &quot;Kylie&#x27;s Secret Night&quot; on Channel 4.

In May 2020, Minogue launched Kylie Minogue Wines in partnership with English beverages distributor Benchmark Drinks, with Rosé Vin de France serving as the debut product. Her prosecco rosé had become the number one branded prosecco in the UK, according to Nielsen Holdings data. The wine brand has sold over five million bottles by June 2022, and won a Golden Vines Award for entrepreneurship.

Following her Glastonbury performance, Minogue stated she would like to create a &quot;disco-pop album&quot; and return to recording new material after the performance. In 2020, work continued on her fifteenth studio album during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a home studio to record throughout lockdowns, she also recorded and audio engineered her own vocals. The singles, &quot;Say Something&quot; and &quot;Magic&quot; were released in July and September respectively. In November, &quot;Disco&quot; was released, reaching number one in Australia and the UK. She became the only female artist to achieve a number one album in five consecutive decades, from the 1980s to the 2020s. In support of the album, a livestream concert titled Infinite Disco was held. Nick Levine of &quot;NME&quot; called the album her &quot;most consistent and enjoyable album in a decade.&quot; In December, &quot;Real Groove&quot; was released as a single, with a subsequent remix featuring English singer Dua Lipa. The album was reissued in November 2021, titled &quot;Disco: Guest List Edition&quot;. It contained new tracks featuring British band Years &amp; Years, English singer Jessie Ware and American singer Gloria Gaynor.

===2022–present: &quot;Tension&quot; and &quot;Tension II&quot; ===
By 2022, Minogue began working for her sixteenth studio album. In February, after living in London since the 1990s, she relocated back to Melbourne, citing a desire to be closer to her family in Australia. In July, she returned to her role in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Charlene, for a brief appearance for the show&#x27;s intended .

In May 2023, Minogue released the lead single &quot;Padam Padam&quot; from her sixteenth album &quot;Tension&quot;. The song entered the top ten in the United Kingdom and marked her as the only female artist to achieve a UK top ten entry in the 1980s to the 2020s. The single won an ARIA Award for Best Pop Release and a Grammy Award for Best Pop Dance Recording, becoming her second Grammy win after &quot;Come into My World&quot; in 2004. The album later released in September to critical acclaim. Featuring works from British record producer Lostboy, singer-songwriter Kamille, Dutch DJ Oliver Heldens, and previous collaborators Richard Stannard, Duck Blackwell,and Jon Green; Minogue described the album as &quot;a blend of personal reflection, club abandon and melancholic high&quot;. Hannah Mylrea of &quot;Rolling Stone UK&quot; claimed it as &quot;brilliantly good fun and soaring pop music, with a huge amount of heart that brings big emotions to the dancefloor, much like its creator.&quot; The album debuted at number one in Australia and the UK. The title track &quot;Tension&quot; and &quot;Hold On to Now&quot; both served as the follow up singles.

In November, Minogue embarked on a concert residency – More Than Just a Residency at Voltaire at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada. The show sold out within minutes. Michael Idato of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said the show was &quot;brief and a blast of Vegas high&quot;. In December, a television concert special, &quot;An Audience with Kylie&quot; filmed at the Royal Albert Hall, aired on ITV. Ateeqe Bhatti of &quot;Attitude&quot; gave her performance a good review, labeling Minogue as a &quot;masterclass in stage performance&quot;.

In February 2024, Minogue signed with United Talent Agency for live representation in Canada and the U.S., as well for acting roles worldwide. In March, she received the Global Icon Award at the Brit Awards 2024, and performed a medley of her singles. In the same month, she also received &quot;Billboard&quot; Women in Music&#x27;s Icon Award. She then performed with American singer Madonna for the 7 March concert of Madonna&#x27;s The Celebration Tour. Minogue stated that it was a &quot;long time coming&quot;, with Madonna describing Minogue as a &quot;survivor and a fighter.&quot;

Minogue released her seventeenth studio album, &quot;Tension II&quot; on 18 October 2024, with &quot;Lights Camera Action&quot; as the lead single. Serving as a &quot;companion&quot; to &quot;Tension&quot;, the album features collaborations with the Blessed Madonna, Diplo, Tove Lo, Orville Peck, Bebe Rexha and Sia. The album peaked at number one in Australia and the UK. Puah Ziwei of &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;tighter and bolder&quot;, claiming it &quot;surpasses its predecessor and stands strong on its own&quot;.

In 2025, Minogue embarked on the Tension Tour on 15 February on Perth, Australia. Described as Minogue&#x27;s &quot;biggest tour since 2011&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot;, the tour would visit North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Sian Cain of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the tour an &quot;excursion to every Kylie Minogue era and a reminder of the many hits Minogue has produced.&quot;

==Artistry==
Minogue explained she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: &quot;I first got into pop music in 1981, I&#x27;d say. It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Before that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad&#x27;s records – the Stones and Beatles.&quot; She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. She said she &quot;wanted to be&quot; Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: &quot;She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.&quot; Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a &quot;product of the Stock Aitken Waterman Hit Factory&quot;. Australian musician Nick Cave, who worked with her, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;He&#x27;s definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.&quot; Throughout her career, her work was also influenced by Jamaican singer Grace Jones, British singer-songwriter-producer Cathy Dennis, British record producer D Mob, British band Scritti Politti, Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, British rapper Tricky, Irish rock band U2 and Japanese pop band Pizzicato Five.

Minogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range. Tim Sendra of AllMusic reviewed her album &quot;Aphrodite&quot; and said Minogue&#x27;s &quot;slightly nasal, girl next door vocals serve her needs perfectly.&quot; According to Fiona MacDonald from &quot;Madison&quot; magazine, Minogue &quot;has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions&quot;. In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music. However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American singer-songwriter Madonna. Chris True from AllMusic, reviewed her debut album, &quot;Kylie&quot; and found her music &quot;standard late-&#x27;80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum&quot;, however he stated she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. He said of her third album &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot;, from the early 1990s, &quot;the songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally.&quot; At the time of her third studio album, &quot;she began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one.&quot; Chris True stated during her relationship with Australian singer-actor Michael Hutchence, &quot;her shedding of the near-virginal façade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music.&quot;

Her self-titled fifth studio album, primarily a dance-pop album integrating elements of R&amp;B and adult contemporary music, saw a shift in her music. Chris True of AllMusic stated the album is a &quot;remarkable change from Minogue&#x27;s previous teen pop material&quot; and the &quot;start of a second phase&quot; in her music career. From her work on her sixth studio album, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. She had written lyrics before, but called them &quot;safe, just neatly rhymed words, and that&#x27;s that&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; said the album bears a resemblance to Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998). He said she took inspiration from &quot;both the Britpop and electronica movements of the mid-&#x27;90s&quot;, saying &quot;&quot;Impossible Princess&quot; is the work of an artist willing to take risks&quot;.

Her seventh studio album, &quot;Light Years&quot; is a disco-influenced dance-pop record, with AllMusic&#x27;s Chris True calling it &quot;arguably one of the best disco records since the &#x27;70s&quot;. True stated her eighth studio album, &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;combines the disco-diva comeback of &quot;Light Years&quot; with simple dance rhythms&quot;. Her ninth studio album, &quot;Body Language&quot;, was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a &quot;successful&quot; attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&amp;B, the album was listed on &quot;Q&quot;″s &quot;Best Albums of 2003&quot;.

Critics said Minogue&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;X&quot;, did not feature enough &quot;consistency&quot;, and Chris True called the tracks &quot;cold, calculated dance-pop numbers.&quot; Tim Sendra of AllMusic said her eleventh album, &quot;Aphrodite&quot;, &quot;rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems&quot; and &quot;the main sound is the kind of glittery disco-pop that really is her strong suit.&quot; Sendra found &quot;Aphrodite&quot; &quot;One of her best, in fact.&quot; &quot;Kiss Me Once&quot;, her twelfth studio album has been described by critics as her return to contemporary pop music.

Her fourteenth studio album, &quot;Golden&quot; was heavily influenced by country music, although maintaining her dance-pop sensibilities. Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Golden&quot; further bolsters Minogue&#x27;s reputation for taking risks—and artfully sets the stage for her inevitable disco comeback.&quot; For her fifteenth studio album, &quot;Disco&quot;, she began
to audio engineer her own music due to the restrictions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Public image==
Minogue&#x27;s efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception she had not &quot;paid her dues&quot; and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. She acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re part of a record company, I think to a degree it&#x27;s fair to say that you&#x27;re a manufactured product. You&#x27;re a product and you&#x27;re selling a product. It doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;re not talented and that you don&#x27;t make creative and business decisions about what you will and won&#x27;t do and where you want to go.&quot;

In 1993, Australian director Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with American actress Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new &quot;look&quot; for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge &quot;The Face&quot; to the more traditionally sophisticated &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.

By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome &quot;girl next door&quot; to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her music video for &quot;Spinning Around&quot; led to some media outlets referring to her as &quot;SexKylie&quot;, and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. In September 2002, she was ranked 27 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Artists list. She was also named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All-Time by &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; in 2013. William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a &quot;double edged sword&quot;, observing &quot;we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer.&quot; After 20 years as a performer, she was described by BBC&#x27;s Fiona Pryor as a fashion &quot;trend-setter&quot; and a &quot;style icon who constantly reinvents herself&quot;. Pointing out the several reinventions in Minogue&#x27;s image, Larissa Dubecki from &quot;The Age&quot; labelled her the &quot;Mother of Reinvention&quot;.

Minogue has been inspired by and compared to American artist Madonna throughout her career. She received negative comments her Rhythm of Love Tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Writing for &quot;The Observer&#x27;s Music Monthly&quot;, Rufus Wainwright described her as &quot;the anti-Madonna. Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out. She is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it. She is the gay shorthand for joy.&quot; Kathy McCabe for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; noted Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, &quot;Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue&#x27;s clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna&#x27;s ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force.&quot; Minogue has said of Madonna, &quot;Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn&#x27;t immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done&quot;, and &quot;Madonna&#x27;s the Queen of Pop, I&#x27;m the princess. I&#x27;m quite happy with that.&quot;

In January 2007, Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its fourth waxwork of Minogue. During the same week a bronze cast of her hands was added to Wembley Arena&#x27;s &quot;Square of Fame&quot;. In 2007, a bronze statue of Minogue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands for permanent display.

In March 2010, researchers declared Minogue as the &quot;most powerful celebrity in Britain&quot;. The study examined how marketers identify celebrity and brand partnerships. Mark Husak, head of Millward Brown&#x27;s UK media practice, said: &quot;Kylie is widely accepted as an adopted Brit. People know her, like her and she is surrounded by positive buzz&quot;. In 2016, according to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;, Minogue had a net worth of £55 million.

In May 2020, Alison Boshoff of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; labelled her as the &quot;great comeback queen of Pop, for springing back from any setback&quot; in her life and career. In November 2020, Nick Levine of BBC described her as &quot;pop&#x27;s most underestimated icon&quot;, adding Minogue has &quot;lasted more than 30 years by delivering pop songs with passion and panache, and retaining a quintessentially likeable persona along the way, in such a cutthroat industry.&quot; In June 2023, Barbara Ellen of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented &quot;modesty, likeability and vulnerability have aided Minogue enduring appeal&quot;, 36 years after the 1987 single &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; was released.

Minogue is regarded as a gay icon, which she has encouraged with comments including &quot;I am not a traditional gay icon. There&#x27;s been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits&quot; and &quot;My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me.&quot; Her status as a gay icon has been attributed to her music, fashion sense and career longevity. Author Constantine Chatzipapatheodoridis wrote about Minogue&#x27;s appeal to gay men in &quot;Strike a Pose, Forever: The Legacy of Vogue...&quot; and observed she &quot;frequently incorporates camp-inflected themes in her extravaganzas, drawing mainly from the disco scene, the S/M culture, and the burlesque stage.&quot; In &quot;Beautiful Things in Popular Culture&quot; (2007), Marc Brennan stated Minogue&#x27;s work &quot;provides a gorgeous form of escapism&quot;. Minogue has explained she first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. She said she felt &quot;very touched&quot; to have such an &quot;appreciative crowd&quot;, and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world.

==Legacy==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ernest Macias said that by combining &quot;a panache for fabulous fashion&quot; with &quot;her unequivocal disco-pop sound&quot;, Minogue &quot;established herself as a timeless icon.&quot; Paula Joye of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;Minogue&#x27;s fusion of fashion and music has made a huge contribution to the style &quot;zeitgeist&quot;.&quot; Fiona MacDonald, from fashion magazine &quot;Madison&quot;, acknowledged Minogue as &quot;one of the handful of singers recognised around the world by her first name alone. ... And yet despite becoming an international music superstar, style icon and honorary Brit, those two syllables still seem as Australian as the smell of eucalyptus or a barbeque on a hot day.&quot; In 2007 and 2009, the Victoria and Albert Museum &quot;celebrated her influence on fashion&quot; with an exhibition.

In 2012, Dino Scatena of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; wrote about Minogue: &quot;A quarter of a century ago, a sequence of symbiotic events altered the fabric of Australian popular culture and set in motion the transformation of a 19-year-old soap actor from Melbourne into an international pop icon.&quot; Scatena also described her as &quot;Australia&#x27;s single most successful entertainer and a world-renowned style idol&quot;. In the same year, VH1 cited Minogue among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music and the 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.

Minogue has been recognised with many honorific nicknames, most notably the &quot;Princess of Pop&quot;. Jon O&#x27;Brien of AllMusic reviewed her box-set &quot;The Albums 2000–2010&quot; and stated it &quot;contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses.&quot; In January 2012, &quot;NME&quot; critics ranked her single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; at number four on their Greatest Pop Songs in History list. Channel 4 listed her as one of the world&#x27;s greatest pop stars. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot; placed her at number three on its 50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time list. In March 2024, to commemorate the 65th anniversary of International Women&#x27;s Day, Minogue was one of a number of female celebrities had their likeness turned into Barbie dolls. In April 2024, she was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s annual list of top 100 &quot;most influential&quot; people in the world. In February 2025, she received a &quot;commemorative star&quot; at Melbourne Park.

Minogue&#x27;s work has influenced pop and dance artists including Olly Alexander, Melanie C, Alice Chater, Ricki-Lee Coulter, Paris Hilton, Dua Lipa, Kim Petras, Rina Sawayama, September, Slayyyter, The Veronicas, Diana Vickers, Pabllo Vittar, and Jessie Ware. French avant-garde guitarist Noël Akchoté released the album &quot;So Lucky&quot; in 2007, featuring solo guitar versions of songs recorded by Minogue.

==Achievements==


Minogue has received many accolades, including two Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, eighteen ARIA Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and six Mo Awards, including the Australian Performer of the Year in 2001 and 2003. In October 2007, she was honoured with Music Industry Trust&#x27;s award for recognition of her 20-year career and was hailed as &quot;an icon of pop and style&quot;, becoming the first female musician to receive a Music Industry Trust award. In July 2008, she was invested by Charles III as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In April 2017, the Britain–Australia Society recognised Minogue with its 2016 award for outstanding contribution to the improving of relations and bilateral understanding between the countries. The citation reads: &quot;In recognition of significant contributions to the Britain-Australia relationship as an acclaimed singer, songwriter, actor and iconic personality in both countries&quot;. The award was announced at a reception in Australia House but was personally presented the next day by Prince Philip, Patron of the Society, at Windsor Castle. In January 2019, she was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours.

In August 2004, she held the record for the most singles at number one in the ARIA singles chart, with nine. In November 2011, Minogue was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. In January 2011, Minogue received a &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; citation for having the most consecutive decades with top five albums in the UK, with all her albums doing so. In February 2011, she made history for having two songs inside the top three on the U.S. Dance Club Songs chart, with her singles &quot;Better than Today&quot; and &quot;Higher&quot; charting at one and three, respectively. In June 2012, Official Charts Company mentioned Minogue is the 12th best selling singer in the United Kingdom to date, and the third best selling female artist, selling over 10.1 million singles. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as the eighteenth most successful dance artist of all time. In November 2020, she became the only female artist to reach the top spot of the UK Albums Chart in five consecutive decades, when her studio album, &quot;Disco&quot; reached number one. In June 2023, she became the only female artist to reach the top ten of the UK singles chart in the 1980s to the 2020s, when her single &quot;Padam Padam&quot; entered the top ten. As of November 2020, Minogue has sold 80 million records worldwide. She is the most successful Australian female recording artist of all time. According to PRS for Music, her 2001 single &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; was the most-played track of the 2000s, &quot;after receiving the most airplay and live covers&quot; in the decade.

==Personal life==
Actor Jason Donavan and Kylie Minogue started going out while both were actors on the Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;. They remained in a relationship from 1986 to 1989.She later had a relationship with French actor Olivier Martinez, which ended in 2007.

Minogue was engaged to British actor Joshua Sasse up until 2017, followed by a five year relationship with GQ Executive Paul Solomons from 2018 to 2023.

===Health===
Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 36 in May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where then Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media any disruption of the Minogue family&#x27;s rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated.

Minogue underwent a lumpectomy, on 21 May 2005 at Cabrini Hospital in Malvern and commenced chemotherapy treatment soon after. After the surgery, the disease &quot;had no recurrence&quot;. On 8 July 2005, she made her first public appearance after surgery when she visited a children&#x27;s cancer ward at Melbourne&#x27;s Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her chemotherapy treatment at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, near Paris. In January 2006, her publicist announced she had finished chemotherapy, and her treatment continued for the next months. On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she discussed her illness and said her chemotherapy treatment had been like &quot;experiencing a nuclear bomb&quot;. While appearing on the American television talk show, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; in 2008, she said her cancer had originally been misdiagnosed. She commented, &quot;because someone is in a white coat and using big medical instruments doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they&#x27;re right&quot;, but later spoke of her respect for the medical profession.

Minogue was acknowledged for the impact she made by publicly discussing her breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. In May 2008, the French Cultural Minister Christine Albanel said, &quot;Doctors now even go as far as saying there is a &quot;Kylie effect&quot; encouraging young women to have regular checks.&quot; Several scientific studies have been carried out how publicity around her case resulted in more women undergoing regular checks for cancer symptoms. Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue&#x27;s cancer story as &quot;inspirational&quot;, when Rancic was diagnosed with breast cancer.

===Philanthropy===
Minogue has helped fundraise on many occasions. In 1989, she participated in recording &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; under the name Band Aid II to help raise money. In 2008, Minogue pledged her support for a campaign to raise funds for abused children, to be donated to the British charities ChildLine and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. According to the source, around $93 million was raised. She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: &quot;Finding the courage to tell someone about being abused is one of the most difficult decisions a child will ever have to make.&quot; Since her breast cancer diagnosis in 2005, she has been a sponsor and ambassador for the cause. In May 2010, she held a breast cancer campaign for the first time. She later spoke about the cause saying &quot;It means so much to me to be part of this year&#x27;s campaign for Fashion Targets Breast Cancer. I wholeheartedly support their efforts to raise funds for the vital work undertaken by Breakthrough Breast Cancer.&quot; For the cause, she &quot;posed in a silk sheet emblazoned with the distinctive target logo of Fashion Targets Breast Cancer&quot; for photographer Mario Testino. Minogue is a supporter of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, hosting the amfAR Inspiration Gala in Los Angeles in 2010. She has also attended amfAR fundraising benefits in Cannes, and performed at galas for the charity in São Paulo and Hong Kong.

In early 2010, Minogue along with many other artists, under the name Helping Haiti, recorded a cover version of &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;. The single was a fundraiser to help after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. During her 2011 Aphrodite World Tour, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, which was on her itinerary. She declared she would continue to tour there, stating, &quot;I was here to do shows and I chose not to cancel, Why did I choose not to cancel? I thought long and hard about it and it wasn&#x27;t an easy decision to make.&quot; While she was there, she and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard were star guests at an Australian Embassy fundraiser for the disaster. In April 2014, she launched One Note Against Cancer, a campaign to raise funds and awareness for French cancer research charity APREC (The Alliance for Cancer Research). As part of the campaign, she released the single &quot;Crystallize&quot;, with the public able to bid via online auction to own each of the song&#x27;s 4,408 notes. The proceeds of the auction were donated to APREC, with the names of the successful bidders appearing in the accompanying music video&#x27;s credits. In January 2020, in response to the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, she announced she and her family were donating A$500,000 towards immediate firefighting efforts and ongoing support.

<text>A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state (including the pope) or representative for service to the monarch, the church or the country, especially in a military capacity. 

The concept of knighthood may have been inspired by the ancient Greek &quot;hippeis&quot; (ἱππεῖς) and Roman &quot;equites&quot;. In the Early Middle Ages in Western Christian Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of petty nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as an elite fighter or a bodyguard for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Knighthood in the Middle Ages was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 12th century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century. This linkage is reflected in the etymology of &quot;chivalry&quot;, &quot;cavalier&quot; and related terms such as the French title &quot;chevalier&quot;. In that sense, the special prestige accorded to mounted warriors in Christendom finds a parallel in the &quot;furusiyya&quot; in the Islamic world. The Crusades brought various military orders of knights to the forefront of defending Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.

In the Late Middle Ages, new methods of warfare – such as the introduction of the culverin as an anti-personnel, gunpowder-fired weapon – began to render classical knights in armour obsolete, but the titles remained in many countries. Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459–1519) is often referred to as the &quot;last knight&quot; in this regard; however, some of the most iconic battles of the Knights Hospitaller, such as the Siege of Rhodes and the Great Siege of Malta, took place after his rule. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, particularly the literary cycles known as the Matter of France, relating to the legendary companions of Charlemagne and his men-at-arms, the paladins, and the Matter of Britain, relating to the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.

Today, a number of orders of knighthood continue to exist in Christian Churches, as well as in several historically Christian countries and their former territories, such as the Roman Catholic Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Protestant Order of Saint John, as well as the English Order of the Garter, the Swedish Royal Order of the Seraphim, the Spanish Order of Santiago, and the Norwegian Order of St. Olav. There are also dynastic orders like the Order of the Golden Fleece, the Imperial Order of the Rose, the Order of the British Empire and the Order of St. George. In modern times these are orders centered around charity and civic service, and are no longer military orders. Each of these orders has its own criteria for eligibility, but knighthood is generally granted by a head of state, monarch, or prelate to selected persons to recognise some meritorious achievement, as in the British honours system, often for service to the Church or country. The modern female equivalent in the English language is Dame. Knighthoods and damehoods are traditionally regarded as being one of the most prestigious awards people can obtain.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;knight&quot;, from Old English &quot;cniht&quot; (&quot;boy&quot; or &quot;servant&quot;), is a cognate of the German word &quot;Knecht&quot; (&quot;servant, bondsman, vassal&quot;). This meaning, of unknown origin, is common among West Germanic languages (cf Old Frisian &quot;kniucht&quot;, Dutch &quot;knecht&quot;, Danish &quot;knægt&quot;, Swedish &quot;knekt&quot;, Norwegian &quot;knekt&quot;, Middle High German &quot;kneht&quot;, all meaning &quot;boy, youth, lad&quot;). Middle High German had the phrase &quot;guoter kneht&quot;, which also meant knight; but this meaning was in decline by about 1200.

The meaning of &quot;cniht&quot; changed over time from its original meaning of &quot;boy&quot; to &quot;household retainer&quot;. Ælfric&#x27;s homily of St. Swithun describes a mounted retainer as a &quot;cniht&quot;. While &quot;cnihtas&quot; might have fought alongside their lords, their role as household servants features more prominently in the Anglo-Saxon texts. In several Anglo-Saxon wills &quot;cnihtas&quot; are left either money or lands. In his will, King Æthelstan leaves his cniht, Aelfmar, eight hides of land.

A &quot;rādcniht&quot;, &quot;riding-servant&quot;, was a servant on horseback.

A narrowing of the generic meaning &quot;servant&quot; to &quot;military follower of a king or other superior&quot; is visible by 1100. The specific military sense of a knight as a mounted warrior in the heavy cavalry emerges only in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The verb &quot;to knight&quot; (to make someone a knight) appears around 1300; and, from the same time, the word &quot;knighthood&quot; shifted from &quot;adolescence&quot; to &quot;rank or dignity of a knight&quot;.

An Equestrian (Latin, from &quot;eques&quot; &quot;horseman&quot;, from &quot;equus&quot; &quot;horse&quot;) was a member of the second highest social class in the Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. This class is often translated as &quot;knight&quot;; the medieval knight, however, was called &quot;miles&quot; in Latin (which in classical Latin meant &quot;soldier&quot;, normally infantry).

In the later Roman Empire, the classical Latin word for horse, &quot;equus&quot;, was replaced in common parlance by the vulgar Latin &quot;caballus&quot;, sometimes thought to derive from Gaulish &quot;caballos&quot;. From &quot;caballus&quot; arose terms in the various Romance languages cognate with the (French-derived) English &quot;cavalier&quot;: Italian &quot;cavaliere&quot;, Spanish &quot;caballero&quot;, French &quot;chevalier&quot; (whence &quot;chivalry&quot;), Portuguese &quot;cavaleiro&quot;, and Romanian &quot;cavaler&quot;. The Germanic languages have terms cognate with the English &quot;rider&quot;: German &quot;Ritter&quot;, and Dutch and Scandinavian &quot;ridder&quot;. These words are derived from Germanic &quot;rīdan&quot;, &quot;to ride&quot;, in turn derived from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*reidh-&quot;.

==History and evolution of medieval knighthood==
===Pre-Carolingian legacies===

In ancient Rome, there was a knightly class &quot;Ordo Equestris&quot; (order of mounted nobles). Some portions of the armies of Germanic peoples who occupied Europe from the 3rd century AD onward had been mounted, and some armies, such as those of the Ostrogoths, were mainly cavalry. However, it was the Franks who generally fielded armies composed of large masses of infantry, with an infantry elite, the comitatus, which often rode to battle on horseback rather than marching on foot. When the armies of the Frankish ruler Charles Martel defeated the Umayyad Arab invasion at the Battle of Tours in 732, the Frankish forces were still largely infantry armies, with elites riding to battle but dismounting to fight.

===Carolingian age===
In the Early Medieval period, any well-equipped horseman could be described as a knight, or &quot;miles&quot; in Latin. The first knights appeared during the reign of Charlemagne in the 8th century. As the Carolingian Age progressed, the Franks were generally on the attack, and larger numbers of warriors took to their horses to ride with the Emperor in his wide-ranging campaigns of conquest. At about this time the Franks increasingly remained on horseback to fight on the battlefield as true cavalry rather than mounted infantry, with the discovery of the stirrup, and would continue to do so for centuries afterwards. Although in some nations the knight returned to foot combat in the 14th century, the association of the knight with mounted combat with a spear, and later a lance, remained a strong one. The older Carolingian ceremony of presenting a young man with weapons influenced the emergence of knighthood ceremonies, in which a noble would be ritually given weapons and declared to be a knight, usually amid some festivities. These mobile mounted warriors made Charlemagne&#x27;s far-flung conquests possible, and to secure their service he rewarded them with grants of land called benefices. These were given to the captains directly by the Emperor to reward their efforts in the conquests, and they in turn were to grant benefices to their warrior contingents, who were a mix of free and unfree men. In the century or so following Charlemagne&#x27;s death, his newly empowered warrior class grew stronger still, and Charles the Bald declared their fiefs to be hereditary, and also issued the Edict of Pîtres in 864, largely moving away from the infantry-based traditional armies and calling upon all men who could afford it to answer calls to arms on horseback to quickly repel the constant and wide-ranging Viking attacks, which is considered the beginnings of the period of knights that were to become so famous and spread throughout Europe in the following centuries. The period of chaos in the 9th and 10th centuries, between the fall of the Carolingian central authority and the rise of separate Western and Eastern Frankish kingdoms (later to become France and Germany respectively) only entrenched this newly landed warrior class. This was because governing power and defense against Viking, Magyar and Saracen attack became an essentially local affair which revolved around these new hereditary local lords and their &quot;demesnes&quot;.

===Multiple crusades and military orders===

Clerics and the Church often opposed the practices of the Knights because of their abuses against women and civilians, and many such as St. Bernard de Clairvaux were convinced that Knights served the devil and not God, and needed reforming. 

In the course of the 12th century, knighthood became a social rank with a distinction being made between &quot;milites gregarii&quot; (non-noble cavalrymen) and &quot;milites nobiles&quot; (true knights). As the term &quot;knight&quot; became increasingly confined to denoting a social rank, the military role of fully armoured cavalryman gained a separate term, &quot;man-at-arms&quot;. Although any medieval knight going to war would automatically serve as a man-at-arms, not all men-at-arms were knights. 

The first military orders of knighthood were the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and the Knights Hospitaller, both founded shortly after the First Crusade of 1099, followed by the Order of Saint Lazarus (1100), Knights Templars (1118), the Order of Montesa (1128), the Order of Santiago (1170) and the Teutonic Knights (1190). At the time of their foundation, these were intended as monastic orders, whose members would act as simple soldiers protecting pilgrims. 

It was only over the following century, with the successful conquest of the Holy Land and the rise of the crusader states, that these orders became powerful and prestigious.

The great European legends of warriors such as the paladins, the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain popularized the notion of chivalry among the warrior class. The ideal of chivalry as the ethos of the Christian warrior, and the transmutation of the term &quot;knight&quot; from the meaning &quot;servant, soldier&quot;, and of &quot;chevalier&quot; &quot;mounted soldier&quot;, to refer to a member of this ideal class, is significantly influenced by the Crusades, on one hand inspired by the military orders of monastic warriors, and on the other hand also cross-influenced by Islamic (Saracen) ideals of &quot;furusiyya&quot;.

==Knightly culture in the Middle Ages==
===Training===
The institution of knights was already well-established by the 10th century. While the knight was essentially a title denoting a military office, the term could also be used for positions of higher nobility such as landholders. The higher nobles grant the vassals their portions of land (fiefs) in return for their loyalty, protection, and service. The nobles also provided their knights with necessities, such as lodging, food, armour, weapons, horses, and money. The knight generally held his lands by military tenure which was measured through military service that usually lasted 40 days a year. The military service was the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for each knight&#x27;s fief. Vassals and lords could maintain any number of knights, although knights with more military experience were those most sought after. Thus, all petty nobles intending to become prosperous knights needed a great deal of military experience. A knight fighting under another&#x27;s banner was called a &quot;knight bachelor&quot; while a knight fighting under his own banner was a &quot;knight banneret&quot;.

Some knights were familiar with city culture or familiarized with it during training. These knights, among others, were called in to end large insurgencies and other large uprisings that involved urban areas such as the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of England and the 1323–1328 Flemish revolt.

====Page====
A knight had to be born of nobility – typically sons of knights or lords. In some cases, commoners could also be knighted as a reward for extraordinary military service. Children of the nobility were cared for by noble foster-mothers in castles until they reached the age of seven.

These seven-year-old boys were given the title of &quot;page&quot; and turned over to the care of the castle&#x27;s lords. They were placed on an early training regime of hunting with huntsmen and falconers, and academic studies with priests or chaplains. Pages then become assistants to older knights in battle, carrying and cleaning armour, taking care of the horses, and packing the baggage. They would accompany the knights on expeditions, even into foreign lands. Older pages were instructed by knights in swordsmanship, equestrianism, chivalry, warfare, and combat (using wooden swords and spears).

====Squire====
When the boy turned 14, he became a &quot;squire&quot;. In a religious ceremony, the new squire swore on a sword consecrated by a bishop or priest, and attended to assigned duties in his lord&#x27;s household. During this time, the squires continued training in combat and were allowed to own armour (rather than borrowing it).Squires were required to master the &quot;seven points of agilities&quot; – riding, swimming and diving, shooting different types of weapons, climbing, participation in tournaments, wrestling, fencing, long jumping, and dancing – the prerequisite skills for knighthood. All of these were even performed while wearing armour.

Upon turning 21, the squire was eligible to be knighted.

===Accolade===

The accolade or knighting ceremony was usually held during one of the great feasts or holidays, like Christmas or Easter, and sometimes at the wedding of a noble or royal. The knighting ceremony usually involved a ritual bath on the eve of the ceremony and a prayer vigil during the night. On the day of the ceremony, the would-be knight would swear an oath and the master of the ceremony would dub the new knight on the shoulders with a sword. Squires, and even soldiers, could also be conferred direct knighthood early if they showed valor and efficiency for their service; such acts may include deploying for an important quest or mission, or protecting a high diplomat or a royal relative in battle.

=== Chivalric code ===
Knights were expected, above all, to fight bravely and to display military professionalism and courtesy. When knights were taken as prisoners of war, they were customarily held for ransom in somewhat comfortable surroundings. This same standard of conduct did not apply to non-knights (archers, peasants, foot-soldiers, etc.) who were often slaughtered after capture, and who were viewed during battle as mere impediments to knights&#x27; getting to other knights to fight them.

Chivalry developed as an early standard of professional ethics for knights, who were relatively affluent horse owners and were expected to provide military services in exchange for landed property. Early notions of chivalry entailed loyalty to one&#x27;s liege lord and bravery in battle, similar to the values of the Heroic Age. During the Middle Ages, this grew from simple military professionalism into a social code including the values of gentility, nobility and treating others reasonably. In &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; (c. 1100), Roland is portrayed as the ideal knight, demonstrating unwavering loyalty, military prowess and social fellowship. In Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; (c. 1205), chivalry had become a blend of religious duties, love and military service. Ramon Llull&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Order of Chivalry&quot; (1275) demonstrates that by the end of the 13th century, chivalry entailed a litany of very specific duties, including riding warhorses, jousting, attending tournaments, holding Round Tables and hunting, as well as aspiring to the more æthereal virtues of &quot;faith, hope, charity, justice, strength, moderation and loyalty.&quot;

Knights of the late medieval era were expected by society to maintain all these skills and many more, as outlined in Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot;, though the book&#x27;s protagonist, Count Ludovico, states the &quot;first and true profession&quot; of the ideal courtier &quot;must be that of arms.&quot; &quot;Chivalry&quot;, derived from the French word &quot;chevalier&quot; (&#x27;cavalier&#x27;), simultaneously denoted skilled horsemanship and military service, and these remained the primary occupations of knighthood throughout the Middle Ages.

Chivalry and religion were mutually influenced during the period of the Crusades. The early Crusades helped to clarify the moral code of chivalry as it related to religion. As a result, Christian armies began to devote their efforts to sacred purposes. As time passed, clergy instituted religious vows which required knights to use their weapons chiefly for the protection of the weak and defenseless, especially women and orphans, and of churches.

===Tournaments===
In peacetime, knights often demonstrated their martial skills in tournaments, which usually took place on the grounds of a castle. Knights could parade their armour and banner to the whole court as the tournament commenced. Medieval tournaments were made up of martial sports called &quot;hastiludes&quot;, and were not only a major spectator sport but also played as a real combat simulation. It usually ended with many knights either injured or even killed. One contest was a free-for-all battle called a &quot;melee&quot;, where large groups of knights numbering hundreds assembled and fought one another, and the last knight standing was the winner. The most popular and romanticized contest for knights was the &quot;joust&quot;. In this competition, two knights charge each other with blunt wooden lances in an effort to break their lance on the opponent&#x27;s head or body or unhorse them completely. The loser in these tournaments had to turn his armour and horse over to the victor. The last day was filled with feasting, dancing and minstrel singing.

Besides formal tournaments, there were also unformalized judicial duels done by knights and squires to end various disputes. Countries like Germany, Britain and Ireland practiced this tradition. Judicial combat was of two forms in medieval society, the feat of arms and chivalric combat. The feat of arms were done to settle hostilities between two large parties and supervised by a judge. The chivalric combat was fought when one party&#x27;s honor was disrespected or challenged and the conflict could not be resolved in court. Weapons were standardized and must be of the same caliber. The duel lasted until the other party was too weak to fight back and in early cases, the defeated party were then subsequently executed. Examples of these brutal duels were the judicial combat known as the Combat of the Thirty in 1351, and the trial by combat fought by Jean de Carrouges in 1386. A far more chivalric duel which became popular in the Late Middle Ages was the &quot;pas d&#x27;armes&quot; or &quot;passage of arms&quot;. In this hastilude, a knight or a group of knights would claim a bridge, lane or city gate, and challenge other passing knights to fight or be disgraced. If a lady passed unescorted, she would leave behind a glove or scarf, to be rescued and returned to her by a future knight who passed that way.

===Heraldry===

One of the greatest distinguishing marks of the knightly class was the flying of coloured banners, to display power and to distinguish knights in battle and in tournaments. Knights are generally &quot;armigerous&quot; (bearing a coat of arms), and indeed they played an essential role in the development of heraldry. As heavier armour, including enlarged shields and enclosed helmets, developed in the Middle Ages, the need for marks of identification arose, and with coloured shields and surcoats, coat armoury was born. Armorial rolls were created to record the knights of various regions or those who participated in various tournaments.

=== Equipment ===
Knights used a variety of weapons, including maces, axes and swords. Elements of the knightly armour included helmet, cuirass, gauntlet and shield.

The sword was a weapon designed to be used solely in combat; it was useless in hunting and impractical as a tool. Thus, the sword was a status symbol among the knightly class. Swords were effective against lightly armoured enemies, while maces and warhammers were more effective against heavily armoured ones.

One of the primary elements of a knight&#x27;s armour was the shield, which could be used to block strikes and projectiles. Oval shields were used during the Dark Ages and were made of wooden boards that were roughly half an inch thick. Towards the end of the 10th century, oval shields were lengthened to cover the left knee of the mounted warrior, called the kite shield. The heater shield was used during the 13th and the first half of the 14th century. Around 1350, square shields called bouched shields appeared, which had a notch in which to place the couched lance.

Until the mid-14th century, knights wore mail armour as their main form of defence. Mail was extremely flexible and provided good protection against sword cuts, but weak against blunt weapons such as the mace and piercing weapons such as the lance. Padded undergarment known as aketon was worn to absorb shock damage and prevent chafing caused by mail. In hotter climates metal rings became too hot, so sleeveless surcoats were worn as a protection against the sun, and also to show their heraldic arms. This sort of coat also evolved to be tabards, waffenrocks and other garments with the arms of the wearer sewn into it.

Helmets of the knight of the early periods usually were more open helms such as the nasal helmet, and later forms of the spangenhelm. The lack of more facial protection lead to the evolution of more enclosing helmets to be made in the late 12th to early 13th centuries, this eventually would evolve to make the great helm. Later forms of the bascinet, which was originally a small helm worn under the larger great helm, evolved to be worn solely, and would eventually have pivoted or hinged visors, the most popular was the hounskull, also known as the &quot;pig-face visor&quot;.

Plate armour first appeared in the 13th century, when plates were added onto the torso and mounted to a base of leather. This form of armour is known as a coat of plates, and was initially used over chain mail in the 13th and 14th centuries, at the time of Transitional armour. The torso was not the only part of the knight to receive this plate protection evolution, as the elbows and shoulders were covered with circular pieces of metal, commonly referred to as rondels, eventually evolving into the plate arm harness consisting of the rerebrace, vambrace, and spaulder or pauldron. The legs too were covered in plates, mainly on the shin, called schynbalds which later evolved to fully enclose the leg in the form of enclosed greaves. As for the upper legs, cuisses came about in the mid 14th century. Overall, plate armour offered better protection against piercing weapons such as arrows and especially bolts than mail armour did.Plate armor reached his peak in the 15th and 16th centuries, but was still used at the beginning of the 17th century by the first Cuirassiers like the London lobsters.

Knights&#x27; horses were also armoured in later periods; caparisons were the first form of medieval horse coverage and was used much like the surcoat. Other armours, such as the facial armouring chanfron, were made for horses.

==Medieval and Renaissance chivalric literature==

Knights and the ideals of knighthood featured largely in medieval and Renaissance literature, and have secured a permanent place in literary romance. While chivalric romances abound, particularly notable literary portrayals of knighthood include &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;, The Twelve of England, Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot;, and Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, as well as Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and other Arthurian tales (Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, the Pearl Poet&#x27;s &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, etc.).

Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (&quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot;), written in the 1130s, introduced the legend of King Arthur, which was to be important to the development of chivalric ideals in literature. Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Death of Arthur&quot;), written in 1469, was important in defining the ideal of chivalry, which is essential to the modern concept of the knight, as an elite warrior sworn to uphold the values of faith, loyalty, courage, and honour.

Instructional literature was also created. Geoffroi de Charny&#x27;s &quot;Book of Chivalry&quot; expounded upon the importance of Christian faith in every area of a knight&#x27;s life, though still laying stress on the primarily military focus of knighthood.

In the early Renaissance greater emphasis was laid upon courtliness. The ideal courtier—the chivalrous knight—of Baldassarre Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot; became a model of the ideal virtues of nobility. Castiglione&#x27;s tale took the form of a discussion among the nobility of the court of the Duke of Urbino, in which the characters determine that the ideal knight should be renowned not only for his bravery and prowess in battle, but also as a skilled dancer, athlete, singer and orator, and he should also be well-read in the humanities and classical Greek and Latin literature.

Later Renaissance literature, such as Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, rejected the code of chivalry as unrealistic idealism. The rise of Christian humanism in Renaissance literature demonstrated a marked departure from the chivalric romance of late medieval literature, and the chivalric ideal ceased to influence literature over successive centuries until it saw some pockets of revival in post-Victorian literature.

==Decline==
By the mid to late 16th century, knights were quickly becoming obsolete as countries started creating their own standing armies that were faster to train, cheaper to equip, and easier to mobilize. The advancement of high-powered firearms contributed greatly to the decline in use of plate armour, as the time it took to train soldiers with guns was much less compared to that of the knight. The cost of equipment was also significantly lower, and guns had a reasonable chance to easily penetrate a knight&#x27;s armour. In the 14th century the use of infantrymen armed with pikes and fighting in close formation also proved effective against heavy cavalry, such as during the Battle of Nancy, when Charles the Bold and his armoured cavalry were decimated by Swiss pikemen. As the feudal system came to an end, lords saw no further use of knights. Many landowners found the duties of knighthood too expensive and so contented themselves with the use of squires. Mercenaries also became an economic alternative to knights when conflicts arose.

Armies of the time started adopting a more realistic approach to warfare than the honor-bound code of chivalry. Soon, the remaining knights were absorbed into professional armies. Although they had a higher rank than most soldiers because of their valuable lineage, they lost their distinctive identity that previously set them apart from common soldiers. Some knightly orders survived into modern times. They adopted newer technology while still retaining their age-old chivalric traditions. Examples include the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, Knights Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights.

==Types of knighthood==

===Hereditary knighthoods===
====Continental Europe====
In continental Europe different systems of hereditary knighthood have existed or do exist.

In the Kingdom of Spain, the Royal House of Spain grants titles of knighthood to the successor of the throne. This knighthood title, known as Order of the Golden Fleece, is probably the most prestigious and exclusive chivalric order. This order can also be granted to persons not belonging to the Spanish Crown, as the former Emperor of Japan Akihito, Queen of United Kingdom Elizabeth II or the relevant Spanish politician of the Spanish democratic transition Adolfo Suárez, among others.

&quot;Ridder&quot;, Dutch for &quot;knight&quot;, is a hereditary noble title in the Netherlands. It is the lowest title within the nobility system and ranks below that of &quot;Baron&quot; but above &quot;Jonkheer&quot; (the latter is not a title, but a Dutch honorific to show that someone belongs to the untitled nobility). The collective term for its holders in a certain locality is the Ridderschap (e.g. Ridderschap van Holland, Ridderschap van Friesland, etc.). In the Netherlands no female equivalent exists. Before 1814, the history of nobility is separate for each of the eleven provinces that make up the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In each of these, there were in the early Middle Ages a number of feudal lords who often were just as powerful, and sometimes more so than the rulers themselves. During this period, knights ranked below the ruler and above the feudal barons (Dutch: &quot;heren&quot;). In the Netherlands only 10 knightly families are still extant, a number which steadily decreases because in that country ennoblement or incorporation into the nobility is not possible anymore.

Likewise &quot;Ridder&quot;, Dutch for &quot;knight&quot;, or the equivalent French &quot;Chevalier&quot; is a hereditary noble title in Belgium. It is the second lowest title within the nobility system above &quot;Écuyer&quot; or &quot;Jonkheer/Jonkvrouw&quot; and below &quot;Baron&quot;. Like in the Netherlands, no female equivalent to the title exists. Belgium still does have about 232 registered knightly families.

The German and Austrian equivalent of an hereditary knight is a &quot;Ritter&quot;. This designation is used as a title of nobility in all German-speaking areas. Traditionally it denotes the second lowest rank within the nobility, standing above &quot;Edler&quot; (noble) and below &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron). For its historical association with warfare and the landed gentry in the Middle Ages, it can be considered roughly equal to the titles of &quot;Knight&quot; or &quot;Baronet&quot;.

The Royal House of Portugal historically bestowed hereditary knighthoods to holders of the highest ranks in the Royal Orders. Today, the head of the Royal House of Portugal Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, bestows hereditary knighthoods for extraordinary acts of sacrifice and service to the Royal House. There are very few hereditary knights and they are entitled to wear an oval neck badge with the shield of the house of Braganza. As there are two classes of hereditary knights in Portugal, the highest grade is the hereditary knight with grand collar. Portuguese hereditary knighthoods confer nobility. 

In France, the hereditary knighthood existed similarly throughout as a title of nobility, as well as in regions formerly under Holy Roman Empire control. One family ennobled with a title in such a manner is the house of Hauteclocque (by letters patents of 1752), even if its most recent members used a pontifical title of count. In some other regions such as Normandy, a specific type of fief was granted to the lower ranked knights () called the &quot;fief de haubert&quot;, referring to the hauberk, or chain mail shirt worn almost daily by knights, as they would not only fight for their liege lords, but enforce and carry out their orders on a routine basis as well. Later the term came to officially designate the higher rank of the nobility in the Ancien Régime (the lower rank being Squire), as the romanticism and prestige associated with the term grew in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Italy and Poland also had the hereditary knighthood that existed within their respective systems of nobility. Just as with the Royal House of Portugal, the Royal House of Italy - House of Savoy, continue to confer their dynastic orders of chivalry on both Italian and non-Italian citizens, these dynastic orders include the; Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and the Civil Order of Savoy. Additionally the Royal House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies confers their dynastic orders of chivalry on both Italian and non-italian citizens, including the dynastic orders of; Order of Saint Januarius, Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George, and the Order of Saint Ferdinand and of Merit.

====Ireland====
There are traces of the Continental system of hereditary knighthood in Ireland. Notably all three of the following belong to the Hiberno-Norman FitzGerald dynasty, created by the Earls of Desmond, acting as Earls Palatine, for their kinsmen.
*Knight of Kerry or Green Knight (FitzGerald of Kerry) — the current holder is Sir Adrian FitzGerald, 6th Baronet of Valencia, 24th Knight of Kerry. He is also a Knight of Malta, and has served as President of the Irish Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
*Knight of Glin or Black Knight (FitzGerald of Limerick) — now dormant.
*White Knight (&quot;see Edmund Fitzgibbon&quot;) — now dormant.

Another Irish family were the O&#x27;Shaughnessys, who were created knights in 1553 under the policy of surrender and regrant (first established by Henry VIII of England). They were attainted in 1697 for participation on the Jacobite side in the Williamite wars.

====British baronetcies====
Since 1611, the British Crown has awarded a hereditary title in the form of the baronetcy. Like knights, baronets are accorded the title &quot;Sir&quot;. Baronets are not peers of the Realm, and have never been entitled to sit in the House of Lords, therefore like knights they remain commoners in the view of the British legal system. However, unlike knights, the title is hereditary and the recipient does not receive an accolade. The position is therefore more comparable with hereditary knighthoods in continental European orders of nobility, such as &quot;Ritter&quot;, than with knighthoods under the British orders of chivalry. However, unlike the continental orders, the British baronetcy system was a modern invention, designed specifically to raise money for the Crown with the purchase of the title.

===Chivalric orders===
==== Military orders ====
*Sovereign Military Order of Malta founded to provide military medical services in 1048
*Order of the Holy Sepulchre, founded very shortly after the First Crusade in 1099
*Order of Saint Lazarus established to serve and protect lepers on/about 1100
*Knights Templar, founded 1118, disbanded 1307
*Teutonic Knights, established about 1190, and ruled the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia until 1525
Other orders were established in the Iberian peninsula, under the influence of the orders in the Holy Land and the Crusader movement of the Reconquista and generally aligned with geographical area, for example:
*Order of Aviz, established in Avis (Portugal) in 1143
*Order of Alcántara, established in Alcántara (Spain) in 1156
*Order of Calatrava, established in Calatrava (Spain) in 1158
*Order of Santiago, established in Santiago (Spain) in 1164.

====Honorific orders of knighthood====
After the Crusades, the military orders became idealized and romanticized, resulting in the late medieval notion of chivalry, as reflected in the chivalric romances of the time. The creation of chivalric orders was fashionable among the nobility in the 14th and 15th centuries, and this is still reflected in contemporary honours systems, including the term &quot;order&quot; itself. Examples of notable orders of chivalry are:
* the Order of Saint George, founded by Charles I of Hungary in 1326
* the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, founded by Count Amadeus VI in 1362
* the Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III of England in 1348
* the Order of the Dragon, founded by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1408
* the Order of the Golden Fleece, founded by Philip III, Duke of Burgundy in 1430
* the Order of Saint Michael, founded by Louis XI of France in 1469
* the Order of the Thistle, founded by King James VII of Scotland (also known as James II of England) in 1687
* the Order of the Elephant, which may have been first founded by Christian I of Denmark, but was founded in its current form by King Christian V in 1693
* the Order of the Bath, founded by George I in 1725
From roughly 1560, purely honorific orders were established, as a way to confer prestige and distinction, unrelated to military service and chivalry in the more narrow sense. Such orders were particularly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, and knighthood continues to be conferred in various countries:

* The United Kingdom using the British honours system and some Commonwealth of Nations countries such as New Zealand;
* Some European countries, such as The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain among others . The Order of Charles III, the Order of Isabella the Catholic, and the Order of Civil Merit are Spain&#x27;s highest civil honours.
* The Holy See implementing the Papal Orders of Chivalry.

There are other monarchies and also republics that also follow this practice. Modern knighthoods are typically conferred in recognition for services rendered to society, which are not necessarily martial in nature. The British musician Elton John, for example, is a Knight Bachelor, thus entitled to be called Sir Elton. The female equivalent is a &quot;Dame&quot;, for example Dame Julie Andrews.

In the United Kingdom, honorific knighthood may be conferred in two different ways:

*The first is by membership of one of the &quot;pure&quot; orders of chivalry such as the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of Saint Patrick, of which all members are knighted. In addition, many British orders of merit, namely the Order of the Bath, the Order of St Michael and St George, the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire are part of the British honours system, and the award of their highest ranks (Knight/Dame Commander and Knight/Dame Grand Cross), comes together with an honorific knighthood, making them a cross between orders of chivalry and orders of merit. By contrast, membership of other British orders of merit, such as the Distinguished Service Order, the Order of Merit and the Order of the Companions of Honour does not confer a knighthood.
*The second is being granted honorific knighthood by the British sovereign without membership of an order, the recipient being called Knight Bachelor.

In the British honours system the knightly style of &quot;Sir&quot; and its female equivalent &quot;Dame&quot; are followed by the given name only when addressing the holder. Thus, Sir Elton John should be addressed as &quot;Sir Elton&quot;, not &quot;Sir John&quot; or &quot;Mr John&quot;. Similarly, actress Dame Judi Dench should be addressed as &quot;Dame Judi&quot;, not &quot;Dame Dench&quot; or &quot;Ms Dench&quot;.

Wives of knights, however, are entitled to the honorific pre-nominal &quot;Lady&quot; before their husband&#x27;s surname. Thus Sir Paul McCartney&#x27;s ex-wife was formally styled &quot;Lady McCartney&quot; (rather than &quot;Lady Paul McCartney&quot; or &quot;Lady Heather McCartney&quot;). The style &quot;Dame Heather McCartney&quot; could be used for the wife of a knight; however, this style is largely archaic and is only used in the most formal of documents, or where the wife is a Dame in her own right (such as Dame Norma Major, who gained her title six years before her husband Sir John Major was knighted). The husbands of Dames have no honorific pre-nominal, so Dame Norma&#x27;s husband remained John Major until he received his own knighthood.

Up until 1965 it was not permitted to use these titles until after the knight concerned had received the accolade; but in that year the prohibition was lifted, and it is now permitted to use the titles immediately, from the time the award is gazetted.
With the award of a KCVO to the Rt Rev. Randall Davidson in 1902, the custom was established whereby a clerk in holy orders in the Church of England, on being appointed to a degree of knighthood, does not received the accolade. He receives the insignia of his honour and may place the appropriate letters after his name or title but he may not be called Sir and his wife may not be called Lady. This custom is not observed in Australia and New Zealand, where knighted Anglican clergymen routinely use the title &quot;Sir&quot;. Ministers of other Christian Churches are entitled to receive the accolade. For example, Sir Norman Cardinal Gilroy did receive the accolade on his appointment as Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1969. A knight who is subsequently ordained does not lose his title. A famous example of this situation was The Revd Sir Derek Pattinson, who was ordained just a year after he was appointed Knight Bachelor, apparently somewhat to the consternation of officials at Buckingham Palace. A woman clerk in holy orders may be made a Dame in exactly the same way as any other woman since there are no military connotations attached to the honour. A clerk in holy orders who is a baronet is entitled to use the title Sir.

Outside the British honours system it is usually considered improper to address a knighted person as &#x27;Sir&#x27; or &#x27;Dame&#x27; (notable exceptions are members of the Order of the Knights of Rizal in the Republic of the Philippines.) Some countries, however, historically have equivalent honorifics for knights, such as Cavaliere in Italy (e.g. &quot;Cavaliere&quot; Benito Mussolini), and Ritter in Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (e.g. Georg &quot;Ritter von Trapp&quot;).
State knighthoods in the Netherlands are issued in three orders: the Order of William, the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and the Order of Orange Nassau. Additionally there remain a few hereditary knights in the Netherlands.

In Belgium, honorific knighthood (not hereditary) can be conferred by the king on particularly meritorious individuals such as scientists or eminent businessmen, or for instance to astronaut Frank De Winne, the second Belgian in space. This practice is similar to the conferral of the dignity of Knight Bachelor in the United Kingdom. In addition, there still are a number of hereditary knights in Belgium .

In France and Belgium, one of the ranks conferred in some orders of merit, such as the Légion d&#x27;Honneur, the Ordre National du Mérite, the Ordre des Palmes académiques and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France, and the Order of Leopold, Order of the Crown and Order of Leopold II in Belgium, is that of &quot;Chevalier&quot; (in French) or &quot;Ridder&quot; (in Dutch), meaning Knight.

In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the monarchs tried to establish chivalric orders, but the hereditary lords who controlled the Union did not agree and managed to ban such assemblies. They feared the king would use orders to gain support for absolutist goals and to make formal distinctions among the peerage, which could lead to its legal breakup into two separate classes, and that the king would later play one against the other and eventually limit the legal privileges of hereditary nobility. But finally in 1705 King managed to establish the Order of the White Eagle which remains Poland&#x27;s most prestigious order of that kind. The head of state (now the President as the acting Grand Master) confers knighthoods of the order to distinguished citizens, foreign monarchs and other heads of state. The order has its chapter. There were no particular honorifics that would accompany a knight&#x27;s name, as historically all (or at least by far most) of its members would be royals or hereditary lords anyway. So today, a knight is simply referred to as &quot;Name Surname, knight of the White Eagle (Order)&quot;.

In Nigeria, holders of religious honours like the Knighthood of St. Gregory make use of the word &quot;Sir&quot; as a pre-nominal honorific in much the same way as it is used for secular purposes in Britain and the Philippines. Wives of such individuals also typically assume the title of Lady.

====Women====
=====England and the United Kingdom=====
Women were appointed to the Order of the Garter almost from the start. In all, 68 women were appointed between 1358 and 1488, including all consorts. Though many were women of royal blood, or wives of knights of the Garter, some women were neither. They wore the garter on the left arm, and some are shown on their tombstones with this arrangement. After 1488, no other appointments of women are known, although it is said that the Garter was conferred upon Neapolitan poet Laura Bacio Terricina, by King Edward VI. In 1638, a proposal was made to revive the use of robes for the wives of knights in ceremonies, but this did not occur. Queens consort have been made Ladies of the Garter since 1901 (Queens Alexandra in 1901, Mary in 1910 and Elizabeth in 1937). The first non-royal woman to be made Lady Companion of the Garter was The Duchess of Norfolk in 1990, the second was The Baroness Thatcher in 1995 (post-nominal: LG). On 30 November 1996, Lady Fraser was made Lady of the Thistle, the first non-royal woman (post-nominal: LT). (See Edmund Fellowes, &quot;Knights of the Garter&quot;, 1939; and Beltz: &quot;Memorials of the Order of the Garter&quot;). The first woman to be granted a knighthood in modern Britain seems to have been Nawab Sikandar Begum Sahiba, Nawab Begum of Bhopal, who became a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (GCSI) in 1861, at the foundation of the order. Her daughter received the same honor in 1872, as well as her granddaughter in 1910. The order was open to &quot;princes and chiefs&quot; without distinction of gender. The first European woman to have been granted an order of knighthood was Queen Mary, when she was made a Knight Grand Commander of the same order, by special statute, in celebration of the Delhi Durbar of 1911. She was also granted a damehood in 1917 as a Dame Grand Cross, when the Order of the British Empire was created (it was the first order explicitly open to women). The Royal Victorian Order was opened to women in 1936, and the Orders of the Bath and Saint Michael and Saint George in 1965 and 1971 respectively.

=====France=====
Medieval French had two words, chevaleresse and chevalière, which were used in two ways: one was for the wife of a knight, and this usage goes back to the 14th century. The other was possibly for a female knight. Here is a quote from Ménestrier, a 17th-century writer on chivalry: Modern French orders of knighthood include women, for example the Légion d&#x27;Honneur (Legion of Honor) since the mid-19th century, but they are usually called chevaliers. The first documented case is that of Angélique Brûlon (1772–1859), who fought in the Revolutionary Wars, received a military disability pension in 1798, the rank of 2nd lieutenant in 1822, and the Legion of Honor in 1852. A recipient of the Ordre National du Mérite recently requested from the order&#x27;s Chancery the permission to call herself &quot;chevalière,&quot; and the request was granted.

=====Italy=====
As related in &quot;Orders of Knighthood, Awards and the Holy See&quot; by H. E. Cardinale (1983), the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary was founded by two Bolognese nobles Loderingo degli Andalò and Catalano di Guido in 1233, and approved by Pope Alexander IV in 1261. It was the first religious order of knighthood to grant the rank of militissa to women. However, this order was suppressed by Pope Sixtus V in 1558.

=====The Low Countries=====
At the initiative of Catherine Baw in 1441, and 10 years later of Elizabeth, Mary, and Isabella of the house of Hornes, orders were founded which were open exclusively to women of noble birth, who received the French title of chevalière or the Latin title of equitissa. In his Glossarium (s.v. militissa), Du Cange notes that still in his day (17th century), the female canons of the canonical monastery of St. Gertrude in Nivelles (Brabant), after a probation of 3 years, are made knights (militissae) at the altar, by a (male) knight called in for that purpose, who gives them the accolade with a sword and pronounces the usual words.

=====Spain=====

To honour those women who defended Tortosa against an attack by the Moors, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, created the Order of the Hatchet (&quot;&quot;Orde de la Atxa&quot; in catalan&quot;) in 1149.

<doc id="16898" wikidata="Q33629" url="?curid=16898" title="Kara Sea">
<text>The Kara Sea is a marginal sea, separated from the Barents Sea to the west by the Kara Strait and Novaya Zemlya, and from the Laptev Sea to the east by the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago. Ultimately the Kara, Barents and Laptev Seas are all extensions of the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia.

The Kara Sea&#x27;s northern limit is marked geographically by a line running from Cape Kohlsaat in Graham Bell Island, Franz Josef Land, to Cape Molotov (Arctic Cape), the northernmost point of Komsomolets Island in Severnaya Zemlya.

The Kara Sea is roughly long and wide with an area of around and a mean depth of .

Its main ports are Novy Port and Dikson and it is important as a fishing ground although the sea is ice-bound for all but two months of the year. The Kara Sea contains the East-Prinovozemelsky field (an extension of the West Siberian Oil Basin), containing significant undeveloped petroleum and natural gas. In 2014, US government sanctions resulted in Exxon having until 26 September to discontinue its operations in the Kara Sea.

==Name origin==
It is named after the Kara river (flowing into Baydaratskaya Bay), which is now relatively insignificant but which played an important role in the Russian conquest of northern Siberia. The Kara river name is derived from a Nenets word meaning &#x27;hummocked ice&#x27;.

==Geography==

===Extent===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Kara Sea as follows:

:&quot;On the West.&quot; The Eastern limit of Barents Sea [Cape Kohlsaat to Cape Zhelaniya (Desire); West and Southwest coast of Novaya Zemlya to Cape Kussov Noss and thence to Western entrance Cape, Dolgaya Bay () on Vaigach Island. Through Vaigach Island to Cape Greben; thence to Cape Belyi Noss on the mainland].

:&quot;On the North.&quot; Cape Kohlsaat to Cape Molotov () (Northern extremity of Severnaya Zemlya on Komsomolets Island).

:&quot;On the East.&quot; Komsomolets Island from Cape Molotov to South Eastern Cape; thence to Cape Vorochilov, Oktiabrskaya Revolutziya Island to Cape Anuchin. Then to Cape Unslicht on Bolshevik Island. Bolshevik Island to Cape Yevgenov. Thence to Cape Pronchisthehev on the main land (see Russian chart No. 1484 of the year 1935).

===Islands===
There are many islands and island groups in the Kara Sea. Unlike the other marginal seas of the Arctic, where most islands lie along the coasts, in the Kara Sea many islands, like the Arkticheskiy Institut Islands, the Izvesti Tsik Islands, the Kirov Islands, Uedineniya or Lonely Island, Wiese Island, and Voronina Island are located in the open sea of its central regions.

The largest group in the Kara Sea is by far the Nordenskiöld Archipelago, with five large subgroups and over ninety islands. Other important islands in the Kara Sea are Bely Island, Dikson Island, Taymyr Island, the Kamennyye Islands and Oleni Island. Despite the high latitude, all islands are unglaciated except for Ushakov Island at the extreme northern limit of the Kara Sea.

=== Current patterns ===
Water circulation patterns in the Kara Sea are complex. The Kara Sea tends to be sea ice covered between September and May, and between May and August heavily influenced by freshwater run-off (roughly 1200 km3 yr−1) from the Russian rivers (e.g., Ob, Yenisei, Pyasina, Pur, and Taz). The Kara Sea is also affected by the water inflow from the Barents Sea, which brings 0.6 Sv in August and 2.6 Sv in December. The advected water originates from the Atlantic, but it was cooled and mixed with freshwater in the Barents Sea before it reaches the Kara Sea. Simulations with the Hamburg shelf ocean model (HAMSOM) suggest that no typical water current pattern consists in the Kara Sea throughout the year. Depending on the freshwater run-off, the dominant wind patterns, and the sea ice formation, the water currents change.

===Connections to global weather===
==History==
The Kara Sea was formerly known as Oceanus Scythicus or Mare Glaciale and it appears with these names in 16th century maps. Since it is closed by ice most of the year it remained largely unexplored until the late nineteenth century.

In 1556 Stephen Borough sailed in the &quot;Searchthrift&quot; to try to reach the Ob River, but he was stopped by ice and fog at the entrance to the Kara Sea. Not until 1580 did another English expedition, under Arthur Pet and Charles Jackman, attempt its passage. They too failed to penetrate it, and England lost interest in searching for the Northeast Passage.

In 1736–1737 Russian Admiral Stepan Malygin undertook a voyage from Dolgy Island in the Barents Sea. The two ships in this early expedition were the &quot;Perviy&quot;, under Malygin&#x27;s command and the &quot;Vtoroy&quot; under Captain A. Skuratov. After entering the little-explored Kara Sea, they sailed to the mouth of the Ob River. Malygin took careful observations of these hitherto almost unknown areas of the Russian Arctic coastline. With this knowledge he was able to draw the first somewhat accurate map of the Arctic shores between the Pechora River and the Ob River.

In 1878, Finnish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld on ship &quot;Vega&quot; sailed across the Kara Sea from Gothenburg, along the coast of Siberia, and despite the ice packs, got to 180° longitude by early September. Frozen in for the winter in the Chukchi Sea, Nordenskiöld waited and bartered with the local Chukchi people. The following July, the Vega was freed from the ice, and continued to Yokohama, Japan. He became the first to force the Northeast Passage. The largest group of islands in the Kara Sea, the Nordenskiöld Archipelago, has been named in his honour. The year 1912 was a tragic one for Russian explorers in the Kara Sea. In that fateful year unbroken consolidated ice blocked the way for the Northern Sea Route and three expeditions that had to cross the Kara Sea became trapped and failed: Sedov&#x27;s on vessel &quot;St. Foka&quot;, Brusilov&#x27;s on the &quot;St. Anna&quot;, and Rusanov&#x27;s on the &quot;Gercules&quot;. Georgy Sedov intended to reach Franz Josef Land on ship, leave a depot over there, and sledge to the pole. Due to the heavy ice the vessel could only reach Novaya Zemlya the first summer and wintered in Franz Josef Land. In February 1914 Sedov headed to the North Pole with two sailors and three sledges, but he fell ill and died on Rudolf Island. Georgy Brusilov attempted to navigate the Northeast Passage, was trapped in the Kara Sea, and drifted northward for more than two years reaching latitude 83° 17&#x27; N. Thirteen men, headed by Valerian Albanov, left the vessel and started across the ice to Franz Josef Land, but only Albanov and one sailor (Alexander Konrad) survived after a gruesome three-month ordeal. The survivors brought the ship log of &quot;St. Anna&quot;, the map of her drift, and daily meteorological records, but the destiny of those who stayed on board remains unknown. In the same year the expedition of Vladimir Rusanov was lost in the Kara Sea. The prolonged absence of those three expeditions stirred public attention, and a few small rescue expeditions were launched, including Jan Nagórski&#x27;s five air flights over the sea and ice from the NW coast of Novaya Zemlya.

After the Russian Revolution in 1917, the scale and scope of exploration of the Kara Sea increased greatly as part of the work of developing the Northern Sea Route. Polar stations, of which five already existed in 1917, increased in number, providing meteorologic, ice reconnaissance, and radio facilities. By 1932 there were 24 stations, by 1948 about 80, and by the 1970s more than 100. The use of icebreakers and, later, aircraft as platforms for scientific work were developed. In 1929 and 1930 the Icebreaker Sedov carried groups of scientists to Severnaya Zemlya, the last major piece of unsurveyed territory in the Soviet Arctic; the archipelago was completely mapped under Georgy Ushakov between 1930 and 1932.

Particularly worth noting are three cruises of the Icebreaker &quot;Sadko&quot;, which went farther north than most; in 1935 and 1936 the last unexplored areas in the northern Kara Sea were examined and the small and elusive Ushakov Island was discovered.

In the summer of 1942, German Kriegsmarine warships and submarines entered the Kara Sea to destroy as many Russian vessels as possible. This naval campaign was named &quot;Operation Wunderland&quot;. Its success was limited by the presence of ice floes, as well as bad weather and fog. These effectively protected the Soviet ships, preventing the damage that could have been inflicted on the Soviet fleet under fair weather conditions.

In October 2010, the Russian government awarded a license to Russian oil company Rosneft for developing the East-Prinovozemelsky oil and gas structure in the Kara Sea.

== Nuclear dumping ==

There is concern about radioactive contamination from nuclear waste the former Soviet Union dumped in the sea and the effect this will have on the marine environment. According to an official &quot;White Paper&quot; report compiled and released by the Russian government in March 1993, the Soviet Union dumped six nuclear submarine reactors and ten nuclear reactors into the Kara Sea between 1965 and 1988. Solid high- and low-level wastes unloaded from Northern Fleet nuclear submarines during reactor refuelings were dumped in the Kara Sea, mainly in the shallow fjords of Novaya Zemlya, where the depths of the dumping sites range from 12 to 135 meters, and in the Novaya Zemlya Trough at depths of up to 380 meters. Liquid low-level wastes were released in the open Barents and Kara Seas. A subsequent appraisal by the International Atomic Energy Agency showed that releases are low and localized from the 16 naval reactors (reported by the IAEA as having come from seven submarines and the icebreaker &quot;Lenin&quot;) which were dumped at five sites in the Kara Sea. Most of the dumped reactors had suffered an accident.

The Soviet submarine K-27 was scuttled in Stepovogo Bay with its two reactors filled with spent nuclear fuel. At a seminar in February 2012 it was revealed that the reactors on board the submarine could re-achieve criticality and explode (a buildup of heat leading to a steam explosion vs. nuclear). The catalogue of waste dumped at sea by the Soviets, according to documents seen by Bellona, includes some 17,000 containers of radioactive waste, 19 ships containing radioactive waste, 14 nuclear reactors, including five that still contain spent nuclear fuel; 735 other pieces of radioactively contaminated heavy machinery, and the K-27 nuclear submarine with its two reactors loaded with nuclear fuel.

==Nature reserve==

The Great Arctic State Nature Reserve—the largest nature reserve of Russia—was founded on 11 May 1993, by Resolution No. 431 of the Government of the Russian Federation (RF). The Kara Sea Islands section (4,000 km2) of the Great Arctic Nature Reserve includes: the Sergei Kirov Archipelago, the Voronina Island, the Izvestiy TSIK Islands, the Arctic Institute Islands, the Svordrup Island, Uedineniya (Ensomheden) and a number of smaller islands. This section represents rather fully the natural and biological diversity of Arctic sea islands of the eastern part of the Kara Sea.

Nearby, the Franz Josef Land and Severny Island in northern Novaya Zemlya are also registered as a sanctuary, the Russian Arctic National Park.

<text>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ( ; born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. , April 16, 1947) is an American former basketball player. He played professionally for 20 seasons for the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins as a center. A member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Abdul-Jabbar won a record six NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards. He was a 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA Team member, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team selection. He was a member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, and was twice voted the NBA Finals MVP. He was named to three NBA anniversary teams (35th, 50th, and 75th). Widely regarded as one of the greatest NBA players of all time, he has been called the greatest basketball player of all time by many of his contemporaries such as Pat Riley, Isiah Thomas, and Julius Erving. Abdul-Jabbar broke the NBA&#x27;s career scoring record in 1984, and held it until LeBron James surpassed him in 2023.

Abdul-Jabbar was known as Lew Alcindor when he played at Power Memorial, a private Catholic high school in New York City, where he led their team to 71 consecutive wins. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning three consecutive national championships under head coach John Wooden. Alcindor was a record three-time most outstanding player of the NCAA tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Milwaukee Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, he spent six seasons with the team. After leading the Bucks to their first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark skyhook shot, he established himself as one of the league&#x27;s top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career, during which time the team won five NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s contributions were a key component in the Showtime era of Lakers basketball. Over his 20-year NBA career, his teams reached the playoffs 18 times and got past the first round 14 times; his teams reached the NBA Finals ten times.

At the time of his retirement at age 42 in 1989, Abdul-Jabbar was the NBA&#x27;s regular season career leader in points (38,387), games played (1,560), minutes (57,446), field goals made (15,837), field goal attempts (28,307), blocked shots (3,189), defensive rebounds (9,394), and personal fouls (4,657). He remains the all-time leader in minutes played and field goals made. He ranks second in career points and field goal attempts, and is third all-time in both total rebounds (17,440) and blocked shots. ESPN named him the greatest center of all time in 2007, the greatest player in college basketball history in 2008, and the second best player in NBA history (behind Michael Jordan) in 2016. Abdul-Jabbar has also been an actor, a basketball coach, a best-selling author, and a martial artist, having trained in Jeet Kune Do under Bruce Lee and appeared in his film &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1972). In 2012, Abdul-Jabbar was selected by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be a U.S. global cultural ambassador. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life==
Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. was born in Harlem, New York City, the only child of Cora Lillian, a department store price checker, and Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Sr., a transit police officer and jazz musician. Cora was born in North Carolina but came to Harlem as part of the Great Migration. Ferdinand Sr. was the child of immigrants from Trinidad; his uncle was the Black activist and medical pioneer Dr. John Alcindor. Alcindor grew up in the Dyckman Street projects in the Inwood neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, which he moved to at the age of 3 in 1950. At birth, Alcindor weighed and was long. Always very tall for his age, he was already by the age of nine. Alcindor was often depressed as a teenager because of the stares and comments about his height. By the eighth grade (age 13–14), he had grown to and could already dunk a basketball.

Alcindor attended Power Memorial Academy, a private all-boys Catholic high school, where he was one of the few Blacks. He led coach Jack Donohue&#x27;s teams to three straight New York City Catholic championships, a 71–game winning streak, and a 79–2 overall record. This earned him &quot;The Tower from Power&quot; nickname. His 2,067 total points were a New York City high school record. The team won the national high school boys basketball championship when Alcindor was in 10th and 11th grade and was runner-up his senior year. He had a strained relationship in his final year with Donohue after the coach called him a &quot;nigger&quot;.

Alcindor wrote for the Harlem Youth Action Project newspaper. The Harlem riot of 1964, which was prompted by the fatal shooting of 15-year old black boy James Powell by a New York police officer, triggered Alcindor&#x27;s interest in racial politics. &quot;Right then and there, I knew who I was, who I had to be. I was going to be black rage personified, Black Power in the flesh&quot;, he said.

==College career==

Alcindor was not able to play professionally in the NBA out of high school. At the time, the league only accepted players beginning with the year that they could have hypothetically graduated from college. His other options to play basketball professionally would have been to join the Harlem Globetrotters or play overseas. However, Alcindor&#x27;s goal was to attend college. Recruited by hundreds of schools, he was the most sought-after prospect since Wilt Chamberlain. Southern teams that were segregated were willing to break the color line to acquire Alcindor. He chose to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, after being recruited by Bruins assistant coach Jerry Norman.

By now tall, Alcindor was relegated to the freshman team in his first year with the Bruins, as freshman were ineligible to play varsity until 1972. The freshman squad included Lucius Allen, Kenny Heitz, and Lynn Shackelford, who were fellow high-school All-Americans. On November 27, 1965, Alcindor made his first public performance in UCLA&#x27;s annual varsity–freshman exhibition game, attended by 12,051 fans in the inaugural game at the Bruins&#x27; new Pauley Pavilion. The 1965–66 varsity team was the two-time defending national champions and the top-ranked team in preseason polls. The freshman team won 75–60 behind Alcindor&#x27;s 31 points and 21 rebounds. It was the first time a freshman team had beaten the UCLA varsity squad. The varsity had lost Gail Goodrich and Keith Erickson from the championship squad to graduation, and starting guard Freddie Goss was out sick. After the game, UPI wrote: &quot;UCLA&#x27;s Bruins open defense of their national basketball title this week, but right now they&#x27;re only the second best team on campus.&quot; The freshman team was 21–0 that year, dominating against junior college and other freshman teams, as Alcindor averaged 33 points and 21 rebounds per game.
Alcindor made his varsity debut as a sophomore in 1966 and received national coverage. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described him as &quot;The New Superstar&quot; after he scored 56 points in his first game, which broke the UCLA single-game record held by Gail Goodrich. He scored 61 later in the season. Averaging 29 points and 15.5 rebounds per game, he led UCLA to an undefeated 30–0 record and a national championship, their third title in four years and first of seven consecutive. After the season, the dunk was banned in college basketball in an attempt to curtail his dominance; critics dubbed it the &quot;Alcindor Rule&quot;. It was not rescinded until the 1976–77 season. Alcindor was the main contributor to the team&#x27;s three-year record of 88 wins and only two losses: one to the University of Houston in which Alcindor had an eye injury, and the other to crosstown rival USC who played a &quot;stall game&quot;; there was no shot clock in that era, allowing the Trojans to hold the ball as long as it wanted before attempting to score. They limited Alcindor to only four shots and 10 points.

During his college career, Alcindor was a three-time national player of the year (1967–1969), a three-time unanimous first-team All-American (1967–1969), played on three NCAA basketball champion teams (1967, 1968, and 1969), was honored as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament three times, and became the first-ever Naismith College Player of the Year in 1969. He was the only player to win the Helms Foundation Player of the Year award three times. He had considered transferring to Michigan because of unfulfilled recruiting promises. UCLA player Willie Naulls introduced Alcindor and teammate Lucius Allen to athletic booster Sam Gilbert, who convinced the pair to remain at UCLA.

During his junior year, Alcindor suffered a scratched left cornea on January 12, 1968, in a game against California (UC Berkeley) when he was struck by Tom Henderson in a rebound battle. He missed the next two games against Stanford and Portland. His cornea would again be scratched during his pro career, which subsequently caused him to wear goggles for eye protection. On January 20, the Bruins faced coach Guy Lewis&#x27;s Houston Cougars in the first-ever nationally televised regular-season college basketball game, with 52,693 in attendance at the Astrodome. In a contest billed as the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;, Cougar forward Elvin Hayes scored 39 points and had 15 rebounds, while Alcindor, suffering from his eye injury, was held to just 15 points as Houston won 71–69, ending UCLA&#x27;s 47-game winning streak. Hayes and Alcindor had a rematch in the semifinals of the NCAA tournament, where UCLA, with a healthy Alcindor, defeated Houston 101–69 en route to the national championship. UCLA limited Hayes, who was averaging 37.7 points per game, to only ten points. Wooden credited his assistant Norman for devising the diamond-and-one defense that contained Hayes. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ran a cover story on the game and used the headline: &quot;Lew&#x27;s Revenge: The Rout of Houston.&quot; As a senior in 1968–69, Alcindor led the Bruins to their third consecutive national title.
During the summer of 1968, Alcindor took the &quot;shahada&quot; twice and converted to Sunni Islam from Catholicism. He adopted the Arabic name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, though he did not begin using it publicly until 1971. He boycotted the 1968 Summer Olympics, deciding not to try out for the U.S. Olympic basketball team, who went on to win the gold medal. Alcindor was protesting the unequal treatment of African Americans in the United States, stating that he was &quot;trying to point out to the world the futility of winning the gold medal for this country and then coming back to live under oppression&quot;.

As the NBA did not allow college underclassmen to make an early NBA draft declaration, Alcindor completed his studies and earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in history in 1969. In his free time, he practiced martial arts. He studied aikido in New York between his sophomore and junior year before learning Jeet Kune Do under Bruce Lee in Los Angeles.

===School records===
As of the 2019–20 UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s basketball team season, he still holds or shares a number of individual records at UCLA:
* Highest career scoring average: 26.4
* Most career field goals: 943 — tied with Don MacLean
* Most points in a season: 870 (1967) 
* Highest season scoring average: 29.0 (1967)
* Most field goals in a season: 346 (1967) — also the second most at 303 (1969) and the third most at 294 (1968)
* Most free throw attempts in a season: 274 (1967)
* Most points in a single game: 61
* Most field goals in a single game: 26 (vs. Washington State, February 25, 1967)

He is represented in the top ten in a number of other school records, including season and career rebounds, second only to Bill Walton.

==Professional career==

===Milwaukee Bucks (1969–1975)===

====Rookie of the Year (1969–1970)====

The Globetrotters offered Alcindor $1 million to play for them, but he declined and was picked first overall in the 1969 NBA draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, who were in only their second season of existence. The Bucks had won a coin toss with the Phoenix Suns for the first pick. He was also chosen first overall in the 1969 American Basketball Association draft by the New York Nets. The Nets believed that they had the upper hand in securing Alcindor&#x27;s services because he was from New York; however, when Alcindor told both the Bucks and the Nets that he would accept only one offer from each team, he rejected the Nets&#x27; bid as too low. Sam Gilbert negotiated the contract along with Los Angeles businessman Ralph Shapiro at no charge. After Alcindor chose the Milwaukee Bucks&#x27; offer of $1.4 million, the Nets offered a guaranteed $3.25 million. Alcindor declined the offer, saying: &quot;A bidding war degrades the people involved. It would make me feel like a flesh peddler, and I don&#x27;t want to think like that.&quot;

Alcindor&#x27;s presence enabled the Bucks to claim second place in the NBA&#x27;s Eastern Division with a 56–26 record (improved from 27–55 the previous year). On February 21, 1970, he scored 51 points in a 140–127 win over the SuperSonics. Alcindor was an instant star, ranking second in the league in scoring (28.8 ppg) and third in rebounding (14.5 rpg), for which he was awarded the title of NBA Rookie of the Year. In the series-clinching game against the Philadelphia 76ers, he recorded 46 points and 25 rebounds. He was the second rookie to score at least 40 points and 25 rebounds in a playoff game, the first being Wilt Chamberlain. He also set an NBA rookie record with 10 or more games of 20+ points scored during the playoffs, tied by Jayson Tatum in 2018.

====First championship, MVP, and Finals MVP (1970–1971)====
The next season, the Bucks acquired All-Star guard Oscar Robertson. Milwaukee went on to record the best record in the league with 66 victories in the 1970–71 season, including a then-record 20 straight wins. Alcindor was awarded his first of six NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, along with his first scoring title (31.7 ppg). He also led the league in total points, with 2,596. The Bucks won the NBA title, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. Alcindor posted 27 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in Game 4, and he was named the Finals MVP after averaging 27 points per game on 60.5% shooting in the series.

====MVP recognition and trade request (1971–1975)====
During the offseason, Alcindor and Robertson joined Bucks head coach Larry Costello on a three-week basketball tour of Africa on behalf of the State Department. In a press conference at the State Department on June 3, 1971, he stated that going forward he wanted to be called by his Muslim name, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, its translation roughly &quot;noble one, servant of the Almighty [i.e., servant of God]&quot;.
Abdul-Jabbar remained a dominant force for the Bucks. The following year, he repeated as scoring champion (34.8 ppg and 2,822 total points) and became the first player to be named the NBA Most Valuable Player twice in his first three years. In 1974, Abdul-Jabbar led the Bucks to their fourth consecutive Midwest Division title, and he won his third MVP Award in four years. He was among the top five NBA players in scoring (27.0 ppg, third), rebounding (14.5 rpg, fourth), blocked shots (283, second), and field goal percentage (.539, second). Milwaukee advanced to the 1974 finals, losing to the Boston Celtics in seven games.

Robertson, who became a free agent in the offseason, retired in September 1974 after he was unable to agree on a contract with the Bucks. On October 3, Abdul-Jabbar privately requested a trade to the New York Knicks, with his second choice being the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) and his third, the Los Angeles Lakers. He had never spoken negatively of the city of Milwaukee or its fans, but he said that being in the Midwest did not fit his cultural needs. Two days later in a pre-season game before the 1974–75 season against the Celtics in Buffalo, New York, Abdul-Jabbar caught a fingernail in his left eye from Don Nelson and suffered a corneal abrasion; this angered him enough to punch the backboard stanchion, breaking two bones in his right hand. He missed the first 16 games of the season, during which the Bucks were 3–13, and returned in late November wearing protective goggles. On March 13, 1975, sportscaster Marv Albert reported that Abdul-Jabbar requested a trade to either New York or Los Angeles, preferably to the Knicks. The following day after a loss in Milwaukee to the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar confirmed to reporters his desire to play in another city. He averaged 30.0 points during the season, but Milwaukee finished in last place in the division at 38–44.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1975–1989)===

====Fourth and fifth MVP awards (1975–1977)====

In 1975, the Lakers acquired Abdul-Jabbar and reserve center Walt Wesley from the Bucks for center Elmore Smith, guard Brian Winters, blue-chip rookies Dave Meyers and Junior Bridgeman, and cash. In the 1975–76 season, his first with the Lakers, he had a dominating season, averaging 27.7 points per game and leading the league in rebounding (16.9), blocked shots (4.12), and total minutes played (3,379). His 1,111 defensive rebounds remains the NBA single-season record (defensive rebounds were not recorded prior to the 1973–74 season). He earned his fourth MVP award, becoming the first winner in Lakers&#x27; franchise history, but missed the post-season for the second straight year as the Lakers finished 40–42.

After acquiring a cast of no-name free agents, the Lakers were projected to finished near the bottom of the Pacific Division in 1976–77. Abdul-Jabbar helped lead the team to the best record (53–29) in the NBA, and he won his fifth MVP award, tying Bill Russell&#x27;s record. Abdul-Jabbar led the league in field goal percentage (.579), was third in scoring (26.2), and was second in rebounds (13.3) and blocked shots (3.18). In the playoffs, the Lakers beat the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference semifinals, setting up a confrontation with the Portland Trail Blazers. The result was a memorable matchup, pitting Abdul-Jabbar against a young, injury-free Bill Walton. Although Abdul-Jabbar dominated the series statistically, Walton and the Trail Blazers (who were experiencing their first-ever run in the playoffs) swept the Lakers, behind Walton&#x27;s skillful passing and timely plays.

====Playoff disappointments (1977–1979)====
Two minutes into the opening game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar broke his right hand punching Milwaukee&#x27;s Kent Benson in retaliation to the rookie&#x27;s elbow to his stomach. Benson suffered a black right eye and required two stitches. According to Benson, Abdul-Jabbar initiated the elbowing, but there were no witnesses and it was not captured on replays. Abdul-Jabbar, who broke the same bone in 1975 after he punched the backboard support, was out for almost two months and missed 20 games. He was fined a then-league record $5,000 but was not suspended. Benson missed one game but was not punished by the league. The Lakers were 8–13 when Abdul-Jabbar returned. He was not named to the 1978 NBA All-Star Game, the only time in his 20-year career he was not selected to an All-Star Game. Chicago&#x27;s Artis Gilmore and Detroit&#x27;s Bob Lanier were chosen as reserves for the West, with Walton starting
at center. Amid criticism from the media over his performance, Abdul-Jabbar had 39 points, 20 rebounds, six assists and four blocks in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers the day the All-Star rosters were announced. He added 37 points and 30 rebounds in a victory over the New Jersey Nets (now Brooklyn) in the final game before the All-Star break.

Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s play remained strong during the next two seasons, being named to the All-NBA Second Team twice, the All-Defense First Team once, and the All-Defense Second Team once. The Lakers, however, continued to be stymied in the playoffs, being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in both 1978 (first round) and 1979 (semifinals).

====Last MVP award and championship success (1979–1985)====

The Lakers selected Magic Johnson with the first overall pick of 1979 NBA draft. They had acquired the pick from the New Orleans Jazz (later Utah) in 1976, when league rules required that they compensate Los Angeles for their signing of free agent Gail Goodrich. The addition of Johnson paved the way for the Lakers&#x27; Showtime dynasty of the 1980s, appearing in the finals eight times and winning five NBA championships. While less dominant than in his younger years, Abdul-Jabbar reinforced his status as one of the greatest basketball players ever, adding an additional four All-NBA First Team selections and two All-Defense First Team honors. He won his record sixth MVP award in his first season with Johnson in 1979–80. In the 1980 finals, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 33.4 points in five games, spraining his ankle in Game 5, but returning to finish the contest with 40 points and leading the team to a win. He missed Game 6, when the Lakers clinched the title, and Johnson was named the Finals MVP after recording 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists in the finale.

Abdul-Jabbar continued to average 20 or more points per game in the following six seasons. The Lakers won another championship in 1981–82, but he suffered migraines in the finals, averaging just 18 points per game against Philadelphia. In 14 playoff games, he finished with a 20.4 point average, the lowest of his career at the time. The Lakers advanced to the 1983 NBA Finals in a rematch against the 76ers, who had acquired Moses Malone to shore up their center position after Abdul-Jabbar had outplayed their big-man duo of Darryl Dawkins and Caldwell Jones in the previous finals. The 76ers swept the Lakers 4–0, and Malone was named the Finals MVP after outrebounding Abdul-Jabbar 72–30 in the series. Malone had 27 offensive rebounds, which nearly equaled Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s total rebounds (30). 

Before the 1983–84 season, Abdul-Jabbar signed a two-year, $3 million contract with the Lakers, with none of the amount deferred. He fell ill with viral hepatitis during training camp, which rendered him weak for a month after returning. He scored 10 points at Golden State on December 22, 1983, dropping his season average to 17.7, almost 10 points below his career average. His scoring picked up after Christmas. On the road against Utah on April 5, 1984, Abdul-Jabbar broke Chamberlain&#x27;s record for most career points in the NBA. He received a pass from Johnson and scored from on his patent skyhook over the shot-blocking specialist Mark Eaton. The game was played at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, one of 11 home games for the Jazz in the Las Vegas Valley that season. The contest drew 18,389 fans, the Jazz&#x27;s largest home crowd since moving from New Orleans before the 1979–80 season. For the first time since the 1980–81 season, Abdul-Jabbar led the Lakers in both scoring (21.5) and rebounding (7.3) during the season. Playing consistently better than he had over the past few years, he was named to the All-NBA First Team for the ninth time in his career, and he was voted to the All-NBA Defensive Second Team, the final all-defensive selection of his career. The team advanced to the 1984 NBA Finals but lost to Boston.
The 1984–85 season was expected to be Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s final season, as he had maintained since breaking Chamberlain&#x27;s record that he would be retiring. Teams began honoring him in his final appearance in their home arena, but the Lakers instructed them not to use the word &quot;retirement&quot; in their ceremony. He had left open the possibility of changing his mind, but did not want to accept retirement gifts and play again, as Dave Cowens had done. On December 5, 1984, Abdul-Jabbar agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract extension with the Lakers, with none of the money deferred. He won his second Finals MVP in 1985, when he became the oldest to win the award at 38 years and 54 days old. He averaged 25.7 points, 9 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.5 blocks in the series against the Celtics. He was initially outplayed in Game 1, scoring 12 points with three rebounds against 30-year-old Boston center Robert Parish, who had 18 points and eight rebounds in a 148–114 win over the Lakers, dubbed the &quot;Memorial Day Massacre&quot;. At the team&#x27;s film session the following day, Abdul-Jabbar—who normally sat near the back—was seated in the front row, and accepted all of head coach Pat Riley&#x27;s criticism. Before Game 2, Abdul-Jabbar asked if his father could ride on the team bus to the game. Typically a hard-liner on rules, Riley agreed to make an exception. Abdul-Jabbar bounced back with 30 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists and three blocks in a 109–102 victory. In the Lakers’ four wins, he averaged 30.2 points, 11.3 rebounds, 6.5 assists and 2.0 blocks. The title ended the Celtics&#x27; streak of eight consecutive championships against the Lakers.

====Final playing years and sixth ring (1985–1989)====
Abdul-Jabbar played in his 17th season in 1985–86, breaking the previous NBA record for seasons played of 16, held by Dolph Schayes, John Havlicek, Paul Silas, and Elvin Hayes. On November 12, 1985, he signed to a one-year extension of his contract at the same $2 million salary, while maintaining the option to retire after the 1985–86 season. Prior to the 1986–87 season, he gained , reaching close to , to compete against the growing number of 7-footers (2.1 m) in the league. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals in each of his final three seasons, starting with a championship over Boston in 1987. Afterwards, he signed a two-year contract with the Lakers.

Riley guaranteed that the Lakers would be the first NBA team to win consecutive titles since the 1968–69 Celtics, and they defeated the Detroit Pistons for the championship in 1988. Abdul-Jabbar made only 3 of 14 shots in Game 6 of the finals, but he converted two free throws with 14 seconds remaining to extend the series to seven games. After winning the season finale, in which he had only four points and three rebounds, the 41-year-old center announced in the locker room that he would return for one more season before retiring. His points, rebounds, and minutes had dropped in his 19th season, and there were reports prior to the game that he was retiring after the contest. On his &quot;retirement tour&quot; he received standing ovations at games, both home and away, and gifts ranging from a yacht that said &quot;Captain Skyhook&quot; to framed jerseys from his career to a Persian rug. At the Forum against Seattle in his final regular season game, every Laker came onto the court wearing Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s trademark goggles. The Lakers lost to the Pistons in a four-game sweep in the 1989 finals.

At the time of his retirement, Abdul-Jabbar held the record for most career games played in the NBA. He was also the all-time record holder for most minutes played (57,446), most field goals made (15,837), most points (38,387), and most 1,000-point seasons (19).

==Coaching career==
In 1995, Abdul-Jabbar began expressing an interest in coaching and imparting knowledge from his playing days. His opportunities were limited despite the success he enjoyed during his playing days. During his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation for being introverted and sullen. He was often unfriendly with the media. His sensitivity and shyness created a perception of him being aloof and surly. At the time, his mentality was that he either did not have the time or did not owe anything to anyone. Magic Johnson recalled as a kid being brushed off after asking him for an autograph. Abdul-Jabbar might freeze out a reporter if they touched him, and he once refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.

Abdul-Jabbar had spent most of his career with a reserved attitude towards media attention (since he did not have to deal with it as a star at UCLA) before he softened up near the end of his career. Abdul-Jabbar said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t understand that I also had affected people that way and that&#x27;s what it was all about. I always saw it like they were trying to pry. I was way too suspicious and I paid a price for it.&quot; However, he believes it was his reputation as a &quot;difficult person&quot;, alongside his attempts at trying to break into coaching while nearing the age of fifty, that affected his chances of becoming a head coach within the NBA or NCAA.

Abdul-Jabbar worked as an assistant for the Los Angeles Clippers and the Seattle SuperSonics, helping mentor, among others, their young centers, Michael Olowokandi and Jerome James. Abdul-Jabbar was the head coach of the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League in 2002, leading the team to the league&#x27;s championship that season, but he failed to land the head coaching position at Columbia University a year later. He then worked as a scout for the New York Knicks. He returned to the Lakers as a special assistant coach to Phil Jackson for six seasons (2005–2011). Early on, he mentored their young center, Andrew Bynum. Abdul-Jabbar also served as a volunteer coach at Alchesay High School on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in Whiteriver, Arizona, in 1998. He moved on from coaching in 2013 after unsuccessfully lobbying for open head coach positions with UCLA and the Milwaukee Bucks.

==Player profile==
On offense, Abdul-Jabbar was a dominant low-post threat. In contrast to other low-post specialists like Wilt Chamberlain or Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, he was a slender giant, standing tall while weighing around , although he bulked to in 1986; in his early years, he used that frame for agility and speed while in later years he utilized a bigger frame for trying to guard under the basket. Abdul-Jabbar was famous for his ambidextrous skyhook shot. It contributed to his .559 career field goal percentage, which ranked eighth in NBA history at the time of his retirement, and reputation as a feared clutch shooter. He shot above 50% in every season but his last.

Abdul-Jabbar maintained a dominant presence on defense. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Team eleven times. He frustrated opponents with his superior shot-blocking ability and denied an average of 2.6 shots a game. He was not an aggressive rebounder, relying more on his size as a 7-footer instead of positioning. After the pounding he endured early in his career, his rebounding average fell to between six or eight a game in his latter years. As a teammate, Abdul-Jabbar exuded natural leadership and was affectionately called &quot;Cap&quot;, or &quot;Captain&quot;, by his colleagues. He had an even temperament, which Riley said made him coachable.

A strict fitness regime made Abdul-Jabbar one of the most durable players of all time. He began a year-around conditioning program at age 26. While in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar started doing yoga in 1976 to improve his flexibility, and was notable for his physical fitness regimen. He said: &quot;There is no way I could have played as long as I did without yoga.&quot; Because of his metabolism, he had difficulty putting on weight. Prior to the 1979–80 season, he gained from 240 to after switching from free weights to Nautilus equipment. He also switched that offseason from tai chi to yoga. To reduce wear during his later years, Riley did not have him inbound the ball on made baskets, and had him wait at the opposite end of the court on free throws. In what he described as playing a &quot;smarter game&quot; to conserve energy, Abdul-Jabbar sometimes would be the last player to set up on offense by several seconds after staying behind on defense to see if the Lakers scored on a fast break. In 1981, he responded to criticism that he did not hustle: &quot;You have to understand I have to play 42 to 45 minutes a night, and it&#x27;s like mowing a huge estate lawn. If you rush out and run around furiously, it&#x27;s self-defeating. You&#x27;ll be worn out just at the point when you&#x27;re most needed.&quot; Abdul-Jabbar finished his career with then-NBA records of 20 seasons and 1,560 games played, later broken by former Celtics center Robert Parish.

Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his trademark goggles after getting poked in the eye during preseason in 1974. He continued wearing them for years until abandoning them in the 1979 playoffs. He resumed wearing goggles in October 1980 after being accidentally poked in the right eye by Houston&#x27;s Rudy Tomjanovich. After years of being jabbed in the eyes, Abdul-Jabbar developed corneal erosion syndrome, occasionally experiencing pain when his eyes dry up. He missed three games in December 1986 due to the condition.

===Skyhook===
Abdul-Jabbar was well known for his trademark skyhook, a hook shot in which he raised the ball and released it at the highest point of his arm&#x27;s arching motion. He could shoot the skyhook from up to . With his long arms and great height, he released the ball so high that it was difficult for a defender to block without committing a goaltending violation. His body being between the defender and the ball made it further difficult to block, as did extending his non-shooting arm to fend off opponents. He was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left, which he developed in his later years.

According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the ambidextrious Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was &quot;the only shot I could use that didn&#x27;t get smashed back in my face&quot;. He also watched Cliff Hagan shoot the hook with the St. Louis Hawks. To prevent his hook from being blocked from behind, he was advised by Wooden to do away with the typical sweeping motion of a hook shot, instead keeping the ball close to his body and shooting with a straighter motion. Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s hook shot improved in his junior year at UCLA, after the dunk was banned. In his final college years, he often released the ball several feet above the rim.

==Legacy==
Abdul-Jabbar won a record six MVP awards. His 38,387 career points remained the NBA&#x27;s career scoring record until February 7, 2023, when he was surpassed by LeBron James of the Lakers in Los Angeles. Abdul-Jabbar attended the game, and passed the game ball to James during the in-game ceremony after the record was broken. Abdul-Jabbar held the scoring mark for nearly 39 years, the longest span in league history. His skyhook is considered one of the most unstoppable shots ever. He won six NBA championships and two Finals MVP awards, was voted to 15 All-NBA and 11 All-Defensive Teams, and was selected to 19 All-Star teams, a record which stood until it was surpassed by James in 2024. Abdul-Jabbar was named to the NBA&#x27;s 35th, 50th, and 75th anniversary teams. He averaged 24.6 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 2.6 blocks per game in his career, including three straight seasons where he averaged at least 30 points and 16 rebounds, and six times he averaged at least 27 points and 14.5 rebounds in the same season. He is ranked as the NBA&#x27;s third leading all-time rebounder (17,440). He is the third all-time in registered blocks (3,189), which is impressive because this basketball statistic was not recorded until the fourth year of his career (1974). He is one of five players who have led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in the same season.

Abdul-Jabbar combined dominance during his career peak with the longevity and sustained excellence of his later years. A pioneer in using yoga in the NBA, he also credited Bruce Lee with teaching him &quot;the discipline and spirituality of martial arts, which was greatly responsible for me being able to play competitively in the NBA for 20 years with very few injuries&quot;. Abdul-Jabbar played in 95 percent of his team&#x27;s regular-season games during his career, including 80 or more games in 11 of his 20 seasons. Five times he played in all 82 games. After claiming his sixth and final MVP in 1980, he continued to average above 20 points in the following six seasons, including 23 points per game in his 17th season at age 38. He earned first-team All-NBA selections that were 15 years apart and Finals MVPs 14 seasons from each other.

Among the most graceful basketball players ever, Abdul-Jabbar is regarded as one of the best centers ever and one of the greatest players in NBA history; he was voted the best center of all time by ESPN ahead of Wilt Chamberlain in 2007, and ranked 4 in &quot;Slam&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Players Of All-Time&quot; in 2018, and No. 3 in ESPN&#x27;s list of the top 74 NBA players of all time in 2020, the best center ever ahead of Bill Russell and Chamberlain. League experts and basketball legends frequently mentioned him when considering the greatest player of all time. Riley said in 1985: &quot;Why judge anymore? When a man has broken records, won championships, endured tremendous criticism and responsibility, why judge? Let&#x27;s toast him as the greatest player ever.&quot; In 2023, as James was on the verge of breaking the NBA career scoring record, Abdul-Jabbar remained as Riley&#x27;s choice as the greatest: &quot;We don&#x27;t win championships without the greatest player in the history of the game, who had the greatest weapon in the history of the game. The skyhook was unstoppable. Last minute of the game, it&#x27;s going to one guy&quot;. As president of the Miami Heat, Riley had won two NBA titles with James on their roster. Isiah Thomas remarked: &quot;If they say the numbers don&#x27;t lie, then Kareem is the greatest ever to play the game.&quot; In 2013, Julius Erving said: &quot;In terms of players all-time, Kareem is still the number one guy. He&#x27;s the guy you gotta start your franchise with.&quot; In 2015, ESPN named Abdul-Jabbar the best center in NBA history, and ranked him No. 2 behind Michael Jordan among the greatest NBA players ever. While Jordan&#x27;s shots were enthralling and considered unfathomable, Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s skyhook appeared automatic, and he himself called the shot &quot;unsexy&quot;. In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s only recognized rookie card became the most expensive basketball card ever sold (the record has since been surpassed) when it went for $501,900 at auction. In 2022, he was ranked No. 3 (first in his position) in ESPN&#x27;s NBA 75th Anniversary Team list, and No. 3 (behind Jordan and James) in a similar list by &quot;The Athletic&quot;.

Abdul-Jabbar was also the first ever NBA player to sign a sneaker endorsement deal with Adidas in 1978. He went on to become the first ever player overall with a signature shoe shortly after. In 2014, the UCLA Bruins wore &quot;The Blueprint&quot; Crazy 8 against Colorado on Feb. 13, and the shoes were sold online and at an Adidas store in New Orleans—during NBA All-Star weekend—starting on Feb. 14.

==Film and television==

Playing in Los Angeles facilitated Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s trying his hand at acting. He made his film debut in Bruce Lee&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Game of Death&quot;.

In 1980, Abdul-Jabbar played co-pilot Roger Murdock in &quot;Airplane!&quot; He has a scene in which a little boy looks at him and remarks that he is in fact Abdul-Jabbar, spoofing the appearance of football star Elroy &quot;Crazylegs&quot; Hirsch as an airplane pilot in the 1957 drama that served as the inspiration for &quot;Airplane!&quot;, &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; Staying in character, Abdul-Jabbar states that he is merely Roger Murdock, an airline co-pilot; the boy continues to insist that Abdul-Jabbar is &quot;the greatest&quot;, but that according to his father he does not &quot;work hard on defense&quot; and that he does not &quot;really try, except during the playoffs&quot;. This causes Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s character to snap and break character: &quot;The hell I don&#x27;t!&quot; He then grabs the boy and snarls that he has &quot;been hearing that crap ever since I was at UCLA&quot; and been &quot;busting my buns every night!&quot; He instructs the boy: &quot;Tell your old man to drag [Bill] Walton and [Bob] Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes.&quot; When Murdock loses consciousness later in the film, he collapses at the controls wearing Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s goggles and yellow Lakers&#x27; shorts. In 2014, Abdul-Jabbar and &quot;Airplane!&quot; co-star Robert Hays (character Ted Striker) reprised their &quot;Airplane!&quot; roles in a parody commercial promoting Wisconsin tourism.
Abdul-Jabbar has had numerous other television and film appearances, often playing himself. He has had roles in movies such as &quot;Fletch&quot;, &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot; and &quot;Forget Paris&quot;, and television series such as &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;Living Single&quot;, &quot;Amen&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (his height humorously contrasted with that of diminutive child star Gary Coleman), &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;New Girl&quot;. Abdul-Jabbar played a genie in a lamp in a 1984 episode of &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;. He also played himself on the February 10, 1994, episode of the sketch comedy television series &quot;In Living Color&quot;.

Abdul-Jabbar appeared in the television version of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot;, played the Archangel of Basketball in &quot;Slam Dunk Ernest&quot;, and had a brief non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;BASEketball&quot;. Abdul-Jabbar was also the co-executive producer of the 1994 TV film &quot;The Vernon Johns Story&quot;. He has also made appearances on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in a 2006 skit called &quot;HipHopKetball II: The ReJazzebration Remix &#x27;06&quot;, and in 2008 as a stage manager who is sent out on a mission to find Nazi gold. Abdul-Jabbar also voiced himself in a 2011 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Love Is a Many Strangled Thing&quot;. He had a recurring role as himself on the NBC series &quot;Guys with Kids&quot;, which aired from 2012 to 2013. On Al Jazeera English he expressed his desire to be remembered not just as a player, but also as somebody who used their mind and made other contributions.

Abdul-Jabbar appeared in the music video for &quot;Good Goodbye&quot;, a 2017 song by rock band Linkin Park featuring rappers Pusha T and Stormzy. In the video, Abdul-Jabbar plays the role of a warlord or emperor of a dunk contest where Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington has to dunk on several people in order to save his own life. In an interview about the video, Bennington said that he believes Abdul-Jabbar is the &quot;greatest [basketball] player of all-time&quot;.

In February 2019, he appeared in season 12 episode 16 of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, &quot;The D&amp;D Vortex&quot;. In 2021, Abdul-Jabbar made a guest appearance as himself in a season 2 episode of &quot;Dave&quot;. The episode he appeared in was also named after him. Abdul-Jabbar makes a cameo appearance as himself in the 2022 Netflix film &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;. In 2023, Abdul-Jabbar appeared as himself in season 7, episode 3 of the Showtime series &quot;Billions&quot;.

===Writing===
In September 2018, Abdul-Jabbar was announced as one of the writers for the July 2019 revival of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;.

===Documentaries===
On February 10, 2011, Abdul-Jabbar debuted his film &quot;On the Shoulders of Giants&quot;, documenting the tumultuous journey of the famed yet often-overlooked New York Renaissance professional basketball team, at Science Park High School in Newark, New Jersey. The event was simulcast live throughout the school, city, and state. In 2015, he appeared in &quot;Kareem: Minority of One&quot;, an HBO documentary on his life. In 2020, Abdul-Jabbar was the executive producer and narrator of the History channel special &quot;Black Patriots: Heroes of the Revolution&quot;. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for his narration.

===Reality television===
Abdul-Jabbar participated in the 2013 ABC reality series &quot;Splash&quot;, a celebrity diving competition. In April 2018, Abdul-Jabbar competed in the all-athlete season of season 26 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and partnered with professional dancer Lindsay Arnold.

==Writing and activism==

In 1967, Abdul-Jabbar was the only college athlete to attend the Cleveland Summit, a meeting of prominent black athletes who convened in support of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s refusal to fight in the Vietnam War.

Abdul-Jabbar became a best-selling author and cultural critic. He published several books, mostly on African-American history. His first book, his autobiography &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, was written in 1983 with co-author Peter Knobler. The book&#x27;s title is an homage to jazz great John Coltrane, referring to his album &quot;Giant Steps&quot;. Others include &quot;On the Shoulders of Giants: My Journey Through the Harlem Renaissance&quot;, co-written with Raymond Obstfeld, and &quot;Brothers in Arms: The Epic Story of the 761st Tank Battalion, World War II&#x27;s Forgotten Heroes&quot;, co-written with Anthony Walton, which is a history of the first black armored unit to fight in World War II.

In 2015, Abdul-Jabbar made his adult fiction writing debut with the Victorian mystery novel &quot;Mycroft Holmes&quot;, based around the titular character from the Sherlock Holmes stories. Two sequels followed: &quot;Mycroft and Sherlock&quot; (2018) and &quot;Mycroft and Sherlock: The Empty Birdcage&quot; (2019). All three titles were co-written with Anna Waterhouse.

A regular contributor to discussions about issues of race and religion, among other topics, in national magazines and on television, Abdul-Jabbar has written a regular column for &quot;Time&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on January 25, 2015, to talk about a column saying that Islam should not be blamed for the actions of violent extremists, just as Christianity has not been blamed for the actions of violent extremists who profess Christianity. When asked about being Muslim, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any misgiving about my faith. I&#x27;m very concerned about the people who claim to be Muslims that are murdering people and creating all this mayhem in the world. That is not what Islam is about, and that should not be what people think of when they think about Muslims. But it&#x27;s up to all of us to do something about all of it.&quot;

In November 2014, Abdul-Jabbar published an essay in &quot;Jacobin&quot; calling for just compensation for college athletes, writing that &quot;in the name of fairness, we must bring an end to the indentured servitude of college athletes and start paying them what they are worth.&quot; Commenting on Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 travel ban, he condemned it, saying: &quot;The absence of reason and compassion is the very definition of pure evil because it is a rejection of our sacred values, distilled from millennia of struggle.&quot; 

In 2017, Abdul-Jabber spoke at an event marking Ramadan organized by the Israeli consul Sam Grundwerg at the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles, stressing the importance of Muslim-Jewish relations and cross-cultural exchange.

In June 2021, he published an essay in &quot;Jacobin&quot; on the negative impact on public health of those refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, criticizing Kyrie Irving, among others. Abdul-Jabbar began publishing an online newsletter in 2021.

==Government appointments==

===Cultural ambassador===

In January 2012, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that Abdul-Jabbar had accepted a position as a cultural ambassador for the United States. During the announcement press conference, Abdul-Jabbar commented on the historical legacy of African-Americans as representatives of U.S. culture: &quot;I remember when Louis Armstrong first did it back for President Kennedy, one of my heroes. So it&#x27;s nice to be following in his footsteps.&quot; As part of this role, Abdul-Jabbar traveled to Brazil to promote education for local youths.

===President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition===
Former President Barack Obama announced in his last days of office that he has appointed Abdul-Jabbar along with Gabrielle Douglas and Carli Lloyd to the President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition.

===Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee===
In January 2017, Abdul-Jabbar was appointed to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee by United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. According to the United States Mint, Abdul-Jabbar is a keen coin collector whose interest in the life of Alexander Hamilton had led him into the hobby. He resigned in 2018 due to what the Mint described as &quot;increasing personal obligations&quot;.

==Personal life==

Abdul-Jabbar met Habiba Abdul-Jabbar (born Janice Brown) at a Lakers game during his senior year at UCLA. They married in 1971, and together had three children: daughters Habiba and Sultana and son Kareem Jr., who played basketball at Western Kentucky after attending Valparaiso. Abdul-Jabbar and Janice divorced in 1978. He has another son, Amir, with Cheryl Pistono. Another son, Adam, made an appearance on the TV sitcom &quot;Full House&quot; with him.

In 1983, Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s house burned down. Many of his belongings, including his beloved jazz LP collection of about 3,000 albums, were destroyed. Many Lakers fans sent and brought him albums, which he found uplifting.

In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar performed a tribute to friend Muhammad Ali along with Chance the Rapper.

===Religion and name===
Alcindor grew up in the Catholic Church, but abandoned the faith when he left his home in New York for UCLA. At age 24 in 1971, he converted to Islam and legally became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which means &quot;noble one, servant of the Almighty&quot;. He was named by Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. Abdul-Jabbar purchased and donated 7700 16th Street NW, a house in Washington, D.C., for Khaalis to use as the Hanafi Madh-Hab Center; a few years later, the location would become the place of the 1973 Hanafi Muslim massacre. Eventually, Kareem &quot;found that [he] disagreed with some of Hamaas&#x27; teachings about the Quran, and [they] parted ways.&quot; In 1973, Abdul-Jabbar embarked on a pilgrimage to Libya and Saudi Arabia with the goal of learning enough Arabic for self-study of the Quran, and he &quot;emerged from this pilgrimage with [his] beliefs clarified and [his] faith renewed&quot;. Abdul-Jabbar was also heavily influenced by Malcolm X, a leader of the Nation of Islam. Abdul-Jabbar was invited to join the group, but he declined.

Abdul-Jabbar has spoken about the thinking that was behind his name change when he converted to Islam. He stated that he was &quot;latching on to something that was part of my heritage, because many of the slaves who were brought here were Muslims. My family was brought to America by a French planter named Alcindor, who came here from Trinidad in the 18th century. My people were Yoruba, and their culture survived slavery ... My father found out about that when I was a kid, and it gave me all I needed to know that, hey, I was somebody, even if nobody else knew about it. When I was a kid, no one would believe anything positive that you could say about black people. And that&#x27;s a terrible burden on black people, because they don&#x27;t have an accurate idea of their history, which has been either suppressed or distorted.&quot; His name change further eroded his public image in the United States, mostly in white areas.

In 1998, Abdul-Jabbar reached a settlement after he sued Miami Dolphins running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar (now Abdul-Karim al-Jabbar, born Sharmon Shah) because he felt Karim was profiting off the name he made famous by having the Abdul-Jabbar moniker and number 33 on his Dolphins jersey. As a result, the younger Abdul-Jabbar had to change his jersey nameplate to &quot;Abdul&quot; while playing for the Dolphins. The football player had also been an athlete at UCLA.

===Health problems===
Abdul-Jabbar suffers from migraines, and his use of cannabis to reduce the symptoms has had legal ramifications. In November 2009, Abdul-Jabbar announced that he was suffering from a form of leukemia, Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The disease was diagnosed in December 2008, but Abdul-Jabbar said his condition could be managed by taking oral medication daily, seeing his specialist every other month, and having his blood analyzed regularly. He expressed in a 2009 press conference that he did not believe the illness would stop him from leading a normal life. Abdul-Jabbar is a spokesman for Novartis, the company that produces Gleevec, his cancer medication.

In February 2011, Abdul-Jabbar announced via Twitter that his leukemia was gone and he was &quot;100% cancer free&quot;. A few days later, he clarified his misstatement: &quot;You&#x27;re never really cancer-free and I should have known that. My cancer right now is at an absolute minimum.&quot; In April 2015, Abdul-Jabbar was admitted to hospital when he was diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. Later that week, on his 68th birthday, he underwent quadruple coronary bypass surgery at the UCLA Medical Center.

In 2020 Abdul-Jabbar revealed that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer eleven years earlier.

In February 2023, he spoke out about his atrial fibrillation diagnosis. He partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Wait&quot; to raise awareness of the symptoms of the irregular and rapid heart rhythm condition which increase the risk of stroke. In December 2023, he was hospitalized after he fell and broke his hip while attending a concert.

===Non-athletic honors===
In 2011, Abdul-Jabbar was awarded the Double Helix Medal for his work in raising awareness for cancer research. Also in 2011, Abdul-Jabbar received an honorary degree from New York Institute of Technology. In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by outgoing U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2020, Abdul-Jabbar was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator for his work on the documentary special &quot;Black Patriots: Heroes of The Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="16900" wikidata="Q208607" url="?curid=16900" title="Kung fu (term)">
<text>In general, kung fu ( or kungfu ; ) refers to the Chinese martial arts also called quanfa. In China, it refers to any study, learning, or practice that requires patience, energy, and time to complete. In its original meaning, kung fu can refer to any discipline or skill achieved through hard work and practice, not necessarily martial arts (for example, the discipline of tea making is called the gongfu tea ceremony). The literal equivalent of &quot;Chinese martial art&quot; in Mandarin would be &quot;&quot;.

There are many forms of kung fu, such as Shaolin kung fu, Wing Chun, and tai chi, and they are practiced all over the world. Each form of kung fu has its own principles and techniques, but is best known for its trickery and quickness. It is only in the late twentieth century that this term was used in relation to Chinese martial arts by the Chinese community. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines the term &quot;kung-fu&quot; as &quot;a primarily unarmed Chinese martial art resembling karate&quot; and attributes the first use of &quot;kung fu&quot; in print to &quot;Punch&quot; magazine in 1966. This illustrates how the meaning of this term has been changed in English. The origin of this change can be attributed to the misunderstanding or mistranslation of the term through movie subtitles or dubbing.

==In popular culture==
References to the concepts and use of Chinese martial arts can be found in popular culture. Historically, the influence of Chinese martial arts can be found in books and in the performance arts specific to Asia. Recently, those influences have extended to the movies and television that targets a much wider audience. As a result, Chinese martial arts have spread beyond their national roots and have a global appeal.

Martial arts play a prominent role in the literature genre known as &quot;wuxia&quot;. This type of fiction is based on Chinese concepts of chivalry, a separate martial arts society (武林; &quot;Wulin&quot;) and a central theme involving martial arts. &quot;Wuxia&quot; stories can be traced as far back as the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, becoming popular by the Tang dynasty and evolving into novel form by the Ming dynasty. This genre is still extremely popular in much of Asia and provides a major influence for the public perception of the martial arts.

Martial arts influences can also be found in dance, theater and especially Chinese opera, of which Beijing opera is one of the best-known examples. This popular form of drama dates back to the Tang dynasty and continues to be an example of Chinese culture. Some martial arts movements can be found in Chinese opera and some martial artists can be found as performers in Chinese operas.

In modern times, Chinese martial arts have spawned the genre of cinema known as the kung fu film. The films of Bruce Lee were instrumental in the initial burst of Chinese martial arts&#x27; popularity in the West in the 1970s, following a famous demonstration of &quot;Chinese Boxing&quot; to the US karate community the Long Beach International Karate Championships in 1964. Martial artists and actors such as Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Donnie Yen have continued the appeal of movies of this genre. Jackie Chan successfully brought in a sense of humor in his fighting style into his movies. Martial arts films from China are often referred to as &quot;kung fu movies&quot; (功夫片), or &quot;wire-fu&quot; if extensive wire work is performed for special effects, and are still best known as part of the tradition of kung fu theater. (see also: &quot;wuxia&quot;, Hong Kong action cinema).

=== Influence on early hip hop ===
In the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community. With the release of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; in 1973, kung fu movies became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films&#x27; popularity well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth from every borough in New York City were attending movies in Manhattan&#x27;s Times Square every night to watch the latest films.

Among these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during this time, hip hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was DJ Kool Herc, who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or breakdancing, a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences.

Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and &quot;up rocking&quot; (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung fu fights. The dancers&#x27; ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group Rock Steady Crew, described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, &quot;where the one kung fu master says something along the lines of &#x27;hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,&#x27; then a fight erupts.&quot;

<doc id="16903" wikidata="Q31113" url="?curid=16903" title="Kuomintang">
<text>The Kuomintang (KMT), also referred to as the Guomindang (GMD), the Nationalist Party of China (NPC), the Chinese Nationalist Party (CNP), or the National People&#x27;s Party of China (NPPC), is a major political party in the Republic of China, initially based on the Chinese mainland and currently in the Free area of the Republic of China (including Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and etc) since 1949. The KMT is a centre-right to right-wing party and the largest in the Pan-Blue Coalition, one of the two main political groups in Taiwan. Its primary rival is the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the largest party in the Pan-Green Coalition. As of 2024, the KMT is the largest single party in the Legislative Yuan. The current chairman is Eric Chu.

The party originated as the Revive China Society founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1894 in Honolulu. It was reorganized after the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China (ROC) with Sun as the President of the Provisional Government. In 1919, Sun reformed the party under the name &quot;Kuomintang&quot; in the Shanghai French Concession. From 1926 to 1928, the KMT under Chiang Kai-shek successfully unified China in the Northern Expedition against regional warlords, leading to the fall of the Beiyang government. After initially allying with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the First United Front, the party under Chiang purged communist members. It was the sole ruling party of China from 1928 to 1949 but gradually lost control while fighting the Empire of Japan in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the CCP in the Chinese Civil War. In December 1949, the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan following its defeat by the communists. 

From 1949 to 1987, the KMT ruled Taiwan as an authoritarian one-party state after the February 28 incident. During this period, martial law was in effect and civil liberties were curtailed as part of its anti-communism efforts, with the period known as the White Terror. The party oversaw Taiwan&#x27;s economic development, but experienced diplomatic setbacks, including the ROC losing its United Nations seat and most countries, including its ally the US, switching diplomatic recognition to the CCP-led People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s son, lifted martial law and the ban on opposition parties. His successor Lee Teng-hui continued democratic reforms and was re-elected in 1996 through a direct presidential election, the first time in the ROC history. The 2000 presidential election ended 72 years of KMT presidencies. The party later reclaimed power with the landslide victory of Ma Ying-jeou in the 2008 presidential election, whose presidency significantly loosened restrictions on economic and cultural exchanges with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The KMT then lost the presidency and its legislative majority in the 2016 election, but regained a legislative plurality in the 2024 election.

The KMT is a member of the International Democracy Union. The party&#x27;s guiding ideology is the Three Principles of the People, advocated by Sun Yat-sen and organized on a basis of democratic centralism. As the KMT strongly supports the ROC as the only representative of China, it strongly opposes both Chinese unification under the PRC and formal Taiwan independence. As the KMT opposes non-peaceful means to resolve the cross-strait disputes while still strongly adhering to the ROC constitution, the party favors a closer relationship with the PRC and accepts the 1992 Consensus, which defines both sides of the Taiwan Strait as &quot;one China&quot; but maintains its ambiguity to different interpretations. It seeks to maintain Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;status quo&quot; rather than formal independence or the unification.

== History ==
=== Founding and Sun Yat-sen era ===
The KMT traces its ideological and organizational roots to the work of Sun Yat-sen, a proponent of Chinese nationalism and democracy who founded the Revive China Society at the capital of the Republic of Hawaii, Honolulu, on 24 November 1894. On 20 August 1905, Sun joined forces with other anti-monarchist societies in Tokyo, Empire of Japan, to form the Tongmenghui, a group committed to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and to establish a republic in China.
The group supported the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and the founding of the Republic of China on 1 January 1912. Although Sun and the Tongmenghui are often depicted as the principal organizers of the Xinhai Revolution, this view is disputed by scholars who argue that the Revolution broke out in a leaderless and decentralized way and that Sun was only later elected provisional president of the new Chinese republic. However, Sun did not have military power and ceded the provisional presidency of the republic to Yuan Shikai, who arranged for the abdication of Puyi, the last Emperor, on 12 February.

On 25 August 1912, the Nationalist Party was established at the Huguang Guild Hall in Beijing, where the Tongmenghui and five smaller pro-revolution parties merged to contest the first national elections. Sun was chosen as the party chairman with Huang Xing as his deputy.

The most influential member of the party was the third ranking Song Jiaoren, who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the Nationalists to advocate a constitutional parliamentary democracy. The party opposed constitutional monarchists and sought to check the power of Yuan. The Nationalists won an overwhelming majority in the first National Assembly election in December 1912.

However, Yuan soon began to ignore the parliament in making presidential decisions. Song Jiaoren was assassinated in Shanghai in 1913. Members of the Nationalists, led by Sun Yat-sen, suspected that Yuan was behind the plot and thus staged the Second Revolution in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan, claiming subversiveness and betrayal, expelled adherents of the KMT from the parliament. Yuan dissolved the Nationalists, whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan, in November and dismissed the parliament early in 1914.

Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915. While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party on 8 July 1914, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin and Chen Jiongming, refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan. To join the Revolutionary Party, members had to take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. As a result, he became largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period.

Sun returned to China in 1917 to establish a military junta at Canton to oppose the Beiyang government but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, under the name Kuomintang of China () and established its headquarters in Canton in 1920.

In 1923, the KMT and its Canton government accepted aid from the Soviet Union after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers—the most prominent of whom was Mikhail Borodin, an agent of the Comintern—arrived in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), establishing a Leninist party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the First United Front between the two parties. Mao Zedong and early members of the CCP also joined the KMT in 1923.
Soviet advisers also helped the KMT to set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 Chiang Kai-shek, one of Sun&#x27;s lieutenants from the Tongmenghui days, was sent to Moscow for several months&#x27; military and political study. At the first party congress in 1924 in Guangzhou, Guangdong, which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CCP, they adopted Sun&#x27;s political theory, which included the Three Principles of the People: nationalism, democracy and people&#x27;s livelihood.
=== Under Chiang Kai-shek in Mainland China ===
When Sun Yat-sen died in 1925, the political leadership of the KMT fell to Wang Jingwei (&quot;Reorganization Group&quot;) and Hu Hanmin (&quot;Western Hills Group&quot;), respectively the left-wing and right-wing leaders of the party. However, the real power was in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who was in near complete control of the military as the superintendent of the Whampoa Military Academy. With their military superiority, the KMT confirmed their rule on Canton, the provincial capital of Guangdong. The Guangxi warlords pledged loyalty to the KMT. The KMT now became a rival government in opposition to the warlord Beiyang government based in Beijing.

Chiang assumed leadership of the KMT on 6 July 1926. Unlike Sun Yat-sen, whom he admired greatly and who forged all his political, economic, and revolutionary ideas primarily from what he had learned in Hawaii and indirectly through Hong Kong and Japan under the Meiji Restoration, Chiang knew relatively little about the West. He also studied in Japan, but he was firmly rooted in his ancient Han Chinese identity and was steeped in Chinese culture. As his life progressed, he became increasingly attached to ancient Chinese culture and traditions. His few trips to the West confirmed his pro-ancient Chinese outlook and he studied the ancient Chinese classics and ancient Chinese history assiduously. In 1923, after the formation of the First United Front, Sun Yat-sen sent Chiang to spend three months in Moscow studying the political and military system of the Soviet Union. Although Chiang did not follow the Soviet Communist doctrine, he, like the Communist Party, sought to destroy warlordism and foreign imperialism in China, and upon his return established the Whampoa Military Academy near Guangzhou, following the Soviet Model.

Chiang was also particularly committed to Sun&#x27;s idea of &quot;political tutelage&quot;. Sun believed that the only hope for a unified and better China lay in a military conquest, followed by a period of political tutelage that would culminate in the transition to democracy. Using this ideology, Chiang built himself into the dictator of the Republic of China, both in the Chinese mainland and after the national government relocated to Taiwan.

Following the death of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek emerged as the KMT leader and launched the Northern Expedition to defeat the northern warlords and unite China under the party. With its power confirmed in the southeast, the Nationalist Government appointed Chiang Kai-shek commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), and the Northern Expedition to suppress the warlords began. Chiang had to defeat three separate warlords and two independent armies. Chiang, with Soviet supplies, conquered the southern half of China in nine months.

A split erupted between the Chinese Communist Party and the KMT, which threatened the Northern Expedition. Wang Jing Wei, who led the KMT leftist allies, took the city of Wuhan in January 1927. With the support of the Soviet agent Mikhail Borodin, Wang declared the National Government as having moved to Wuhan. Having taken Nanjing in March, Chiang halted his campaign and prepared a violent break with Wang and his communist allies. Chiang&#x27;s expulsion of the CCP and their Soviet advisers, marked by the Shanghai massacre on 12 April, led to the beginning of the Chinese Civil War. Wang finally surrendered his power to Chiang. Once this split had been healed, Chiang resumed his Northern Expedition and managed to take Shanghai.
During the Nanjing incident in March 1927, the NRA stormed the consulates of the United States, the United Kingdom and Imperial Japan, looted foreign properties and almost assassinated the Japanese consul. An American, two British, one French, an Italian and a Japanese were killed. These looters also stormed and seized millions of dollars&#x27; worth of British concessions in Hankou, refusing to hand them back to the UK government. Both Nationalists and Communist soldiers within the army participated in the rioting and looting of foreign residents in Nanjing.

NRA took Beijing in 1928. The city was the internationally recognized capital, even when it was previously controlled by warlords. This event allowed the KMT to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Beijing to Nanjing, the original capital of the Ming dynasty, and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 was relatively stable and prosperous and is still known as the Nanjing decade.

After the Northern Expedition in 1928, the Nationalist government under the KMT declared that China had been exploited for decades under the unequal treaties signed between the foreign powers and the Qing dynasty. The KMT government demanded that the foreign powers renegotiate the treaties on equal terms.

Before the Northern Expedition, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial autonomy. However, the KMT under Chiang&#x27;s leadership aimed at establishing a centralized one-party state with one ideology. This was even more evident following Sun&#x27;s elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of &quot;political tutelage&quot;, whereby the party was to lead the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. The topic of reorganizing the army, brought up at a military conference in 1929, sparked the Central Plains War. The cliques, some of them former warlords, demanded to retain their army and political power within their own territories. Although Chiang finally won the war, the conflicts among the cliques would have a devastating effect on the survival of the KMT. Muslim Generals in Gansu waged war against the Guominjun in favor of the KMT during the conflict in Gansu in 1927–1930.
In 1931, Japanese aggression resumed with the Mukden Incident and occupation of Manchuria, and the CCP founded the Chinese Soviet Republic (CSR) in Jiangxi while secretly recruiting within the KMT government and military. Chiang was alarmed by the expansion of communist influence; he wanted to suppress internal conflicts before confronting foreign aggression. The KMT were aided by German military advisors. The CSR was destroyed in 1934 after a series of KMT offensives. The communists abandoned bases in southeast China for Shaanxi in a military retreat called the Long March; less than 10% of the communist army survived. A new base, the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, was created with Soviet aid.

KMT secret police persecuted suspected communists and political opponents with terror. In &quot;The Birth of Communist China&quot;, C.P. Fitzgerald describes China under the rule of the KMT thus: &quot;the Chinese people groaned under a regime Fascist in every quality except efficiency.&quot;

In 1936, Chiang was kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang in the Xi&#x27;an Incident and forced into the Second United Front, an anti-Japanese alliance with the CCP; the Second Sino-Japanese War started the following year. The alliance brought little coordination and was treated as a temporary cease fire in the civil war. The New Fourth Army Incident in 1941 ended the alliance.
Japan surrendered in 1945, and Taiwan was returned to the Republic of China on 25 October of that year. The brief period of celebration was soon shadowed by the possibility of a civil war between the KMT and CCP. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan just before it surrendered and occupied Manchuria, the north eastern part of China. The Soviet Union denied the KMT army the right to enter the region but allowed the CCP to take control of the Japanese factories and their supplies.

Full-scale civil war between the Communists and the Nationalists erupted in 1946. The Communist Chinese armies, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT&#x27;s part. First, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the PLA. Second, the KMT government proved thoroughly unable to manage the economy, allowing hyperinflation to result. Among the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the Chinese gold yuan in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Scrip in exchange. As most farmland in the north were under CCP&#x27;s control, the cities governed by the KMT lacked food supply and this added to the hyperinflation. The new scrip became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of the KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave CCP a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States (US). However, with the country suffering from hyperinflation, widespread corruption and other economic ills, the KMT continued to lose popular support. Some leading officials and military leaders of the KMT hoarded material, armament and military-aid funding provided by the US. This became an issue which proved to be a hindrance of its relationship with US government. US President Harry S. Truman wrote that &quot;the Chiangs, the Kungs and the Soongs (were) all thieves&quot;, having taken $750 million in US aid.
At the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the PLA cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the CCP side, and the overwhelming popular support for the CCP in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists.

By the end of 1949, the CCP controlled almost all of mainland China, as the KMT retreated to Taiwan with a significant amount of China&#x27;s national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (also known as the Left Kuomintang), which still currently exists as one of the eight minor registered parties of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

=== In Taiwan: 1945–present ===


In 1895, Formosa (now called Taiwan), including the Penghu islands, became a Japanese colony via the Treaty of Shimonoseki following the First Sino-Japanese War.

After Japan&#x27;s defeat at the end of World War II in 1945, General Order No. 1 instructed Japan to surrender its troops in Taiwan to Chiang Kai-shek. On 25 October 1945, KMT general Chen Yi acted on behalf of the Allied Powers to accept Japan&#x27;s surrender and proclaimed that day as Taiwan Retrocession Day.

Tensions between the local Taiwanese and mainlanders from mainland China increased in the intervening years, culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in Taipei when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer in front of Tianma Tea House triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days. The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the ROC Army in the February 28 Incident. As a result of the 28 February Incident in 1947, Taiwanese people endured what is called the &quot;White Terror&quot;, a KMT-led political repression that resulted in the death or disappearance of over 30,000 Taiwanese intellectuals, activists, and people suspected of opposition to the KMT.

Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949, the commanders of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) believed that Kinmen and Matsu had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. The KMT fought the Battle of Guningtou on 25–27 October 1949 and stopped the PLA invasion. The KMT headquarters were set up on 10 December 1949 at No. 11 Zhongshan South Road. In 1950, Chiang took office in Taipei under the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion. The provision declared martial law in Taiwan and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the CCP. The KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists. The slogan was &quot;prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year.&quot; Chiang also initiated the Project National Glory to retake back the mainland in 1965, but was eventually dropped in July 1972 after many unsuccessful attempts.

However, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the CCP full-scale. The KMT backed Muslim insurgents formerly belonging to the National Revolutionary Army during the KMT Islamic insurgency in 1950–1958 in mainland China. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in Nanjing, that were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government, actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The Republic of China in Taiwan retained China&#x27;s seat in the United Nations until 1971 as well as recognition by the United States until 1979.

Until the 1970s, the KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved relations between Taiwan and the mainland and created the Taiwan economic miracle. However, the KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as Nationalist China after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for &quot;supplemental elections&quot; in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in the National Assembly.

Although opposition parties were not permitted, the pro-democracy movement &quot;Tangwai&quot; (&quot;outside the KMT&quot;) created the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on 28 September 1986. Outside observers of Taiwanese politics expected the KMT to clamp down and crush the illegal opposition party, though this did not occur, and instead the party&#x27;s formation marked the beginning of Taiwan&#x27;s democratization.

Martial law ceased in 1987 and the President Lee Teng-hui terminated the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion in 1991. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. Lee Teng-hui, the ROC&#x27;s first democratically elected president and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of &quot;special state-to-state relations&quot; with the PRC. The PRC associated this idea with Taiwan independence.

The KMT faced a split in 1993 that led to the formation of the New Party in August 1993, alleged to be a result of Lee&#x27;s &quot;corruptive ruling style&quot;. The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into the KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the 2000 presidential election. Upset at the choice of Lien Chan as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General James Soong launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the People First Party (PFP) on 31 March 2000. The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee&#x27;s strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. To prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee&#x27;s pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward Chinese unification. This shift led to Lee&#x27;s expulsion from the party and the formation of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) by Lee supporters on 24 July 2001.
Prior to this, the party&#x27;s voters had defected to both the PFP and TSU, and the KMT did poorly in the December 2001 legislative elections and lost its position as the largest party in the Legislative Yuan. However, the party did well in the 2002 local government mayoral and council election with Ma Ying-jeou, its candidate for Taipei mayor, winning reelection by a landslide and its candidate for Kaohsiung mayor narrowly losing but doing surprisingly well. Since 2002, the KMT and PFP have coordinated electoral strategies. In 2004, the KMT and PFP ran a joint presidential ticket, with Lien running for president and Soong running for vice-president.

The loss of the presidential election of 2004 to DPP President Chen Shui-bian by merely over 30,000 votes was a bitter disappointment to party members, leading to large scale rallies for several weeks protesting alleged electoral fraud and the &quot;odd circumstances&quot; of the shooting of President Chen. However, the fortunes of the party were greatly improved when the KMT did well in the legislative elections held in December 2004 by maintaining its support in southern Taiwan achieving a majority for the Pan-Blue Coalition.

Soon after the election, there appeared to be a falling out with the KMT&#x27;s junior partner, the People First Party and talk of a merger seemed to have ended. This split appeared to widen in early 2005, as the leader of the PFP, James Soong appeared to be reconciling with President Chen Shui-Bian and the Democratic Progressive Party. Many PFP members including legislators and municipal leaders have since defected to the KMT, and the PFP is seen as a fading party.

In 2005, Ma Ying-jeou became KMT chairman defeating speaker Wang Jin-pyng in the first public election for KMT chairmanship. The KMT won a decisive victory in the 3-in-1 local elections of December 2005, replacing the DPP as the largest party at the local level. This was seen as a major victory for the party ahead of legislative elections in 2007. There were elections for the two municipalities of the ROC, Taipei and Kaohsiung in December 2006. The KMT won a clear victory in Taipei, but lost to the DPP in the southern city of Kaohsiung by the slim margin of 1,100 votes.

On 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11 million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of &quot;special expenses&quot; while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as KMT chairman at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for ROC president. Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties. In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors. In 2008, the KMT won a landslide victory in the Republic of China presidential election on 22 March 2008. The KMT fielded former Taipei mayor and former KMT chairman Ma Ying-jeou to run against the DPP&#x27;s Frank Hsieh. Ma won by a margin of 17% against Hsieh. Ma took office on 20 May 2008, with vice-presidential candidate Vincent Siew, and ended 8 years of the DPP presidency. The KMT also won a landslide victory in the 2008 legislative elections, winning 81 of 113 seats, or 71.7% of seats in the Legislative Yuan. These two elections gave the KMT firm control of both the executive and legislative yuans.

On 25 June 2009, President Ma launched his bid to regain the KMT leadership and registered as the sole candidate for the chairmanship election. On 26 July, Ma won 93.9% of the vote, becoming the new chairman of the KMT, taking office on 17 October 2009. This officially allowed Ma to be able to meet with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, and other PRC delegates, as he was able to represent the KMT as leader of a Chinese political party rather than as head-of-state of a political entity unrecognized by the PRC.

On 29 November 2014, the KMT suffered a heavy loss in the local election to the DPP, winning only 6 municipalities and counties, down from 14 in the previous election in 2009 and 2010. Ma Ying-jeou subsequently resigned from the party chairmanship on 3 December and replaced by acting Chairman Wu Den-yih. Chairmanship election was held on 17 January 2015 and Eric Chu was elected to become the new chairman. He was inaugurated on 19 February. In September 2021, Kuomintang elected its former leader (in office 2015–2016), veteran politician Eric Chu, as its new leader to replace Johnny Chiang (in office 2020–2021). In January 2024, no party won a majority in Taiwan&#x27;s legislative election for the first time since 2004, meaning 51 seats for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), 52 seats for the Kuomintang (KMT), and the Taiwan People&#x27;s Party (TPP) secured eight seats.

=== Current issues and challenges ===
==== Party assets ====
Upon arriving in Taiwan the KMT occupied assets previously owned by the Japanese and forced local businesses to make contributions directly to the KMT. Some of this real estate and other assets was distributed to party loyalists, but most of it remained with the party, as did the profits generated by the properties.

As the ruling party on Taiwan, the KMT amassed a vast business empire of banks, investment companies, petrochemical firms, and television and radio stations, thought to have made it the world&#x27;s richest political party, with assets once estimated to be around US$2–10 billion. Although this war chest appeared to help the KMT until the mid-1990s, it later led to accusations of corruption (often referred to as &quot;black gold&quot;).

After 2000, the KMT&#x27;s financial holdings appeared to be more of a liability than a benefit, and the KMT started to divest itself of its assets. However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the 2004 presidential election that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. During the 2000–2008 DPP presidency, a law was proposed by the DPP in the Legislative Yuan to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government. However, due to the DPP&#x27;s lack of control of the legislative chamber at the time, it never materialized.

The KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to &quot;retro-endow&quot; them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate. DPP, in its capacity as ruling party from 2000 to 2008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT chairman Ma Ying-Jeou&#x27;s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.
In 2006, the KMT sold its headquarters at 11 Zhongshan South Road in Taipei to Evergreen Group for NT$2.3 billion (US$96 million). The KMT moved into a smaller building on Bade Road in the eastern part of the city.

In July 2014, the KMT reported total assets of NT$26.8 billion (US$892.4 million) and interest earnings of NT$981.52 million for the year of 2013, making it one of the richest political parties in the world.

In August 2016, the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee was set up by the ruling DPP government to investigate KMT party assets acquired during the martial law period and recover those that were determined to be illegally acquired.

== Supporter base ==
Support for the KMT in Taiwan encompasses a wide range of social groups but is largely determined by age. KMT support tends to be higher in northern Taiwan and in urban areas, where it draws its backing from big businesses due to its policy of maintaining commercial links with mainland China. As of 2020 only 3% of KMT members are under 40 years of age.

The KMT also has some support in the labor sector because of the many labor benefits and insurance implemented while the KMT was in power. The KMT traditionally has strong cooperation with military officers, teachers, and government workers. Among the ethnic groups in Taiwan, the KMT has stronger support among mainlanders and their descendants, for ideological reasons, and among Taiwanese aboriginals. The support for the KMT generally tend to be stronger in majority-Hakka and Mandarin-speaking counties of Taiwan, in contrast to the Hokkien-majority southwestern counties that tend to support the Democratic Progressive Party.

The deep-rooted hostility between Aboriginals and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities effective KMT networks, contribute to Aboriginal skepticism towards the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Aboriginals&#x27; tendency to vote for the KMT. Aboriginals have criticized politicians for abusing the &quot;indigenization&quot; movement for political gains, such as aboriginal opposition to the DPP&#x27;s &quot;rectification&quot; by recognizing the Taroko for political reasons, with the majority of mountain townships voting for Ma Ying-jeou. In 2005 the Kuomintang displayed a massive photo of the anti-Japanese Aboriginal leader Mona Rudao at its headquarters in honor of the 60th anniversary of Taiwan&#x27;s retrocession from Japan to the Republic of China.

On social issues, the KMT does not take an official position on same-sex marriage, though most members of legislative committees, mayors of cities, and the 2020 presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu oppose it. The party does, however, have a small faction that supports same-sex marriage, consisting mainly of young people and people in the Taipei metropolitan area. The opposition to same-sex marriage comes mostly from Christian groups, who wield significant political influence within the KMT.

== Organization ==


=== Leadership ===
The Kuomintang&#x27;s constitution designated Sun Yat-sen as party president. After his death, the Kuomintang opted to keep that language in its constitution to honor his memory forever. The party has since been headed by a director-general (1927–1975) and a chairman (since 1975), positions which officially discharge the functions of the president.

== Ideology in mainland China ==
=== Chinese nationalism ===

The KMT was a nationalist revolutionary party that had been supported by the Soviet Union. It was organized on the Leninist principle of democratic centralism.

The KMT had several influences upon its ideology by revolutionary thinking. The KMT and Chiang Kai-shek used the words feudal and counterrevolutionary as synonyms for evil and backwardness, and they proudly proclaimed themselves to be revolutionaries. Chiang called the warlords feudalists, and he also called for feudalism and counterrevolutionaries to be stamped out by the KMT. Chiang showed extreme rage when he was called a warlord, because of the word&#x27;s negative and feudal connotations. Ma Bufang was forced to defend himself against the accusations, and stated to the news media that his army was a part of &quot;National army, people&#x27;s power&quot;.

Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the KMT, warned the Soviet Union and other foreign countries about interfering in Chinese affairs. He was personally angry at the way China was treated by foreigners, mainly by the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. He and his New Life Movement called for the crushing of Soviet, Western, American and other foreign influences in China. Chen Lifu, a CC Clique member in the KMT, said &quot;Communism originated from Soviet imperialism, which has encroached on our country.&quot; It was also noted that &quot;the white bear of the North Pole is known for its viciousness and cruelty&quot;.

KMT leaders across China adopted nationalist rhetoric. The Chinese Muslim general Ma Bufang of Qinghai presented himself as a Chinese nationalist to the people of China who was fighting against Western imperialism to deflect criticism by opponents that his government was feudal and oppressed minorities like Tibetans and Buddhist Mongols. He used his Chinese nationalist credentials to his advantage to keep himself in power.

=== Fascist influences ===
The Blue Shirts Society, a ultranationalist paramilitary organization within the KMT that modeled itself after Mussolini&#x27;s blackshirts, was anti-foreign and anti-communist, and it stated that its agenda was to expel foreign (Japanese and Western) imperialists from China, crush Communism, and eliminate feudalism. In addition to being anticommunist, some KMT members, like Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s right-hand man Dai Li were anti-American, and wanted to expel American influence. Close Sino-German ties also promoted cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Nazi Party (NSDAP).

The New Life Movement was a government-led civic movement in 1930s China initiated by Chiang Kai-shek to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality and to ultimately unite China under a centralised ideology following the emergence of ideological challenges to the status quo. The Movement attempted to counter threats of Western and Japanese imperialism through a resurrection of traditional Chinese morality, which it held to be superior to modern Western values. As such the Movement was based upon Confucianism, mixed with Christianity, nationalism and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. It rejected individualism and liberalism, while also opposing socialism and communism. Some historians regard this movement as imitating Nazism and being a neo-nationalistic movement used to elevate Chiang&#x27;s control of everyday lives. Frederic Wakeman suggested that the New Life Movement was &quot;Confucian fascism&quot;.

According to Stanley Payne, Chiang&#x27;s KMT was &quot;normally classified as a multi-class populist or &#x27;nation-building&#x27; party but not a fitting candidate for fascism (except by old-line Communists).&quot; He also stated that, &quot;Lloyd Eastman has called the Blue Shirts, whose members admired European fascism and were influenced by it, a Chinese fascist organization. This is probably an exaggeration. The Blue Shirts certainly exhibited some of the characteristics of fascism, as did many nationalist organizations around the world, but it is not clear that the group possessed the full qualities of an intrinsic fascist movement...The Blue Shirts probably had some affinity with and for fascism, a common feature of nationalisms in crisis during the 1930s, but it is doubtful that they represented any clear-cut Asian variant of fascism.&quot; The Sino-German relationship also rapidly deteriorated as Germany failed to pursue a détente between China and Japan, which led to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. China later declared war on fascist countries, including Germany, Italy, and Japan, as part of the Declarations of war during World War II and Chiang, the head of the KMT, became the most powerful &quot;anti-fascist&quot; leader in Asia.

=== Ideology of the New Guangxi Clique ===
The KMT branch in Guangxi province, led by the New Guangxi Clique of Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren, implemented anti-imperialist, anti-religious, and anti-foreign policies. During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Muslim General Bai Chongxi led his troops in destroying most of the Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and KMT headquarters. Bai led an anti-foreign wave in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for non-natives. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents.

The leaders clashed with Chiang Kai-shek, which led to the Central Plains War where Chiang defeated the clique.

=== Socialism and anti-capitalist agitation ===

The KMT had a left wing and a right wing, the left being more radical in its pro-Soviet policies, but both wings equally persecuted merchants, accusing them of being counterrevolutionaries and reactionaries. The right wing under Chiang Kai-shek prevailed, and continued radical policies against private merchants and industrialists, even as they denounced communism.

One of the Three Principles of the People of the KMT, Mínshēng, was defined as socialism by Sun Yat-sen. He defined this principle of saying in his last days &quot;its socialism and its communism&quot;. The concept may be understood as social welfare as well. Sun understood it as an industrial economy and equality of land holdings for the Chinese peasant farmers. Here he was influenced by the American thinker Henry George, (see Georgism) the land value tax in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. He divided livelihood into four areas: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people.

The KMT was referred to having a socialist ideology. &quot;Equalization of land rights&quot; was a clause included by Sun in the original Tongmenhui. The KMT&#x27;s revolutionary ideology in the 1920s incorporated unique Chinese Socialism as part of its ideology.

The Soviet Union trained KMT revolutionaries in the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. In the West and in the Soviet Union, Chiang was known as the &quot;Red General&quot;. Movie theaters in the Soviet Union showed newsreels and clips of Chiang, at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University Portraits of Chiang were hung on the walls, and in the Soviet May Day Parades that year, Chiang&#x27;s portrait was to be carried along with the portraits of Karl Marx, Lenin, Stalin, and other socialist leaders.

The KMT attempted to levy taxes upon merchants in Canton, and the merchants resisted by raising an army, the Merchant&#x27;s volunteer corps. Sun initiated this anti-merchant policy, and Chiang Kai-shek enforced it, Chiang led his army of Whampoa Military Academy graduates to defeat the merchant&#x27;s army. Chiang was assisted by Soviet advisors, who supplied him with weapons, while the merchants were supplied with weapons from the Western countries.

The KMT was accused of leading a &quot;Red Revolution&quot; in Canton. The merchants were conservative and reactionary, and their Volunteer Corp leader Chen Lianbao was a prominent comprador trader.

The merchants were supported by the Western powers, who led an international flotilla to support them against the KMT. The KMT seized many of Western-supplied weapons from the merchants, using them to equip their troops. A KMT General executed several merchants, and the KMT formed a Soviet-inspired Revolutionary Committee. The British Communist Party sent a letter to Sun, congratulating him on his military successes.

In 1948, the KMT again attacked the merchants of Shanghai. Chiang Kai-shek sent his son Chiang Ching-kuo to restore economic order. Ching-kuo copied Soviet methods, which he learned during his stay there, to start a social revolution by attacking middle-class merchants. He also enforced low prices on all goods to raise support from the proletariat.

As riots broke out and savings were ruined, bankrupting shop owners, Ching-kuo began to attack the wealthy, seizing assets and placing them under arrest. The son of the gangster Du Yuesheng was arrested by him. Ching-kuo ordered KMT agents to raid the Yangtze Development Corporation&#x27;s warehouses, which was privately owned by H.H. Kung and his family. H.H. Kung&#x27;s wife was Soong Ai-ling, the sister of Soong Mei-ling who was Ching-kuo&#x27;s stepmother. H.H. Kung&#x27;s son David was arrested, the Kung&#x27;s responded by blackmailing the Chiang&#x27;s, threatening to release information about them, eventually he was freed after negotiations, and Ching-kuo resigned, ending the terror on the Shanghainese merchants.

The KMT also promotes government-owned corporations. KMT founder Sun Yat-sen, was heavily influenced by the economic ideas of Henry George, who believed that the rents extracted from natural monopolies or the usage of land belonged to the public. Sun argued for Georgism and emphasized the importance of a mixed economy, which he termed &quot;The Principle of Minsheng&quot; in his Three Principles of the People.

&quot;The railroads, public utilities, canals, and forests should be nationalized, and all income from the land and mines should be in the hands of the State. With this money in hand, the State can therefore finance the social welfare programs.&quot;

The KMT Muslim Governor of Ningxia, Ma Hongkui, promoted state-owned monopolies. His government had a company, Fu Ning Company, which had a monopoly over commerce and industry in Ningxia.

Corporations such as CSBC Corporation, Taiwan, CPC Corporation and Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation are owned by the state in the Republic of China.

Marxists also existed in the KMT. They viewed the Chinese revolution in different terms than the CCP, claiming that China already went past its feudal stage and was in a stagnation period rather than in another mode of production. These Marxists in the KMT opposed the CCP ideology. The Left Kuomintang who disagreed with Chiang Kai-shek formed the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang when the KMT was on the edge of defeat in the civil war and later joined the government of the CCP.

=== Confucianism and religion in its ideology ===

The KMT used traditional Chinese religious ceremonies. According to the KMT, the souls of party martyrs were sent to heaven. Chiang Kai-shek believed that these martyrs still witnessed events on Earth.

The KMT backed the New Life Movement, which promoted Confucianism, and it was also against westernization. KMT leaders also opposed the May Fourth Movement. Chiang Kai-shek, as a nationalist, and Confucianist, was against the iconoclasm of the May Fourth Movement. He viewed some western ideas as foreign, as a Chinese nationalist, and that the introduction of western ideas and literature that the May Fourth Movement wanted was not welcome. He and Sun Yat-sen criticized these May Fourth intellectuals for corrupting morals of youth.

The KMT also incorporated Confucianism in its jurisprudence. It pardoned Shi Jianqiao for murdering Sun Chuanfang, because she did it in revenge since Sun executed her father Shi Congbin, which was an example of filial piety to one&#x27;s parents in Confucianism. The KMT encouraged filial revenge killings and extended pardons to those who performed them.

In response to the Cultural Revolution, Chiang Kai-shek promoted a Chinese Cultural Renaissance movement which followed in the steps of the New Life Movement, promoting Confucian values.

==== Education ====
The KMT purged China&#x27;s education system of Western ideas, introducing Confucianism into the curriculum. Education came under the total control of the state, which meant, in effect, the KMT, via the Ministry of Education. Military and political classes on KMT&#x27;s &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; were added. Textbooks, exams, degrees and educational instructors were all controlled by the state, as were all universities.

=== Soviet-style military ===
Chiang Ching-kuo, appointed as KMT director of Secret Police in 1950, was educated in the Soviet Union, and initiated Soviet style military organization in the Republic of China Armed Forces, reorganizing and Sovietizing the political officer corps, surveillance, and KMT activities were propagated throughout the whole of the armed forces. Opposed to this was Sun Li-jen, who was educated at the American Virginia Military Institute. Chiang Ching-kuo then arrested Sun Li-jen, charging him of conspiring with the American CIA of plotting to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT, Sun was placed under house arrest in 1955.

=== Anti-communism ===

Before the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Kuomintang, also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, led by Chiang Kai-shek, was ruling China and strongly opposed the Chinese Communist Party as it was funded and militarily backed by the COMINTERN (Soviet Union) and pursuing a communist revolution to overthrow the Republic of China . On 12 April 1927, Chiang Kai-shek purged the communists in what was known as the Shanghai massacre which led to the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Nationalist government then led 5 military campaigns in order to wipe out Chinese Soviet Republic, a Soviet-puppet state established by the Chinese Communist Party. Initially, the Kuomintang was successful, eventually forcing the Chinese Communist Party to escape on a long march until a full-scale invasion of China by Japan forced both the Nationalists and the Communists into an alliance. After the war, the two parties were thrown back into a civil war. The Kuomintang were defeated in the mainland and escaped in exile to Taiwan while the rest of mainland China became Communist in 1949.

=== Policy on ethnic minorities ===

Former KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek considered all the minority peoples of China as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the semi-mythical initiator of the Chinese civilization. Chiang considered all ethnic minorities in China to belong to the &quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; (Chinese nation) and he introduced this into KMT ideology, which was propagated into the educational system of the Republic of China, and the Constitution of the ROC considered Chiang&#x27;s ideology to be true. In Taiwan, the president performs a ritual honoring the Yellow Emperor, while facing west, in the direction of the Chinese mainland.

The KMT retained the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for dealing with Mongolian and Tibetan affairs. A Muslim, Ma Fuxiang, was appointed as its chairman.

The KMT was known for sponsoring Muslim students to study abroad at Muslim universities like Al-Azhar University and it established schools especially for Muslims, Muslim KMT warlords like Ma Fuxiang promoted education for Muslims. KMT Muslim Warlord Ma Bufang built a girls&#x27; school for Muslim girls in Linxia City which taught modern secular education.

Tibetans and Mongols refused to allow other ethnic groups like Kazakhs to participate in the Kokonur ceremony in Qinghai, but KMT Muslim General Ma Bufang allowed them to participate.

Chinese Muslims were among the most hardline KMT members. Ma Chengxiang was a Muslim KMT member, and he refused to surrender to the Communists.

The KMT incited anti-Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang sentiments among Hui people and Mongols, encouraging for them to topple their rule during the Central Plains War.

Masud Sabri, a Uyghur was appointed as Governor of Xinjiang by the KMT, as was the Tatar Burhan Shahidi and the Uyghur Yulbars Khan.

The Muslim General Ma Bufang also put KMT symbols on his mansion, the Ma Bufang Mansion along with a portrait of party founder Sun Yatsen arranged with the KMT flag and the Republic of China flag.

General Ma Bufang and other high ranking Muslim Generals attended the Kokonuur Lake Ceremony where the God of the Lake was worshipped, and during the ritual, the Chinese national anthem was sung, all participants bowed to a Portrait of KMT founder Sun Yat-sen, and the God of the Lake was also bowed to, and offerings were given to him by the participants, which included the Muslims. This cult of personality around the KMT leader and the KMT was standard in all meetings. Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s portrait was bowed to three times by KMT party members. Sun&#x27;s portrait was arranged with two flags crossed under, the KMT flag and the flag of the Republic of China.

The KMT also hosted conferences of important Muslims like Bai Chongxi, Ma Fuxiang, and Ma Liang. Ma Bufang stressed &quot;racial harmony&quot; as a goal when he was Governor of Qinghai.

In 1939, Isa Yusuf Alptekin and Ma Fuliang were sent on a mission by the KMT to the Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt, Turkey and Syria to gain support for the Chinese War against Japan, they also visited Afghanistan in 1940 and contacted Muhammad Amin Bughra, they asked him to come to Chongqing, the capital of the Nationalist Government. Bughra was arrested by the British government in 1942 for spying, and the KMT arranged for Bughra&#x27;s release. He and Isa Yusuf worked as editors of KMT Muslim publications. Ma Tianying () (1900–1982) led the 1939 mission which had 5 other people including Isa and Fuliang.

=== Anti-separatism ===

The KMT, being anti-separatist, claims sovereignty over Outer Mongolia and Tuva as well as the territories of the modern People&#x27;s Republic and Republic of China.

KMT Muslim General Ma Bufang waged war on the invading Tibetans during the Sino-Tibetan War with his Muslim army, and he repeatedly crushed Tibetan revolts during bloody battles in Qinghai provinces. Ma Bufang was fully supported by President Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered him to prepare his Muslim army to invade Tibet several times and threatened aerial bombardment on the Tibetans. With support from the KMT, Ma Bufang repeatedly attacked the Tibetan area of Golog seven times during the KMT Pacification of Qinghai, eliminating thousands of Tibetans.

General Ma Fuxiang, the chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission stated that Mongolia and Tibet were an integral part of the Republic of China, arguing:
Our Party [the Guomindang] takes the development of the weak and small and resistance to the strong and violent as our sole and most urgent task. This is even more true for those groups which are not of our kind [Ch. fei wo zulei zhe]. Now the people of Mongolia and Tibet are closely related to us, and we have great affection for one another: our common existence and common honor already have a history of over a thousand years. [...] Mongolia and Tibet&#x27;s life and death are China&#x27;s life and death. China absolutely cannot cause Mongolia and Tibet to break away from China&#x27;s territory, and Mongolia and Tibet cannot reject China to become independent. At this time, there is not a single nation on earth except China that will sincerely develop Mongolia and Tibet.

Ma Bufang also crushed Mongol separatist movements, abducting the Genghis Khan Shrine and attacking Tibetan Buddhist Temples like Labrang, and keeping a tight control over them through the Kokonur God ceremony.

== Ideology in Taiwan ==
=== Anti-communism ===

On 28 February 1947, the Kuomintang cracked down on an anti-government uprising in Taiwan known as the February 28 incident and the government began the White Terror in Taiwan in order to purge communist spies and prevent Chinese communist subversion. While in Taiwan, the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang remained anti-communist and attempted to recover the mainland from the Communist forces. During the Cold War, Taiwan was referred to as Free China while the China on the mainland was known as Red China or Communist China in the West, to mark the ideological difference between the capitalist &#x27;Free World&#x27; and the communist nations. The ROC government under the Kuomintang also actively supported anti-communist efforts in Southeast Asia and around the world. This effort did not cease until the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975. The Kuomintang continued to be anti-communist during the period of Chiang Chin-kuo. Contacts between Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party have started since 1990s to re-establish Cross-Strait relations. Although relations has improved with the PRC since the 1992 Consensus, with both sides having a common opposition to Taiwanese nationalism, it continues to be opposed to communism, as anti-communism is written under Article 2 of Kuomintang&#x27;s party charter.

=== Three Principles of the People ===

Sun Yat-sen was not just the founder of the Republic of China, but also the founder of the Kuomintang. Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s political ideology was based on building a free and democratic China founded on Three Principles of the People, namely Democracy (civil rights of people), people&#x27;s economic livelihood and nationalism. Although the Kuomintang lost control over mainland China in 1949, the Republic of China under Kuomintang rule was able to achieve the political ideal of a democratic Republic of China on the island of Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People after its retreat to Taiwan. The Three Principles of the People is not just written in the ROC Constitution, but also in Article 1, 5, 7, 9, 37, 42, 43 of Kuomintang&#x27;s party charter.

=== Chinese democracy ===
The Kuomintang advocates a free and democratic China under the Republic of China founded on Three Principles of the People. In fact, during the 1980s, Chiang Ching-kuo advocated Grand Alliance for China&#x27;s Reunification under the Three Principles of the People. Since then, a democracy promotion banner for Grand Alliance for China&#x27;s Reunification under the Three Principles of the People continues to exist in Kinmen today as a display to mainland China that the Republic of China&#x27;s unification principle should be based on Chinese democracy. Today, the Kuomintang continues to view the Republic of China as the free, democratic and legitimate China.

=== Cross-Strait relations ===
A Chinese nationalist party, the Kuomintang strongly adheres to the defense of the Republic of China and upholding the Constitution of the Republic of China. It is strongly opposed to formal Taiwanese independence and the party also holds that the ROC is the sole legitimate representative of all of China. It favors a closer relationship with the PRC and the CCP, though it also opposes Chinese unification under the &quot;One country, two systems&quot; framework of the PRC. It opposes any non-peaceful means to resolve the cross-strait disputes. The party also accepts the 1992 Consensus, which defines both sides of the Taiwan Strait as &quot;one China&quot; but maintains its ambiguity to different interpretations. Although the KMT&#x27;s long-term goal is to unify China under the ROC, the party advocates maintaining the status quo of Taiwan.

=== Chinese conservatism ===
In modern Taiwanese politics, the Kuomintang is seen as a centre-right to right-wing political party. The Kuomintang believes in the values associated with conservatism. The Kuomintang has a strong tradition of defending the established institutions of the Republic of China, such as defending Constitution of the Republic of China, defending the five branches of government (modeled on Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s political philosophy of Three Principles of the People), espousing the One-China policy as a vital component for the Republic of China (ROC)&#x27;s international security and economic development, as opposed to Taiwanization. The Kuomintang claims to have a strong tradition of fighting to defend, preserve and revive traditional Chinese culture and religious freedom as well as advocating for Confucian values, economic liberalism and anti-communism. The KMT still sees the Republic of China in Taiwan as presenting the true cultural China which has preserved Chinese culture, as compared to the People&#x27;s Republic of China which had experienced Chinese cultural destruction during the Cultural Revolution.

Some Kuomintang conservatives see traditional social or family values as being threatened by liberal values and oppose same-sex marriage. KMT conservatives are also typically against the abolishment of capital punishment, arguing the need to maintain deterrence against harsh crimes. Conservative KMT policies may also be characterized by a focus on maintaining the traditions and doctrine of Confucian thought, namely reinforcing the morals of paternalism and patriarchy in Taiwan&#x27;s society. In terms of education policy, KMT policies advocate increasing more Classical Chinese content in Chinese education and Chinese history content in order to reinforce Chinese cultural identity, as opposed to de-sinicization attempts by advocates of Taiwan independence who typically decrease Classical Chinese and Chinese history content in schools in order to achieve Taiwanization.

== Parties affiliated with the Kuomintang ==
=== Malaysian Chinese Association ===

The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was initially pro-ROC and mainly consisted of KMT members who joined as an alternative and were also in opposition to the Malayan Communist Party, supporting the KMT in China by funding them with the intention of reclaiming the Chinese mainland from the communists.

=== Tibet Improvement Party ===

The Tibet Improvement Party was founded by Pandatsang Rapga, a pro-ROC and pro-KMT Khampa revolutionary, who worked against the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s Tibetan Government in Lhasa. Rapga borrowed Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People doctrine and translated his political theories into the Tibetan language, hailing it as the best hope for Asian peoples against imperialism. Rapga stated that &quot;the Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man. But it was conceived especially for the Asians. It is for this reason that I translated it. At that time, a lot of new ideas were spreading in Tibet,&quot; during an interview in 1975 by Heather Stoddard. He wanted to destroy the feudal government in Lhasa, in addition to modernizing and secularizing Tibetan society. The ultimate goal of the party was the overthrow of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s regime, and the creation of a Tibetan Republic which would be an autonomous Republic within the ROC. Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT funded the party and their efforts to build an army to battle the Dalai Lama&#x27;s government. The KMT was extensively involved in the Kham region, recruiting the Khampa people to both oppose the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Tibetan government, fight the Communist Red Army, and crush the influence of local Chinese warlords who did not obey the central government.

=== Vietnamese Nationalist Party ===

The KMT assisted the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng party which translates literally into Chinese (; ) as the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. When it was established, it was based on the Chinese KMT and was pro-Chinese. The Chinese KMT helped the party, known as the VNQDD, set up headquarters in Canton and Yunnan, to aid their anti-imperialist struggle against the French occupiers of Indochina and against the Vietnamese Communist Party. It was the first revolutionary nationalist party to be established in Vietnam, before the communist party. The KMT assisted VNQDD with funds and military training.

The VNQDD was founded with KMT aid in 1925, they were against Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s Viet Nam Revolutionary Youth League. When the VNQDD fled to China after the failed uprising against the French, they settled in Yunnan and Canton, in two different branches. The VNQDD existed as a party in exile in China for 15 years, receiving help, militarily and financially, and organizationally from the Chinese KMT. The two VNQDD parties merged into a single organization, the Canton branch removed the word &quot;revolutionary&quot; from the party name. Lu Han, a KMT official in Nanjing, who was originally from Yunnan, was contacted by the VNQDD, and the KMT Central Executive Committee and Military made direct contact with VNQDD for the first time, the party was reestablished in Nanjing with KMT help.

The Chinese KMT used the VNQDD for its own interests in south China and Indo China. General Zhang Fakui (Chang Fa-kuei), who based himself in Guangxi, established the Việt Nam Cách mệnh Đồng minh Hội meaning &quot;Viet Nam Revolutionary League&quot; in 1942, which was assisted by the VNQDD to serve the KMT&#x27;s aims. The Chinese Yunnan provincial army, under the KMT, occupied northern Vietnam after the Japanese surrender in 1945, the VNQDD tagging alone, opposing Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s communist party. The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, created by KMT founder Sun and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyễn Hải Thần. General Zhang shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as his main goal was Chinese influence in Indo China. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces.

A KMT left-winger, General Chang Fa-kuei, worked with Nguyễn Hải Thần, a VNQDD member, against French Imperialists and Communists in Indo China. General Chang Fa-kuei planned to lead a Chinese army invasion of Tonkin in Indochina to free Vietnam from French control, and to get Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s support. The VNQDD opposed the government of Ngo Dinh Diem during the Vietnam War.

The party dissolved after the Fall of Saigon in 1977 and was later re-founded in 1991 as the People&#x27;s Action Party of Vietnam (Đảng Nhân dân Hành động Việt Nam).

=== Ryukyu Guomindang ===

The Ryukyu Guomindang (琉球国民党) was established on 30 November 1958. Tsugumasa Kiyuna headed its predecessor party, the Ryukyuan separatist Ryukyu Revolutionary Party (琉球革命党) which was backed by the Kuomintang in Taiwan.

=== Hong Kong Pro-ROC camp ===
The pro-ROC camp is a political alignment in Hong Kong. It pledges allegiance to the Republic of China. One of these members, the 123 Democratic Alliance, dissolved in 2000 due to the lack of financial support from the Taiwanese government after the 2000 presidential election.

== Sponsored organizations ==

Ma Fuxiang founded Islamic organizations sponsored by the KMT, including the China Islamic Association ().

KMT Muslim General Bai Chongxi was Chairman of the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Federation. The Muslim Chengda school and Yuehua publication were supported by the Nationalist Government, and they supported the KMT.

The Chinese Muslim Association was also sponsored by the KMT, and it evacuated from the mainland to Taiwan with the party. The Chinese Muslim Association owns the Taipei Grand Mosque which was built with funds from the KMT.

The Yihewani (Ikhwan al Muslimun a.k.a. Muslim brotherhood) was the predominant Muslim sect backed by the KMT. Other Muslim sects, like the Xidaotang were also supported by the KMT. The Chinese Muslim brotherhood became a Chinese nationalist organization and supported KMT rule. Brotherhood Imams like Hu Songshan ordered Muslims to pray for the Nationalist Government, salute KMT flags during prayer, and listen to nationalist sermons.

<text>Kabbalah or Qabalah ( ; ) is an esoteric method, discipline and school of thought in Jewish mysticism. It forms the foundation of mystical religious interpretations within Judaism. A traditional Kabbalist is called a Mekubbal ().

Jewish Kabbalists originally developed transmissions of the primary texts of Kabbalah within the realm of Jewish tradition and often use classical Jewish scriptures to explain and demonstrate its mystical teachings. Kabbalists hold these teachings to define the inner meaning of both the Hebrew Bible and traditional rabbinic literature and their formerly concealed transmitted dimension, as well as to explain the significance of Jewish religious observances.

Historically, Kabbalah emerged from earlier forms of Jewish mysticism, in 12th- to 13th-century al-Andalus (Spain) and in Hakhmei Provence, and was reinterpreted during the Jewish mystical renaissance in 16th-century Ottoman Palestine. The , the foundational text of Kabbalah, was authored in the late 13th century, likely by Moses de León. Isaac Luria (16th century) is considered the father of contemporary Kabbalah; Lurianic Kabbalah was popularised in the form of Hasidic Judaism from the 18th century onwards. During the 20th century, academic interest in Kabbalistic texts led primarily by the Jewish historian Gershom Scholem has inspired the development of historical research on Kabbalah in the field of Judaic studies.

Though minor works contribute to an understanding of the Kabbalah as an evolving tradition, the primary texts are the and . The early Hekhalot literature is acknowledged as ancestral to the sensibilities of this later flowering of the Kabbalah and more especially the is acknowledged as the antecedent from which all these books draw many of their formal inspirations. The &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; is a brief document of only few pages that was written many centuries before the high and late medieval works (sometime between 200-600CE), detailing an alphanumeric vision of cosmology—may be understood as a kind of prelude to the canon of Kabbalah.

== History of Jewish mysticism ==


The history of Jewish mysticism encompasses various forms of esoteric and spiritual practices aimed at understanding the divine and the hidden aspects of existence. This mystical tradition has evolved significantly over millennia, influencing and being influenced by different historical, cultural, and religious contexts. Among the most prominent forms of Jewish mysticism is Kabbalah, which emerged in the 12th century and has since become a central component of Jewish mystical thought. Other notable early forms include prophetic and apocalyptic mysticism, which are evident in biblical and post-biblical texts.

The roots of Jewish mysticism can be traced back to the biblical era, with prophetic figures such as Elijah and Ezekiel experiencing divine visions and encounters. This tradition continued into the apocalyptic period, where texts like 1 Enoch and the Book of Daniel introduced complex angelology and eschatological themes. The Heikhalot and Merkavah literature, dating from the 2nd century to the early medieval period, further developed these mystical themes, focusing on visionary ascents to the heavenly palaces and the divine chariot.

The medieval period saw the formalization of Kabbalah, particularly in Southern France and Spain. Foundational texts such as the &quot;Bahir&quot; and the &quot;Zohar&quot; were composed during this time, laying the groundwork for later developments. The Kabbalistic teachings of this era delved deeply into the nature of the divine, the structure of the universe, and the process of creation. Notable Kabbalists like Moses de León played crucial roles in disseminating these teachings, which were characterized by their profound symbolic and allegorical interpretations of the Torah.

In the early modern period, Lurianic Kabbalah, founded by Isaac Luria in the 16th century, introduced new metaphysical concepts such as &quot;Tzimtzum&quot; (divine contraction) and &quot;Tikkun&quot; (cosmic repair), which have had a lasting impact on Jewish thought. The 18th century saw the rise of Hasidism, a movement that integrated Kabbalistic ideas into a popular, revivalist context, emphasizing personal mystical experience and the presence of the divine in everyday life. Today, the academic study of Jewish mysticism, pioneered by scholars like Gershom Scholem, continues to explore its historical, textual, and philosophical dimensions.

== Traditions ==

According to the , a foundational text for kabbalistic thought, Torah study can proceed along four levels of interpretation (exegesis). These four levels are called from their initial letters (PRDS , &#x27;orchard&#x27;):

* ( ): the direct interpretations of meaning.
* ( ): the allegoric meanings (through allusion).
* ( from the Hebrew : &#x27;inquire&#x27; or &#x27;seek&#x27;): midrashic (rabbinic) meanings, often with imaginative comparisons with similar words or verses.
* (, ): the inner, esoteric (metaphysical) meanings, expressed in kabbalah.

Kabbalah is considered by its followers as a necessary part of the study of Torah – the study of Torah (the Tanakh and rabbinic literature) being an inherent duty of observant Jews.

Modern academic-historical study of Jewish mysticism reserves the term &quot;kabbalah&quot; to designate the particular, distinctive doctrines that textually emerged fully expressed in the Middle Ages, as distinct from the earlier Merkabah mystical concepts and methods. According to this descriptive categorization, both versions of Kabbalistic theory, the medieval-Zoharic and the early-modern Lurianic Kabbalah together comprise the Theosophical tradition in Kabbalah, while the Meditative-Ecstatic Kabbalah incorporates a parallel inter-related Medieval tradition. A third tradition, related but more shunned, involves the magical aims of Practical Kabbalah. Moshe Idel, for example, writes that these 3 basic models can be discerned operating and competing throughout the whole history of Jewish mysticism, beyond the particular Kabbalistic background of the Middle Ages. They can be readily distinguished by their basic intent with respect to God:

* The Theosophical or Theosophical-Theurgic tradition of Theoretical Kabbalah (the main focus of the and Luria) seeks to understand and describe the divine realm using the imaginative and mythic symbols of human psychological experience. As an intuitive conceptual alternative to rationalist Jewish philosophy, particularly Maimonides&#x27; Aristotelianism, this speculation became the central stream of Kabbalah, and the usual reference of the term &quot;kabbalah&quot;. Its theosophy also implies the innate, centrally important theurgic influence of human conduct on redeeming or damaging the spiritual realms, as man is a divine microcosm, and the spiritual realms the divine macrocosm. The purpose of traditional theosophical kabbalah was to give the whole of normative Jewish religious practice this mystical metaphysical meaning.
* The Meditative tradition of Ecstatic Kabbalah (exemplified by Abraham Abulafia and Isaac of Acre) strives to achieve a mystical union with God, or nullification of the meditator in God&#x27;s Active intellect. Abraham Abulafia&#x27;s &quot;Prophetic Kabbalah&quot; was the supreme example of this, though marginal in Kabbalistic development, and his alternative to the program of theosophical Kabbalah. Abulafian meditation built upon the philosophy of Maimonides, whose following remained the rationalist threat to theosophical Kabbalists.
* The Magico-Talismanic tradition of Practical Kabbalah (in often unpublished manuscripts) endeavours to alter both the Divine realms and the World using practical methods. While theosophical interpretations of worship see its redemptive role as harmonising heavenly forces, Practical Kabbalah properly involved white-magical acts, and was censored by Kabbalists for only those completely pure of intent, as it relates to lower realms where purity and impurity are mixed. Consequently, it formed a separate minor tradition shunned from Kabbalah. Practical Kabbalah was prohibited by the Arizal until the Temple in Jerusalem is rebuilt and the required state of ritual purity is attainable.

According to Kabbalistic belief, early kabbalistic knowledge was transmitted orally by the Patriarchs, prophets, and sages, eventually to be &quot;interwoven&quot; into Jewish religious writings and culture. According to this view, early kabbalah was, in around the 10th century BCE, an open knowledge practiced by over a million people in ancient Israel. Foreign conquests drove the Jewish spiritual leadership of the time (the Sanhedrin) to hide the knowledge and make it secret, fearing that it might be misused if it fell into the wrong hands.

It is hard to clarify with any degree of certainty the exact concepts within kabbalah. There are several different schools of thought with very different outlooks; however, all are accepted as correct. Modern halakhic authorities have tried to narrow the scope and diversity within kabbalah, by restricting study to certain texts, notably and the teachings of Isaac Luria as passed down through Hayyim ben Joseph Vital. However, even this qualification does little to limit the scope of understanding and expression, as included in those works are commentaries on Abulafian writings, , Albotonian writings, and the , which is known to the kabbalistic elect and which, as described more recently by Gershom Scholem, combined ecstatic with theosophical mysticism. It is therefore important to bear in mind when discussing things such as the and their interactions that one is dealing with highly abstract concepts that at best can only be understood intuitively.

===Jewish and non-Jewish Kabbalah===
From the Renaissance onwards Jewish Kabbalah texts entered non-Jewish culture, where they were studied and translated by Christian Hebraists and Hermetic occultists. The syncretic traditions of Christian Cabala and Hermetic Qabalah developed independently of Judaic Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universalist ancient wisdom preserved from the Gnostic traditions of antiquity. Both adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Jewish understanding, to merge with multiple other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations. With the decline of Christian Cabala in the Age of Reason, Hermetic Qabalah continued as a central underground tradition in Western esotericism. Through these non-Jewish associations with magic, alchemy and divination, Kabbalah acquired some popular occult connotations forbidden within Judaism, where Jewish theurgic Practical Kabbalah was a minor, permitted tradition restricted for a few elite. Today, many publications on Kabbalah belong to the non-Jewish New Age and occult traditions of Cabala, rather than giving an accurate picture of Judaic Kabbalah. Instead, academic and traditional Jewish publications now translate and study Judaic Kabbalah for wide readership.

== Concepts ==
The definition of Kabbalah varies according to the tradition and aims of those following it. According to its earliest and original usage in ancient Hebrew it means &#x27;reception&#x27; or &#x27;tradition&#x27;, and in this context it tends to refer to any sacred writing composed after (or otherwise outside of) the five books of the Torah. After the Talmud is written, it refers to the Oral Law (both in the sense of the &#x27;Talmud&#x27; itself and in the sense of continuing dialog and thought devoted to the scripture in every generation). In the much later writings of Eleazar of Worms (c. 1350), it refers to theurgy or the conjuring of demons and angels by the invocation of their secret names. The understanding of the word Kabbalah undergoes a transformation of its meaning in medieval Judaism, in the books which are now primarily referred to as &#x27;the Kabbalah&#x27;: the &quot;Bahir&quot;, the &quot;Zohar&quot;, &quot;Etz Hayim&quot; etc. In these books the word Kabbalah is used in manifold new senses. During this major phase it refers to the continuity of revelation in every generation, on the one hand, while also suggesting the necessity of revelation to remain concealed and secret or esoteric in every period by formal requirements native to sacred truth. When the term Kabbalah is used to refer to a canon of secret mystical books by medieval Jews, these aforementioned books and other works in their constellation are the books and the literary sensibility to which the term refers. Even later the word is adapted or appropriated in Western esotericism (Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah), where it influences the tenor and aesthetics of European occultism practiced by gentiles or non-Jews. But above all, Jewish Kabbalah is a set of sacred and magical teachings meant to explain the relationship between the unchanging, eternal God—the mysterious &quot;Ein Sof&quot; (, &#x27;The Infinite&#x27;)—and the mortal, finite universe (God&#x27;s creation).

=== Concealed and revealed God ===
The nature of the divine prompted kabbalists to envision two aspects to God: (a) God in essence, absolutely transcendent, unknowable, limitless divine simplicity beyond revelation, and (b) God in manifestation, the revealed persona of God through which he creates and sustains and relates to humankind. Kabbalists speak of the first as &quot;Ein/Ayn Sof&quot; (אין סוף &quot;the infinite/endless&quot;, literally &quot;there is no end&quot;). Of the impersonal &quot;Ein Sof&quot; nothing can be grasped. However, the second aspect of divine emanations, accessible to human perception, dynamically interacting throughout spiritual and physical existence, reveal the divine immanently, and are bound up in the life of man. Kabbalists believe that these two aspects are not contradictory but complement one another, emanations mystically revealing the concealed mystery from within the Godhead.

As a term describing the Infinite Godhead beyond Creation, Kabbalists viewed the &quot;Ein Sof&quot; itself as too sublime to be referred to directly in the Torah. It is not a Holy Name in Judaism, as no name could contain a revelation of the Ein Sof. Even terming it &quot;No End&quot; is an inadequate representation of its true nature, the description only bearing its designation in relation to Creation. However, the Torah does narrate God speaking in the first person, most memorably the first word of the Ten Commandments, a reference without any description or name to the simple Divine essence (termed also &quot;Atzmus Ein Sof&quot; – Essence of the Infinite) beyond even the duality of Infinitude/Finitude. In contrast, the term Ein Sof describes the Godhead as Infinite lifeforce first cause, continuously keeping all Creation in existence. The Zohar reads the first words of Genesis, &quot;BeReishit Bara Elohim – In the beginning God created&quot;, as &quot;&quot;With&quot; (the level of) &quot;Reishit (Beginning)&quot; (the Ein Sof) &quot;created Elohim&quot; (God&#x27;s manifestation in creation)&quot;:

The structure of emanations has been described in various ways: Sephirot (divine attributes) and Partzufim (divine &quot;faces&quot;), Ohr (spiritual light and flow), Names of God and the supernal Torah, Olamot (Spiritual Worlds), a Divine Tree and Archetypal Man, Angelic Chariot and Palaces, male and female, enclothed layers of reality, inwardly holy vitality and external Kelipot shells, 613 channels (&quot;limbs&quot; of the King) and the divine Souls of Man. These symbols are used to describe various levels and aspects of Divine manifestation, from the &quot;Pnimi&quot; (inner) dimensions to the &quot;Hitzoni&quot; (outer). It is solely in relation to the emanations, certainly not the Ein Sof Ground of all Being, that Kabbalah uses anthropomorphic symbolism to relate psychologically to divinity. Kabbalists debated the validity of anthropomorphic symbolism, between its disclosure as mystical allusion, versus its instrumental use as allegorical metaphor; in the language of the Zohar, symbolism &quot;touches yet does not touch&quot; its point.

=== Sephirot ===
The &quot;Sephirot&quot; (also spelled &quot;sefirot&quot;; singular &quot;sefirah&quot;) are the ten emanations and attributes of God with which he continually sustains the existence of the universe. The Zohar and other Kabbalistic texts elaborate on the emergence of the sephirot from a state of concealed potential in the &quot;Ein Sof&quot; until their manifestation in the mundane world. In particular, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (known as &quot;the Ramak&quot;), describes how God emanated the myriad details of finite reality out of the absolute unity of Divine light via the ten sephirot, or vessels.

====Ten sephirot as process of creation====
According to Lurianic cosmology, the &quot;sephirot&quot; correspond to various levels of creation (ten &quot;sephirot&quot; in each of the Four Worlds, and four worlds within each of the larger four worlds, each containing ten &quot;sephirot&quot;, which themselves contain ten &quot;sephirot&quot;, to an infinite number of possibilities), and are emanated from the Creator for the purpose of creating the universe. The &quot;sephirot&quot; are considered revelations of the Creator&#x27;s will (&quot;ratzon&quot;), and they should not be understood as ten different &quot;gods&quot; but as ten different ways the one God reveals his will through the Emanations. It is not God who changes but the ability to perceive God that changes.

==== Ten Sephirot as process of ethics ====
Divine creation by means of the Ten Sephirot is an ethical process. They represent the different aspects of Morality. Loving-Kindness is a possible moral justification found in Chessed, and Gevurah is the Moral Justification of Justice and both are mediated by Mercy which is Rachamim. However, these pillars of morality become immoral once they become extremes. When Loving-Kindness becomes extreme it can lead to sexual depravity and lack of Justice to the wicked. When Justice becomes extreme, it can lead to torture and the Murder of innocents and unfair punishment.

&quot;Righteous&quot; humans (&quot;tzadikim&quot; plural of Tzadik) ascend these ethical qualities of the ten &quot;sephirot&quot; by doing righteous actions. If there were no righteous humans, the blessings of God would become completely hidden, and creation would cease to exist. While real human actions are the &quot;Foundation&quot; (&quot;Yesod&quot;) of this universe (&quot;Malchut&quot;), these actions must accompany the conscious intention of compassion. Compassionate actions are often impossible without faith (&quot;Emunah&quot;), meaning to trust that God always supports compassionate actions even when God seems hidden. Ultimately, it is necessary to show compassion toward oneself too in order to share compassion toward others. This &quot;selfish&quot; enjoyment of God&#x27;s blessings but only in order to empower oneself to assist others is an important aspect of &quot;Restriction&quot;, and is considered a kind of golden mean in kabbalah, corresponding to the &quot;sefirah&quot; of Adornment (Tiferet) being part of the &quot;Middle Column&quot;.

Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, wrote &quot;Tomer Devorah&quot; (&quot;Palm Tree of Deborah&quot;), in which he presents an ethical teaching of Judaism in the kabbalistic context of the ten &quot;sephirot&quot;. &quot;Tomer Devorah&quot; has become also a foundational Musar text.

=== Partzufim ===

The most esoteric Idrot sections of the classic Zohar make reference to hypostatic male and female &quot;Partzufim&quot; (Divine Personas) displacing the Sephirot, manifestations of God in particular Anthropomorphic symbolic personalities based on Biblical esoteric exegesis and midrashic narratives. Lurianic Kabbalah places these at the centre of our existence, rather than earlier Kabbalah&#x27;s Sephirot, which Luria saw as broken in Divine crisis. Contemporary cognitive understanding of the Partzuf symbols relates them to Jungian archetypes of the collective unconscious, reflecting a psychologised progression from youth to sage in therapeutic healing back to the infinite Ein Sof/Unconscious, as Kabbalah is simultaneously both theology and psychology.

=== Descending spiritual worlds ===

Medieval Kabbalists believed that all things are linked to God through these emanations, making all levels in creation part of one great, gradually descending chain of being. Through this any lower creation reflects its particular roots in supernal divinity. Kabbalists agreed with the divine transcendence described by Jewish philosophy, but as only referring to the &quot;Ein Sof&quot; unknowable Godhead. They reinterpreted the theistic philosophical concept of creation from nothing, replacing God&#x27;s creative act with panentheistic continual self-emanation by the mystical Ayin Nothingness/No-thing sustaining all spiritual and physical realms as successively more corporeal garments, veils and condensations of divine immanence. The innumerable levels of descent divide into Four comprehensive spiritual worlds, &quot;Atziluth&quot; (&quot;Closeness&quot; – Divine Wisdom), &quot;Beriah&quot; (&quot;Creation&quot; – Divine Understanding), &quot;Yetzirah&quot; (&quot;Formation&quot; – Divine Emotions), &quot;Assiah&quot; (&quot;Action&quot; – Divine Activity), with a preceding Fifth World &quot;Adam Kadmon&quot; (&quot;Primordial Man&quot; – Divine Will) sometimes excluded due to its sublimity. Together the whole spiritual heavens form the Divine Persona/Anthropos.

Hasidic thought extends the divine immanence of Kabbalah by holding that God is all that really exists, all else being completely undifferentiated from God&#x27;s perspective. This view can be defined as acosmic monistic panentheism. According to this philosophy, God&#x27;s existence is higher than anything that this world can express, yet he includes all things of this world within his divine reality in perfect unity, so that the creation effected no change in him at all. This paradox as seen from dual human and divine perspectives is dealt with at length in Chabad texts.

=== Origin of evil ===

Among problems considered in the Hebrew Kabbalah is the theological issue of the nature and origin of evil. In the views of some Kabbalists this conceives &quot;evil&quot; as a &quot;quality of God&quot;, asserting that negativity enters into the essence of the Absolute. In this view it is conceived that the Absolute needs evil to &quot;be what it is&quot;, i.e., to exist. Foundational texts of Medieval Kabbalism conceived evil as a demonic parallel to the holy, called the &quot;Sitra Achra&quot; (the &quot;Other Side&quot;), and the &quot;qlippoth&quot; (the &quot;shells/husks&quot;) that cover and conceal the holy, are nurtured from it, and yet also protect it by limiting its revelation. Scholem termed this element of the Spanish Kabbalah a &quot;Jewish gnostic&quot; motif, in the sense of dual powers in the divine realm of manifestation. In a radical notion, the root of evil is found within the 10 holy Sephirot, through an imbalance of Gevurah, the power of &quot;Strength/Judgement/Severity&quot;.

Gevurah is necessary for Creation to exist as it counterposes Chesed (&quot;loving-kindness&quot;), restricting the unlimited divine bounty within suitable vessels, so forming the Worlds. However, if man sins (actualising impure judgement within his soul), the supernal Judgement is reciprocally empowered over the Kindness, introducing disharmony among the Sephirot in the divine realm and exile from God throughout Creation. The demonic realm, though illusory in its holy origin, becomes the real apparent realm of impurity in lower Creation. In the Zohar, the sin of Adam and Eve (who embodied Adam Kadmon below) took place in the spiritual realms. Their sin was that they separated the Tree of knowledge (10 sefirot within Malkuth, representing Divine immanence), from the Tree of life within it (10 sefirot within Tiferet, representing Divine transcendence). This introduced the false perception of duality into lower creation, an external Tree of Death nurtured from holiness, and an Adam Belial of impurity. In Lurianic Kabbalah, evil originates from a primordial shattering of the sephirot of God&#x27;s Persona before creation of the stable spiritual worlds, mystically represented by the 8 Kings of Edom (the derivative of Gevurah) &quot;who died&quot; before any king reigned in Israel from Genesis 36. In the divine view from above within Kabbalah, emphasised in Hasidic Panentheism, the appearance of duality and pluralism below dissolves into the absolute Monism of God, psychologising evil. Though impure below, what appears as evil derives from a divine blessing too high to be contained openly. The mystical task of the righteous in the Zohar is to reveal this concealed Divine Oneness and absolute good, to &quot;convert bitterness into sweetness, darkness into light&quot;.

=== Role of Man ===

Kabbalistic doctrine gives man the central role in Creation, as his soul and body correspond to the supernal divine manifestations. In the Christian Kabbalah this scheme was universalised to describe &quot;harmonia mundi&quot;, the harmony of Creation within man. In Judaism, it gave a profound spiritualisation of Jewish practice. While the kabbalistic scheme gave a radically innovative, though conceptually continuous, development of mainstream Midrashic and Talmudic rabbinic notions, kabbalistic thought underscored and invigorated conservative Jewish observance. The esoteric teachings of kabbalah gave the traditional mitzvot observances the central role in spiritual creation, whether the practitioner was learned in this knowledge or not. Accompanying normative Jewish observance and worship with elite mystical kavanot intentions gave them theurgic power, but sincere observance by common folk, especially in the Hasidic popularisation of kabbalah, could replace esoteric abilities. Many kabbalists were also leading legal figures in Judaism, such as Nachmanides and Joseph Karo.

Medieval kabbalah elaborates particular reasons for each Biblical mitzvah, and their role in harmonising the supernal divine flow, uniting masculine and feminine forces on High. With this, the feminine Divine presence in this world is drawn from exile to the Holy One Above. The 613 mitzvot are embodied in the organs and soul of man. Lurianic Kabbalah incorporates this in the more inclusive scheme of Jewish messianic rectification of exiled divinity. Jewish mysticism, in contrast to Divine transcendence rationalist human-centred reasons for Jewish observance, gave Divine-immanent providential cosmic significance to the daily events in the worldly life of man in general, and the spiritual role of Jewish observance in particular.

=== Levels of the soul ===

The Kabbalah posits that the human soul has three elements: the &quot;nefesh&quot;, &quot;ru&#x27;ach&quot;, and &quot;neshamah&quot;. The &quot;nefesh&quot; is found in all humans, and enters the physical body at birth. It is the source of one&#x27;s physical and psychological nature. The next two parts of the soul are not implanted at birth, but can be developed over time; their development depends on the actions and beliefs of the individual. They are said to only fully exist in people awakened spiritually. A common way of explaining the three parts of the soul is as follows:

* &quot;Nefesh&quot; (נֶפֶשׁ): the lower part, or &quot;animal part&quot;, of the soul. It is linked to instincts and bodily cravings. This part of the soul is provided at birth.
* &quot;Ruach&quot; (רוּחַ): the middle soul, the &quot;spirit&quot;. It contains the moral virtues and the ability to distinguish between good and evil.
* &quot;Neshamah&quot; (נְשָׁמָה): the higher soul, or &quot;super-soul&quot;. This separates man from all other life-forms. It is related to the intellect and allows man to enjoy and benefit from the afterlife. It allows one to have some awareness of the existence and presence of God.
* &quot;Chayyah&quot; (חיה): The part of the soul that allows one to have an awareness of the divine life force itself.
* &quot;Yehidah&quot; (יחידה): The highest plane of the soul, in which one can achieve as full a union with God as is possible.

=== Reincarnation ===

Reincarnation, the transmigration of the soul after death, was introduced into Judaism as a central esoteric tenet of Kabbalah from the Medieval period onwards, called Gilgul neshamot (&quot;cycles of the soul&quot;). The concept does not appear overtly in the Hebrew Bible or classic rabbinic literature, and was rejected by various Medieval Jewish philosophers. However, the Kabbalists explained a number of scriptural passages in reference to Gilgulim. The concept became central to the later Kabbalah of Isaac Luria, who systemised it as the personal parallel to the cosmic process of rectification. Through Lurianic Kabbalah and Hasidic Judaism, reincarnation entered popular Jewish culture as a literary motif.

=== Tzimtzum, Shevirah and Tikkun ===
&quot;Tzimtzum&quot; (Constriction/Concentration) is the primordial cosmic act whereby God &quot;contracted&quot; His infinite light, leaving a &quot;void&quot; into which the light of existence was poured. This allowed the emergence of independent existence that would not become nullified by the pristine Infinite Light, reconciling the unity of the &quot;Ein Sof&quot; with the plurality of creation. This changed the first creative act into one of withdrawal/exile, the antithesis of the ultimate Divine Will. In contrast, a new emanation after the Tzimtzum shone into the vacuum to begin creation, but led to an initial instability called &quot;Tohu&quot; (Chaos), leading to a new crisis of &quot;Shevirah&quot; (Shattering) of the sephirot vessels. The shards of the broken vessels fell down into the lower realms, animated by remnants of their divine light, causing primordial exile within the Divine Persona before the creation of man. Exile and enclothement of higher divinity within lower realms throughout existence requires man to complete the &quot;Tikkun olam&quot; (Rectification) process. Rectification Above corresponds to the reorganization of the independent sephirot into relating &quot;Partzufim&quot; (Divine Personas), previously referred to obliquely in the Zohar. From the catastrophe stems the possibility of self-aware Creation, and also the &quot;Kelipot&quot; (Impure Shells) of previous Medieval kabbalah. The metaphorical anthropomorphism of the partzufim accentuates the sexual unifications of the redemption process, while Gilgul reincarnation emerges from the scheme. Uniquely, Lurianism gave formerly private mysticism the urgency of Messianic social involvement.

According to interpretations of Luria, the catastrophe stemmed from the &quot;unwillingness&quot; of the residue imprint after the Tzimtzum to relate to the new vitality that began creation. The process was arranged to shed and harmonise the Divine Infinity with the latent potential of evil. The creation of Adam would have redeemed existence, but his sin caused new shevirah of Divine vitality, requiring the Giving of the Torah to begin Messianic rectification. Historical and individual history becomes the narrative of reclaiming exiled Divine sparks.

=== Linguistic mysticism and the mystical Torah ===

Kabbalistic thought extended Biblical and Midrashic notions that God enacted Creation through the Hebrew language and through the Torah into a full linguistic mysticism. In this, every Hebrew letter, word, number, even accent on words of the Hebrew Bible contain Jewish mystical meanings, describing the spiritual dimensions within exoteric ideas, and it teaches the hermeneutic methods of interpretation for ascertaining these meanings. Names of God in Judaism have further prominence, though infinite meaning turns the whole Torah into a Divine name. As the Hebrew name of things is the channel of their lifeforce, parallel to the sephirot, so concepts such as &quot;holiness&quot; and &quot;mitzvot&quot; embody ontological Divine immanence, as God can be known in manifestation as well as transcendence. The infinite potential of meaning in the Torah, as in the &quot;Ein Sof&quot;, is reflected in the symbol of the two trees of the Garden of Eden; the Torah of the Tree of Knowledge is the external, finite Halachic Torah, enclothed within which the mystics perceive the unlimited infinite plurality of meanings of the Torah of the Tree of Life. In Lurianic terms, each of the 600,000 root souls of Israel find their own interpretation in Torah, as &quot;God, the Torah and Israel are all One&quot;.

As early as the 1st century BCE Jews believed that the Torah and other canonical texts contained encoded messages and hidden meanings. Gematria is one method for discovering its hidden meanings. In this system, each Hebrew letter also represents a number. By converting letters to numbers, Kabbalists were able to find a hidden meaning in each word. This method of interpretation was used extensively by various schools.

In contemporary interpretation of kabbalah, Sanford Drob makes cognitive sense of this linguistic mythos by relating it to postmodern philosophical concepts described by Jacques Derrida and others, where all reality embodies narrative texts with infinite plurality of meanings brought by the reader. In this dialogue, kabbalah survives the nihilism of Deconstruction by incorporating its own Lurianic &quot;Shevirah&quot;, and by the dialectical paradox where man and God imply each other.

== Cognition, mysticism, or values ==
=== Kabbalists as mystics ===
The founder of the academic study of Jewish mysticism, Gershom Scholem, privileged an intellectual view of the nature of Kabbalistic symbols as dialectic Theosophical speculation. In contrast, contemporary scholarship of Moshe Idel and Elliot R. Wolfson has opened a phenomenological understanding of the mystical nature of Kabbalistic experience, based on a close reading of the historical texts. Wolfson has shown that among the closed elite circles of mystical activity, medieval Theosophical Kabbalists held that an intellectual view of their symbols was secondary to the experiential. In the context of medieval Jewish philosophical debates on the role of imagination in Biblical prophecy, and essentialist versus instrumental kabbalistic debates about the relation of sephirot to God, they saw contemplation on the sephirot as a vehicle for prophecy. Judaism&#x27;s ban on physical iconography, along with anthropomorphic metaphors for Divinity in the Hebrew Bible and midrash, enabled their internal visualisation of the Divine sephirot Anthropos in imagination. Disclosure of the aniconic in iconic internal psychology, involved sublimatory revelation of Kabbalah&#x27;s sexual unifications. Previous academic distinction between &quot;Theosophical&quot; versus Abulafian &quot;Ecstatic-Prophetic Kabbalah&quot; overstated their division of aims, which revolved around visual versus verbal/auditory views of prophecy. In addition, throughout the history of Judaic Kabbalah, the greatest mystics claimed to receive new teachings from Elijah the Prophet, the souls of earlier sages (a purpose of Lurianic meditation prostrated on the graves of Talmudic Tannaim, Amoraim and Kabbalists), the soul of the mishnah, ascents during sleep, heavenly messengers, etc. A tradition of parapsychology abilities, psychic knowledge, and theurgic intercessions in heaven for the community is recounted in the hagiographic works &quot;Praises of the Ari&quot;, &quot;Praises of the Besht&quot;, and in many other Kabbalistic and Hasidic tales. Kabbalistic and Hasidic texts are concerned to apply themselves from exegesis and theory to spiritual practice, including prophetic drawing of new mystical revelations in Torah. The mythological symbols Kabbalah uses to answer philosophical questions, themselves invite mystical contemplation, intuitive apprehension and psychological engagement.

=== Paradoxical coincidence of opposites ===
In bringing Theosophical Kabbalah into contemporary intellectual understanding, using the tools of modern and postmodern philosophy and psychology, Sanford Drob shows philosophically how every symbol of the Kabbalah embodies the simultaneous dialectical paradox of mystical &quot;Coincidentia oppositorum&quot;, the conjoining of two opposite dualities. Thus the Infinite Ein Sof is above the duality of &quot;Yesh/Ayin Being/Non-Being&quot; transcending Existence/Nothingness (&quot;Becoming&quot; into Existence through the souls of Man who are the inner dimension of all spiritual and physical worlds, yet simultaneously the Infinite Divine generative lifesource beyond Creation that continuously keeps everything spiritual and physical in existence); Sephirot bridge the philosophical problem of the One and the Many; Man is both Divine (Adam Kadmon) and human (invited to project human psychology onto Divinity to understand it); Tzimtzum is both illusion and real from Divine and human perspectives; evil and good imply each other (Kelipah draws from Divinity, good arises only from overcoming evil); Existence is simultaneously partial (Tzimtzum), broken (Shevirah), and whole (Tikun) from different perspectives; God experiences Himself as Other through Man, Man embodies and completes (Tikun) the Divine Persona Above. In Kabbalah&#x27;s reciprocal Panentheism, Theism and Atheism/Humanism represent two incomplete poles of a mutual dialectic that imply and include each other&#x27;s partial validity. This was expressed by the Chabad Hasidic thinker Aaron of Staroselye, that the truth of any concept is revealed only in its opposite.

=== Metaphysics or axiology ===
By expressing itself using symbols and myth that transcend single interpretations, Theosophical Kabbalah incorporates aspects of philosophy, Jewish theology, psychology and unconscious depth psychology, mysticism and meditation, Jewish exegesis, theurgy, and ethics, as well as overlapping with theory from magical elements. Its symbols can be read as questions which are their own existentialist answers (the Hebrew sephirah Chokmah-Wisdom, the beginning of Existence, is read etymologically by Kabbalists as the question &quot;Koach Mah?&quot; the &quot;Power of What?&quot;). Alternative listings of the Sephirot start with either Keter (Unconscious Will/Volition), or Chokmah (Wisdom), a philosophical duality between a Rational or Supra-Rational Creation, between whether the Mitzvot Judaic observances have reasons or transcend reasons in Divine Will, between whether study or good deeds is superior, and whether the symbols of Kabbalah should be read as primarily metaphysical intellectual cognition or Axiology values. Messianic redemption requires both ethical Tikkun olam and contemplative Kavanah. Sanford Drob sees every attempt to limit Kabbalah to one fixed dogmatic interpretation as necessarily bringing its own Deconstruction (Lurianic Kabbalah incorporates its own Shevirah self shattering; the Ein Sof transcends all of its infinite expressions; the infinite mystical Torah of the Tree of Life has no/infinite interpretations). The infinite axiology of the Ein Sof One, expressed through the Plural Many, overcomes the dangers of nihilism, or the antinomian mystical breaking of Jewish observance alluded to throughout Kabbalistic and Hasidic mysticisms.

== Primary texts ==
Like the rest of the rabbinic literature, the texts of kabbalah were once part of an ongoing oral tradition, though, over the centuries, much of the oral tradition has been written down.

Jewish forms of esotericism existed over 2,000 years ago. Ben Sira (born ) warns against it, saying: &quot;You shall have no business with secret things&quot;. Nonetheless, mystical studies were undertaken and resulted in mystical literature, the first being the Apocalyptic literature of the second and first pre-Christian centuries and which contained elements that carried over to later kabbalah.

Throughout the centuries since, many texts have been produced, among them the ancient descriptions of &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, the &quot;Heichalot&quot; mystical ascent literature, the &quot;Bahir&quot;, &quot;Sefer Raziel HaMalakh&quot; and the &quot;Zohar&quot;, the main text of Kabbalistic exegesis. Classic mystical Bible commentaries are included in fuller versions of the &quot;Mikraot Gedolot&quot; (Main Commentators). Cordoveran systemisation is presented in &quot;Pardes Rimonim&quot;, philosophical articulation in the works of the Maharal, and Lurianic rectification in &quot;Etz Chayim&quot;. Subsequent interpretation of Lurianic Kabbalah was made in the writings of Shalom Sharabi, in &quot;Nefesh HaChaim&quot; and the 20th-century &quot;Sulam&quot;. Hasidism interpreted kabbalistic structures to their correspondence in inward perception. The Hasidic development of kabbalah incorporates a successive stage of Jewish mysticism from historical kabbalistic metaphysics.

== Scholarship ==

The first modern-academic historians of Judaism, the &quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; school of the 19th century, framed Judaism in solely rational terms in the emancipatory Haskalah spirit of their age. They opposed kabbalah and restricted its significance from Jewish historiography. In the mid-20th century, it was left to Gershom Scholem to overturn their stance, establishing the flourishing present-day academic investigation of Jewish mysticism, and making Heichalot, Kabbalistic and Hasidic texts the objects of scholarly critical-historical study. In Scholem&#x27;s opinion, the mythical and mystical components of Judaism were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the exoteric Halakha or intellectualist Jewish philosophy, were the living subterranean stream in historical Jewish development that periodically broke out to renew the Jewish spirit and social life of the community. Scholem&#x27;s magisterial &quot;Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism&quot; (1941) among his seminal works, though representing scholarship and interpretations that have subsequently been challenged and revised within the field, remains the only academic survey studying all main historical periods of Jewish mysticism.

The Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been a centre of this research, including Scholem and Isaiah Tishby, and more recently Joseph Dan, Yehuda Liebes, Rachel Elior, and Moshe Idel. Scholars across the eras of Jewish mysticism in America and Britain have included Alexander Altmann, Arthur Green, Lawrence Fine, Elliot Wolfson, Daniel Matt, Louis Jacobs and Ada Rapoport-Albert.

Moshe Idel has opened up research on the Ecstatic Kabbalah alongside the theosophical, and has called for new multi-disciplinary approaches, beyond the philological and historical that have dominated until now, to include phenomenology, psychology, anthropology and comparative studies.

=== Claims for authority ===
Historians have noted that most claims for the authority of kabbalah involve an argument of the antiquity of authority. As a result, virtually all early foundational works pseudepigraphically claim, or are ascribed, ancient authorship. For example, &quot;Sefer Raziel HaMalach&quot;, an astro-magical text partly based on a magical manual of late antiquity, &quot;Sefer ha-Razim&quot;, was, according to the kabbalists, transmitted by the angel Raziel to Adam after he was evicted from Eden. Another famous work, the early &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;, is dated back to the patriarch Abraham. This tendency toward pseudepigraphy has its roots in apocalyptic literature, which claims that esoteric knowledge such as magic, divination and astrology was transmitted to humans in the mythic past by the two angels, Aza and Azaz&#x27;el (in other places, Azaz&#x27;el and Uzaz&#x27;el) who fell from heaven (see Genesis 6:4).

As well as ascribing ancient origins to texts, and reception of Oral Torah transmission, the greatest and most innovative Kabbalists claimed mystical reception of direct personal divine revelations, by heavenly mentors such as Elijah the Prophet, the souls of Talmudic sages, prophetic revelation, soul ascents on high, etc. On this basis Arthur Green speculates, that while the &quot;Zohar&quot; was written by a circle of Kabbalists in medieval Spain, they may have believed they were channeling the souls and direct revelations from the earlier mystic circle of Shimon bar Yochai in 2nd century Galilee depicted in the Zohar&#x27;s narrative. Academics have compared the Zohar mystic circle of Spain with the romanticised wandering mystic circle of Galilee described in the text. Similarly, Isaac Luria gathered his disciples at the traditional Idra assembly location, placing each in the seat of their former reincarnations as students of Shimon bar Yochai.

== Criticism ==
=== Distinction between Jews and non-Jews ===
One point of view is represented by the Hasidic work &quot;Tanya&quot; (1797), in order to argue that Jews have a different character of soul: while a non-Jew, according to the author Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745-1812), can achieve a high level of spirituality, similar to an angel, his soul is still fundamentally different in character, from a Jewish one. A similar view is found in &quot;Kuzari&quot;, an early medieval philosophical book by Yehuda Halevi (1075–1141). Another rabbi, Abraham Yehudah Khein (1878-1957), believed that spiritually elevated Gentiles have essentially Jewish souls, &quot;who just lack the formal conversion to Judaism&quot;, and that unspiritual Jews are &quot;Jewish merely by their birth documents&quot;. 

David Halperin argues that the collapse of Kabbalah&#x27;s influence among Western European Jews over the course of the 17th and 18th century was a result of the cognitive dissonance they experienced between the negative perception of Gentiles found in some exponents of Kabbalah, and their own positive dealings with non-Jews, which were rapidly expanding and improving during this period due to the influence of the Enlightenment. Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz, a Lithuanian-Galician Kabbalist of the 18th century and a moderate proponent of the Haskalah, called for brotherly love and solidarity between all nations, and believed that Kabbalah can empower everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, with prophetic abilities.

The works of Abraham Cohen de Herrera (1570–1635) are full of references to Gentile mystical philosophers. Such approach was particularly common among the Renaissance and post-Renaissance Italian Jews. Late medieval and Renaissance Italian Kabbalists, such as Yohanan Alemanno, David Messer Leon and Abraham Yagel, adhered to humanistic ideals and incorporated teachings of various Christian and pagan mystics.

A prime representative of this humanist stream in Kabbalah was Elijah Benamozegh, who explicitly praised Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, as well as a whole range of ancient pagan mystical systems. He believed that Kabbalah can reconcile the differences between the world&#x27;s religions, which represent different facets and stages of the universal human spirituality. In his writings, Benamozegh interprets the New Testament, Hadith, Vedas, Avesta and pagan mysteries according to the Kabbalistic theosophy.

E. R. Wolfson provides numerous examples from the 17th to the 20th centuries, which would challenge the view of Halperin as well as the notion that &quot;modern Judaism&quot; has rejected or dismissed this &quot;outdated aspect&quot; of the religion and, he argues, there are still Kabbalists today who harbor this view. He argues that, while it is accurate to say that many Jews do and would find this distinction offensive, it is inaccurate to say that the idea has been totally rejected in all circles. As Wolfson has argued, it is an ethical demand on the part of scholars to continue to be vigilant with regard to this matter and in this way the tradition can be refined from within.

=== Medieval views ===
The idea that there are ten divine &quot;sephirot&quot; could evolve over time into the idea that &quot;God is One being, yet in that One being there are Ten&quot; which opens up a debate about what the &quot;correct beliefs&quot; in God should be, according to Judaism. The early Kabbalists debated the relationship of the Sephirot to God, adopting a range of essentialist versus instrumental views. Modern Kabbalah, based on the 16th century systemisations of Cordovero and Isaac Luria, takes an intermediate position: the instrumental vessels of the sephirot are created, but their inner light is from the undifferentiated Ohr Ein Sof essence.

Maimonides (12th century), celebrated by followers for his Jewish rationalism, rejected many of the pre-Kabbalistic Hekalot texts, particularly &quot;Shi&#x27;ur Qomah&quot; whose starkly anthropomorphic vision of God he considered heretical. Maimonides, a centrally important medieval sage of Judaism, lived at the time of the first emergence of Kabbalah. Modern scholarship views the systemisation and publication of their historic oral doctrine by Kabbalists, as a move to rebut the threat on Judaic observance by the populance misreading Maimonides&#x27; ideal of philosophical contemplation over ritual performance in his philosophical &quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;. They objected to Maimonides equating the Talmudic Maaseh Breishit and Maaseh Merkavah secrets of the Torah with Aristotelean physics and metaphysics in that work and in his legal Mishneh Torah, teaching that their own Theosophy, centred on an esoteric metaphysics of traditional Jewish practice, is the Torah&#x27;s true inner meaning.

The Kabbalist medieval rabbinic sage Nachmanides (13th century), classic debater against Maimonidean rationalism, provides background to many kabbalistic ideas. An entire book entitled &quot;Gevuras Aryeh&quot; was authored by Yaakov Yehuda Aryeh Leib Frenkel and originally published in 1915, specifically to explain and elaborate on the kabbalistic concepts addressed by Nachmanides in his classic commentary to the Five books of Moses.

Abraham Maimonides (in the spirit of his father Maimonides, Saadiah Gaon, and other predecessors) explains at length in his &quot;Milḥamot HaShem&quot; that God is in no way literally within time or space nor physically outside time or space, since time and space simply do not apply to his being whatsoever, emphasizing the Monotheist Oneness of Divine transcendence unlike any worldly conception. Kabbalah&#x27;s Panentheism expressed by Moses Cordovero and Hasidic thought, agrees that God&#x27;s essence transcends all expression, but holds in contrast that existence is a manifestation of God&#x27;s Being, descending immanently through spiritual and physical condensations of the divine light. By incorporating the pluralist many within God, God&#x27;s Oneness is deepened to exclude the true existence of anything but God. In Hasidic Panentheism, the world is acosmic from the Divine view, yet real from its own perspective.

Around the 1230s, Rabbi Meir ben Simon of Narbonne wrote an epistle (included in his &quot;Milḥemet Mitzvah&quot;) against his contemporaries, the early Kabbalists, characterizing them as blasphemers who even approach heresy. He particularly singled out the Sefer Bahir, rejecting the attribution of its authorship to the &quot;tanna&quot; R. Neḥunya ben ha-Kanah and describing some of its content as truly heretical.

Leon of Modena, a 17th-century Venetian critic of Kabbalah, wrote that if we were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would be compatible with Judaism, as the Trinity seems to resemble the kabbalistic doctrine of the &quot;sephirot&quot;. This was in response to the belief that some European Jews of the period addressed individual &quot;sephirot&quot; in their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon. Apologists explained that Jews may have been praying &quot;for&quot; and not necessarily &quot;to&quot; the aspects of Godliness represented by the &quot;sephirot&quot;. In contrast to Christianity, Kabbalists declare that one prays only &quot;to Him (God&#x27;s Essence, male solely by metaphor in Hebrew&#x27;s gendered grammar), not to his attributes (sephirot or any other Divine manifestations or forms of incarnation)&quot;. Kabbalists directed their prayers to God&#x27;s essence through the channels of particular sephirot using kavanot Divine names intentions. To pray to a manifestation of God introduces false division among the sephirot, disrupting their absolute unity, dependence and dissolving into the transcendent Ein Sof; the sephirot descend throughout Creation, only appearing from man&#x27;s perception of God, where God manifests by any variety of numbers.

Yaakov Emden (1697–1776), himself an Orthodox Kabbalist who venerated the Zohar, concerned to battle Sabbatean misuse of Kabbalah, wrote the &quot;Mitpaḥath Sfarim&quot; (&quot;Veil of the Books&quot;), an astute critique of the Zohar in which he concludes that certain parts of the Zohar contain heretical teaching and therefore could not have been written by Shimon bar Yochai.

Vilna Gaon (1720–1797) held the Zohar and Luria in deep reverence, critically emending classic Judaic texts from historically accumulated errors by his acute acumen and scholarly belief in the perfect unity of Kabbalah revelation and Rabbinic Judaism. Though a Lurianic Kabbalist, his commentaries sometimes chose Zoharic interpretation over Luria when he felt the matter lent itself to a more exoteric view. Although proficient in mathematics and sciences and recommending their necessity for understanding Talmud, he had no use for canonical medieval Jewish philosophy, declaring that Maimonides had been &quot;misled by the accursed philosophy&quot; in denying belief in the external occult matters of demons, incantations and amulets.

Views of Kabbalists regarding Jewish philosophy varied from those who appreciated Maimonidean and other classic medieval philosophical works, integrating them with Kabbalah and seeing profound human philosophical and Divine kabbalistic wisdoms as compatible, to those who polemicised against religious philosophy during times when it became overly rationalist and dogmatic. A dictum commonly cited by Kabbalists, &quot;Kabbalah begins where Philosophy ends&quot;, can be read as either appreciation or polemic. Moses of Burgos (late 13th century) declared, &quot;these philosophers whose wisdom you are praising end where we begin&quot;. Moses Cordovero appreciated the influence of Maimonides in his quasi-rational systemisation. From its inception, the Theosophical Kabbalah became permeated by terminology adapted from philosophy and given new mystical meanings, such as its early integration with the Neoplatonism of Ibn Gabirol and use of Aristotelian terms of Form over Matter.

=== Orthodox Judaism ===

Pinchas Giller and Adin Steinsaltz write that Kabbalah is best described as the inner part of traditional Jewish religion, the official metaphysics of Judaism, that was essential to normative Judaism until fairly recently. With the decline of Jewish life in medieval Spain, it displaced rationalist Jewish philosophy until the modern rise of Haskalah enlightenment, receiving a revival in our postmodern age. While Judaism always maintained a minority tradition of religious rationalist criticism of Kabbalah, Gershom Scholem writes that Lurianic Kabbalah was the last theology that was near predominant in Jewish life. While Lurianism represented the elite of esoteric Kabbalism, its mythic-messianic divine drama and personalisation of reincarnation captured the popular imagination in Jewish folklore and in the Sabbatean and Hasidic social movements. Giller notes that the former Zoharic-Cordoverian classic Kabbalah represented a common exoteric popular view of Kabbalah, as depicted in early modern Musar literature.

In contemporary Orthodox Judaism there is dispute as to the status of the Zohar&#x27;s and Isaac Luria&#x27;s (the Arizal) Kabbalistic teachings. While a portion of Modern Orthodox, followers of the Dor De&#x27;ah movement, and many students of the Rambam reject Arizal&#x27;s Kabbalistic teachings, as well as deny that the &quot;Zohar&quot; is authoritative or from Shimon bar Yohai, all three of these groups accept the existence and validity of the Talmudic &quot;Maaseh Breishit and Maaseh Merkavah&quot; mysticism. Their disagreement concerns whether the Kabbalistic teachings promulgated today are accurate representations of those esoteric teachings to which the Talmud refers. The mainstream Haredi (Hasidic, Lithuanian, Oriental) and Religious Zionist Jewish movements revere Luria and the Kabbalah, but one can find both rabbis who sympathize with such a view, while disagreeing with it, as well as rabbis who consider such a view heresy. The Haredi Eliyahu Dessler and Gedaliah Nadel maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship. Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg mentioned the possibility of Christian influence in the Kabbalah with the &quot;Kabbalistic vision of the Messiah as the redeemer of all mankind&quot; being &quot;the Jewish counterpart to Christ.&quot;

Modern Orthodox Judaism, representing an inclination to rationalism, embrace of academic scholarship, and the individual&#x27;s autonomy to define Judaism, embodies a diversity of views regarding Kabbalah from a Neo-Hasidic spirituality to Maimonist anti-Kabbalism. In a book to help define central theological issues in Modern Orthodoxy, Michael J. Harris writes that the relationship between Modern Orthodoxy and mysticism has been under-discussed. He sees a deficiency of spirituality in Modern Orthodoxy, as well as the dangers in a fundamentalist adoption of Kabbalah. He suggests the development of neo-Kabbalistic adaptions of Jewish mysticism compatible with rationalism, offering a variety of precedent models from past thinkers ranging from the mystical inclusivism of Abraham Isaac Kook to a compartmentalisation between Halakha and mysticism.

Yiḥyeh Qafeḥ, a 20th-century Yemenite Jewish leader and Chief Rabbi of Yemen, spearheaded the Dor De&#x27;ah (&quot;generation of knowledge&quot;) movement to counteract the influence of the Zohar and modern Kabbalah. He authored critiques of mysticism in general and Lurianic Kabbalah in particular; his magnum opus was Milḥamoth ha-Shem (&quot;Wars of Hashem&quot;) against what he perceived as neo-platonic and gnostic influences on Judaism with the publication and distribution of the Zohar since the 13th Century. Rabbi Yiḥyah founded yeshivot, rabbinical schools, and synagogues that featured a rationalist approach to Judaism based on the Talmud and works of Saadia Gaon and Maimonides (Rambam). In recent years, rationalists holding similar views as those of the Dor De&#x27;ah movement have described themselves as &quot;talmide ha-Rambam&quot; (disciples of Maimonides) rather than as being aligned with Dor De&#x27;ah, and are more theologically aligned with the rationalism of Modern Orthodox Judaism than with Orthodox Ḥasidic or Ḥaredi communities.

Yeshayahu Leibowitz (1903–1994), an ultra-rationalist Modern Orthodox philosopher, referred to Kabbalah &quot;a collection of &quot;pagan superstitions&quot; and &quot;idol worship&quot; in remarks given in 1990.

=== Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism ===

Kabbalah tended to be rejected by most Jews in the Conservative and Reform movements, though its influences were not completely eliminated. While it was generally not studied as a discipline, the Kabbalistic &quot;Kabbalat Shabbat&quot; service remained part of liberal liturgy, as did the &quot;Yedid Nefesh&quot; prayer. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, Saul Lieberman of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America is reputed to have introduced a lecture by Scholem on Kabbalah with a statement that Kabbalah itself was &quot;nonsense&quot;, but the academic study of Kabbalah was &quot;scholarship&quot;. This view became popular among many Jews, who viewed the subject as worthy of study, but who did not accept Kabbalah as teaching literal truths.

According to Bradley Shavit Artson (Dean of the Conservative Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies):

However, in the late 20th century and early 21st century there has been a revival in interest in Kabbalah in all branches of liberal Judaism. The Kabbalistic 12th-century prayer &quot;Anim Zemirot&quot; was restored to the new Conservative &quot;Sim Shalom&quot; &quot;siddur&quot;, as was the &quot;B&#x27;rikh Shmeh&quot; passage from the Zohar, and the mystical &quot;Ushpizin&quot; service welcoming to the &quot;Sukkah&quot; the spirits of Jewish forebears. &quot;Anim Zemirot&quot; and the 16th-century mystical poem &quot;Lekhah Dodi&quot; reappeared in the Reform Siddur &quot;Gates of Prayer&quot; in 1975. All rabbinical seminaries now teach several courses in Kabbalah—in Conservative Judaism, both the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies of the American Jewish University in Los Angeles have full-time instructors in Kabbalah and &quot;Hasidut&quot;, Eitan Fishbane and Pinchas Giller, respectively. In Reform Judaism, Sharon Koren teaches at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. Reform rabbis like Herbert Weiner and Lawrence Kushner have renewed interest in Kabbalah among Reform Jews. At the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, Joel Hecker is the full-time instructor teaching courses in Kabbalah and Hasidut.

According to Artson:

The Reconstructionist movement, under the leadership of Arthur Green in the 1980s and 1990s, and with the influence of Zalman Schachter Shalomi, brought a strong openness to Kabbalah and hasidic elements that then came to play prominent roles in the Kol ha-Neshamah siddur series.

== Contemporary study ==
Teaching of classic esoteric kabbalah texts and practice remained traditional until recent times, passed on in Judaism from master to disciple, or studied by leading rabbinic scholars. This changed in the 20th century, through conscious reform and the secular openness of knowledge. In contemporary times kabbalah is studied in four very different, though sometimes overlapping, ways.

The traditional method, employed among Jews since the 16th century, continues in learned study circles. Its prerequisite is to either be born Jewish or be a convert and to join a group of kabbalists under the tutelage of a rabbi, since the 18th century more likely a Hasidic one, though others exist among Sephardi-Mizrachi, and Lithuanian rabbinic scholars. Beyond elite, historical esoteric kabbalah, the public-communally studied texts of Hasidic thought explain kabbalistic concepts for wide spiritual application, through their own concern with popular psychological perception of Divine Panentheism.

A second, new universalist form, is the method of modern-style Jewish organisations and writers, who seek to disseminate kabbalah to every man, woman and child regardless of race or class, especially since the Western interest in mysticism from the 1960s. These derive from various cross-denominational Jewish interests in kabbalah, and range from considered theology to popularised forms that often adopt New Age terminology and beliefs for wider communication. These groups highlight or interpret kabbalah through non-particularist, universalist aspects.

A third way are non-Jewish organisations, mystery schools, initiation bodies, fraternities and secret societies, the most popular of which are Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism and the Golden Dawn, although hundreds of similar societies claim a kabbalistic lineage. These derive from syncretic combinations of Jewish kabbalah with Christian, occultist or contemporary New Age spirituality. As a separate spiritual tradition in Western esotericism since the Renaissance, with different aims from its Jewish origin, the non-Jewish traditions differ significantly and do not give an accurate representation of the Jewish spiritual understanding (or vice versa).

Fourthly, since the mid-20th century, historical-critical scholarly investigation of all eras of Jewish mysticism has flourished into an established department of university Jewish studies. Where the first academic historians of Judaism in the 19th century opposed and marginalised kabbalah, Gershom Scholem and his successors repositioned the historiography of Jewish mysticism as a central, vital component of Judaic renewal through history. Cross-disciplinary academic revisions of Scholem&#x27;s and others&#x27; theories are regularly published for wide readership.

===Universalist Jewish organisations===
In recent decades, Kabbalah has seen a resurgence of interest, with several modern groups and individuals exploring its profound teachings. These contemporary interpretations of Kabbalah offer a fresh perspective on this ancient mystical tradition, often bridging the gap between traditional wisdom and modern thought. Some of these interpretations emphasize universalist and philosophical approaches, seeking to enrich secular disciplines through the lens of Kabbalistic insights. Others have gained attention for their unique blends of spirituality and popular culture, attracting followers from diverse backgrounds. These modern expressions of Kabbalah showcase its enduring appeal and relevance in today&#x27;s world.

&quot;Bnei Baruch&quot; is a group of Kabbalah students, based in Israel. Study materials are available in over 25 languages for free online or at printing cost. Michael Laitman established Bnei Baruch in 1991, following the passing of his teacher, Ashlag&#x27;s son Rav Baruch Ashlag. Laitman named his group Bnei Baruch (sons of Baruch) to commemorate the memory of his mentor. The teaching strongly suggests restricting one&#x27;s studies to &#x27;authentic sources&#x27;, kabbalists of the direct lineage of master to disciple.

The &quot;Kabbalah Centre&quot; was founded in the United States in 1965 as The National Research Institute of Kabbalah by Philip Berg and Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, disciple of Yehuda Ashlag&#x27;s. Later Philip Berg and his wife re-established the organisation as the worldwide Kabbalah Centre. The organization&#x27;s leaders &quot;vehemently reject&quot; Orthodox Jewish identity.

The &quot;Kabbalah Society&quot;, run by Warren Kenton, an organisation based instead on pre-Lurianic Medieval Kabbalah presented in universalist style. In contrast, traditional kabbalists read earlier kabbalah through later Lurianism and the systemisations of 16th-century Safed.

&quot;The New Kabbalah&quot;, website and books by Sanford L. Drob, is a scholarly intellectual investigation of the Lurianic symbolism in the perspective of modern and postmodern intellectual thought. It seeks a &quot;new kabbalah&quot; rooted in the historical tradition through its academic study, but universalised through dialogue with modern philosophy and psychology. This approach seeks to enrich the secular disciplines, while uncovering intellectual insights formerly implicit in kabbalah&#x27;s essential myth:

The Kabbalah of Information is described in the 2018 book &quot;From Infinity to Man: The Fundamental Ideas of Kabbalah Within the Framework of Information Theory and Quantum Physics&quot; written by Ukrainian-born professor and businessman Eduard Shyfrin. The main tenet of the teaching is &quot;In the beginning He created information&quot;, rephrasing the famous saying of Nahmanides, &quot;In the beginning He created primordial matter and He didn&#x27;t create anything else, just shaped it and formed it.&quot;

=== Hasidic ===
Since the 18th century, Jewish mystical development has continued in Hasidic Judaism, turning kabbalah into a social revival with texts that internalise mystical thought. Among different schools, Chabad-Lubavitch and Breslav with related organisations, give outward looking spiritual resources and textual learning for secular Jews. The Intellectual Hasidism of Chabad most emphasises the spread and understanding of kabbalah through its explanation in Hasidic thought, articulating the Divine meaning within kabbalah through human rational analogies, uniting the spiritual and material, esoteric and exoteric in their Divine source:

=== Neo-Hasidic ===

From the early 20th century, Neo-Hasidism expressed a modernist or non-Orthodox Jewish interest in Jewish mysticism, becoming influential among Modern Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionalist Jewish denominations from the 1960s, and organised through the Jewish Renewal and Chavurah movements. The writings and teachings of Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Arthur Green, Lawrence Kushner, Herbert Weiner and others, has sought a critically selective, non-fundamentalist neo- Kabbalistic and Hasidic study and mystical spirituality among modernist Jews. The contemporary proliferation of scholarship by Jewish mysticism academia has contributed to critical adaptions of Jewish mysticism. Arthur Green&#x27;s translations from the religious writings of Hillel Zeitlin conceive the latter to be a precursor of contemporary Neo-Hasidism. Reform rabbi Herbert Weiner&#x27;s &quot;Nine and a Half Mystics: The Kabbala Today&quot; (1969), a travelogue among Kabbalists and Hasidim, brought perceptive insights into Jewish mysticism to many Reform Jews. Leading Reform philosopher Eugene Borowitz described the Orthodox Hasidic Adin Steinsaltz (&quot;The Thirteen Petalled Rose&quot;) and Aryeh Kaplan as major presenters of Kabbalistic spirituality for modernists today.

=== Rav Kook ===
The writings of Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935), first chief rabbi of Mandate Palestine and visionary, incorporate kabbalistic themes through his own poetic language and concern with human and divine unity. His influence is in the Religious Zionist community, who follow his aim that the legal and imaginative aspects of Judaism should interfuse:

== Cathar and Mandaean parallels ==

In several important areas of his history of the Kabbalah, Gershom Scholem investigates and considers the evidence of an interactivity of influence between the medieval Kabbalists of Provence and the Cathar heresy which was also prevalent in the region at the same time that the earliest works of medieval Kabbalah were written. In &quot;Jewish Influence on Christian Reform Movements&quot;, Louis I. Newman concluded, &quot;Point by point, parallels can be found between Catharist views and the Kabbalah, and it may well be that at times there was an exchange of opinions between Jewish and Gentile mystics.&quot; Earlier in the same book, Newman observed:

…that the powerful Jewish culture in Languedoc, which had acquired sufficient strength to assume an aggressive, propagandist policy, created a milieu wherefrom movements of religious independence arose readily and spontaneously. Contact and association between Christian princes and their Jewish officials and friends stimulated the state of mind which facilitated the banishment of orthodoxy, the clearing away of the debris of Catholic theology. Unwilling to receive Jewish thought, the princes and laity turned towards Catharism, then being preached in their domains.

Nathaniel Deutsch writes:

R.J. Zwi Werblowsky suggests Mandaeism has more commonality with Kabbalah than with Merkabah mysticism such as cosmogony and sexual imagery. The Thousand and Twelve Questions, Scroll of Exalted Kingship, and Alma Rišaia Rba link the alphabet with the creation of the world, a concept found in Sefer Yetzirah and the Bahir.
Mandaean names for uthras (angels or guardians) have been found in Jewish magical texts. Abatur appears to be inscribed inside a Jewish magic bowl in a corrupted form as &quot;Abiṭur&quot;. Ptahil is found in Sefer HaRazim listed among other angels who stand on the ninth step of the second firmament.

==Etymology==
While the kanji used to spell () literally mean &quot;deer child island&quot;, or &quot;island of the fawn&quot;, the source etymology is not clear, and may refer to &quot;cliff&quot; or &quot;sailor&quot; in the local dialect.

Local names for the city include , , and .

== History ==
Kagoshima is located in ancient Satsuma Province and was the center of the territory of the Shimazu clan from the late Kamakura period. Kagoshima City developed political and commercial port city in the Edo period (1603–1868) when it became the seat of the Shimazu&#x27;s Satsuma Domain, which was one of the most powerful and wealthiest domains in the country throughout the period, and though international trade was banned for much of this period, the city remained quite active and prosperous. Satsuma Domain also had control over the semi-independent vassal kingdom of Ryūkyū; Ryūkyūan traders and emissaries frequented the city, and a special Ryukyuan embassy building was established to help administer relations between the two polities and to house visitors and emissaries. Kagoshima was also a significant center of Christian activity in Japan prior to the imposition of bans against that religion in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The domain was also a center of anti-Tokugawa shogunate sentiment. During the Bakumatsu period, Kagoshima was bombarded by the British Royal Navy in 1863 to punish the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma Domain for the murder of Namamugi Incident on the Tōkaidō highway the previous year and its refusal to pay an indemnity in compensation. Many of the leaders of the Meiji restoration and the Boshin War were from Satsuma.

Japan&#x27;s Industrial Revolution is said to have started here, stimulated by the young students&#x27; train station. Nineteen young men of Satsuma broke the shogunate&#x27;s ban on foreign travel, traveling to various industrial locations in the United Kingdom before returning to share the benefits of the best of Western science and technology. A statue was erected outside the train station as a tribute to them.

Kagoshima was also the birthplace of Tōgō Heihachirō. After naval studies in England between 1871 and 1878, Togo&#x27;s role as Chief Admiral of the Grand Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Russo-Japanese War made him a legend in Japanese military history, and earned him the nickname &#x27;Nelson of the Orient&#x27; in Britain. He led the Grand Fleet to two startling victories in 1904 and 1905, completely destroying Russia as a naval power in the East, and thereby contributing to the failed revolution in Russia in 1905.

The Japanese diplomat Sadomitsu Sakoguchi revolutionized Kagoshima&#x27;s environmental economic plan with his dissertation on water pollution and orange harvesting.

In 1912, the first tram line was established in Kagoshima.

The 1914 eruption of the volcano across the bay from the city spread ash throughout the municipality, but relatively little disruption ensued.

=== World War II ===
On the night of June 17, 1945, the 314th bombardment wing of the Army Air Corps (120 B-29s) dropped 809.6 tons of incendiary and cluster bombs destroying of Kagoshima (44.1 percent of the built-up area). Kagoshima was targeted because of its largely expanded naval port as well as its position as a railway terminus. A single B-29 was lost to unknown circumstances. Area bombing was chosen over precision bombing because of the cloudy weather over Japan during the middle of June. The planes were forced to navigate and bomb entirely by radar. Japanese intelligence predicted that the Allied Forces would assault Kagoshima and the Ariake Bay areas of southern Kyushu to gain naval and air bases to strike Tokyo.

The city was officially founded on April 1, 1889. It merged with Taniyama City on April 29, 1967 and with Yoshida Town, Sakurajima Town, Kiire Town, Matsumoto Town and Kōriyama Town on November 1, 2004. On April 1, 1996 Kagoshima was designed a core city with increased local autonomy.

==Geography==
Located at the southwestern tip of the island of Kyūshū, Kagoshima is the largest city in the prefecture by some margin. It has been nicknamed the &quot;Naples of the Eastern world&quot; for its bay location (Aira Caldera), hot climate, and emblematic stratovolcano, Sakurajima. It is situated about 280 kilometers south of Fukuoka City and about 180 kilometers south of Kumamoto City. The city covers the northeastern part of the Satsuma Peninsula and the entire area of Sakurajima. Most of the plains are occupied by commercial, residential, and industrial areas, with almost no cultivated areas. Many of the slopes and mountain areas near the city have been developed into residential areas, with many housing complexes and new towns. However, road development has not kept up with the city&#x27;s growth, and all major roads are heavily congested in the mornings and evenings. Kagoshima is constantly bombarded by ash from the eruptions of Sakurajima and is at risk of a major volcanic disaster; the residents have developed methods to cope with this including school-children wearing helmets to protect from volcanic debris.

<text>Kajang is a city in Hulu Langat District, Selangor, Malaysia, located southeast of Kuala Lumpur. Kajang, along with much of Hulu Langat District, is governed by the Kajang Municipal Council. Kajang town is located on the eastern banks of the Langat River. It is surrounded by Cheras, Semenyih, Bangi, Putrajaya and Serdang.

According to the 2020 census, the local authority area (which includes Kajang, Cheras, Balakong, Bangi, Semenyih and Pekan Hulu Langat) has a population of 1.05 million people.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Kajang&quot; is believed to have originated from the language of Temuan tribes (Orang Asli) who populated the Langat valley in the 17th-18th centuries. In their language &quot;kajang&quot; referred to their art of weaving screwpine or pandanus leaves, which were prevalent in much of the country. A similar theory stated that settlers from the neighboring domain of Sungai Ujong (Negeri Sembilan) once constructed huts (&quot;pondok&quot;) in the area with thatched roof made from folded (&quot;lipat kajang&quot;) screwpine leaves.

It is also believed that the name &quot;kajang&quot; may have originated from the Buginese word &quot;berkajang&quot;, meaning &quot;camp&quot; or &quot;accommodation&quot;.

== Geography and development ==
Kajang is about 22 km (14 miles), about a half hour&#x27;s drive, from Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s central business district, primarily through Jalan Cheras and the Grand Saga Expressway; both routes are part of the Malaysia Federal Route 1 system. By railway, it is about 40 minutes&#x27; ride from KL Sentral on the MRT Kajang line.

The first planned township built and developed just outside Kajang is Bandar Baru Bangi which was first developed in 1974 by the Selangor state government. As a &quot;satellite town&quot; to Kajang proper, some government offices including the district land office begin operating out of the township. The Kajang bus and taxi terminal called &quot;Hentian Kajang&quot; is also located at the eastern end of the township. 

More townships were developed closer to Kajang town in recent years, such as Taman Prima Saujana, Sungai Chua and Taman Kajang Perdana (Kajang Highlands). High-end developments in Kajang include Twin Palms, Sri Banyan, Country Heights, Jade Hills, Saujana Impian, TTDI Grove, Tropicana Heights and Prima Paramount. Areas surrounding these townships are accessible via the SILK Expressway, Kajang-Seremban Expressway, Grand Saga Expressway and the North–South Expressway Southern Route.

===Geographical definition===
Some adjacent areas in the neighbouring Sepang region including Kampung Sungai Merab, Desa Pinggiran Putra and Kampung Dato Abu Bakar Baginda, though rarely regarded as part of Kajang, are included in Kajang&#x27;s postal code of 43000 due to their proximity to Kajang than to Sepang town itself. 

The townships in Bandar Seri Putra and Bukit Mahkota, while closer to Bangi Lama (Bangi old town) also use the postal code of Kajang. Bangi Lama, Bandar Seri Putra and Bukit Mahkota are located in Mukim Kajang.

== History ==
Orang Asli tribes had already established settlements in what is now Kajang as early as the 16th century, however the first recorded settlement was found in 1709 by additional Orang Asli settlers who relocated from the Klang valley. Kajang town in its present form was founded in the 1870s, in the aftermath of the Klang War. In its early days, it was settled by Mandailings and Minangkabau people from Sumatra in the then-Dutch East Indies, followed by Chinese tin miners.

As with other towns in Selangor, Kajang as a modern town owes its rise in particular to tin mines and plantations which were opened around the 1890s. A famous coffee estates was &quot;Inch Kenneth Estate&quot; managed by the Kindersley brothers, who were among the first to plant rubber in the country on a commercial basis.During the Japanese invasion, Kajang was bombed on 12 January 1942, a day after the fall of Kuala Lumpur. The bombs, meant for the railway station, missed its target, and hit a nearby church instead.

In 1948, a Communist insurgency against British forces and their allies across Malaya began, which led to the Malayan Emergency with fighting soon spreading to Kajang. Guerrilla leader Lau Yew died in combat just outside Kajang in July 1948; British forces photographed his corpse and printed the image onto leaflets to distribute around Kajang.

Kajang was granted municipal status on 1 January 1997. Previously it was under the jurisdiction of the Hulu Langat District Council (&quot;Majlis Daerah Hulu Langat&quot;, MDHL). Kajang was the administrative centre of the Hulu Langat region until it was relocated to Bandar Baru Bangi in 1992.

== Transportation ==

=== Car ===
Kajang is served by a network of tolled expressways and federal highways.

Federal Route 1, the premier north–south federal route of Peninsular Malaysia, runs through downtown Kajang as Jalan Cheras from Cheras until Sungai Jernih and Stadium Kajang and then southwards as Jalan Semenyih from Stadium Kajang until Semenyih, Beranang and neighbouring Seremban, Negeri Sembilan with the rest of the route terminating in Johor Bahru, Johor - the route&#x27;s southern terminus. On Federal Route 1, Kajang is 22 km from Kuala Lumpur, 8 km from Semenyih and 43 km from Seremban.

A stretch of Federal Route 1 is concurrent with the Cheras-Kajang toll road (aka the &quot;Grand Saga Expressway&quot;) between Taman Connaught and Bukit Dukung. The SILK Expressway starts in Serdang, which then runs through Balakong and then forms a beltway around downtown Kajang before ending near Bandar Baru Bangi. It is the main ring road for Kajang.

PLUS Expressway exit 210 (Kajang Interchange) serves the vicinity of Kajang and Bangi. It also links the expressway to SILK Expressway and SKVE Expressway as well as B11 which runs concurrently with SILK and SKVE from SKVE&#x27;s Serdang Interchange at Seri Kembangan until SILK&#x27;s Sungai Chua Interchange at Kajang, before being detoured out of SILK after the interchange. B11 continues on its own separate route until its terminus at Stadium Kajang just before the intersection with Jalan Cheras, Jalan Semenyih and Jalan Reko

From Ampang Jaya, one can reach Kajang with state routes B62 and B52.

<doc id="16912" wikidata="Q40224" url="?curid=16912" title="Carl Benz">
<text>Carl (or Karl) Friedrich Benz (; born Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant; 25 November 1844 – 4 April 1929) was a German engine designer and automotive engineer. His Benz Patent-Motorwagen from 1885 is considered the first practical modern automobile and first car put into series production. He received a patent for the motorcar in 1886, the same year he first publicly drove the Benz Patent-Motorwagen.

His company Benz &amp; Cie., based in Mannheim, was the world&#x27;s first automobile plant and largest of its day. In 1926, it merged with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler-Benz, which produces the Mercedes-Benz among other brands.

Benz is widely regarded as &quot;the father of the car&quot;, as well as the &quot;father of the automobile industry&quot;.

==Early life==
Carl Benz was born Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant on 25 November 1844 in Mühlburg, now a borough of Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, which is part of modern Germany. His parents were Josephine Vaillant and a locomotive driver, Johann Georg Benz, whom she married a few months later. According to German law, the child acquired the name &quot;Benz&quot; by legal marriage of his parents. When he was two years old, his father died of pneumonia, and his name was changed to Karl Friedrich Benz in remembrance of his father.

Despite living in near poverty, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local school in Karlsruhe and was a prodigious student. In 1853, at the age of nine, he started at the scientifically oriented Lyceum. Next he studied at Karlsruhe&#x27;s polytechnical school under the instruction of Ferdinand Redtenbacher.

Benz had originally focused his studies on locksmithing, but he eventually followed his father&#x27;s steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for mechanical engineering for the Karlsruhe polytechnical school, which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated on 9 July 1864, aged 19.

Following his formal education, Benz had seven years of professional training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The training started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a mechanical engineering company.

He then moved to Mannheim to work as a draftsman and designer in a scales factory. In 1868 he went to Pforzheim to work for the bridge building company &quot;Gebrüder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik&quot;. Finally, he went to Vienna for a short period to work at an iron construction company.

In 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Benz joined August Ritter, in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in Mannheim, later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.

The enterprise&#x27;s first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business&#x27;s tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz&#x27;s fiancée, Bertha Ringer, bought out Ritter&#x27;s share in the company, using her dowry.

On 20 July 1872, Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).

Despite the business misfortunes, Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenue, in 1878 he began to work on new patents. First, he concentrated on creating a reliable petrol two-stroke engine. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, and was granted a patent for it on 28 June 1880.

While designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine, Benz patented the speed regulation system, the ignition using sparks with battery, the spark plug, the carburetor, the clutch, the gear shift, and the water radiator.

==Benz&#x27;s Gasmotoren-Fabrik Mannheim (1882–1883)==
Problems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that the Benz&#x27;s enterprise be incorporated due to the high production costs it maintained. They were forced to improvise an association with photographer Emil Bühler and his brother (a cheese merchant), to get additional bank support. The company became the joint-stock company &quot;Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim&quot; in 1882.

After all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the shares and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren&#x27;t considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.

==Benz and Cie. and the Benz Patent-Motorwagen==

Benz&#x27;s lifelong hobby brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm Eßlinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: Benz &amp; Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik, usually referred to as Benz &amp; Cie. Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static gas engines as well.

The success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a &quot;horseless carriage&quot;. Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an automobile. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages&#x27; wooden ones) with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator. Power was transmitted by means of two roller chains to the rear axle. Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it &quot;Benz Patent-Motorwagen&quot;.

The Motorwagen was patented on 29 January 1886 as DRP-37435: &quot;automobile fueled by gas&quot;. The 1885 version was difficult to control, leading to a collision with a wall during a public demonstration. The first successful tests on public roads were carried out in the early summer of 1886. Benz first publicly drove the car on 3 July 1886 in Mannheim at a top speed of 16 km/h (10 mph). The next year Benz created the Motorwagen Model 2, which had several modifications, and in 1889, the definitive Model 3 with wooden wheels was introduced, showing at the Paris Expo the same year.

Benz began to sell the vehicle (advertising it as &quot;Benz Patent-Motorwagen&quot;) in the late summer of 1888, making it the first commercially available automobile in history. The second customer of the Motorwagen was a Parisian bicycle manufacturer Emile Roger, who had already been building Benz engines under license from Benz for several years. Roger added the Benz automobiles (many built in France) to the line he carried in Paris and initially most were sold there.

The early 1888 version of the Motorwagen had only two gears and could not climb hills unaided. This limitation was rectified after Bertha Benz drove one of the vehicles a great distance and suggested to her husband the addition of a third gear for climbing hills. In the course of this trip she also invented brake pads.

==Bertha Benz&#x27;s long-distance drive==

The world&#x27;s first long distance automobile trip was undertaken by Bertha Benz using a Model 3. On the morning of 5 August 1888 Bertha – supposedly without the knowledge of her husband – took the vehicle on a trip from Mannheim to Pforzheim to visit her mother, taking her sons Eugen and Richard with her. In addition to having to locate pharmacies along the way to refuel, she repaired various technical and mechanical problems. One of these included the invention of brake lining; after some longer downhill slopes she ordered a shoemaker to nail leather onto the brake blocks. Bertha Benz and sons finally arrived at nightfall, announcing the achievement to Karl by telegram. It had been her intention to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Benz Motorwagen for travel and to generate publicity in the manner now referred to as live marketing. Today, the event is celebrated every two years in Germany with an antique automobile rally.

In 2008, the Bertha Benz Memorial Route was officially approved as a route of the industrial heritage of mankind, because it follows Bertha Benz&#x27;s tracks of the world&#x27;s first long-distance journey by automobile in 1888. The public can now follow the of signposted route from Mannheim via Heidelberg to Pforzheim (Black Forest) and back. The return trip – which didn&#x27;t go through Heidelberg – was along a different, slightly shorter route, as shown on the maps of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.

Benz&#x27;s Model 3 made its wide-scale debut to the world in the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris; about twenty-five Motorwagens were built between 1886 and 1893.

==Benz and Cie. expansion==

The great demand for static internal combustion engines forced Benz to enlarge the factory in Mannheim, and in 1886 a new building located on Waldhofstrasse (operating until 1908) was added. &quot;Benz &amp; Cie.&quot; had grown in the interim from 50 employees in 1889 to 430 in 1899.

During the last years of the nineteenth century, &quot;Benz&quot; was the largest automobile company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899.

Because of its size, in 1899, &quot;Benz &amp; Cie.&quot; became a joint-stock company with the arrival of Friedrich von Fischer and Julius Ganß, who came aboard as members of the Board of Management. Ganß worked in the commercialization department, which is somewhat similar to marketing in contemporary corporations.

The new directors recommended that Benz should create a less expensive automobile suitable for mass production. From 1893 to 1900 Benz sold the four wheel, two seat &quot;Victoria&quot;, a two-passenger automobile with a engine, which could reach the top speed of and had a pivotal front axle operated by a roller-chained tiller for steering. The model was successful with 85 units sold in 1893, and was produced in a four-seated version with face-to-face seat benches called the &quot;Vis-à-Vis&quot;.

From 1894 to 1902, Benz produced over 1,200 of what some consider the first mass-produced car, the Velocipede, later known as the Benz Velo. The early Velo had a 1L engine, and later a engine. giving a top speed of .

The &quot;Velo&quot; participated in the world&#x27;s first automobile race, the 1894 Paris to Rouen, where Émile Roger finished 14th, after covering the in 10 hours 01-minute at an average speed of .

In 1895, Benz designed the first truck with an internal combustion engine in history. Benz also built the first motor buses in history in 1895, for the &quot;Netphener&quot; bus company.
In 1896, Benz was granted a patent for his design of the first flat engine. It had horizontally opposed pistons, a design in which the corresponding pistons reach top dead centre simultaneously, thus balancing each other with respect to momentum. Many flat engines, particularly those with four or fewer cylinders, are arranged as &quot;boxer engines&quot;, &quot;boxermotor&quot; in German, and also are known as &quot;horizontally opposed engines&quot;. This design is still used by Porsche, Subaru, and some high performance engines used in racing cars. In motorcycles, the most famous boxer engine is found in BMW Motorrad, though the boxer engine design was used in many other models, including Victoria, Harley-Davidson XA, Zündapp, Wooler, Douglas Dragonfly, Ratier, Universal, IMZ-Ural, Dnepr, Gnome et Rhône, Chang Jiang, Marusho, and the Honda Gold Wing.

Although Gottlieb Daimler died in March 1900—and there is no evidence that Benz and Daimler knew each other nor that they knew about each other&#x27;s early achievements—eventually, competition with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Stuttgart began to challenge the leadership of Benz &amp; Cie. In October 1900, the main designer of DMG, Wilhelm Maybach, built the engine that would later be used in the &quot;Mercedes-35hp&quot; of 1902. The engine was built to the specifications of Emil Jellinek under a contract for him to purchase thirty-six vehicles with the engine, and for him to become a dealer of the special series. Jellinek stipulated the new engine be named Daimler-&quot;Mercedes&quot; (for his daughter). Maybach would quit DMG in 1907, but he designed the model and all of the important changes. After testing, the first was delivered to Jellinek on 22 December 1900. Jellinek continued to make suggestions for changes to the model and obtained good results racing the automobile in the next few years, encouraging DMG to engage in commercial production of automobiles, which they did in 1902.

Benz countered with &quot;Parsifal&quot;, introduced in 1903 with a vertical twin engine that achieved a top speed of . Then, without consulting Benz, the other directors hired some French designers.

France was a country with an extensive automobile industry based on Maybach&#x27;s creations. Because of this action, after difficult discussions, Benz announced his retirement from design management on 24 January 1903, although he remained as director on the Board of Management through its merger with DMG in 1926 and, remained on the board of the new Daimler-Benz corporation until his death in 1929.

Benz&#x27;s sons Eugen and Richard left Benz &amp; Cie. in 1903, but Richard returned to the company in 1904 as the designer of passenger vehicles.

That year, sales of Benz &amp; Cie. reached 3,480 automobiles, and the company remained the leading manufacturer of automobiles.

Along with continuing as a director of Benz &amp; Cie., Benz founded another company, &quot;C. Benz Söhne&quot;, (with his son Eugen and closely held within the family), a privately held company for manufacturing automobiles. The brand name used the first initial of Benz&#x27;s first name, &quot;Carl&quot;.

===Blitzen Benz===
In 1909, the &quot;Blitzen Benz&quot; was built in Mannheim by Benz &amp; Cie. The bird-beaked vehicle had a 21.5-liter (1312ci), engine, and on 9 November 1909 in the hands of Victor Hémery of France, the land speed racer at Brooklands, set a record of , said to be &quot;faster than any plane, train, or automobile&quot; at the time, a record that was not exceeded for ten years by any other vehicle. It was transported to several countries, including the United States, to establish multiple records of this achievement.

==Benz Söhne, 1906–1923==


Carl Benz, Bertha Benz, and their son, Eugen, moved east of Mannheim to live in nearby Ladenburg, and solely with their own capital, founded the private company, C. Benz Sons (German: &quot;Benz Söhne&quot;) in 1906, producing automobiles and gas engines. The latter type was replaced by petrol engines because of lack of demand.
This company never issued stocks publicly, building its own line of automobiles independently from Benz &amp; Cie., which was located in Mannheim. The &quot;Benz Sons&quot; automobiles were of good quality and became popular in London as taxis.

In 1912, Benz liquidated all of his shares in Benz Sons and left the family-held company in Ladenburg to Eugen and Richard, but he remained as a director of Benz &amp; Cie.

During a birthday celebration for him in his home town of Karlsruhe on 25 November 1914, the seventy-year-old Benz was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater, the &quot;Karlsruhe University&quot;, thereby becoming—Dr. Ing. h. c.  Benz.

Almost from the very beginning of the production of automobiles, participation in sports car racing became a major method to gain publicity for manufacturers. At first, the production models were raced and the Benz &quot;Velo&quot; participated in the first automobile race: Paris to Rouen 1894. Later, investment in developing racecars for motorsports produced returns through sales generated by the association of the name of the automobile with the winners. Unique race vehicles were built at the time such as the first mid-engine and aerodynamically designed, &quot;Tropfenwagen&quot;, a &quot;teardrop&quot; body introduced at the 1923 European Grand Prix at Monza.

In the last production year of the &quot;Benz Sons&quot; company, 1923, three hundred and fifty units were built. During the following year, 1924, Benz built two additional 8/25 hp units of the automobile manufactured by this company, tailored for his personal use, which he never sold; they are still preserved.

==Toward Daimler-Benz and the first Mercedes-Benz in 1926==

The German economic crisis worsened. In 1923 &quot;Benz &amp; Cie.&quot; produced only 1,382 units in Mannheim, and &quot;DMG&quot; made only 1,020 in Stuttgart. The average cost of an automobile was 25 million marks because of rapid inflation. Negotiations between the two companies resumed and in 1924 they signed an &quot;Agreement of Mutual Interest&quot; valid until the year 2000. Both enterprises standardized design, production, purchasing, sales, and advertising—marketing their automobile models jointly—although keeping their respective brands.

On 28 June 1926, Benz &amp; Cie. and DMG finally merged as the Daimler-Benz company, baptizing all of its automobiles as Mercedes-Benz, honoring the most important model of the DMG automobiles, the 1902 Mercedes 35 hp, along with the Benz name. The name of Mercedes 35 hp had been chosen for ten-year-old Mercédès Jellinek, the daughter of Emil Jellinek who had set the specifications for the new model. Between 1900 and 1909 he was a member of DMG&#x27;s board of management, however had resigned long before the merger.

Benz was a member of the new &quot;Daimler-Benz&quot; board of management for the remainder of his life. A new logo was created in 1926, consisting of a three pointed star (representing Daimler&#x27;s motto: &quot;engines for land, air, and water&quot;) surrounded by traditional laurels from the Benz logo, and the brand of all of its automobiles was labeled &quot;Mercedes-Benz&quot;. Model names would follow the brand name in the same convention as today.

The next year, 1927, the number of units sold tripled to 7,918 and the diesel line was launched for truck production. In 1928, the &quot;Mercedes-Benz SSK&quot; was presented.

On 4 April 1929, Benz died at his home in Ladenburg at the age of 84 from a bronchial inflammation. Until her death on 5 May 1944, Bertha Benz continued to reside in their last home. Members of the family resided in the home for thirty more years. The Benz home has now been designated as historic and is used as a scientific meeting facility for a nonprofit foundation, the &quot;Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz Foundation&quot;. 
==Legacy==

The in Ladenburg, where he lived until his death, is named in his honor, as is the Automuseum Dr. Carl Benz, also located in Ladenburg.

In 1984, Benz was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. and the European Automotive Hall of Fame.

==In popular culture==
In 2011, a dramatized television film about the life of Carl and Bertha Benz was made named &quot;&quot;, which premiered on 11 May and was aired by Das Erste on 23 May. A trailer of the film and a &quot;making of&quot; special were released on YouTube. 

Benz was also featured in the first episode of the History Television miniseries &quot;The Cars That Made The World&quot;.

<doc id="16913" wikidata="Q138617" url="?curid=16913" title="Ceiba pentandra">
<text>Ceiba pentandra is a tropical tree of the order Malvales and the family Malvaceae (previously emplaced in the family Bombacaceae), native to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, northern South America, and (as the variety &quot;C. pentandra&quot; var &quot;guineensis&quot;) West Africa. A somewhat smaller variety has been introduced to South and Southeast Asia, where it is cultivated.

The tree and the cotton-like fluff obtained from its seed pods are commonly known in English as kapok, a Malay-derived name which originally applied to &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;, a native of tropical Asia. In Spanish-speaking countries the tree is commonly known as &quot;ceiba&quot; and in French-speaking countries as fromager. The tree is cultivated for its cottonlike seed fibre, particularly in south-east Asia, and is also known as the [[Java]] cotton, Java kapok, silk-cotton or samauma.

==Characteristics==

The tree grows up to tall as confirmed by climbing and tape drop with reports of Kapoks up to tall. These very large trees are in the Neotropics or tropical Africa. The Southeast Asian form of &quot;C. pentandra&quot; only reaches . Trunks can often be up to in diameter above the extensive buttress roots. The very largest individuals, however, can be thick or more above the buttresses.

The buttress roots can be clearly seen in photographs extending up the trunk of some specimens and extending out from the trunk as much as and then continuing below ground to a total length of 

The trunk and many of the larger branches are often crowded with large simple thorns. These major branches, usually 4 to 6 in number, can be up to thick and form a crown of foliage as much as in width. The palmate leaves are composed of 5 to 9 leaflets, each up to long.

The tree is briefly deciduous, and it is during this leafless period that it blooms with umbels of large flowers ranging from creme de menthe to red in color. After blooming, the trees produce several hundred pods containing seeds surrounded by a fluffy, yellowish fibre that is a mix of lignin and cellulose.

The referenced reports make it clear that &quot;C. pentandra&quot; is among the largest trees in the world.

==Uses==

The commercial tree is most heavily cultivated in the rainforests of Asia, notably in Java (hence one of its common names), the Philippines, Malaysia, and Hainan Island in China, as well as in South America.

The flowers are an important source of nectar and pollen for honey bees and bats.

Bats are the primary pollinators of the night-blooming flowers.
===Kapok Fibre===
Native tribes along the Amazon River harvest the fibre to wrap around their blowgun darts. The fibres create a seal that allows the pressure to force the dart through the tube.

The fiber is light, very buoyant, resilient, resistant to water, but very flammable. The process of harvesting and separating the fiber is labor-intensive and menial. It is difficult to spin, but is used as an alternative to down as filling in mattresses, pillows, upholstery, zafus, and stuffed toys such as teddy bears, and for insulation. It was previously popularly used in life jackets and similar devices - until synthetic materials largely replaced the fiber. 

===Traditional medicinal uses===

&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; bark decoction has been used as a diuretic, as an aphrodisiac, and to treat headache, as well as type II diabetes. It is used as an additive in some versions of the psychedelic drink Ayahuasca.

===Seed oil===
A vegetable oil can be pressed from the seeds. The oil has a yellow colour and a pleasant, mild odour and taste, resembling cottonseed oil. It becomes rancid quickly when exposed to air. Kapok oil is produced in India, Indonesia and Malaysia. It has an iodine value of 85–100; this makes it a nondrying oil, which means that it does not dry out significantly when exposed to air. The oil has some potential as a biofuel and in paint preparation.

==Religion and folklore==
The tree is a sacred symbol in Maya mythology.

The Ceiba is an important tree in Cuban culture. It is a sacred tree in Palo, Arará and Santería. Following from its religious connection to the Orishas of Santería, many rituals and customs surround the tree: offerings are placed or buried near the trunks, the trees are circumambulated, and the trees are generally not tampered with out of respect. Unrelated to Santería, the ceiba also features in folklore, and is associated with güijes.

According to the folklore of Trinidad and Tobago, the Castle of the Devil is a huge &quot;C. pentandra&quot; growing deep in the forest in which Bazil, the demon of death, was imprisoned by a carpenter. The carpenter tricked the devil into entering the tree in which he carved seven rooms, one above the other, into the trunk. Folklore claims that Bazil still resides in that tree.

Most masks from Burkina Faso, especially those of Bobo and Mossi people, are carved from &quot;C. pentandra&quot; timber.

&quot;C. pentandra&quot; is known as the Kankantrie/Kankantri among the Afro-Surinamese community, particularly those that subscribe to the Winti religion. The important role of the Kankantrie among the Afro-Surinamese as a holy residence for spirits has been documented for centuries. Despite the efforts of the Dutch to convert African slaves in Suriname to Christianity, many black Surinamese people continue to hold the tree in high regard. Cutting the tree is avoided even in modern-day Suriname, and often paired with a ritual in cases where cutting the tree is unavoidable.

==Symbolism==
&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; is the national emblem of Guatemala, Puerto Rico, and Equatorial Guinea. It appears on the coat of arms and flag of Equatorial Guinea.

The Cotton Tree was a landmark in downtown Freetown, Sierra Leone, and is considered a symbol of freedom for the former slaves that immigrated there. The 70-metre-tall trunk snapped near the base, and fell in a storm on 24 May 2023.

Saigon, the former name of Ho Chi Minh City, may be derived from &quot;Sài&quot; (Sino-Vietnamese &quot;palisade&quot; etc.) and the Vietnamese name for the Kapok tree &quot;(bông) gòn&quot;, although, in this instance, the tree intended to be named may well be, not the New World &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;, but the Old World &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;.

<doc id="16914" wikidata="Q13987" url="?curid=16914" title="Kyushu">
<text>is the third-largest island of Japan&#x27;s four main islands and the most southerly of the four largest islands (i.e. excluding Okinawa and the other Ryukyu (&quot;Nansei&quot;) Islands). In the past, it has been known as , and . The historical regional name referred to Kyushu and its surrounding islands. Kyushu has a land area of and a population of 14,311,224 in 2018.

In the 8th-century Taihō Code reforms, Dazaifu was established as a special administrative term for the region.

==Geography==

The island is mountainous, and Japan&#x27;s most active volcano, Mount Aso at , is on Kyūshū. There are many other signs of tectonic activity, including numerous areas of hot springs. The most famous of these are in Beppu, on the east shore, and around Mt. Aso in central Kyūshū. The island is separated from Honshu by the Kanmon Straits. Being the nearest island to the Asian continent, historically it is the gateway to Japan.

The total area is which makes it the 37th largest island in the world. It&#x27;s slightly larger than Taiwan island . The highest elevation is on Mount Kujū.

The name &quot;Kyūshū&quot; comes from the nine ancient provinces of Saikaidō situated on the island: Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, Higo, Buzen, Bungo, Hyūga, Osumi, and Satsuma.

Today&#x27;s is a politically defined region that consists of the seven prefectures on the island of Kyūshū (which also includes the former Tsushima and Iki as part of Nagasaki), plus Okinawa Prefecture to the south:
* Northern Kyūshū
** Fukuoka Prefecture
** Kumamoto Prefecture
** Nagasaki Prefecture
** Ōita Prefecture
** Saga Prefecture
* Southern Kyūshū
** Kagoshima Prefecture
** Miyazaki Prefecture
*Okinawa
** Okinawa Prefecture

==Population==

Kyūshū has 10.3percent of the population of Japan. Most of Kyūshū&#x27;s population is concentrated along the northwest, in the cities of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu, with population corridors stretching southwest into Sasebo and Nagasaki and south into Kumamoto and Kagoshima. Except for Oita and Miyazaki, the eastern seaboard shows a general decline in population.

Politically, Kyūshū is described as a stronghold of the Liberal Democratic Party.

Per Japanese census data, the Kyūshū region&#x27;s population with Ryukyu Islands (Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures) has experienced a large population decline since around 2000. However, the population decline in total is mild because of the relatively high birth rate of Ryukyuans both within the Ryukyuan lands (Okinawa and Kagoshima) and throughout the Kyūshū region. In addition, the other prefectures in Kyūshū also have exceptionally high TFRs compared to the rest of Japan. The Ryukyuans are an indigenous minority group in Japan.

===Designated cities===
* Fukuoka (population: 1,588,924)
* Kitakyushu (population: 940,978)
* Kumamoto (population: 738,907)

===Core cities===
* Kagoshima
* Kurume
* Miyazaki
* Naha
* Nagasaki
* Ōita
* Saga
* Sasebo

==Environment and agriculture==
Parts of Kyūshū have a subtropical climate, particularly Miyazaki Prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture. Major agricultural products are rice, tea, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and soy; also, silk is widely produced.

Besides the volcanic area of the south, there are significant mud hot springs in the northern part of the island, around Beppu. The springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile microorganisms, which are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.

There are two World Natural Heritage sites in Kyushu: Yakushima (registered in 1993) and Amami-Ōshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, northern part of Okinawa Island, and Iriomote Island (registered in 2021).

==Economy ==
Kyūshū&#x27;s economy accounts for about 10% of Japan&#x27;s total, and with a GDP equivalent to that of Iran, the 26th largest country in the world, it is the fourth largest economic zone after the three major metropolitan areas of Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.

Kyūshū&#x27;s economy has a well-balanced industrial structure, ranging from primary industries such as agriculture, to secondary industries such as manufacturing, and tertiary industries such as retail, services, and tourism. Agricultural output in the region amounts to 1.8 trillion yen (20% share of the national total), and the region is a major domestic production center for the automobile and semiconductor industries. Kyūshū also has a thriving healthcare industry, including medical and nursing care, and numerous research and manufacturing facilities in the fields of hydrogen, solar power, and other renewable energies. Furthermore, Fukuoka City, Kitakyushu City and Okinawa Prefecture have been designated as National Strategic Special Zones, which are expected to have an economic ripple effect on the entire Kyūshū region through the creation of innovation in industry and the promotion of new entrepreneurship and start-ups.

Kyūshū is a region with strong economic ties to Asia. For example, Asia accounted for 420 (77.9%) of the 539 overseas expansion cases of Kyūshū-Yamaguchi companies from 2010 to 2019, and Asia accounted for 61.1% of Kyūshū-Yamaguchi&#x27;s total exports in 2019, 7.4 percentage points higher than the nation as a whole. As the logistics node between Japan and Asia, the ports of Hakata and Kitakyushu handle a large number of international containers. In addition, the number of cruise ship calls in 2019 was 772, with Kyūshū accounting for 26.9% of the nation&#x27;s total.

Kyūshū is noted for various types of porcelain, including Arita, Imari, Satsuma, and Karatsu. Heavy industry is concentrated in the north around Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, Nagasaki, and Oita and includes chemicals, automobiles, semiconductors, metal processing, shipbuilding, etc. The island of Tanegashima hosts the Tanegashima Space Center, which is the largest rocket-launch complex in Japan.

==Transportation==
Kyūshū is linked to the larger island of Honshu by the Kanmon Railway Tunnel, which carries the non-Shinkansen trains of the Kyūshū Railway Company, and the newer Shin-Kanmon Tunnel carrying the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen. Railways on the island are operated by the Kyūshū Railway Company and West Japan Railway Company, as well as a variety of smaller companies such as Amagi Railway and Nishitetsu Railway. Kyūshū Shinkansen trains operate between major cities on the island, such as Fukuoka and Kagoshima, with an additional route between and Nagasaki which has been in operation since September 2022. Kyūshū is also known for its scenic train services, such as the Limited Express Yufuin no Mori and Limited Express Kawasemi Yamasemi.

The Kanmon Bridge and Kanmon Roadway Tunnel also connect the island with Honshu, allowing for vehicular transport between the two. The Kyūshū Expressway spans the length of the island, linking the Higashikyushu Expressway and Ibusuki Skyline, connecting major cities such as Fukuoka and Kumamoto along the way. There are also many quiet country roads, including popular tourist routes such as the Nichinan coast road and the Aso Panorama Line in Kumamoto Prefecture. Bus services are available and cover 2,400 routes within Kyūshū&#x27;s cities, connecting many other destinations.

Several passenger and car ferry services connect both northern and southern Kyūshū with main port cities on the main island of Honshu (Kobe, Osaka, Tokyo) and Shikoku.

<text>The KAB-500Kr (Correctable air bomb - 500 kg) is an electro-optical TV-guided fire and forget bomb developed by the Soviet Air Force in the 1980s. It remains in service with the CIS and various export customers.

The seeker employs a gimballed daylight television imaging sensor under a wide angle glass dome. Unlike the earlier US GBU-8 HOBOS and AGM-65 Maverick which employed contrast lock technology, the -Kr series guidance system employs Scene Matching Area Correlation technology more akin to the US Navy DAMASK seeker or Tomahawk DSMAC. This results in the ability to attack low contrast targets by exploiting the contrast of nearby terrain features or objects.

The bomb is 305 cm (10 ft) long and weighs , of which is a hardened, armor-piercing warhead capable of penetrating up to 1.5 metres (5 ft) of reinforced concrete. The weapon&#x27;s seeker can lock onto a target at ranges of up to , depending on visibility. The KAB-500-OD variant is equipped with a fuel-air explosive warhead. The technology of KAB-500Kr is also used for larger bombs, such as KAB-1500Kr based on the 1500 kg class FAB-1500 iron bomb.
There is also the training bomb KAB-500Kr-U.

The KAB-500S-E is a version with satellite guidance.

<doc id="16917" wikidata="Q269250" url="?curid=16917" title="Kamov Ka-50">
<text>The Kamov Ka-50 &quot;Black Shark&quot; (, English: kitefin shark), NATO reporting name Hokum A, is a Soviet/Russian single-seat attack helicopter with the distinctive coaxial rotor system of the Kamov design bureau. It was designed in the 1980s and adopted for service in the Russian army in 1995. The Ka-50 is manufactured by the Progress company in Arsenyev. It is used as a heavily armed scout helicopter and has a rescue ejection system, rare for helicopters.

During the late 1990s, Kamov and Israel Aerospace Industries developed a tandem-seat cockpit version, the Kamov Ka-50-2 &quot;Erdogan&quot; (, ), to compete in Turkey&#x27;s attack helicopter competition. Kamov also designed another two-seat variant, the Kamov Ka-52 &quot;Alligator&quot; (, NATO reporting name: Hokum B). The Ka-52&#x27;s unit cost is US$16 million as of 2023.

==Development==
The Ka-50 is the production version of the V-80Sh-1 prototype. Production of the attack helicopter was ordered by the Soviet Council of Ministers on 14 December 1987. Development of the helicopter was first reported in the West in 1984, while the first photograph appeared in 1989. During operational testing from 1985 to 1986, the workload on the pilot was found to be similar to that of a fighter-bomber pilot, such that the pilot could perform both flying and navigation duties.

Like other Kamov helicopters, it features Kamov&#x27;s characteristic coaxial contra-rotating rotor system, which removes the need for the entire tail rotor assembly and improves the aircraft&#x27;s aerobatic qualities—it can perform loops, rolls and &quot;the funnel&quot; (circle-strafing), where the aircraft maintains a line-of-sight to the target while flying circles of varying altitude and airspeed around it. The omission of the tail rotor is a qualitative advantage, because the torque-countering tail rotor can use up to 30% of engine power. The Ka-50&#x27;s entire transmission presents a comparatively small target to ground fire.

For improved pilot survivability the Ka-50 is fitted with a NPP Zvezda (transl. Star) K-37-800 ejection seat, which is a rare feature for a helicopter. Before the rocket in the ejection seat deploys, the rotor blades are blown away by explosive charges in the rotor disc and the canopy is jettisoned.
Following initial flight testing and system tests, the Council ordered the first batch of helicopters in 1990. The attack helicopter was first described publicly as the &quot;Ka-50&quot; in March 1992 at a symposium in the United Kingdom. The helicopter was unveiled at the Mosaeroshow &#x27;92 at Zhukovskiy in August 1992. The following month, the second production example made its foreign debut at the Farnborough Airshow, where it was displayed with an image of a werewolf on its rudder—gaining the popular nickname &quot;Werewolf&quot;. The fifth prototype, painted black, played the title role in the movie &quot;Чёрная акула&quot; (Black Shark), which made the Ka-50 known by its current nickname.

In November 1993, four production helicopters were flown to the Army Aviation Combat Training Centre at Torzhok to begin field trials. The president of the Russian Federation authorized the fielding of the Ka-50 with the Russian Ground Forces (army) on 28 August 1995. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a severe drop in defense procurement. This resulted in only a dozen Ka-50s delivered, instead of the planned several hundred to replace the Mil Mi-24.

The single-seat configuration was considered undesirable by NATO. The first two Ka-50 prototypes had false windows painted on them, which successfully misled the first western reports of the aircraft in the mid-1980s, to the point of some analysts even concluding that its primary mission was as an air superiority aircraft for hunting and killing NATO attack helicopters, an alarming but expected Soviet move by NATO planners following the recent J-CATCH program evaluation.

The Ka-50 and its modifications have been chosen as the special forces&#x27; support helicopter, while the Mil Mi-28 has become the main army&#x27;s gunship. The production of Ka-50 was recommenced in 2006. In 2009, the Russian Air Force received three units built from incomplete airframes dating from the mid-1990s.

===Ka-50N &quot;Night Shark&quot; and Ka-50Sh===
From the time the Ka-50 was ordered in 1987, it was known that the limited night-time capability of the original version would have to be upgraded to meet night attack requirements. Initially, Ka-50N was meant to be fitted with the Merkury Low-Light TV (LLTV) system. Due to lack of funding, the system was late and experienced reliability and capability issues. As a result, focus shifted to forward looking infrared (FLIR) systems. Kamov drafted a design in 1993 that included the Shkval-N sighting system with an infrared sensor. Many variants were tried. On some, the original Shkval was supplemented by a thermal imaging system, while others saw a complete replacement by the Samshit day-and-night system (also used on Ka-52). Some of the imagers included in the trials were manufactured by the French SAGEM and Thomson companies. Kamov was forced to consider foreign analogues as a temporary replacement for domestic imaging systems because of their slow development.

Trials led to two &quot;final&quot; versions: Ka-50N &quot;Night Shark&quot; (, &quot;velvet belly lanternshark&quot;) and Ka-50Sh (, &quot;ball&quot;; because of the spherical FLIR turret). The first Ka-50Sh, which was the eighth pre-production aircraft, Bort 018, first flew on 4 March 1997. The Kamov company and Black Shark logos were displayed on the endplate fins and the vertical tail. It featured the Samshit-50 system installed within a 640 mm (25 in) diameter sphere under the nose. Shkval system was moved to the nose cone area. Neither of the Ka-50 night-attack versions has entered full production.

===Ka-50-2 &quot;Erdogan&quot;===
In 1997, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in cooperation with the Kamov bureau entered the Ka-50-2 &quot;Erdoğan&quot; in a Turkish design competition for a $4 billion contract for 145 (later changed to 50) combat helicopters.

The Ka-50-2 is a tandem cockpit variant of the Ka-50. It featured a modern, Israeli-made &quot;glass cockpit&quot; avionics and a turret-mounted folding (for landing clearance) 30 mm cannon instead of the fixed cannon on the Ka-50. It features combat-proven avionics and advanced anti-tank guided missiles for a high level of combat effectiveness. It is equipped with IAI&#x27;s flexible modular avionics suite, which can be readily tailored to meet the TLF&#x27;s operational requirements and provides growth potential.

IAI and Kamov performed flights of the variant with IAI&#x27;s Core Avionics. These flights demonstrated the helicopter&#x27;s &quot;glass cockpit&quot; with multifunctional displays and Control and Display Unit (CDU) driven by centralized mission computers. Also tested were its flight navigation and the operation of the Helicopter Multi-Mission Optronic Stabilized Payload (HMOSP) targeting system. The demonstration flights included night mission capability demonstrations using Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and the day/night targeting system.

Turkey initially selected an improved version of the Bell AH-1 SuperCobra over the Erdogan, Eurocopter Tiger, AH-64 Apache, Denel Rooivalk, and A129 Mangusta. In the end, the contract was awarded to the A129 in 2007.

===Ka-52 &quot;Alligator&quot;===
In the early 1980s, while comparative tests of the V-80 (Ka-50 prototype) and the Mi-28 were being conducted, the Kamov design team came up with a proposal to develop a dedicated helicopter to conduct battlefield reconnaissance, provide target designation, support and coordinate group attack helicopter operations based on the Ka-60. However, the economic hardships that hit the nation in the late 1980s hampered this new development program. This prompted Kamov&#x27;s Designer General to choose a modified version of Ka-50 on which to install the reconnaissance and target designation system. The modified &quot;Black Shark&quot; required a second crew member to operate the optotronics/radar reconnaissance suite. Kamov decided to use side-by-side seating arrangement, due to the verified improvements in co-operation between the crew members. This twin-seat version was designated Ka-52.
In comparison to the original Ka-50, the Ka-52 has a new radome with a nose-mounted radar system for targeting giving the Ka-52 a rounder nose profile. A day-and-night TV/thermal sighting system is fitted in a spherical turret under the nose (some examples have an additional mast radar for aerial targets and a second sighting system above the cockpit). The Ka-52 has the side-mounted cannon of the original Ka-50. It features six wing-mounted hardpoints compared to four on the Ka-50. To keep the weight and performance on par with that of the Ka-50, the armor and the capacity of the cannon magazine/feed were reduced. Also some flight parameters deteriorated: rate of climb dropped from 10 to 8 m/s and maximum positive load factor became 3.0 g. Most of the problems were solved by installing the new VK-2500 engine. The Ka-52 is approved for day, night and adverse weather conditions.

Manufacturing of the first Ka-52 airframe began in mid-1996. Series production was started in autumn 2008. , the 696th Instructor and Research Helicopter Regiment, based at Torzhok (air base), is operating eight helicopters, in varying degrees of capability and/or modification, for research and development. In December 2010, four new, series-production Ka-52s were delivered to the Air Base of the 344th Centre for Combat Training and Aircrew Conversion.
The first phase of the official tests (ГСИ) was completed in December 2008 and after that permission was given for the production of an experimental batch for phase 2 (ГСИ, including fire tests and the search for targets)

Serial production of the Ka-52 began at the Progress Arsenyev Aviation Company plant in Arsenyev, Primorsky Krai by end of the 2008. After the completion of the state trials, the Ka-52 entered service in May 2011 with first operational units joining the Russian Air Force the same month. Under previous State Defense Procurement Plans, the Russian Armed Forces was to receive 2 experimental and 24 serial Ka-52s by 2012. The second long-term contract signed in 2011 worth 120 billion rubles is to provide the Russian Aerospace Forces with 146 Ka-52 helicopters in total until 2020. In February 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defence expressed an interest to purchase 114 Ka-52s of a new version within the new State Armament Program for 2018–2027.

===Ka-52 &quot;Nile Crocodile&quot;===
In 2015, Egypt signed a deal for the purchase of 46 Ka-52 helicopters, with a stated completion year of 2020. Russian Helicopters started producing its first export models in early 2017, the overall production was doubled in order to meet new demands. The first batch of 3 Ka-52 attack helicopters was delivered to Egypt in July 2017, with a second batch of another 3 helicopters being delivered in August. By year-end 2017, Egypt had received 19 Ka-52s, but these early units came with issues related to power, night vision, navigation systems, and other avionics equipment. On 6 December 2018, it was announced at the Egypt Defence Expo (EDEX) that Ka-52s had officially entered service with the Egyptian Air Force.

Egypt&#x27;s helicopter is a modified version of the basic Ka-52 Alligator that serves in the Russian Aerospace Forces. Unlike the basic model, the Egyptian Ka-52 utilizes anti-corrosion materials and has a reinforced fuselage structure. It received new landing gear and wheels, designed for the increased takeoff weight of the helicopter. The Egyptian model features updated avionics and a new cooling system for operating in hot climate. Dmitry Rogozin, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia on defense and space industry, proposed to name it the &quot;Nile Crocodile&quot;.

The helicopter is equipped with the new OES-52 electro-optical observation and laser targeting system, replacing the standard GOES-451 mounted under the nose. The new optronic system began development in 2011 as a collaboration between Kamov and Sagem, and is based on the French company&#x27;s STRIX sighting System. The OES-52 provides greater range of target detection and recognition.

The helicopter features the Arbalet-52 dual-band coherent pulse radar, which has an Earth mapping range of 32 km and a detection range of 25 km for ground targets and 15 km for aerial targets.

The &quot;Nile Crocodiles&quot; use President-S airborne defense systems for protection against guided missiles. The system includes both radar and laser warning receivers, MAW sensors, chaff/flare dispensers, in addition to ECM and DIRCM jammers. Egyptian Ka-52s feature two new DIRCM sets installed on either side of the fuselage, which are different from the standard L370-5 sets. Moreover, the laser-warning system present on the Russian variants of the Ka-52 has been removed, and a L-150 Pastel radar warning receiver has been installed instead.

Egypt plans to arm its Ka-52s with Russian anti-tank guided missiles. The Air Force has chosen two types of missiles; namely the laser-guided Vikhr and the radar-guided Ataka beam-riding missiles.

===Ka-52K &quot;Katran&quot;===
The &quot;Mistral&quot;-class amphibious assault ships, ordered by the Russian Defense Ministry, were to contain rotary-wing assets, formed into aviation groups. Each of these groups was planned to include eight attack and eight assault/transport helicopters. The Ka-52K &quot;Katran&quot; (, &#x27;mud shark&#x27;), a navalised derivative of the Ka-52, has been selected as the new ship-borne attack type for the Russian Naval Aviation. Its features include folding rotor blades, folding wings, and reinforced landing gear. Since its wings are shorter than those of the land-based variants, the Ka-52K only has four weapons pylons, instead of six on the land-based Ka-52. There are plans to install a new radar in the Ka-52K, with longer range compared to the Ka-52&#x27;s radar. The Ka-52K will also be able to use Kh-35 and Kh-38 missiles. However, they haven&#x27;t yet been integrated in the helicopter&#x27;s mission suite. Russian Naval Aviation will need at least 40 Ka-52Ks, the first of which was tentatively slated to enter squadron service by early 2015, coinciding with the delivery of the first carrier.

However, following the Russian annexation of Crimea the sale of the Mistrals was cancelled and they have since been sold to Egypt. Later, Egypt bought 46 Ka-52s, with deliveries lasting from 2017 to 2019. These helicopters have been deployed on the Mistrals originally built for Russia; however, Egyptian Ka-52s are regular land-based variants, not Ka-52Ks.

Still, the first of four Ka-52Ks ordered for the Russian Navy flew on 7 March 2015; the Navy also had an option for a further 28 helicopters. As of 2017, 4 pre-series Ka-52Ks were operated and used for testing by the Russian Navy. After a period of uncertainty, the Ka-52K&#x27;s future with the Russian Navy now appears clearer. In July 2020, the keel was laid for two new Project 23900 amphibious assault ships in the Zalyv Shipbuilding yard. Each ship will be able to carry up to 18 helicopters, including Ka-52Ks. The Ka-52K has passed all tests and was ready for serial production as of September 2020.

According to the SCMP, China is considering the purchase of 36 Ka-52Ks to be used aboard the Type 075 helicopter carrier, which would fulfil the role of a heavy attack helicopter. These helicopters are necessary to equip the carrier with powerful attack weapons, which it currently lacks.

===Ka-52M===
The new version announced by the Russian Ministry of Defence in 2018 eventually crystalized into the Ka-52M; 114 helicopters of this new version are to be acquired. Additionally, older Ka-52s are to be upgraded to Ka-52M standard. The contract for the first 30 Ka-52Ms was signed in August 2021. A new contract was signed in August 2022. Upgrades embodied in the Ka-52M include a modernized GOES-451M electro-optical targeting turret with an increased range, stronger undercarriage wheels, and improved cockpit ergonomics, with better adaptation to the use of night-vision goggles. The LMUR missile is added to the helicopter&#x27;s armament options. Several new radar types are being considered for the Ka-52M. A new self-protection system will also be fitted to the Ka-52M, replacing the current L370-5 Vitebsk. Lastly, the Ka-52M is adapted to work within a new battlefield command and control system. The Russian military received its first 10 modified Ka-52M helicopters on 9 January 2023. The state defense order for the helicopters was doubled in 2023.

==Design==
The Ka-50 and its two-seat version Ka-52 are high-performance combat helicopters with day and night capability, high survivability and fire power, to defeat air targets and heavily armoured tanks armed with air defence weapons. It was designed to be small, fast and agile to improve survivability and lethality.

===Manoeuvering===
The hovering ceiling is 4,000 m and vertical rate of climb 10 m/s at an altitude of 2,500 m. Having a coaxial rotor with blades of polymer results in low inertia both relative to vertical and lateral axes, at 50%–75% as compared to a single rotor helicopter with tail rotor. No tail rotor also means it can perform flat turns at all speeds. A maximum vertical load of 3.5 g combined with low inertia makes the Ka-50 highly agile.

===Navigation systems===
Flight systems include an inertial navigation system (INS), autopilot and head-up display (HUD). Sensors include forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and terrain-following radar.

The Kamov Ka-50 is also fitted with an electronic radio and sighting-piloting-navigating system allowing flights at day and night in VFR and IFR weather conditions. The novelty of this avionics is based on the system of precise target designation with digital coded communication system, which ensures the exchange of information (precise enemy coordinates) between helicopters flying far apart from each other as well as with ground command posts. The Ka-52 is also equipped with a &quot;Phazotron&quot; cockpit radio-locator, allowing flights in adverse meteorological conditions and at night. The necessary information acquired by this radio-locator is transferred to the cockpit&#x27;s multi-functional display screen. For conducting a fight, both pilots are equipped with range-finders built-in their helmets and they can use night vision eyepieces for night flights.

===Protection and survivability===
For its own protection, Ka-50 is fitted with a radar warning receiver, electronic warfare system and chaff and flare dispensers. Aerodynamic cases at wings&#x27; ends each contain two dispensers, which in turn have 32 x 26 mm countermeasures each. The whole system works on principle of evaluated response based on infrared or electronic impulse irradiation. Extensive all-round armour in the cockpit protects the pilot against 12.7 mm armour-piercing bullets and 23 mm projectile fragments. The rotor blades are rated to withstand several hits of ground-based automatic weapons.

Other survivability features include armour protection for vital aircraft systems, and crash-absorbing landing gear and seats. Also, not having a tail rotor can improve survivability, since the tail boom isn&#x27;t load-bearing; during testing, a Ka-50 lost its tail, but still managed to return to base without a problem.

It is the world&#x27;s first operational helicopter with a rescue ejection system allowing the pilot to escape at all altitudes and speeds. The rotor blades detach using explosive bolts prior to ejection to prevent damage to the crew. The K-37-800 rocket-assisted ejection system is manufactured by NPP Zvezda.

===Armament===
The aircraft has one Shipunov 2A42 autocannon with selective fire, and a dual-feed, giving it a cyclic rate of fire between 200 and 800 rounds per minute. It is mounted near centre of gravity for accuracy, and carries 460 high-fragmentation, explosive incendiary, or armour-piercing rounds. The type of ammunition is selected by the pilot during flight. The integrated 30 mm cannon is semi-rigidly fixed on the helicopter&#x27;s side, movable only slightly in elevation and azimuth. Semi-rigid mounting improves the cannon&#x27;s accuracy, giving the 30 mm a longer practical range and better hit ratio at medium ranges than with a free-turning turret mount.

The fire control system automatically shares all target information in real time, allowing one helicopter to engage a target spotted by another aircraft, and the system can also input target information from ground-based forward scouts with personnel-carried target designation gear.

Weapons can be carried on four external hardpoints under the stub wings, plus two on the wingtips, a total of more than 2,000 kg (depending on the mix). The pylons can be tilted up to 10 degrees downward. Fuel tanks may be mounted on a suspension point, whenever necessary.

Anti-tank armament comprises twelve Vikhr laser-guided anti-tank missiles (transl. Vortex or whirlwind), with a maximum range of some 8 km. The laser guidance is reported to be virtually jam-proof and the system features automatic guidance to target, enabling evasive action immediately after missile launch, alternatively it can also use Ataka laser-guided anti-tank missiles. Before firing laser-guided missiles it often must hover a few hundred feet off the ground to direct a laser at a target, leaving itself briefly exposed.

Ka-50/52 can also carry several rocket pods, including the S-13 and S-8 rockets. The &quot;dumb&quot; rockets could be upgraded to laser guided with the proposed Ugroza system.

==Operational history==
===Second Chechen War===
The Ka-50 took part in the Russian Army&#x27;s operations against separatists in the Chechen Republic during the Second Chechen War. In December 2000, a pair of production Ka-50s arrived in the area. With the Ka-50s was a Ka-29 to provide reconnaissance and target designation. On 6 January 2001, the Ka-50 used live weapons against a real enemy for the first time. On 9 January, at the entry into a mountain gorge in the area of a settlement named Komsomolskoye, a single Ka-50 accompanied by an Mi-24 used S-8 unguided rockets to destroy a warehouse full of ammunition belonging to Chechen insurgents. On 6 February, in the forest-covered mountain area to the south of the village of Tsentoroj, a strike group composed of two Ka-50s and the sole Ka-29 discovered and, from a range of 3 km, destroyed a fortified camp of insurgents using two &quot;9K121 Vikhr&quot; guided missiles. On 14 February, a similar strike group carried out a &quot;hunting&quot; mission in the area of Oak-Yurt and Hatun. In difficult conditions, pilots found and destroyed eight targets. These missions tested the type&#x27;s airframe, as well as its on-board systems and armament. Its successful performance in difficult, mountainous terrain confirmed the usefulness of the many advanced features of the Ka-50&#x27;s design, and its power and maneuverability.

===Syrian Civil War===
Ka-52 helicopters were spotted being deployed in support of the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War in 2015, various sources stating they were involved in defense of the Russian base in Latakia, providing escort for search and rescue helicopters, and supporting Russian special forces.

On 5 May 2018, a Ka-52 crashed near Mayadin due to a technical failure, according to some sources.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===

On 24 February 2022, during the initial stages of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, at least one Russian Ka-52 helicopter was damaged but was able to land on its own. On 2 March, a Russian Ka-52 was hit by a surface-to-air missile and crash landed. On 12 March, Ukrainian forces reported that Ka-52 tail number &quot;RF-13409&quot; had been shot down in Novomykolaivka near Kherson. Ukraine officials claimed on 16 March 2022 that Ka-52 number &quot;RF-13411&quot; was shot down at an undisclosed location in Ukraine, providing footage of the airframe wreckage. Footage appeared on social media on 5 April 2022 that appeared to show a hovering Ka-52 shot down by a Ukrainian Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile. On 15 April, Ukrainian forces claimed to have shot down another Ka-52 and published footage of the wreckage; the crew were reported to have died. On 1 May footage appeared of another Ka-52 shot down using a Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile. On 4 June, Ukrainian forces of the 128th Mountain Brigade reported the downing of a Russian Ka-52 in the north. According to Ukrainian officials, the helicopter was shot down by MANPADS. On 27 June, another helicopter was hit by a British-made Martlet MANPADS, forcing it to land. On 15 August, Ukrainian forces damaged a Russian Ka-52 helicopter flying in Donetsk Oblast.

Reportedly, a few Ka-52s have suffered from wing vibration under heavy-load attack missions. This was observed months after the invasion. It has been suggested that this may be due to causes such as fatigue, inadequate design, lack of maintenance, and poor management. Ukrainian military intelligence claimed that the Ka-52 can be &quot;disabled with a 7.62mm machine gun&quot; despite a claimed ability to withstand 12.7mm rounds.

Ka-52s have been heavily used by Russian forces to defend against the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive. They have been successful, due in part to a shortage of Ukrainian short-range air defence, or SHORAD, weapons. Due to the unique design of the coaxial main rotors, the helicopter can withstand the destruction of the tail. A video released on 19 June 2023 shows a Ka-52 losing its tail. The UK MOD has noted the movement of additional Ka-52s to an airfield near Berdiansk, &quot;In the constant contest between aviation measures and counter-measures, it is likely that Russia has gained a temporary advantage in southern Ukraine, especially with attack helicopters employing longer-range missiles against ground targets&quot;.

As of late July 2023, the UK MoD claimed that Russia has lost 40 Ka-52s since the start of the Russian invasion. Oryx, a Dutch open source website, visually confirmed 61 Ka-52s were destroyed or damaged as of 29 August 2024. At the same time the UK MoD said on 27 July 2023: &quot;One of the single most influential Russian weapon systems in the sector is the Ka-52 HOKUM attack helicopter&quot;. With the LMUR missile, the Ka-52 has an attack range of 15 km, putting it beyond the range of Ukrainian air defences.

On 7 August 2023, a Russian Ka-52 was reported shot down over Robotyne, making it the 40th lost during the current invasion according to Oryx. Oryx only counts losses confirmed through open sources.

On 17 August 2023, Ukrainian military claimed to have shot down two Ka-52s in one day. One was downed near Robotyne with a MANPAD by the 47th Mechanized Brigade, a second was claimed by the Ukrainian Air Force near Bakhmut. Ukraine has reported that the missile system used to shoot down a Ka-52 near Robotyne was the RBS-70. While a Ka-52 has countermeasures for infra-red and laser guided missiles, it appears to lack radar jamming. It has to rely flying with helicopters like the Mi-28s that have radar jamming technology. Despite sanctions Russia has continued to manufacture Ka-52s.

Additionally five Ka-52s have been destroyed by Ukrainian tactical missiles on 18 October on the grounds of Berdiansk airport, as reported by Oryx (via satellite imaging). As of 17 December 2024, at least 62 Ka-52s have been confirmed lost during the invasion, with 49 destroyed, 12 damaged, and one damaged and captured by Ukrainian forces.

A Ka-52 was shot down during the Wagner Group rebellion. Another Ka-52 was able to decoy a missile fired from a Wagner operated 9K35 Strela-10 by use of flares.

On 19 July 2024, a Ka-52 was purportedly shot down by a BM-27 Uragan rocket according to Russian telegram source, both crew were killed, but the location and date of the downing have not been released. This followed a similar event where a rocket narrowly missed an Ka-52 per cockpit footage.

On 7 August 2024 during the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk, a Ka-52 was destroyed along with the two-man crew. The Ukrainians are concerned about the ability of the aircraft to carry 9K121 Vikhr air-to-surface missiles, as they are able to penetrate tank armour. The Ka-52 &quot;can carry up to 12 units, allowing it to attack targets from 5 to 11 kilometres.&quot;

Ukrainian forces have shot down a Ka-52 attack helicopter using a Swedish-made RBS-70 man-portable anti-air missile in the Kursk region. As of 7 September 2024, 61 Ka-52s have been destroyed during the conflict.

===Other===
It has participated in a number of exercises, including &quot;Boundary 2004&quot; at the Edelweiss training center in Kyrgyzstan during August 2004. The &quot;Shark&quot; demonstrated its advantages by operating at a high altitude and an air temperature of more than 30 °C. A Ka-50 provided cover for the landing of troops and then worked on the ground targets using its cannons and rockets.

India issued a request for proposal for 22 attack helicopters for the Indian Air Force in May 2008. The Ka-50, the Mil Mi-28, and the Eurocopter Tiger were the front-runners for this order as of October 2008. The tender though was eventually cancelled and later India announced a new tender, with revised conditions. Russia again offered the Mi-28N and Ka-52.

The Russian Air Force has accepted 12 Ka-52 helicopters for operational service in 2011, and the total number of completed Ka-52s was already 65 units. 20 Ka-52 aircraft were located at the 575th Airbase Chernigovsky District, Eastern Military District. 16 were at 393rd &quot;Sevastopol&quot; Airbase Korenovsk, Southern Military District, 12 were transferred to newly formed 15th Army Aviation Brigade of the Western Military District at the airport of Ostrov, 8 – Torzhok 344th Centre for Combat Training and Flight Personnel Training. Five test aircraft are owned by JSC &quot;Kamov&quot;; two machines were lost in accidents. The Ka-52 was displayed to the international community at the 2013 Paris Air Show.

In 2013, the AAC &quot;Progress&quot; has completed the contract with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, signed in 2009, and would begin the next long-term contract for supplying 143 Ka-52, worth about 120 billion rubles (≈US$3.5 bln).

In June 2015, Sergei Kornev, the head of Rosoboronexport&#x27;s delegation, said that Russia has signed its first contracts on the export of Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopters. &quot;We have the Ka-52 in its export model and we have contracts for it, and it&#x27;s already being spun because it has a good, firm future&quot; he said at the airshow outside Paris. Kornev did not specify the volume of contracts or with whom they were signed.

The Algerian Air Force is negotiating a sale for 12 Ka-52Es as of 2022. In September 2015, the Ka-52 was presented at Aïn Oussera Air Base.

North Macedonia reportedly bought two Ka-52s (or Ka-50s) from Russia in June 2001 for its North Macedonia Air Brigade. However, the Ministry of Defense of Macedonia denied this report.

<doc id="16919" wikidata="Q187198" url="?curid=16919" title="Kenny Dalglish">
<text>Sir Kenneth Mathieson Dalglish (born 4 March 1951) is a Scottish former football player and manager. He is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time as well as one of Celtic&#x27;s, Liverpool&#x27;s and Britain&#x27;s greatest ever players. During his career, he made 338 appearances for Celtic and 515 for Liverpool, playing as a forward, and earned a record 102 caps for the Scotland national team, scoring 30 goals, also a joint record. Dalglish won the Ballon d&#x27;Or Silver Award in 1983, the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 1983, and the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1979 and 1983. In 2009, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine named Dalglish the greatest striker in post-war British football, and he has been inducted into both the Scottish and English Football Halls of Fame. He is highly regarded by Liverpool fans, who still affectionately refer to him as &quot;King Kenny&quot;, and in 2006 voted him top of the fans&#x27; poll &quot;100 Players Who Shook the Kop&quot;.

Dalglish began his career with Celtic in 1971, going on to win four Scottish league championships, four Scottish Cups and one Scottish League Cup with the club. In 1977, Liverpool manager Bob Paisley paid a British transfer record of £440,000 to take Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club&#x27;s most successful periods, as he won six English league championships, the FA Cup, four League Cups, five FA Charity Shields, three European Cups and one European Super Cup. In international football, Dalglish made 102 appearances and scored 30 goals for Scotland between 1971 and 1986, becoming their most capped player and joint-leading goal scorer (with Denis Law). He was chosen for Scotland&#x27;s FIFA World Cup squads in 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986, playing in all of those tournaments except the latter, due to injury.

Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of Joe Fagan, winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with Blackburn Rovers, whom he led from the Second Division to win the Premier League in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become director of football at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996. In January 1997, Dalglish took over as manager at Newcastle United. Newcastle finished as runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in 1997–98, which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed director of football at Celtic in 1999, and later briefly manager. He won the Scottish League Cup in 2000 before his departure from the club that year.

Between 2000 and 2010, Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care. In January 2011, Dalglish returned to Liverpool for a spell as caretaker manager after the dismissal of Roy Hodgson, becoming the permanent manager in May 2011. Despite winning the League Cup, which was the club&#x27;s first trophy since 2006, earning them a place in the UEFA Europa League, and reaching the FA Cup Final, Liverpool only finished 8th in the Premier League, and Dalglish was dismissed in May 2012. In October 2013, Dalglish returned to Anfield as a non-executive director, and Anfield&#x27;s Centenary Stand was renamed after him in October 2017.

==Early life==
The son of an engineer, Dalglish was born in Dalmarnock in the east end of Glasgow and was brought up in Milton in the north of the city. When he was 14 the family moved to a newly built tower block in Ibrox overlooking the home ground of Rangers, the club he had grown up supporting.

Dalglish attended Miltonbank Primary School in Milton and started out as a goalkeeper. He then attended High Possil Senior Secondary School, where he won the inter-schools five-a-side and the inter-year five-a-side competitions. He won the Scottish Cup playing for Glasgow Schoolboys and Glasgow Schools, and was then selected for the Scottish schoolboys team that went undefeated in a Home Nations Victory Shield tournament. In 1966, Dalglish had unsuccessful trials at West Ham United and Liverpool.

==Club career==
===Celtic===
Dalglish signed a professional contract with Celtic in May 1967. The club&#x27;s assistant manager Sean Fallon went to see Dalglish and his parents at their home, which had Rangers-related pictures on the walls. In his first season, Dalglish was loaned out to Cumbernauld United, for whom he scored 37 goals. During this time he also worked as an apprentice joiner. Celtic manager Jock Stein wanted Dalglish to spend a second season at Cumbernauld, but the youngster wanted to turn professional. Dalglish got his wish and became a regular in the reserve team known as the Quality Street Gang, due to it containing a large number of highly rated players, including future Scottish internationals Danny McGrain, George Connelly, Lou Macari and David Hay. Dalglish made his first-team competitive debut for Celtic in a Scottish League Cup quarter-final tie against Hamilton Academical on 25 September 1968, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 4–2 win.

He spent the 1968–69 season playing for the reserves, though scored just four goals in 17 games. The following season he changed his position, moving into midfield, and enjoyed a good season as he helped the reserve team to the league and cup double, scoring 19 goals in 31 games. Stein put Dalglish in the starting XI for the first team in a league match against Raith Rovers on 4 October 1969. Celtic won 7–1 but Dalglish did not score, nor did he score in the next three first-team games he played in during the 1969–70 season.

Dalglish continued his goal-scoring form in the reserves into the next season, scoring 23 goals. A highlight of his season came in the Reserve Cup Final against Rangers; Dalglish scored one goal in a 4–1 win in the first leg, then in the second leg scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win to clinch the cup. Still not a first-team regular, Dalglish was in the stands when the Ibrox disaster occurred at an Old Firm match in January 1971, when 66 Rangers fans died. On 17 May 1971, he played for Celtic against Kilmarnock in a testimonial match for the Rugby Park club&#x27;s long serving midfielder Frank Beattie, and scored six goals in a 7–2 win for Celtic.

The 1971–72 season saw Dalglish finally establish himself in the Celtic first team. He scored his first competitive goal for the first team on 14 August 1971, Celtic&#x27;s second goal with a penalty kick in a 2–0 win over Rangers at Ibrox Stadium. He went on to score 29 goals in 53 games that season, including a hat-trick against Dundee and braces against Kilmarnock and Motherwell and helped Celtic win their seventh consecutive league title. Dalglish also played in Celtic&#x27;s 6–1 win over Hibernian in the 1972 Scottish Cup Final. In 1972–73 Dalglish was Celtic&#x27;s leading scorer, with 39 goals in all competitions, and the club won the league championship once again. Celtic won a league and cup double in 1973–74 and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. The ties against Atlético Madrid were acrimonious, and Dalglish described the first leg in Glasgow where the Spanish side had three players sent off as &quot;without doubt the worst game I have ever played in as far as violence is concerned.&quot; Dalglish won a further Scottish Cup winner&#x27;s medal in 1975, providing the cross for Paul Wilson&#x27;s opening goal in a 3–1 win over Airdrieonians in what transpired to be captain Billy McNeill&#x27;s last match before retiring from playing football.

Dalglish was made Celtic captain in the 1975–76 season, during which the club failed to win a trophy for the first time in 12 years. Jock Stein had been badly injured in a car crash and missed most of that season while recovering from his injuries. Celtic won another league and cup double in 1976–77, with Dalglish scoring 27 goals in all competitions. On 10 August 1977, after making 320 appearances and scoring 167 goals for Celtic, Dalglish was signed by Liverpool manager Bob Paisley for a British transfer fee record of £440,000 (£ today). The deal was unpopular with the Celtic fans, and Dalglish was booed by the crowd when he returned to Celtic Park in August 1978 to play in a testimonial match for Stein.

===Liverpool===

Dalglish was signed to replace Kevin Keegan and quickly settled into his new club. He made his debut on 13 August 1977 in the season opener at Wembley, in the 1977 FA Charity Shield against Manchester United. He scored his first goal for Liverpool in his league debut a week later on 20 August, against Middlesbrough. Dalglish also scored three days later on his Anfield debut in a 2–0 victory over Newcastle United, and he scored Liverpool&#x27;s sixth goal when they beat Keegan&#x27;s Hamburg 6–0 in the second leg of the 1977 European Super Cup. By the end of his first season with Liverpool, Dalglish had played 62 times and scored 31 goals, including the winning goal in the 1978 European Cup Final at Wembley against Bruges.

In his second season, Dalglish recorded a personal best of 21 league goals for the club and was also named Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year. He did not miss a league game for Liverpool until the 1980–81 season, when he appeared in 34 out of 42 league games and scored only eight goals as Liverpool finished fifth in the league, but still won the European Cup and Football League Cup. He recovered his goal-scoring form the following season, and was an ever-present player in the league once again, scoring 13 goals as Liverpool became league champions for the 13th time, and the third time since Dalglish&#x27;s arrival. It was also around this time that he began to form a potent strike partnership with Ian Rush; Dalglish began to play just off Rush, &quot;running riot in the extra space afforded to him in the hole&quot;. Dalglish was voted PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year for the 1982–83 season, during which he scored 18 league goals as Liverpool retained their title. From 1983 Dalglish became less prolific as a goal-scorer, though he remained a regular player.

After becoming player-manager on the retirement of Joe Fagan in the 1985 close season and in the aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster, Dalglish selected himself for just 21 First Division games in 1985–86 as Liverpool won the double, but he started the FA Cup final win over Everton. On the last day of the league season, his goal in a 1–0 away win over Chelsea gave Liverpool their 16th league title. Dalglish had a personally better campaign in the 1986–87 season, scoring six goals in 18 league appearances, but by then he was committed to giving younger players priority for a first-team place.

With the sale of Ian Rush to Juventus in 1987, Dalglish formed a new striker partnership of new signings John Aldridge and Peter Beardsley for the 1987–88 season, and he played only twice in a league campaign which saw Liverpool gain their 17th title. Dalglish did not play in Liverpool&#x27;s 1988–89 campaign, and he made his final league appearance on 5 May 1990 as a substitute against Derby. At 39, he was one of the oldest players ever to play for Liverpool. His final goal had come three years earlier, in a 3–0 home league win over Nottingham Forest on 18 April 1987.

==International career==
Tommy Docherty gave Dalglish his debut for the Scottish national side as a substitute in the 1–0 Euro 1972 qualifier victory over Belgium on 10 November 1971 at Pittodrie. Dalglish scored his first goal for Scotland a year later on 15 November 1972 in the 2–0 World Cup qualifier win over Denmark at Hampden Park. Scotland would go on to qualify for the final tournament and he was part of Scotland&#x27;s 1974 World Cup squad in West Germany. He started in all three games as Scotland were eliminated during the group stages despite not losing any of their three games.

In 1976, Dalglish scored the winning goal for Scotland at Hampden Park against England, by nutmegging Ray Clemence. A year later Dalglish scored against the same opponents and goalkeeper at Wembley, in another 2–1 win. Dalglish went on to play in both the 1978 World Cup in Argentina where he started in all of Scotland&#x27;s games – scoring against eventual runners-up the Netherlands in a famous 3–2 win – and the 1982 World Cup in Spain, scoring against New Zealand. On both occasions Scotland failed to get past the group stage. Dalglish was selected for the 22-man squad travelling to Mexico for the 1986 World Cup, but had to withdraw due to injury.

In total, Dalglish played 102 times for Scotland (a national record) and he scored 30 goals (also a national record, which matched that set by Denis Law). He became the first, and as of 2024 only, player to win 100 caps for Scotland in a friendly match against Romania on 26 March 1986 at Hampden Park. He was presented with the milestone cap by Franz Beckenbauer prior to kick off. His final appearance for Scotland, after 15 years as a full international, was on 12 November 1986 at Hampden in a Euro 1988 qualifying game against Luxembourg, which Scotland won 3–0. His 30th and final international goal had been two years earlier, on 14 November 1984, in a 3–1 win over Spain in a World Cup qualifier, also at Hampden Park.

==Managerial career==
===Liverpool===
After the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 and Joe Fagan&#x27;s subsequent resignation as manager, Dalglish became player-manager of Liverpool. In his first season in charge in 1985–86, he guided the club to its first &quot;double&quot;. Liverpool achieved this by winning the League Championship by two points over Everton (Dalglish himself scored the winner in a 1–0 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to secure the title on the final day of the season), and the FA Cup by beating Everton in the final.

The 1986–87 season was trophyless for Liverpool. They lost 2–1 to Arsenal in the League Cup final at Wembley. Before the 1987–88 season, Dalglish signed two new players: striker Peter Beardsley from Newcastle and winger John Barnes from Watford. He had already purchased goalscorer John Aldridge from Oxford United (a replacement for Ian Rush, who was moving to Italy) in the spring of 1987 and early into the new campaign, bought Oxford United midfielder Ray Houghton. The new-look Liverpool side shaped by Dalglish topped the league for almost the entire season, and had a run of 37 matches unbeaten in all competitions (including 29 in the league; 22 wins and 7 draws) from the beginning of the season to 21 February 1988, when they lost to Everton in the league. Liverpool were crowned champions with four games left to play, having suffered just two defeats from 40 games. However, Dalglish&#x27;s side lost the 1988 FA Cup Final to underdogs Wimbledon.

In the summer of 1988, Dalglish re-signed Ian Rush. Liverpool beat Everton 3–2 after extra time in the second all-Merseyside FA Cup final in 1989, but was deprived of a second double in the final game of the season, when Arsenal secured a last-minute goal to take the title from Liverpool. In the 1989–90 season Liverpool won their third league title under Dalglish. They missed out on the double and a third successive FA Cup final appearance when they lost 4–3 in extra-time to Crystal Palace in an FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. At the end of the season Dalglish received his third Manager of the Year award. Dalglish resigned as manager of Liverpool on 22 February 1991, two days after a 4–4 draw with rivals Everton in an FA Cup fifth round tie at Goodison Park, in which Liverpool surrendered the lead four times. At the time of his resignation, the club were three points ahead in the league and still in contention for the FA Cup.

====Hillsborough disaster====
Dalglish was the manager of Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989. The disaster claimed 94 lives on the day, with the final death toll reaching 97. Dalglish attended all the funerals of the victims, including four in one day. His presence in the aftermath of the disaster has been described as &quot;colossal and heroic&quot;. Dalglish broke a twenty-year silence about the disaster in March 2009, expressing regret that the police and the FA did not consider delaying the kick-off of the match. During the Hillsborough Memorial Service on 15 April 2011, Liverpool MP Steve Rotheram announced he would submit an early day motion to have Dalglish knighted, &quot;not only for his outstanding playing and managerial career, but also the charity work he has done with his wife, Marina, for breast cancer support and what he did after Hillsborough. It is common knowledge it affected him deeply&quot;.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Dalglish returned to management in October 1991 at Second Division Blackburn Rovers who had recently been purchased by multi-millionaire Jack Walker. By the turn of 1992 they were top of the Second Division, and then suffered a dip in form before recovering to qualify for the playoffs, during which Dalglish led Blackburn into the new Premier League by beating Leicester City 1–0 in the Second Division play-off final at Wembley. The resulting promotion meant that Blackburn were back in the top flight of English football for the first time since 1966. In the 1992 pre-season, Dalglish signed Southampton&#x27;s Alan Shearer for a British record fee of £3.5 million. Despite a serious injury which ruled Shearer out for half the season, Dalglish achieved fourth position with the team in the first year of the new Premier League. The following year, Dalglish failed in an attempt to sign Roy Keane. Blackburn finished two positions higher the following season, as runners-up to Manchester United. By this time, Dalglish had added England internationals Tim Flowers and David Batty to his squad.

At the start of the 1994–95 season Dalglish paid a record £5 million for Chris Sutton, with whom Shearer formed an effective strike partnership. By the last game of the season, both Blackburn and Manchester United were in contention for the title. Blackburn had to travel to Liverpool, and Manchester United faced West Ham United in London. Blackburn lost 2–1, but still won the title since United failed to win in London. The title meant that Dalglish was only the fourth football manager in history to lead two different clubs to top-flight league championships in England, after Tom Watson, Herbert Chapman and Brian Clough. Dalglish became director of football at Blackburn in June 1995. He left the club at the start of the 1996–97 season after a disappointing campaign under his replacement and former assistant manager, Ray Harford.

Following his departure from Blackburn Dalglish was appointed for a brief spell as an &quot;international talent scout&quot; at his boyhood club Rangers. He was reported as having played a central role in the signing of Chile international Sebastián Rozental.

===Newcastle United===
In January 1997, Dalglish was appointed manager of Premier League side Newcastle United on a three-and-a-half-year contract, taking over from Kevin Keegan. Dalglish guided the club from fourth position to a runner-up spot in May and a place in the new format of the following season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League. He then broke up the team which had finished second two years running, selling popular players like Peter Beardsley, Lee Clark, Les Ferdinand and David Ginola and replacing them with ageing stars like John Barnes (34), Ian Rush (36) and Stuart Pearce (35), as well as virtual unknowns like Des Hamilton and Garry Brady. He also made some good long-term signings like Gary Speed and Shay Given. The 1997–98 campaign saw Newcastle finish in only 13th place and, despite Dalglish achieving some notable successes during the season (including a 3–2 UEFA Champions League win over Barcelona and an FA Cup final appearance against Arsenal), he was dismissed by Freddie Shepherd after two draws in the opening two games of the subsequent 1998–99 season, and replaced by former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit. One commentator from &quot;The Independent&quot; has since written, &quot;His 20 months at Newcastle United are the only part of Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s career that came anywhere near failure&quot;.

===Celtic===
In June 1999 he was appointed director of football operations at Celtic, with his former Liverpool player John Barnes appointed as head coach. Barnes was dismissed in February 2000 and Dalglish took charge of the first team on a temporary basis. He guided them to the Scottish League Cup final, where they beat Aberdeen 2–0 at Hampden Park. Dalglish was dismissed in June 2000, after the appointment of Martin O&#x27;Neill as manager. After a brief legal battle, Dalglish accepted a settlement of £600,000 from Celtic.

===Return to Liverpool===

In April 2009 Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez invited Dalglish to take up a role at the club&#x27;s youth academy. The appointment was confirmed in July 2009, and Dalglish was also made the club&#x27;s ambassador. Following Benítez&#x27;s departure from Liverpool in June 2010, Dalglish was asked to help find a replacement, and in July Fulham&#x27;s Roy Hodgson was appointed manager.

A poor run of results at the start of the 2010–11 season led to Liverpool fans calling for Dalglish&#x27;s return as manager as early as October 2010, and with no subsequent improvement in Liverpool&#x27;s results up to the end of the year (during which time the club was bought by New England Sports Ventures), Hodgson left Liverpool and Dalglish was appointed caretaker manager on 8 January 2011. Dalglish&#x27;s first game in charge was on 9 January 2011 at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which Liverpool lost 1–0. Dalglish&#x27;s first league game in charge was against Blackpool on 12 January 2011; Liverpool lost 2–1. After the game, Dalglish admitted that Liverpool faced &quot;a big challenge&quot;.

Shortly after his appointment, Dalglish indicated he would like the job on a permanent basis if it was offered to him, and on 19 January the Liverpool chairman Tom Werner stated that the club&#x27;s owners would favour this option. On 22 January 2011, Dalglish led Liverpool to their first win since his return, against Wolves at Molineux. After signing Andy Carroll from Newcastle for a British record transfer fee of £35 million and Luis Suárez from Ajax for £22.8 million at the end of January (in the wake of Fernando Torres&#x27;s sale to Chelsea for £50 million), some journalists noted that Dalglish had begun to assert his authority at the club. Following a 1–0 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in February 2011, described by Alan Smith as &quot;a quite brilliant display in terms of discipline and spirit&quot; and a &quot;defensive masterplan&quot; by David Pleat, Henry Winter wrote, &quot;it can only be a matter of time before he [Dalglish] is confirmed as long-term manager&quot;.

On 12 May 2011, Liverpool announced that Dalglish had been given a three-year contract. His first official match in charge was 2–0 defeat to Harry Redknapp&#x27;s Spurs at Anfield. Dalglish&#x27;s second stint in charge at Anfield proved controversial at times. The Scot defended Luis Suárez in the wake of the striker&#x27;s eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra when the teams met in October 2011. After the Uruguayan&#x27;s apparent refusal to shake Evra&#x27;s hand in the return fixture in February 2012, an apology from both player and manager came only after the intervention of the owners.

In February 2012, Dalglish led Liverpool to their first trophy in six years, with victory in the 2011–12 Football League Cup. In the same season he also led Liverpool to the 2012 FA Cup Final where they lost 2–1 to Chelsea. Despite the success in domestic cups, Liverpool finished eighth in the league, their worst showing in the league since 1994, failing to qualify for the Champions League for a third straight season. Following the end of the season, Liverpool dismissed Dalglish on 16 May 2012.

In October 2013, Dalglish returned to Liverpool as a non-executive director.

On 13 October 2017, Anfield&#x27;s Centenary Stand was officially renamed the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand in recognition of his unique contribution to the club.

==Personal life==
Dalglish has been married to Marina since 26 November 1974. The couple have four children, Kelly, Paul, Lynsey and Lauren. Kelly has worked as a football presenter for BBC Radio 5 Live and Sky Sports. Paul followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a footballer, playing in the Premier League and Scottish Premiership before travelling to the United States to play for the Houston Dynamo in Major League Soccer. He retired in 2008 and became a coach, spending time as head coach of Ottawa Fury FC and Miami FC in the second-division leagues of North America. Dalglish&#x27;s wife Marina was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2003, but was treated at Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool and recovered. She later launched a charity to fund new cancer treatment equipment for UK hospitals.

Dalglish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours for services to football. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to football, charity and the City of Liverpool. He dedicated the award to former Celtic and Liverpool coaches Jock Stein, Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley stating that he was &quot;Humbled&quot; and &quot;A wee bit embarrassed&quot;.

In 2002, Celtic supporters voted for what they considered to be the greatest Celtic XI of all time. Dalglish was voted into the team, which was; Simpson, McGrain, Gemmell, Murdoch, McNeill, Auld, Johnstone, P. McStay, Dalglish, Larsson and Lennox. He was an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame the same year, and later also an inaugural inductee to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2004. He is highly regarded by Liverpool fans, who still affectionately refer to him as &quot;King Kenny&quot;, as do supporters of the Scotland National team from the 70s and 80s when he was a world-class player. In 2006 Liverpool fans voted him top of the fans&#x27; poll &quot;100 Players Who Shook the Kop&quot;. In 2009, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine named Dalglish the greatest striker in post-war British football.

On 19 December 2023, Dalglish won the BBC Lifetime Achievement Award, BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

==Charitable work==
In 2005, Dalglish and his wife founded the charity the Marina Dalglish Appeal to raise money to help treat cancer. Dalglish has participated in a number of events to raise money for the charity, including a replay of the 1986 FA Cup Final. In June 2007 a Centre for Oncology at Aintree University Hospital was opened, after the charity had raised £1.5 million. In 2012, the foundation made a £2 million donation to The Walton Centre which allowed the purchase of a new MRI scanner.

Dalglish often competes in the annual Gary Player Invitational Tournament, a charity golfing event which raises money for children&#x27;s causes around the world.

On 1 July 2011, Dalglish was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Ulster, for services to football and charity.

<text>Knowledge representation (KR) aims to model information in a structured manner to formally represent it as knowledge in knowledge-based systems. Whereas knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR, KR&amp;R, or KR²) also aims to understand, reason and interpret knowledge. KRR is widely used in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal to represent information about the world in a form that a computer system can use to solve complex tasks, such as diagnosing a medical condition or having a natural-language dialog. KR incorporates findings from psychology about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge, in order to design formalisms that make complex systems easier to design and build. KRR also incorporates findings from logic to automate various kinds of &quot;reasoning&quot;.

Examples of knowledge representation formalisms include vocabularies, thesaurus, semantic networks, axiom systems, frames, rules, logic programs, and ontologies. Examples of automated reasoning engines include inference engines, theorem provers, model generators, and classifiers.

== History ==

The earliest work in computerized knowledge representation was focused on general problem-solvers such as the General Problem Solver (GPS) system developed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in 1959 and the Advice Taker proposed by John McCarthy also in 1959. GPS featured data structures for planning and decomposition. The system would begin with a goal. It would then decompose that goal into sub-goals and then set out to construct strategies that could accomplish each subgoal. The Advisor Taker, on the other hand, proposed the use of the predicate calculus to represent common sense reasoning.

Many of the early approaches to knowledge represention in Artificial Intelligence (AI) used graph representations and semantic networks, similar to knowledge graphs today. In such approaches, problem solving was a form of graph traversal or path-finding, as in the A* search algorithm. Typical applications included robot plan-formation and game-playing.

Other researchers focused on developing automated theorem-provers for first-order logic, motivated by the use of mathematical logic to formalise mathematics and to automate the proof of mathematical theorems. A major step in this direction was the development of the resolution method by John Alan Robinson.

In the meanwhile, John McCarthy and Pat Hayes developed the situation calculus as a logical representation of common sense knowledge about the laws of cause and effect. Cordell Green, in turn, showed how to do robot plan-formation by applying resolution to the situation calculus. He also showed how to use resolution for question-answering and automatic programming.

In contrast, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) rejected the resolution uniform proof procedure paradigm and advocated the procedural embedding of knowledge instead. The resulting conflict between the use of logical representations and the use of procedural representations was resolved in the early 1970s with the development of logic programming and Prolog, using SLD resolution to treat Horn clauses as goal-reduction procedures.

The early development of logic programming was largely a European phenomenon. In North America, AI researchers such as Ed Feigenbaum and Frederick Hayes-Roth advocated the representation of domain-specific knowledge rather than general-purpose reasoning.

These efforts led to the cognitive revolution in psychology and to the phase of AI focused on knowledge representation that resulted in expert systems in the 1970s and 80s, production systems, frame languages, etc. Rather than general problem solvers, AI changed its focus to expert systems that could match human competence on a specific task, such as medical diagnosis.

Expert systems gave us the terminology still in use today where AI systems are divided into a &quot;knowledge base&quot;, which includes facts and rules about a problem domain, and an &quot;inference engine&quot;, which applies the knowledge in the knowledge base to answer questions and solve problems in the domain. In these early systems the facts in the knowledge base tended to be a fairly flat structure, essentially assertions about the values of variables used by the rules.

Meanwhile, Marvin Minsky developed the concept of frame in the mid-1970s. A frame is similar to an object class: It is an abstract description of a category describing things in the world, problems, and potential solutions. Frames were originally used on systems geared toward human interaction, e.g. understanding natural language and the social settings in which various default expectations such as ordering food in a restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system to choose appropriate responses to dynamic situations.

It was not long before the frame communities and the rule-based researchers realized that there was a synergy between their approaches. Frames were good for representing the real world, described as classes, subclasses, slots (data values) with various constraints on possible values. Rules were good for representing and utilizing complex logic such as the process to make a medical diagnosis. Integrated systems were developed that combined frames and rules. One of the most powerful and well known was the 1983 Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) from Intellicorp. KEE had a complete rule engine with forward and backward chaining. It also had a complete frame-based knowledge base with triggers, slots (data values), inheritance, and message passing. Although message passing originated in the object-oriented community rather than AI it was quickly embraced by AI researchers as well in environments such as KEE and in the operating systems for Lisp machines from Symbolics, Xerox, and Texas Instruments.

The integration of frames, rules, and object-oriented programming was significantly driven by commercial ventures such as KEE and Symbolics spun off from various research projects. At the same time, there was another strain of research that was less commercially focused and was driven by mathematical logic and automated theorem proving. One of the most influential languages in this research was the KL-ONE language of the mid-&#x27;80s. KL-ONE was a frame language that had a rigorous semantics, formal definitions for concepts such as an Is-A relation. KL-ONE and languages that were influenced by it such as Loom had an automated reasoning engine that was based on formal logic rather than on IF-THEN rules. This reasoner is called the classifier. A classifier can analyze a set of declarations and infer new assertions, for example, redefine a class to be a subclass or superclass of some other class that wasn&#x27;t formally specified. In this way the classifier can function as an inference engine, deducing new facts from an existing knowledge base. The classifier can also provide consistency checking on a knowledge base (which in the case of KL-ONE languages is also referred to as an Ontology).

Another area of knowledge representation research was the problem of common-sense reasoning. One of the first realizations learned from trying to make software that can function with human natural language was that humans regularly draw on an extensive foundation of knowledge about the real world that we simply take for granted but that is not at all obvious to an artificial agent, such as basic principles of common-sense physics, causality, intentions, etc. An example is the frame problem, that in an event driven logic there need to be axioms that state things maintain position from one moment to the next unless they are moved by some external force. In order to make a true artificial intelligence agent that can converse with humans using natural language and can process basic statements and questions about the world, it is essential to represent this kind of knowledge. In addition to McCarthy and Hayes&#x27; situation calculus, one of the most ambitious programs to tackle this problem was Doug Lenat&#x27;s Cyc project. Cyc established its own Frame language and had large numbers of analysts document various areas of common-sense reasoning in that language. The knowledge recorded in Cyc included common-sense models of time, causality, physics, intentions, and many others.

The starting point for knowledge representation is the &quot;knowledge representation hypothesis&quot; first formalized by Brian C. Smith in 1985:

Any mechanically embodied intelligent process will be structural ingredients that a) we as external observers naturally take to represent a propositional account of the knowledge that the overall process exhibits, and b) independent of such external semantic attribution, play a formal but causal and essential role in engendering the behavior that manifests that knowledge.

One of the most active areas of knowledge representation research is the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the Semantic Web creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future Semantic Web. The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.

Recent projects funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have integrated frame languages and classifiers with markup languages based on XML. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides the basic capability to define classes, subclasses, and properties of objects. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) provides additional levels of semantics and enables integration with classification engines.

== Overview ==
Knowledge-representation is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can be used for solving complex problems.

The justification for knowledge representation is that conventional procedural code is not the best formalism to use to solve complex problems. Knowledge representation makes complex software easier to define and maintain than procedural code and can be used in expert systems.

For example, talking to experts in terms of business rules rather than code lessens the semantic gap between users and developers and makes development of complex systems more practical.

Knowledge representation goes hand in hand with automated reasoning because one of the main purposes of explicitly representing knowledge is to be able to reason about that knowledge, to make inferences, assert new knowledge, etc. Virtually all knowledge representation languages have a reasoning or inference engine as part of the system.

A key trade-off in the design of knowledge representation formalisms is that between expressivity and tractability. First Order Logic (FOL), with its high expressive power and ability to formalise much of mathematics, is a standard for comparing the expressibility of knowledge representation languages.

Arguably, FOL has two drawbacks as a knowledge representation formalism in its own right, namely ease of use and efficiency of implementation. Firstly, because of its high expressive power, FOL allows many ways of expressing the same information, and this can make it hard for users to formalise or even to understand knowledge expressed in complex, mathematically-oriented ways. Secondly, because of its complex proof procedures, it can be difficult for users to understand complex proofs and explanations, and it can be hard for implementations to be efficient. As a consequence, unrestricted FOL can be intimidating for many software developers.

One of the key discoveries of AI research in the 1970s was that languages that do not have the full expressive power of FOL can still provide close to the same expressive power of FOL, but can be easier for both the average developer and for the computer to understand. Many of the early AI knowledge representation formalisms, from databases to semantic nets to production systems, can be viewed as making various design decisions about how to balance expressive power with naturalness of expression and efficiency. In particular, this balancing act was a driving motivation for the development of IF-THEN rules in rule-based expert systems. 

A similar balancing act was also a motivation for the development of logic programming (LP) and the logic programming language Prolog. Logic programs have a rule-based syntax, which is easily confused with the IF-THEN syntax of production rules. But logic programs have a well-defined logical semantics, whereas production systems do not.

The earliest form of logic programming was based on the Horn clause subset of FOL. But later extensions of LP included the negation as failure inference rule, which turns LP into a non-monotonic logic for default reasoning. The resulting extended semantics of LP is a variation of the standard semantics of Horn clauses and FOL, and is a form of database semantics, which includes the unique name assumption and a form of closed world assumption. These assumptions are much harder to state and reason with explicitly using the standard semantics of FOL.

In a key 1993 paper on the topic, Randall Davis of MIT outlined five distinct roles to analyze a knowledge representation framework:

* &quot;A knowledge representation (KR) is most fundamentally a surrogate, a substitute for the thing itself, used to enable an entity to determine consequences by thinking rather than acting,&quot; i.e., &quot;by reasoning about the world rather than taking action in it.&quot;
* &quot;It is a set of ontological commitments&quot;, i.e., &quot;an answer to the question: In what terms should I think about the world?&quot; 
* &quot;It is a fragmentary theory of intelligent reasoning, expressed in terms of three components: (i) the representation&#x27;s fundamental conception of intelligent reasoning; (ii) the set of inferences the representation sanctions; and (iii) the set of inferences it recommends.&quot;
* &quot;It is a medium for pragmatically efficient computation&quot;, i.e., &quot;the computational environment in which thinking is accomplished. One contribution to this pragmatic efficiency is supplied by the guidance a representation provides for organizing information&quot; so as &quot;to facilitate making the recommended inferences.&quot;
* &quot;It is a medium of human expression&quot;, i.e., &quot;a language in which we say things about the world.&quot;

Knowledge representation and reasoning are a key enabling technology for the Semantic Web. Languages based on the Frame model with automatic classification provide a layer of semantics on top of the existing Internet. Rather than searching via text strings as is typical today, it will be possible to define logical queries and find pages that map to those queries. The automated reasoning component in these systems is an engine known as the classifier. Classifiers focus on the subsumption relations in a knowledge base rather than rules. A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever-changing and evolving information space of the Internet.

The Semantic Web integrates concepts from knowledge representation and reasoning with markup languages based on XML. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) provides the basic capabilities to define knowledge-based objects on the Internet with basic features such as Is-A relations and object properties. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) adds additional semantics and integrates with automatic classification reasoners.

== Characteristics ==
In 1985, Ron Brachman categorized the core issues for knowledge representation as follows:

* Primitives. What is the underlying framework used to represent knowledge? Semantic networks were one of the first knowledge representation primitives. Also, data structures and algorithms for general fast search. In this area, there is a strong overlap with research in data structures and algorithms in computer science. In early systems, the Lisp programming language, which was modeled after the lambda calculus, was often used as a form of functional knowledge representation. Frames and Rules were the next kind of primitive. Frame languages had various mechanisms for expressing and enforcing constraints on frame data. All data in frames are stored in slots. Slots are analogous to relations in entity-relation modeling and to object properties in object-oriented modeling. Another technique for primitives is to define languages that are modeled after First Order Logic (FOL). The most well known example is Prolog, but there are also many special-purpose theorem-proving environments. These environments can validate logical models and can deduce new theories from existing models. Essentially they automate the process a logician would go through in analyzing a model. Theorem-proving technology had some specific practical applications in the areas of software engineering. For example, it is possible to prove that a software program rigidly adheres to a formal logical specification.
* Meta-representation. This is also known as the issue of reflection in computer science. It refers to the ability of a formalism to have access to information about its own state. An example is the meta-object protocol in Smalltalk and CLOS that gives developers runtime access to the class objects and enables them to dynamically redefine the structure of the knowledge base even at runtime. Meta-representation means the knowledge representation language is itself expressed in that language. For example, in most Frame based environments all frames would be instances of a frame class. That class object can be inspected at runtime, so that the object can understand and even change its internal structure or the structure of other parts of the model. In rule-based environments, the rules were also usually instances of rule classes. Part of the meta protocol for rules were the meta rules that prioritized rule firing.
* Incompleteness. Traditional logic requires additional axioms and constraints to deal with the real world as opposed to the world of mathematics. Also, it is often useful to associate degrees of confidence with a statement, i.e., not simply say &quot;Socrates is Human&quot; but rather &quot;Socrates is Human with confidence 50%&quot;. This was one of the early innovations from expert systems research which migrated to some commercial tools, the ability to associate certainty factors with rules and conclusions. Later research in this area is known as fuzzy logic.
* Definitions and universals vs. facts and defaults. Universals are general statements about the world such as &quot;All humans are mortal&quot;. Facts are specific examples of universals such as &quot;Socrates is a human and therefore mortal&quot;. In logical terms definitions and universals are about universal quantification while facts and defaults are about existential quantifications. All forms of knowledge representation must deal with this aspect and most do so with some variant of set theory, modeling universals as sets and subsets and definitions as elements in those sets.
* Non-monotonic reasoning. Non-monotonic reasoning allows various kinds of hypothetical reasoning. The system associates facts asserted with the rules and facts used to justify them and as those facts change updates the dependent knowledge as well. In rule based systems this capability is known as a truth maintenance system.
* Expressive adequacy. The standard that Brachman and most AI researchers use to measure expressive adequacy is usually First Order Logic (FOL). Theoretical limitations mean that a full implementation of FOL is not practical. Researchers should be clear about how expressive (how much of full FOL expressive power) they intend their representation to be.
* Reasoning efficiency. This refers to the runtime efficiency of a system: The ability of the knowledge base to be updated and the reasoner to develop new inferences in a reasonable time. In some ways, this is the flip side of expressive adequacy. In general, the more powerful a representation, the more it has expressive adequacy, the less efficient its automated reasoning engine will be. Efficiency was often an issue, especially for early applications of knowledge representation technology. They were usually implemented in interpreted environments such as Lisp, which were slow compared to more traditional platforms of the time.

== Ontology engineering ==
In the early years of knowledge-based systems the knowledge-bases were fairly small. The knowledge-bases that were meant to actually solve real problems rather than do proof of concept demonstrations needed to focus on well defined problems. So for example, not just medical diagnosis as a whole topic, but medical diagnosis of certain kinds of diseases.

As knowledge-based technology scaled up, the need for larger knowledge bases and for modular knowledge bases that could communicate and integrate with each other became apparent. This gave rise to the discipline of ontology engineering, designing and building large knowledge bases that could be used by multiple projects. One of the leading research projects in this area was the Cyc project. Cyc was an attempt to build a huge encyclopedic knowledge base that would contain not just expert knowledge but common-sense knowledge. In designing an artificial intelligence agent, it was soon realized that representing common-sense knowledge, knowledge that humans simply take for granted, was essential to make an AI that could interact with humans using natural language. Cyc was meant to address this problem. The language they defined was known as CycL.

After CycL, a number of ontology languages have been developed. Most are declarative languages, and are either frame languages, or are based on first-order logic. Modularity—the ability to define boundaries around specific domains and problem spaces—is essential for these languages because as stated by Tom Gruber, &quot;Every ontology is a treaty–a social agreement among people with common motive in sharing.&quot; There are always many competing and differing views that make any general-purpose ontology impossible. A general-purpose ontology would have to be applicable in any domain and different areas of knowledge need to be unified.

There is a long history of work attempting to build ontologies for a variety of task domains, e.g., an ontology for liquids, the lumped element model widely used in representing electronic circuits (e.g.), as well as ontologies for time, belief, and even programming itself. Each of these offers a way to see some part of the world.

The lumped element model, for instance, suggests that we think of circuits in terms of components with connections between them, with signals flowing instantaneously along the connections. This is a useful view, but not the only possible one. A different ontology arises if we need to attend to the electrodynamics in the device: Here signals propagate at finite speed and an object (like a resistor) that was previously viewed as a single component with an I/O behavior may now have to be thought of as an extended medium through which an electromagnetic wave flows.

Ontologies can of course be written down in a wide variety of languages and notations (e.g., logic, LISP, etc.); the essential information is not the form of that language but the content, i.e., the set of concepts offered as a way of thinking about the world. Simply put, the important part is notions like connections and components, not the choice between writing them as predicates or LISP constructs.

The commitment made selecting one or another ontology can produce a sharply different view of the task at hand. Consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.

<text>Knowledge Aided Retrieval in Activity Context (KARNAC) is a system being developed in the United States for use in profiling different categories of terrorist attacks to determine the components of possible future terrorist incidents.

Information for KARNAC is generally to be derived from structured, semi-structured and unstructured databases. This would include information derived from gun registrations, driver&#x27;s licenses, residential and criminal records, as well as the Internet, newspapers and county records. For example, the system might raise an alert if someone attempted to buy components for bomb making, hired a car and rented a hotel room near the White House.
