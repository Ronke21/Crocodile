<text>Jeepster Records is an English, London-based independent record label, founded in 1995, and specializing in British indie and alternative bands, particularly Glasgow-based acts. It is most notable for its signing of Belle and Sebastian and Snow Patrol.

==Early success==
Jeepster Records was founded in 1995 by Mark Jones and Stefano D’Andrea, through a mutual interest in the contemporary indie scene. Following their establishment and after extensive scouting, the label signed their first act, the newly formed Belle and Sebastian, in August 1996. In November of the same year, the band&#x27;s first album with Jeepster, &quot;If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister&quot; was released. This established both Belle and Sebastian and Jeepster, and enabled them to release several EPs with Belle and Sebastian throughout 1997, as well as signing their second act, Snow Patrol, later in the year. 1998 then saw increased activity, with the signing of Salako, and the release of albums for all three of their signed bands; most notably Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;The Boy With The Arab Strap&quot;.

The label&#x27;s strong relationship with Belle and Sebastian enabled them in 1999 to sign Stuart David&#x27;s side-project Looper, and Isobel Campbell&#x27;s solo project The Gentle Waves, releasing albums for each that same year, along with a string of EPs and singles for their entire roster. The label enjoyed further good publicity when Belle and Sebastian won Best Newcomer in the 1999 Brit Awards. Later that year, Jeepster reissued Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s debut album &quot;Tigermilk&quot;, which had previously been available only on limited issue vinyl.

2000 saw new albums released for Belle and Sebastian, Looper (band), and The Gentle Waves, as well as Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In June of the same year, Belle and Sebastian had their first UK Top Ten hit with their fourth studio album, Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant which entered the UK Album Charts at No.10, spending four weeks in the charts. Towards the end of the year, the label released the &quot;It&#x27;s a Cool Cool Christmas&quot; compilation on CD in association with XFM, with proceeds going to The Big Issue charity. The album was only available during this Christmas period, and featured Belle and Sebastian and Snow Patrol, as well as numerous other bands including Grandaddy, The Flaming Lips and Teenage Fanclub. The following year marked the release of Snow Patrol&#x27;s second album &quot;When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have To Clear Up&quot; which would later go gold, along with their debut album &quot;Songs For Polarbears&quot;.

==Dormant period==
Despite critical acclaim for its acts, Jeepster was financially troubled by 2002 due to increasing recording and marketing costs, and an unsustainable reliance on one director for financial support. This forced the label to decline renewal of the contracts of their most successful artists and concentrate solely on marketing their existing catalogue. Stefano D&#x27;Andrea and Mark Jones resigned from the day to day running of the label, and Joanne D&#x27;Andrea took over management of the catalogue. While they were unable to retain their signed artists for ongoing releases and could not afford to sign new acts for this period, there were several additions to the back catalogue in the next few years.

The label released a Belle and Sebastian DVD in 2003, &quot;Fans Only&quot;, and in 2005 &quot;Push Barman to Open Old Wounds&quot;, a compilation comprising all of Belle and Sebastian&#x27;s singles and EPs released under Jeepster. This was followed in 2006 by extended re-issues of Songs for Polarbears and &quot;When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up&quot;, which included all their B-sides as bonus tracks.

==Later releases==
In a stronger financial position by April 2006, largely due to the commercial success of Snow Patrol on signing to a major label, Jeepster announced its first new signing in years, Reading-based act SixNationState. Following renewed scouting of the Glasgow underground scene, the label soon after announced the signing of another band, Parka, in November of the same year.

Following several singles releases by both bands, the label released its first new album in six and a half years in late 2007: SixNationState&#x27;s self-titled debut album. In May 2008, Parka&#x27;s own debut, &quot;Attack of the Hundred Yard Hardman&quot; was also released.

Before the end of 2008, Jeepster would release another Belle and Sebastian compilation, &quot;The BBC Sessions&quot;, collecting the tracks that the band had recorded for the BBC in 1996, which included rarities and unreleased songs, together with live recordings from Belfast.

Jeepster contributed six songs to the Polydor Records Snow Patrol compilation &quot;Up To Now&quot; in 2009.

In 2016, a limited release of 1200 vinyl box sets &quot;The Jeepster Singles Collection&quot;, containing all 12&quot; versions of the early Belle and Sebastian EPs, together with original fanzines, press photo, DVD and scrapbook, was made available to celebrate the 21st Anniversary of the label.

Snow Patrol&#x27;s When It&#x27;s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up was again reissued in 2019 on limited vinyl, with a gold 7&quot; containing two previously unreleased tracks.

In 2020, the Belle and Sebastian album If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister was listed in Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at No. 481.

The Jeepster charity album It&#x27;s a Cool Cool Christmas was reissued for the first time on vinyl in 2021, in aid of War Child (charity) UK and with the blessing of all original artists.

<doc id="16329" wikidata="Q43706" url="?curid=16329" title="John Chrysostom">
<text>John Chrysostom (; ; – 14 September 407) was an important Church Father who served as archbishop of Constantinople. He is known for his preaching and public speaking, his denunciation of abuse of authority by both ecclesiastical and political leaders, his &quot;Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom&quot;, and his ascetic sensibilities. He was also the author of &quot;Adversus Judaeos&quot; and was strongly anti-Judaism. The epithet (&quot;Chrysostomos&quot;, anglicized as Chrysostom) means &quot;golden-mouthed&quot; in Greek and denotes his celebrated eloquence. Chrysostom was among the most prolific authors in the early Christian Church.

He is honored as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches, as well as in some others. The Eastern Orthodox, together with the Byzantine Catholics, hold him in special regard as one of the Three Holy Hierarchs (alongside Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus). Along with them and Athanasius of Alexandria he is also regarded as one of the four Great Greek Church Fathers The feast days of John Chrysostom in the Eastern Orthodox Church are 14 September, 13 November and 27 January. In the Catholic Church, he is recognised as a Doctor of the Church. Because the date of his death is occupied by the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 September), the General Roman Calendar celebrates him since 1970 on the previous day, 13 September; from the 13th century to 1969 it did so on 27 January, the anniversary of the translation of his body to Constantinople. Of other Western churches, including Anglican provinces and Lutheran churches, some commemorate him on 13 September, others on 27 January. John Chrysostom is honored on the calendars of the Church of England and the Episcopal Church on 13 September. The Coptic Church also recognizes him as a saint (with feast days on 16 Thout and 17 Hathor).

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
John was born in Antioch, Roman Syria (modern-day Antakya, Hatay, Turkey) in 347. Different scholars describe his mother Anthusa as a pagan or as a Christian. His father was a high-ranking military officer. John&#x27;s father died soon after his birth and he was raised by his mother. He was baptised in 368 or 373, and tonsured as a reader (one of the minor orders of the Church). It is sometimes said that he was bitten by a snake when he was ten years old, resulting in infection from the bite.

As a result of his mother&#x27;s influential connections in the city, John began his education under the pagan preacher Libanius. From Libanius, John acquired the skills for a career in rhetoric, as well as a love of the Greek language and literature. Eventually, he became a lawyer.

As he grew older, however, John became more deeply committed to Christianity and went on to study theology under Diodorus of Tarsus, founder of the re-constituted School of Antioch. According to the Christian historian Sozomen, Libanius was supposed to have said on his deathbed that John would have been his successor &quot;if the Christians had not taken him from us&quot;.

John lived in extreme asceticism and became a hermit in about 375; he spent the next two years continually standing, scarcely sleeping, and committing the Bible to memory. As a consequence of these practices, his stomach and kidneys were permanently damaged and poor health forced him to return to Antioch.

=== Diaconate and service in Antioch ===
John was first appointed as a reader in the church of Antioch by Zeno of Verona upon the latter&#x27;s return from Jerusalem. Later, he was ordained as a deacon in 381 by the bishop Meletius of Antioch who was not then in communion with Alexandria and Rome. After the death of Meletius, John separated himself from the followers of Meletius, without joining Paulinus II of Antioch, the rival of Meletius for the bishopric of Antioch. But after the death of Paulinus II (388) he was ordained a presbyter (priest) by Evagrius of Antioch, the successor of Paulinus by the Eustathius of Antioch faction in the city. He was destined later to bring about reconciliation between Flavian I of Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome, thus bringing those three sees into communion for the first time in nearly seventy years.

In Antioch, over the course of twelve years (386–397), John gained popularity because of the eloquence of his public speaking at the Golden Church, Antioch&#x27;s cathedral, especially his insightful expositions of Bible passages and moral teaching. The most valuable of his works from this period are his homilies on various books of the Bible. He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor. He spoke against abuse of wealth and personal property:Do you wish to honour the body of Christ? Do not ignore him when he is naked. Do not pay him homage in the temple clad in silk, only then to neglect him outside where he is cold and ill-clad. He who said: &quot;This is my body&quot; is the same who said: &quot;You saw me hungry and you gave me no food&quot;, and &quot;Whatever you did to the least of my brothers you did also to me&quot;... What good is it if the Eucharistic table is overloaded with golden chalices when your brother is dying of hunger? Start by satisfying his hunger and then with what is left you may adorn the altar as well.

His straightforward understanding of the Scriptures – in contrast to the Alexandrian tendency towards allegorical interpretation – meant that the themes of his talks were practical, explaining the Bible&#x27;s application to everyday life. Such straightforward preaching helped Chrysostom to garner popular support.

One incident that happened during his service in Antioch illustrates the influence of his homilies. When Chrysostom arrived in Antioch, Flavian, the bishop of the city, had to intervene with emperor Theodosius I on behalf of citizens who had gone on a rampage mutilating statues of the emperor and his family. During the weeks of Lent in 387, John preached more than twenty homilies in which he entreated the people to see the error of their ways. These made a lasting impression on the general population of the city: many pagans converted to Christianity as a result of the homilies. The city was ultimately spared from severe consequences.

=== Archbishop of Constantinople ===

In the autumn of 397, John was appointed archbishop of Constantinople, after having been nominated without his knowledge by the eunuch Eutropius. He had to leave Antioch in secret due to fears that the departure of such a popular figure would cause civil unrest.

During his time as archbishop, he adamantly refused to host lavish social gatherings, which made him popular with the common people, but unpopular with wealthy citizens and the clergy. His reforms of the clergy were also unpopular. He told visiting regional preachers to return to the churches they were meant to be serving – without any pay-out. He also founded a number of hospitals in Constantinople.

His time in Constantinople was more tumultuous than his time in Antioch. Theophilus I of Alexandria, the patriarch of Alexandria, wanted to bring Constantinople under his sway and opposed John&#x27;s appointment to Constantinople. Theophilus had disciplined four Egyptian monks (known as &quot;the Tall Brothers&quot;) over their support of Origen&#x27;s teachings. They fled to John and were welcomed by him. Theophilus therefore accused John of being too partial to the teaching of Origen. He made another enemy in Aelia Eudoxia, wife of emperor Arcadius, who assumed that John&#x27;s denunciations of extravagance in feminine dress were aimed at her. Eudoxia, Theophilus and other of his enemies held a synod in 403 (the Synod of the Oak) to charge John, in which his connection to Origen was used against him. It resulted in his deposition and banishment. He was called back by Arcadius almost immediately, as the people became &quot;tumultuous&quot; over his departure, even threatening to burn the imperial palace. There was an earthquake the night of his arrest, which Eudoxia took for a sign of God&#x27;s anger, prompting her to ask Arcadius for John&#x27;s reinstatement.

Peace was short-lived. A silver statue of Eudoxia was erected in the Augustaion, near his cathedral, the Constantinian Hagia Sophia. John denounced the dedication ceremonies as pagan and spoke against the empress in harsh terms: &quot;Again Herodias raves, again she dances, and again desires to receive John&#x27;s head on a charger&quot;, an allusion to the events surrounding the death of John the Baptist. Once again he was banished, this time to the Caucasus in Abkhazia. His banishment sparked riots among his supporters in the capital, and in the fighting the cathedral built by Constantius II was burnt down, necessitating the construction of the second cathedral on the site, the Theodosian Hagia Sophia.

Around 405, John began to lend moral and financial support to Christian monks who were enforcing the emperors&#x27; anti-pagan laws, by destroying temples and shrines in Phoenicia and nearby regions.

=== Exile and death ===
The causes of John&#x27;s exile are not clear, though Jennifer Barry suggests that they have to do with his connections to Arianism. Other historians, including Wendy Mayer and Geoffrey Dunn, have argued that &quot;the surplus of evidence reveals a struggle between Johannite and anti-Johannite camps in Constantinople soon after John&#x27;s departure and for a few years after his death&quot;. Faced with exile, John Chrysostom wrote an appeal for help to three churchmen: Pope Innocent I; Venerius, the bishop of Mediolanum (Milan); and Chromatius, the bishop of Aquileia. In 1872, church historian William Stephens wrote:
The Patriarch of the Eastern Rome appeals to the great bishops of the West, as the champions of an ecclesiastical discipline which he confesses himself unable to enforce or to see any prospect of establishing. No jealousy is entertained of the Patriarch of the Old Rome by the patriarch of the New Rome. The interference of Innocent is courted, a certain primacy is accorded him, but at the same time he is not addressed as a supreme arbitrator; assistance and sympathy are solicited from him as from an elder brother, and two other prelates of Italy are joint recipients with him of the appeal.

Pope Innocent I protested John&#x27;s banishment from Constantinople to the town of Cucusus (Göksun) in Cappadocia, but to no avail. Innocent sent a delegation to intercede on behalf of John in 405. It was led by Gaudentius of Brescia; Gaudentius and his companions, two bishops, encountered many difficulties and never reached their goal of entering Constantinople.

John wrote letters which still held great influence in Constantinople. As a result of this, he was further exiled from Cucusus (where he stayed from 404 to 407) to Pitiunt (Pityus) (in modern Georgia). He never reached this destination alive, as he died at Comana Pontica (modern-day Gümenek, Tokat, Turkey) on 14 September 407 during the journey. He died in the Presbyterium or community of the clergy belonging to the church of Saint Basiliscus of Comana. His last words are said to have been &quot;&quot; (&quot;Glory be to God for all things&quot;).

=== Veneration and canonisation ===
John came to be venerated as a saint soon after his death. Almost immediately after, an anonymous supporter of John (known as pseudo-Martyrius) wrote a funeral oration to reclaim John as a symbol of Christian orthodoxy. But three decades later, some of his adherents in Constantinople remained in schism. Proclus, archbishop of Constantinople (434–446), hoping to bring about the reconciliation of the Johannites, preached a homily praising his predecessor in the Church of Hagia Sophia. He said, &quot;O John, your life was filled with sorrow, but your death was glorious. Your grave is blessed and reward is great, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ O graced one, having conquered the bounds of time and place! Love has conquered space, unforgetting memory has annihilated the limits, and place does not hinder the miracles of the saint.&quot;

These homilies helped to mobilize public opinion, and the patriarch received permission from the emperor to return Chrysostom&#x27;s relics to Constantinople, where they were enshrined in the Church of the Holy Apostles on 28 January 438. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as a &quot;Great Ecumenical Teacher&quot;, with Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus. These three saints, in addition to having their own individual commemorations throughout the year, are commemorated together on 30 January, a feast known as the Synaxis of the Three Hierarchs.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, there are several feast days dedicated to him:
* 27 January, Translation of the relics of Saint John Chrysostom from Comana to Constantinople.
* 30 January, Synaxis of the Three Great Hierarchs.
* 14 September, Repose of Saint John Chrysostom.
* 13 November, celebration was transferred from 14 September by the 10th century AD as the Exaltation of the Holy Cross became more prominent. According to Brian Croke, 13 November is the date news of John Chrysostom&#x27;s death reached Constantinople.

In 1908 Pope Pius X named him the patron saint of preachers.

== Writings ==
Some 700 sermons and 246 letters by John Chrysostom survive, plus biblical commentaries, moral discourses, and theological treatises.

=== Homilies ===
==== Paschal Homily ====
The best known of his many homilies is an extremely brief one, the Paschal Homily (&quot;Hieratikon&quot;), which is read at the first service of Pascha (Easter), the midnight Orthros (Matins), in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==== General ====
Chrysostom&#x27;s extant homiletical works are vast, including many hundreds of exegetical homilies on both the New Testament (especially the works of Paul the Apostle) and the Old Testament (particularly on Genesis). Among his exegetical works are sixty-seven homilies on Genesis, fifty-nine on the Psalms, ninety on the Gospel of Matthew, eighty-eight on the Gospel of John, and fifty-five on the Acts of the Apostles.

The homilies were written down by stenographers and subsequently circulated, revealing a style that tended to be direct and greatly personal, but formed by the rhetorical conventions of his time and place. In general, his homiletical theology displays much characteristics of the Antiochian school (i.e., more literal in interpreting biblical events), but he also uses a good deal of the allegorical interpretation more associated with the Alexandrian school.

John&#x27;s social and religious world was formed by the continuing and pervasive presence of paganism in the life of the city. One of his regular topics was the paganism in the culture of Constantinople, and in his homilies, he thunders against popular pagan amusements: the theatre, horseraces, and the revelry surrounding holidays. In particular, he criticizes Christians for taking part in such activities:
If you ask [Christians] who is Amos or Obadiah, how many apostles there were or prophets, they stand mute; but if you ask them about the horses or drivers, they answer with more solemnity than sophists or rhetors.

One of the recurring features of John&#x27;s homilies is his emphasis on care for the needy. Echoing themes found in the Gospel of Matthew, he calls upon the rich to lay aside materialism in favor of helping the poor, often employing all of his rhetorical skills to shame wealthy people to abandon conspicuous consumption: Do you pay such honor to your excrements as to receive them into a silver chamber-pot when another man made in the image of God is perishing in the cold?
Along these lines, he wrote often about the need for almsgiving and its importance alongside fasting and prayer, e.g. &quot;prayer without almsgiving is unfruitful&quot;.

Cyril of Alexandria attributed the destruction of the Ephesian Temple of Artemis to John Chrysostom, referring to him as &quot;the destroyer of the demons and overthrower of the temple of Diana&quot;. A later Archbishop of Constantinople, Proclus of Constantinople repeated the allegation, saying &quot;In Ephesus, he despoiled the art of Midas&quot;. Both claims are considered spurious.

==== Homilies against Jews and Judaizing Christians ====

During his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch (386–387), John denounced Jews and Christians in a series of eight homilies delivered to Christians in his congregation who were taking part in Jewish festivals and other Jewish observances. It is disputed whether the main targets were specifically the so called &quot;Judaizers&quot; or Jews in general. His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner, using the uncompromising rhetorical form known as the &quot;psogos&quot; (Greek: blame, censure).

One of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs, and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom&#x27;s flock. In his homilies, John criticized those &quot;Judaizing Christians&quot;, who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances, such as the shabbat, submitted to circumcision and made pilgrimage to Jewish holy places. There had been a revival of Jewish faith and tolerance in Antioch in 361, so Chrysostom&#x27;s followers and the greater Christian community were in contact with Jews frequently, and Chrysostom was concerned that this interaction would draw Christians away from their faith identity.

John claimed that synagogues were full of Christians, especially Christian women, on the shabbats and Jewish festivals, because they loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy and enjoyed listening to the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom. Due to Chrysostom&#x27;s stature in the Christian church, both locally and within the greater church hierarchy, his sermons were fairly successful in spreading anti-Jewish sentiment.

In Greek, the homilies are called &quot;Kata Ioudaiōn&quot; (), which is translated as in Latin and &quot;Against the Jews&quot; in English. The original Benedictine editor of the homilies, Bernard de Montfaucon, gives the following footnote to the title: &quot;A discourse against the Jews; but it was delivered against those who were Judaizing and keeping the fasts with them [the Jews]&quot;.

According to Patristics scholars, opposition to any particular view during the late 4th century was conventionally expressed in a manner, using the rhetorical form known as the psogos, whose literary conventions were to vilify opponents in an uncompromising manner; thus, it has been argued that to call Chrysostom an &quot;anti-Semite&quot; is to employ anachronistic terminology in a way incongruous with historical context and record. This does not preclude assertions that Chrysostom&#x27;s theology was a form of anti-Jewish supersessionism.

His sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.

==== Homily against homosexuality ====
John Chrysostom&#x27;s most notable discourse in this regard is his fourth homily on Romans 1:26, where he argues as follows:
All these affections then were vile, but chiefly the mad lust after males; for the soul is more the sufferer in sins, and more dishonored, than the body in diseases. ... [The men] have done an insult to nature itself. And a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it, when even the women seek after these intercourses, who ought to have more sense of shame than men.

He says the active male victimizes the passive male in a way that leaves him more enduringly dishonored than even a victim of murder since the victim of this act must &quot;live under&quot; the shame of the &quot;insolency&quot;. The victim of a murder, by contrast, carries no dishonor. He asserts that punishment will be found in Hell for such transgressors and that women can be guilty of the sin as much as men. Chrysostom argues that the male passive partner has effectively renounced his manhood and become a woman – such an individual deserves to be &quot;driven out and stoned&quot;. He attributes the cause to &quot;luxury&quot;. &quot;Do not, he means (Paul), because you have heard that they burned, suppose that the evil was only in desire. For the greater part of it came of their luxuriousness, which also kindled into flame their lust&quot;.

According to scholar Michael Carden, Chrysostom was particularly influential in shaping early Christian thought that same-sex desire was an evil, claiming that he altered a traditional interpretation of Sodom as a place of inhospitality to one where the sexual transgressions of the Sodomites became paramount. However, other scholars – such as Kruger and Nortjé-Meyer – dispute this, arguing that the author of the Epistle of Jude already interpreted the sin of Sodom as homosexuality in the New Testament.

=== Treatises ===
Apart from his homilies, a number of John&#x27;s other treatises have had a lasting influence. One such work is John&#x27;s early treatise &quot;Against Those Who Oppose the Monastic Life&quot;, written while he was a deacon (sometime before 386), which was directed to parents, pagan as well as Christian, whose sons were contemplating a monastic vocation. Chrysostom wrote that, already in his day, it was customary for Antiochenes to send their sons to be educated by monks.

Another important treatise written by John is titled &quot;On the Priesthood&quot; (written 390–391, it contains in Book 1 an account of his early years and a defence of his flight from ordination by bishop Meletius of Antioch, and then proceeds in later books to expound on his exalted understanding of the priesthood). Two other notable books by John are &quot;Instructions to Catechumens&quot; and &quot;On the Incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature&quot;. In addition, he wrote a series of letters to the deaconess Olympias, of which seventeen are extant.

=== Liturgy ===
Beyond his preaching, the other lasting legacy of John is his influence on Christian liturgy. Two of his writings are particularly notable. He harmonized the liturgical life of the church by revising the prayers and rubrics of the Divine Liturgy, or celebration of the Holy Eucharist. To this day, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite typically celebrate the &quot;Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom&quot; as the normal Eucharistic liturgy, although his exact connection with it remains a matter of debate among experts.

== Legacy and influence ==
During a time when city clergy were subject to criticism for their high lifestyle, John was determined to reform his clergy in Constantinople. These efforts were met with resistance and limited success. He was seen as an excellent preacher whose homilies and writings are still studied and quoted. As a theologian, he has been and continues to be very important in Eastern Christianity, and is generally considered among the Three Holy Hierarchs of the Greek Church, but has been less important to Western Christianity. His writings have survived to the present day more so than any of the other Greek Fathers.

=== Catechism of the Catholic Church ===
The Catechism of the Catholic Church cites him in eighteen sections, particularly his reflections on the purpose of prayer and the meaning of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer:
Consider how [Jesus Christ] teaches us to be humble, by making us see that our virtue does not depend on our work alone but on grace from on high. He commands each of the faithful who prays to do so universally, for the whole world. For he did not say &quot;thy will be done in me or in us&quot;, but &quot;on earth&quot;, the whole earth, so that error may be banished from it, truth take root in it, all vice be destroyed on it, virtue flourish on it, and earth no longer differ from heaven.

=== Protestant clergy ===
Protestant clerics, such as Richard Salter Storrs, refer to him as &quot;one of the most eloquent preachers who ever since apostolic times have brought to men the divine tidings of truth and love&quot;, and the 19th-century John Henry Newman described John as a &quot;bright, cheerful, gentle soul; a sensitive heart&quot;.

=== Music and literature ===
John&#x27;s liturgical legacy has inspired several musical compositions, including Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot;, Op. 31, composed in 1910, one of his two major unaccompanied choral works; Pyotr Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot;, Op. 41; and Ukrainian composer Kyrylo Stetsenko&#x27;s &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot;, Arvo Pärt&#x27;s &quot;Litany&quot; sets Chrysostom&#x27;s twenty-four prayers, one for each hour of the day, for soli, mixed choir and orchestra. And the compositions of Alexander Grechaninovs &quot;Liturgy of Johannes Chrysostomos&quot; No. 1, Op. 13 (1897), &quot;Liturgy of Johannes Chrysostomos&quot;, No. 2, Op. 29 (1902), &quot;Liturgia Domestica (Liturgy Johannes Chrysostomos&quot; No. 3), Op. 79 (1917) and &quot;Liturgy of Johannes Chrysostomos&quot; No. 4, Op. 177 (1943) are noteworthy.

James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; includes a character named Mulligan who brings &quot;Chrysostomos&quot; into another character (Stephen Dedalus)&#x27;s mind because Mulligan&#x27;s gold-stopped teeth and his gift of the gab earn him the title which St. John Chrysostom&#x27;s preaching earned him, &quot;golden-mouthed&quot;: &quot;[Mulligan] peered sideways up and gave a long low whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points. Chrysostomos&quot;.

=== Legend of the penance of Saint John Chrysostom ===
A late medieval legend relates that, when John Chrysostom was a hermit in the desert, he was approached by a royal princess in distress. John, thinking she was a demon, at first refused to help her, but the princess convinced him that she was a Christian and would be devoured by wild beasts if she were not allowed to enter his cave. He therefore admitted her, carefully dividing the cave in two parts, one for each of them. In spite of these precautions, the sin of fornication was committed, and in an attempt to hide it the distraught John took the princess and threw her over a precipice. He then went to Rome to beg absolution, which was refused. Realising the appalling nature of his crimes, Chrysostom made a vow that he would never rise from the ground until his sins were expiated, and for years he lived like a beast, crawling on all fours and feeding on wild grasses and roots. Subsequently, the princess reappeared, alive, and suckling John&#x27;s baby, who miraculously pronounced his sins forgiven. This last scene was very popular from the late 15th century onwards as a subject for engravers and artists. The theme was depicted by Albrecht Dürer around 1496, Hans Sebald Beham and Lucas Cranach the Elder, among others. Martin Luther mocked this same legend in his &quot;Die Lügend von S. Johanne Chrysostomo&quot; (1537) to analyse the pitfalls of the Christian Legendary (hagiography).

=== Relics ===
John Chrysostom died in the city of Comana in 407 on his way to his place of exile. There his relics remained until 438 when, thirty years after his death, they were transferred to Constantinople during the reign of the empress Aelia Eudoxia&#x27;s son, the emperor Theodosius II (408–450), under the guidance of John&#x27;s disciple, Proclus of Constantinople, who by that time had become archbishop of Constantinople (434–447).

Most of John&#x27;s relics were looted from Constantinople by crusaders in 1204 and taken to Rome, but some of his bones were returned to the Orthodox Church on 27 November 2004 by Pope John Paul II. Since 2004 the relics have been enshrined in the Church of St. George, Istanbul.

The skull, however, having been kept at the monastery at Vatopedi on Mount Athos in northern Greece, was not among the relics that were taken by the crusaders in the 13th century. In 1655, at the request of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, the skull was taken to Russia, for which the monastery was compensated in the sum of 2000 rubles. In 1693, having received a request from the Vatopedi Monastery for the return of Saint John&#x27;s skull, Tsar Peter the Great ordered that the skull remain in Russia but that the monastery was to be paid 500 rubles every four years. The Russian state archives document these payments up until 1735. The skull was kept at the Moscow Kremlin, in the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God, until 1920, when it was confiscated by the Soviets and placed in the Museum of Silver Antiquities. In 1988, in connection with the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Russia, the head, along with other important relics, was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church and kept at the Epiphany Cathedral, until being moved to the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour after its restoration.

Today, the monastery at Vatopedi posits a rival claim to possessing the skull of John Chrysostom, and there a skull is venerated by pilgrims to the monastery as that of Saint John. Two sites in Italy also claim to have the saint&#x27;s skull: the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence and the &quot;Dal Pozzo&quot; chapel in Pisa. The right hand of Saint John is preserved at Philotheou Monastery on Mount Athos, and numerous smaller relics are scattered throughout the world.

== Collected works ==
Widely used editions of Chrysostom&#x27;s works are available in Greek, Latin, English, and French. The Greek edition is edited by Sir Henry Savile (eight volumes, Eton, 1613); the most complete Greek and Latin edition is edited by Bernard de Montfaucon (thirteen volumes, Paris, 1718–1738, republished in 1834–1840, and reprinted in Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, volumes 47–64). There is an English translation in the first series of the &quot;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot; (London and New York, 1889–1890). A selection of his writings has been published more recently in the original with facing French translation in &quot;Sources Chrétiennes&quot;.

<text>James Joseph Heckman (born April 19, 1944) is an American economist and Nobel laureate who serves as the Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor in Economics at the University of Chicago, where he is also a professor at the College, a professor at the Harris School of Public Policy, Director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), and Co-Director of Human Capital and Economic Opportunity (HCEO) Global Working Group. He is also a professor of law at the Law School, a senior research fellow at the American Bar Foundation, and a research associate at the NBER. He received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1983, and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2000, which he shared with Daniel McFadden. He is known principally for his pioneering work in econometrics and microeconomics. 

Heckman is noted for his contributions to selection bias and self-selection in quantitative analysis in the social sciences, especially the Heckman correction, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also well known for his empirical research in labor economics and his scholarship on the efficacy of early childhood education programs. As of June 2024, according to RePEc, he is the third-most influential economist in the world.

==Early years==
Heckman was born to John Jacob Heckman and Bernice Irene Medley in Chicago, Illinois. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Colorado College in 1965 and his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1971 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Three essays on the supply of labor and the demand for goods&quot; under the supervision of Stanley W. Black.

==Career==
He served as an assistant professor at Columbia University before he moved to the University of Chicago, in 1973. He has been a dissertation advisor for over 70 students, including Carolyn Heinrich, George Borjas, Stephen Cameron, Mark Rosenzweig, and Russ Roberts.

In addition to serving as the Henry Schultz Distinguished Service Professor and director of the Economics Research Center in the department of economics, Heckman is also a professor of law at the Law School and a professor at the Harris School of Public Policy, where he is director of both the Center for Social Program Evaluation and Center for the Study of Childhood Development. He also serves as a member of the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics&#x27;s Research Council. Heckman has held many appointments at other institutions and notably served as the Distinguished Chair of Microeconometrics at University College London (2004–2008), a Professor of Science and Society at University College Dublin (2005–2014), and as the Alfred Cowles Distinguished Visiting Professor at Yale University (2008–2011). His current appointments include Presidential Scholar-in-Residence at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics (2015–) and International Research Fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (2014–).

=== Center for the Economics of Human Development ===
Founded in 2014 and directed by Heckman, the Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), at the University of Chicago, umbrellas his multiple research areas and initiatives that encompass rigorous empirical research to determine effective human capital policies and program design. CEHD initiatives include the Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Global Working Group, the Pritzker Consortium on Early Childhood Development, the Heckman Equation, the Research Network on the Determinants of Life Course Capabilities and Outcomes, and the Asian Family in Transition Initiative.

==Research==
Heckman is noted for his contributions to selection bias and self-selection analysis, especially Heckman correction, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is also well known for his empirical research in labor economics, particularly regarding the efficacy of early childhood education programs.

His work has been devoted to the development of a scientific basis for economic policy evaluation, with special emphasis on models of individuals and disaggregated groups, and the problems and possibilities created by heterogeneity, diversity, and unobserved counterfactual states. He developed a body of new econometric tools that address these issues. His research has given policymakers important new insights into areas such as education, jobtraining, the importance of accounting for general equilibrium in the analysis of labor markets, anti-discrimination law, and civil rights. He demonstrated a strong causal effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in promoting African-American economic progress. He has recently demonstrated that the high school dropout rate is increasing in the US. He has studied the economic benefits of sorting in the labor market, the ineffectiveness of active labor market programs, and the economic returns to education.

His recent research focuses on inequality, human development and lifecycle skill formation, with a special emphasis on the economics of early childhood education. He is currently conducting new social experiments on early childhood interventions and reanalyzing old experiments. He is also studying the emergence of the underclass in the US and Western Europe. For example, he showed that a high IQ only improved an individual&#x27;s chances of financial success by 1 or 2%. Instead, &quot;conscientiousness,&quot; or &quot;diligence, perseverance and self-discipline,&quot; are what led to financial success.

In the early 1990s, his pioneering research, on the outcomes of people who obtain the GED certificate, received national attention.

Heckman has published over 300 articles and several books. His books include &quot;Inequality in America: What Role for Human Capital Policy?&quot; (with Alan Krueger); &quot;Evaluating Human Capital Policy, Law, and Employment: Lessons from Latin America and the Caribbean&quot; (with Carmen Pages); the &quot;Handbook of Econometrics&quot;, volumes 5, 6A, and 6B (edited with Edward Leamer); &quot;Global Perspectives on the Rule of Law,&quot; (edited with R. Nelson and L. Cabatingan); and &quot;The Myth of Achievement Tests: The GED and the Role of Character in American Life&quot; (with John Eric Humphries and Tim Kautz).

He is currently co-editor of the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) and the American Philosophical Society. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Econometric Society (of which he is also former president), the Society of Labor Economics, the American Statistical Association, and the International Statistical Institute.

==Awards==
Heckman has received numerous awards for his work, including the John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association in 1983, the 2005 and 2007 Dennis Aigner Award for Applied Econometrics from the &quot;Journal of Econometrics&quot;, the 2005 Jacob Mincer Award for Lifetime Achievement in Labor Economics, the 2005 Ulysses Medal from the University College Dublin, the 2007 Theodore W. Schultz Award from the American Agricultural Economics Association, the Gold Medal of the President of the Italian Republic awarded by the International Scientific Committee of the Pio Manzú Centre in 2008, the Distinguished Contributions to Public Policy for Children Award from the Society for Research in Child Development in 2009, the 2014 Frisch Medal from the Econometric Society, the 2014 Spirit of Erikson Award from the Erikson Institute, and the 2016 Dan David Prize for Combating Poverty.

==Personal life==
Heckman in 1979 married sociologist Lynne Pettler-Heckman, who died July 8, 2017. They had two children: a son, Jonathan (b. 1982) who is a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania, and a daughter, Alma (b. 1986), who is an assistant professor of history at the University of California at Santa Cruz.

<doc id="16334" wikidata="Q324913" url="?curid=16334" title="Judith of Poland">
<text>Judith of Poland (, ; b. 1130/35 – died 8 July 1171/75) was a member of the House of Piast and by marriage margravine of Brandenburg.
==Early years==
Judith was the daughter of Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland by his second wife, Salomea of Berg. She was probably named after either her paternal grandmother, Judith of Bohemia, or her older half-sister, the princess of Murom. Judith was one of the youngest children of her parents; her date of birth remains unknown. According to Polish medieval chronicles, she was sent to Hungary as a bride of the son of King Béla II. According to the &quot;Annales Cracovienses Compilati&quot;, this event took place in 1136; since it can be assumed that the Polish princess was younger than her betrothed, and also are known the birth dates of the youngest children of Bolesław III (Agnes in 1137 and Casimir in 1138), Judith in consequence could have been born between 1130 and 1135.

The marriage never took place: by 1146, the engagement was broken with the consent of both parties and Judith returned to Poland. The reason for this may have been the wedding of Mieszko (Judith&#x27;s brother) with the Hungarian princess Elisabeth (daughter of King Béla II), which sufficiently secured the Polish-Hungarian alliance.

==Margravine of Brandenburg==
In Kruszwica on 6 January 1148 Judith married Otto, eldest son of Albert the Bear, the first Margrave of Brandenburg. This union was contracted in connection with the Ascanian efforts to support the Junior Dukes in opposition to King Conrad III of Germany, who supported the deposed High Duke Władysław II as legal ruler of Poland. During her marriage, she bore her husband two sons, Otto (who later succeeded his father as Margrave of Brandenburg) in 1149, and Henry (who inherited the Counties of Tangermünde and Gardelegen) in 1150.

Nothing is known about the political role that Judith had to play in Germany. After his father&#x27;s death in 1170, Otto became the second Margrave of Brandenburg and Judith the Margravine consort.

==Death and aftermath==
Like her birth date, Judith&#x27;s date of death remains unknown. Only the day, 8 July, is known thanks to the &quot;Regesta Historia Brandenburgensis&quot;, which records the death in &quot;&quot;VIII Id Jul&quot; of &quot;Juditha marchionissa gemma Polonorum&quot;&quot;. By contrast, the year of death can be determined only through indirect sources. In documents from 1170 Judith is named as a living person. It is assumed that Judith died between 1171 and 1175. She was buried in the Brandenburg Cathedral.

Judith&#x27;s oldest son, Otto II, inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg after the death of his father in 1184. He never married or had children; because his brother Henry died before him (in 1192) also without issue, after Otto II&#x27;s death in 1205 Brandenburg was inherited by his younger half-brother Albert II, son of Otto I and Ada.

<doc id="16336" wikidata="Q313489" url="?curid=16336" title="Jeffrey Archer">
<text>Jeffrey Howard Archer, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare (born 15 April 1940) is an English novelist and former politician. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Louth (Lincolnshire) from 1969 to 1974, but did not seek re-election after a financial scandal that left him almost bankrupt.

Archer revived his fortunes as a novelist. His novel &quot;Kane and Abel&quot; (1979) remains one of the best-selling books in the world, with an estimated 34 million copies sold worldwide. Overall his books have sold more than 320 million copies worldwide.

Archer was the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party from 1985 to 1986; he resigned after a newspaper accused him of paying money to a prostitute. In 1987 he won a civil case and was awarded large damages because of this claim. He was made a life peer in 1992 and subsequently became the first Conservative candidate to be selected as a candidate for mayor of London. He ended his candidacy in 1999 after it emerged that he had lied in the case in 1987. In 2001 he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for perjury and perverting the course of justice, ending his active political career. He was released early in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Jeffrey Howard Archer was born in the City of London Maternity Hospital in Holloway, London on 15 April 1940. He was two weeks old when his family moved to Somerset, eventually settling in the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, where Archer spent most of his early life.

His father, William (died 1956), was 64 years old when Jeffrey Archer was born. Early in his career, Archer gave conflicting accounts to the press of his father&#x27;s supposed, but non-existent, military career. William Archer was, in fact, a bigamist, fraudster, and conman, who impersonated another William Archer, a deceased war medal holder. He was at different times employed as a chewing gum salesman in New York and a mortgage broker in London. In the latter capacity, he was charged at the Old Bailey with a series of fraud offences. On being released on bail, he absconded to the US under the name William Grimwood.

In the US, William Archer fathered a child, Rosemary Turner (21 June 1917 – 11 October 1986), Jeffrey&#x27;s half-sister. In 1940 Rosemary married lawyer Brien McMahon who went on to become the Democratic senator for Connecticut (1945–1952) and a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952. After Brien McMahon&#x27;s death that year, Rosemary married, in 1953, the Belgian ambassador to Washington, Baron Silvercruys. The First Lady, Mamie Eisenhower, was the guest-of-honour at their wedding.

As a boy Archer dreamed of being captain of the Bristol Rovers Football Club. He is still a fan of the club.

===Wellington School===
In 1951, Archer won a scholarship to Wellington School in Somerset (not Wellington College in Berkshire, as he was later inclined to claim) after passing the 11-plus. At this time his mother, Lola, was employed as a journalist on Weston&#x27;s local newspaper, the &quot;Weston Mercury&quot;. She wrote a weekly column entitled &quot;Over the Teacups&quot;, and frequently wrote about Jeffrey, calling him &#x27;Tuppence&#x27;. Although Archer enjoyed the local fame this brought him, it caused him to be the victim of bullying while at Wellington School.

Archer left school with O-levels in English literature, art, and history. He then spent a few years in a variety of jobs, including training with the army and a short period with the Metropolitan Police. He later worked as a physical education teacher, first at Vicar&#x27;s Hill, a preparatory school in Hampshire, and later at Dover College in Kent.

===Oxford===
In 1963 Archer was offered a place at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Extra-Mural Studies to study for a Diploma of Education. The course was based in the department, and Archer became a member of Brasenose College. There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications to Brasenose, the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, for instance, in gaining admission to the course. It has also been alleged Archer provided false statements about three non-existent A-Level passes and a U.S. university degree. Although the diploma course only lasted a year, Archer spent a total of three years at Oxford. At Oxford, Archer was successful in athletics, competing in sprinting and hurdling, and became president of the Oxford University Athletic Club in 1965/6. His opposite number at Cambridge University, Wendell Mottley became a lifelong friend. Television coverage survives of him making false starts in a 1964 sprint race, but he was not disqualified. He gained a blue in athletics and went on to run for England, and once competed for Great Britain. His time of 10.6 seconds for 100 metres is the joint second fastest time by an Oxford University student.

Archer raised money for the charity Oxfam, obtaining the support of The Beatles in a fundraising drive. The band accepted his invitation to visit the Principal&#x27;s lodge at Brasenose College, where they were photographed with Archer and dons of the college, although they did not play there. The critic Sheridan Morley, then a student at Merton, was present and recalled the occasion:

==Early career==
After leaving Oxford, Archer continued as a charity fundraiser, initially working for the National Birthday Trust, a medical charity that promoted safe childbirth, before joining the United Nations Association (UNA) as its chief fundraiser. The then chairman of the UNA, Humphry Berkeley, alleged that there were numerous discrepancies in Archer&#x27;s expense claims while he worked at the UNA.

Around this time, Archer began a career in politics, serving as a Conservative councillor for Havering on the Greater London Council (1967–1970).

Archer set up his own fundraising and public relations company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair. The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the sculptor and painter Leon Underwood. The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later.

==Member of Parliament==
At 29, Archer was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of Louth, holding the seat for the Conservative Party in a by-election on 4 December 1969. Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting. The national party had concerns about Archer&#x27;s selection, specifically relating to the UNA expenses allegations made by Humphry Berkeley, himself a former Conservative MP. Berkeley tried to persuade the Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate. Archer brought a defamation action against Berkeley and the story was kept out of the press, although a truncated version of the story did appear in &quot;The Times&quot;. The case was eventually settled out of court, with Archer agreeing to pay legal costs of around £30,000.

Louth constituency had three key areas: Louth, Cleethorpes, and Immingham. During his time as an MP, Archer was a regular at the Immingham Conservative Club in the most working-class part of the constituency. In 1970 he took part in the Kennedy Memorial Test, a 50-mile running/walking race from Louth to Skegness and back.

In parliament, Archer was on the left of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party&#x27;s policies. He advocated free TV licences for elderly people and was against museum entrance charges. In 1971, he employed David Mellor to deal with his correspondence. He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet. In an interview, in February 1999 Archer said, &quot;I hope we don&#x27;t return to extremes. I&#x27;m what you might call centre-right but I&#x27;ve always disliked the right wing as much as I&#x27;ve disliked the left wing.&quot;

==Financial crisis==
In 1974, Archer was a casualty of a fraudulent investment scheme involving a Canadian company called Aquablast. The debacle lost him his first fortune and left him almost £500,000 in debt. Warned by &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reporter Revel Barker – whom he misidentified as a fellow Oxford student – that as a bankrupt he could not be an MP, he announced that he would not be standing in the October 1974 general election &quot;Because of financial difficulties&quot;.

While he was a witness in the Aquablast case in Toronto in 1975, Archer was accused of stealing three suits from a department store. Archer denied the accusation for many years, but in the late 1990s he finally acknowledged that he had taken the suits, although he claimed that at the time he had not realised he had left the shop. No charges were ever brought.

==Writing career==
Archer wrote his first book, &quot;Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less&quot;, in the autumn of 1974, as a means of avoiding bankruptcy. The book was picked up by the literary agent Deborah Owen and published first in the U.S., then eventually in Britain in the autumn of 1976. A radio adaptation was aired on BBC Radio 4 in the early 1980s and a BBC Television adaptation of the book was broadcast in 1990.

&quot;Kane and Abel&quot; (1979) proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestsellers list. Like most of his early work, it was edited by Richard Cohen, the Olympic fencing gold-medallist. It was made into a television mini-series by CBS in 1985, starring Peter Strauss and Sam Neill. The following year, Granada TV screened a 10-part adaptation of another Archer bestseller, &quot;First Among Equals&quot;, which told the story of four men and their quest to become prime minister. In the U.S. edition of the novel, the character of Andrew Fraser was eliminated, reducing the number of protagonists to three.

As well as novels and short stories, Archer has also written three stage plays. The first, &quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt&quot;, opened in 1987 and ran at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End for over a year. Archer&#x27;s next play, &quot;Exclusive&quot;, opened at the Strand Theatre, London, in September 1989. It was not well received by critics, and closed after a few weeks. His final play, &quot;The Accused&quot;, opened at the Theatre Royal, Windsor on 26 September 2000, before transferring to the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the West End in December.

In 1988, author Kathleen Burnett accused Archer of plagiarizing a story she had written, and including it in his short-story collection, &quot;A Twist in the Tale&quot;. Archer denied he had plagiarized the story, claiming he had simply been inspired by the idea.

While Archer&#x27;s books are commercially successful, critics have been generally unfavorable towards his writing. Journalist Hugo Barnacle, writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; about &quot;The Fourth Estate&quot; (1996), thought the novel, while demonstrating that &quot;the editors don&#x27;t seem to have done any work&quot;, was &quot;not wholly unsatisfactory&quot;.

Archer has said that he spends considerable time writing and re-writing each book. He goes abroad to write the first draft, working in blocks of two hours at a time, then writes anything up to 17 drafts in total. Since 2010, Archer has written the first draft of each new book at his villa in Majorca, called &quot;Writer&#x27;s Block&quot;.

In 2011, Archer published the first of seven books in &quot;The Clifton Chronicles&quot; series, which follow the life of Harry Clifton from his birth in 1920, through to his funeral in 1993. The first novel in the series, &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;, tells the story of Harry from 1920 through to 1940, and was published in the UK on 12 May 2011. The seventh and final novel in the series, &quot;This Was a Man&quot;, was published on 3 November 2016.

&quot;The Short, the Long and the Tall&quot;, an illustrated collection of Archer&#x27;s short stories, was published in November 2020, with watercolor illustrations by artist Paul Cox.

&quot;Over My Dead Body&quot; was published in October 2021, and is the fourth book in a series of thrillers featuring detective William Warwick. The book was critically acclaimed and became a New York Times bestseller.

In January 2020 it was reported that Archer had sued his former literary agents, Curtis Brown, for £500,000 in unpaid royalties.

==Return to politics==

===Deputy party chairman===
Archer&#x27;s political career revived in the 1980s, and he became a popular speaker among the Conservative grassroots. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher in September 1985. Norman Tebbit, party chairman, had misgivings over the appointment, as did other prominent members of the party, including William Whitelaw and Edward Heath. During his tenure as deputy chairman, Archer was responsible for a number of embarrassing moments, including his statement, made during a live radio interview, that many young, unemployed people were simply unwilling to find work. At the time of Archer&#x27;s comment, unemployment in the UK stood at a record 3.4 million. Archer was later forced to apologise for the remark, saying that his words had been &quot;taken out of context&quot;. Archer resigned as deputy chairman in October 1986 due to a scandal caused by an article in &quot;The News of the World&quot;, which led with the story, &quot;Tory boss Archer pays vice-girl&quot;, and claimed Archer had paid Monica Coghlan, a prostitute, £2,000 through an intermediary at Victoria Station to go abroad.

===&quot;Daily Star&quot; libel case===
Shortly after &quot;The News of the World&quot; story broke, rival tabloid the &quot;Daily Star&quot; ran a story alleging Archer had paid for sex with Coghlan, something &quot;The News of the World&quot; had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the &quot;Daily Star&quot;. The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather than that of a guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer&#x27;s final exit from front-line politics some years later. The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: &quot;Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?&quot; The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer: &quot;Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?&quot;

Although the Archers claimed they were a normal, happily married couple, by this time, according to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were living largely separate lives. The editor of the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper&#x27;s owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate. Adam Raphael soon afterwards found proof that Archer had perjured himself at the trial, but his superiors were unwilling to take the risk of a potentially costly libel case. &quot;The News of the World&quot; later settled out-of-court with Archer, acknowledging they, too, had libelled him.

===Kurdish charity and peerage===
When Saddam Hussein suppressed Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, with the Red Cross, set up the charity Simple Truth, a fundraising campaign on behalf of the Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed free of charge. Archer stated that his charity had raised £57,042,000, though it was later reported that only £3 million came from the Simple Truth concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later incur further controversy. Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, &quot;of Mark in the County of Somerset&quot;. Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer&#x27;s role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years.

===Political statements in 1990s===
In a speech at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged then Home Secretary Michael Howard, to &quot;Stand and deliver,&quot; saying: &quot;Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they&#x27;re frightened to go out at night, frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and grandparents walked with freedom ... We say to you: stand and deliver!&quot;. He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of &quot;do-gooders&quot; and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party&#x27;s law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role.

On &quot;Question Time&quot; on 20 January 1994, Archer said that 18 should be the age of consent for gay sex, as opposed to 21, which it was at the time. Archer though was opposed to the age of consent for gay men being 16. Historian David Starkey was on the same edition, and said of Archer: &quot;Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation.&quot; Archer has also consistently been an opponent of a return to capital punishment.

===Allegations of insider dealings===
In January 1994, Mary Archer, then a director of Anglia Television, attended a directors&#x27; meeting at which an impending takeover of Anglia Television by MAI, which owned Meridian Broadcasting, was discussed. The following day, Jeffrey Archer bought 50,000 shares in Anglia Television, acting on behalf of a friend, Broosk Saib. Shortly after this, it was announced publicly that Anglia Television would be taken over by MAI. As a result, the shares jumped in value, whereupon Archer sold them on behalf of his friend for a profit of £77,219. The arrangements he made with the stockbrokers meant he did not have to pay at the time of buying the shares.

An inquiry was launched by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading. The Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Michael Heseltine, announced that Archer would not be prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. His solicitors admitted that he had made a mistake, but Archer later said that he had been exonerated.

===London mayoral candidature===
In 1999, Archer had been selected by the Conservative Party as candidate for the London mayoral election of 2000, with the support of two former Prime Ministers, Baroness Thatcher and John Major.

On 21 November 1999 the &quot;News of the World&quot; published allegations made by Ted Francis, a former friend, that Archer had committed perjury in his 1987 libel case. Archer withdrew his candidature the following day. After the allegations broke, Archer was disowned by his party. Conservative leader William Hague explained: &quot;This is the end of politics for Jeffrey Archer. I will not tolerate such behaviour in my party.&quot; On 4 February 2000, Archer was expelled from the party for five years.

==Perjury trial and imprisonment==

===Trial===
On 26 September 2000, Archer was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice during the 1987 libel trial. Ted Francis was charged with perverting the course of justice. Simultaneously, Archer starred in a production of his own courtroom play &quot;The Accused&quot;, staged at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal Haymarket. The play concerned the court trial of an alleged murderer and assigned the role of jury to the audience, which would vote on the guilt of Archer&#x27;s character at the end of each performance.

The perjury trial began on 30 May 2001, a month after Monica Coghlan&#x27;s death in a road traffic collision. Ted Francis claimed that Archer had asked him to provide a false alibi for the night Archer was alleged to have been with Monica Coghlan. Angela Peppiatt, Archer&#x27;s former personal assistant, also claimed Archer had fabricated an alibi in the 1987 trial. Peppiatt had kept a diary of Archer&#x27;s movements, which contradicted evidence given during the 1987 trial. Andrina Colquhoun, Archer&#x27;s former mistress, confirmed that they had been having an affair in the 1980s, thus contradicting the claim that he and Mary Archer had been &quot;happily married&quot; at the time of the trial.

Archer never spoke during the trial, though his wife Mary again gave evidence as she had done during the 1987 trial. On 19 July 2001, Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial. He was sentenced to four years&#x27; imprisonment by Mr Justice Potts. Francis was found not guilty. Prominent journalists admitted to having accepted Archer&#x27;s hospitality after he was convicted. Archer&#x27;s mother had died shortly before he was sentenced and he was released for the day to attend her funeral.

===Prison===
Archer was initially sent to HM Prison Belmarsh, a Category &quot;A&quot; prison, but was moved to HM Prison Wayland, a Category &quot;C&quot; prison in Norfolk, on 9 August 2001. Despite automatically qualifying as a category &quot;D&quot; prisoner, given it was a first conviction and he did not pose a serious risk of harm to the public, his status as such was suspended pending a police investigation into allegations about his Kurdish charity. He was then transferred to HM Prison North Sea Camp, an open prison, in October 2001. From there he was let out to work, briefly, at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, and allowed occasional home visits.

Media reports claimed he had abused this privilege by attending a lunch with a friend, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard. In September 2002 he was transferred to a Category &quot;B&quot; prison, Lincoln. After three weeks, he was moved to the Category &quot;D&quot; HM Prison Hollesley Bay in Suffolk.

During his imprisonment, Archer was visited by a number of high-profile friends, including actor Donald Sinden and entertainer Barry Humphries.

In October 2002, Archer repaid the &quot;Daily Star&quot; the £500,000 damages he had received in 1987, as well as legal costs and interest of £1.3 million. That month, he was suspended from Marylebone Cricket Club for seven years.

On 21 July 2003, Archer was released on licence from Hollesley Bay after serving half of his sentence.
He remained a peer, there being no legal provision through which his peerage could be removed at the time other than passing a new Act of Parliament. He also retained membership of the House of Lords, which did not then have the power to expel members; however, Archer did not take an active part in parliamentary proceedings until his retirement from the Lords on 4 July 2024. Politically, he was a non-affiliated member of the House of Lords.

===Prison diaries===
While in prison, Archer wrote the three-volume memoir &quot;A Prison Diary&quot;, with volumes fashioned after Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, and named after the first three prisons in which he was kept. His prison term also served as inspiration for nine of the 12 short stories in the collection &quot;Cat O&#x27; Nine Tales&quot;.

===Kurdish aid controversy===
In July 2001, shortly after Archer was jailed for perjury, Scotland Yard began investigating allegations that millions of pounds had disappeared from his Kurdish charity. In 1991, Archer had claimed to have raised £57,042,000. In 1992, the Kurdish Disaster Fund wrote to Archer, complaining: &quot;You must be concerned that the Kurdish refugees have seen hardly any of the huge sums raised in the west in their name.&quot; Kurdish groups claimed that little more than £250,000 had been received by groups in Iraq.

A British Red Cross-commissioned KPMG audit of the cash showed no donations were handled by Archer and any misappropriation was &quot;unlikely&quot;; however, KPMG also could find no evidence to support Archer&#x27;s claims to have raised £31.5 million from overseas governments. The police said they would launch a &quot;preliminary assessment of the facts&quot; from the audit but were not investigating the Simple Truth fund.

==Subsequent incidents==
In 2004, the government of Equatorial Guinea alleged that Archer was one of the financiers of the failed 2004 coup d&#x27;état attempt against it, citing bank details and telephone records as evidence. In 2009, Archer said: &quot;I am completely relaxed about it. Mr Mann [Simon Mann, the English mercenary leader of the coup] has made clear that it&#x27;s nothing to do with me.&quot; In 2011, Mann, imprisoned in Equatorial Guinea for his role in leading the failed 2004 coup d&#x27;état but released on humanitarian grounds later, told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that his forthcoming book, &quot;Cry Havoc&quot;, would reveal &quot;the financial involvement of a controversial and internationally famous member of the British House of Lords in the plot, backed up by banking records.&quot; He claimed documents from the bank accounts in Guernsey of two companies Mann used as vehicles for organising the coup, showed a &#x27;J H Archer&#x27; paying $135,000 into one of the firms.

==Personal life==
Archer has been married to Mary Weeden since July 1966. They met at Oxford University, where Weeden was studying chemistry at St Anne&#x27;s College. She went on to specialise in solar power.

They have two children: William Archer (born 1972), a theatrical producer, and James Archer (born 1974), a financial adviser and businessman.

In 1979, the Archers purchased the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, a house associated with the poet Rupert Brooke. Every summer, they host a lavish garden party in the grounds to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Following the near-bankruptcy of the Aquablast scandal, by the early 1980s, Archer was back in a comfortable financial position and began to hold shepherd&#x27;s pie and Krug parties for prominent people at his London penthouse, which overlooks the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament.

On 26 February 2006, on Andrew Marr&#x27;s &quot;Sunday AM&quot; programme, Archer said he had no interest in returning to front-line politics and would pursue his writing instead.

==Archer in fiction==
Archer was satirically portrayed as a misunderstood secret agent, saviour of Britain and mankind and &quot;overall thoroughly good chap&quot;, by actor Damian Lewis in the BBC drama &quot;Jeffrey Archer: The Truth&quot; (2002). Scriptwriter Guy Jenkin explained that &quot;my Jeffrey Archer is the man who has frequently saved Britain over the last 30 years. He&#x27;s beloved of all women he comes across, all men, all dogs—he&#x27;s a superhero.&quot; Ian Hislop and Nick Newman&#x27;s 1994 BBC Radio 4 satirical series &quot;Gush&quot; purported to be &quot;written by master storyteller Archie Jeffries&quot;.

In the Amazon series (originally a novel by Terry Pratchett &amp; Neil Gaiman) Good Omens, a reference is made by one of the angels in Aziraphale&#x27;s bookshop: &quot;Something smells evil.&quot; Aziraphale replies, &quot;Oh, that would be the Jeffrey Archer books, I&#x27;m afraid.&quot;

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Silence in the Library&quot;, the Doctor mentions that the Library has whole continents of Jeffrey Archer.

<doc id="16339" wikidata="Q7294" url="?curid=16339" title="Johannes Brahms">
<text>Johannes Brahms (; ; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer, virtuoso pianist, and conductor of the mid-Romantic period. His music is noted for its rhythmic vitality and freer treatment of dissonance, often set within studied yet expressive contrapuntal textures. He adapted the traditional structures and techniques of a wide historical range of earlier composers. His includes four symphonies, four concertos, a Requiem, much chamber music, and hundreds of folk-song arrangements and , among other works for symphony orchestra, piano, organ, and choir.

Born to a musical family in Hamburg, Brahms began composing and concertizing locally in his youth. He toured Central Europe as a pianist in his adulthood, premiering many of his own works and meeting Franz Liszt in Weimar. Brahms worked with Ede Reményi and Joseph Joachim, seeking Robert Schumann&#x27;s approval through the latter. He gained both Robert and Clara Schumann&#x27;s strong support and guidance. Brahms stayed with Clara in Düsseldorf, becoming devoted to her amid Robert&#x27;s insanity and institutionalization. The two remained close, lifelong friends after Robert&#x27;s death. Brahms never married, perhaps in an effort to focus on his work as a musician and scholar. He was a self-conscious, sometimes severely self-critical composer.

Though innovative, his music was considered relatively conservative within the polarized context of the War of the Romantics, an affair in which Brahms regretted his public involvement. His compositions were largely successful, attracting a growing circle of supporters, friends, and musicians. Eduard Hanslick celebrated them polemically as absolute music, and Hans von Bülow even cast Brahms as the successor of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven, an idea Richard Wagner mocked. Settling in Vienna, Brahms conducted the Singakademie and Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, programming the early and often &quot;serious&quot; music of his personal studies. He considered retiring from composition late in life but continued to write chamber music, especially for Richard Mühlfeld.

Brahms saw his music become internationally important in his own lifetime. His contributions and craftsmanship were admired by his contemporaries like Antonín Dvořák, whose music he enthusiastically supported, and a variety of later composers. Max Reger and Alexander Zemlinsky reconciled Brahms&#x27;s and Wagner&#x27;s often contrasted styles. So did Arnold Schoenberg, who emphasized Brahms&#x27;s &quot;progressive&quot; side. He and Anton Webern were inspired by the intricate structural coherence of Brahms&#x27;s music, including what Schoenberg termed its developing variation. It remains a staple of the concert repertoire, continuing to influence composers into the 21st century.

== Biography ==

===Youth (1833–1850)===

====Upbringing====
Brahms&#x27;s father, Johann Jakob Brahms, was from the town of Heide in Holstein. Against his family&#x27;s will, Johann Jakob pursued a career in music, arriving in Hamburg at age 19. He found work playing double bass for jobs; he also played in a sextet in the Alster-pavilion in Hamburg&#x27;s Jungfernstieg. In 1830, Johann Jakob was appointed as a horn player in the Hamburg militia. He married Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen the same year. A middle-class seamstress 17 years his senior, she enjoyed writing letters and reading despite an apparently limited education.

Johannes Brahms was born in 1833. His sister Elisabeth (Elise) had been born in 1831 and a younger brother Fritz Friedrich was born in 1835. The family then lived in poor apartments in the quarter of Hamburg and struggled economically. (Johann Jakob even considered emigrating to the United States when an impresario, recognizing Johannes&#x27;s talent, promised them fortune there.) Eventually Johann Jakob became a musician in the Philharmonisches Staatsorchester Hamburg playing double bass, horn, and flute. For enjoyment, he played first violin in string quartets. The family moved over the years to ever better accommodation in Hamburg.

====Training====
Johann Jakob gave his son his first musical training; Johannes also learnt to play the violin and the basics of playing the cello. From 1840 he studied piano with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel. Cossel complained in 1842 that Brahms &quot;could be such a good player, but he will not stop his never-ending composing.&quot;

At the age of 10, Brahms made his debut as a performer in a private concert including Beethoven&#x27;s quintet for piano and winds Op. 16 and a piano quartet by Mozart. He also played as a solo work an étude of Henri Herz. By 1845 he had written a piano sonata in G minor. His parents disapproved of his early efforts as a composer, feeling that he had better career prospects as a performer.

From 1845 to 1848 Brahms studied with Cossel&#x27;s teacher, the pianist and composer Eduard Marxsen. Marxsen had been a personal acquaintance of Beethoven and Schubert, admired the works of Mozart and Haydn, and was a devotee of the music of J. S. Bach. Marxsen conveyed to Brahms the tradition of these composers and ensured that Brahms&#x27;s own compositions were grounded in that tradition.

====Recitals====
In 1847 Brahms made his first public appearance as a solo pianist in Hamburg, playing a fantasy by Sigismund Thalberg. His first full piano recital, in 1848, included a fugue by Bach as well as works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain. A second recital in April 1849 included Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Waldstein&quot; sonata and a waltz fantasia of his own composition and garnered favourable newspaper reviews.

Persistent stories of the impoverished adolescent Brahms playing in bars and brothels have only anecdotal provenance, and many modern scholars dismiss them; the Brahms family was relatively prosperous, and Hamburg legislation very strictly forbade music in, or the admittance of minors to, brothels.

====Juvenilia====
Brahms&#x27;s juvenilia comprised piano music, chamber music and works for male voice choir. Under the pseudonym &#x27;G. W. Marks&#x27;, some piano arrangements and fantasies were published by the Hamburg firm of Cranz in 1849. The earliest of Brahms&#x27;s works which he acknowledged (his &quot;Scherzo&quot; Op. 4 and the song &quot;Heimkehr&quot; Op. 7 no. 6) date from 1851. However, Brahms was later assiduous in eliminating all his juvenilia. Even as late as 1880, he wrote to his friend Elise Giesemann to send him his manuscripts of choral music so that they could be destroyed.

===Early adulthood (1850–1862)===


====Collaboration and travel====
In 1850 Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was his introduction to &quot;gypsy-style&quot; music such as the &quot;csardas&quot;, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; (1869 and 1880). 1850 also marked Brahms&#x27;s first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann; during Schumann&#x27;s visit to Hamburg that year, friends persuaded Brahms to send the former some of his compositions, but the package was returned unopened.

In 1853 Brahms went on a concert tour with Reményi, visiting the violinist and composer Joseph Joachim at Hanover in May. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven&#x27;s violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played some of his own solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: &quot;Never in the course of my artist&#x27;s life have I been more completely overwhelmed&quot;. This was the beginning of a friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim&#x27;s wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883.

Brahms admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms&#x27;s words) &quot;double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever&quot;. Bozarth notes that &quot;products of Brahms&#x27;s study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included &quot;dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works&quot;.

After meeting Joachim, Brahms and Reményi visited Weimar, where Brahms met Franz Liszt, Peter Cornelius, and Joachim Raff, and where Liszt performed Brahms&#x27;s Op. 4 Scherzo at sight. Reményi claimed that Brahms then slept during Liszt&#x27;s performance of his own Sonata in B minor; this and other disagreements led Reményi and Brahms to part company.

====The Schumanns and Leipzig====
Brahms visited Düsseldorf in October 1853, and, with a letter of introduction from Joachim, was welcomed by the Schumanns. Robert, greatly impressed and delighted by the 20-year-old&#x27;s talent, published an article entitled &quot;Neue Bahnen&quot; (&quot;New Paths&quot;) in the 28 October issue of the journal &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; nominating Brahms as one who was &quot;fated to give expression to the times in the highest and most ideal manner&quot;.

This praise may have aggravated Brahms&#x27;s self-critical standards of perfection and dented his confidence. He wrote to Schumann in November 1853 that his praise &quot;will arouse such extraordinary expectations by the public that I don&#x27;t know how I can begin to fulfil them&quot;. While in Düsseldorf, Brahms participated with Schumann and Schumann&#x27;s pupil Albert Dietrich in writing a movement each of a violin sonata for Joachim, the &quot;F-A-E Sonata&quot;, the letters representing the initials of Joachim&#x27;s personal motto &quot;Frei aber einsam&quot; (&quot;Free but lonely&quot;).

Schumann&#x27;s accolade led to the first publication of Brahms&#x27;s works under his own name. Brahms went to Leipzig where Breitkopf &amp; Härtel published his Opp. 1–4 (the Piano Sonatas nos. 1 and 2, the Six Songs Op. 3, and the Scherzo Op. 4), whilst Bartholf Senff published the Third Piano Sonata Op. 5 and the Six Songs Op. 6. In Leipzig, he gave recitals including his own first two piano sonatas, and met with Ferdinand David, Ignaz Moscheles, and Hector Berlioz, among others.

After Schumann&#x27;s attempted suicide and subsequent confinement in a mental sanatorium near Bonn in February 1854 (where he died of pneumonia in 1856), Brahms based himself in Düsseldorf, where he supported the household and dealt with business matters on Clara&#x27;s behalf. Clara was not allowed to visit Robert until two days before his death, but Brahms was able to visit him and acted as a go-between.

Brahms began to feel deeply for Clara, who to him represented an ideal of womanhood. But he was conflicted about their romantic association and resisted it, choosing the life of a bachelor in an apparent effort to focus on his craft. Nonetheless, their intensely emotional relationship lasted until Clara&#x27;s death. In June 1854 Brahms dedicated to Clara his Op. 9, the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Schumann&quot;. Clara continued to support Brahms&#x27;s career by programming his music in her recitals.

====Early compositions, reception, and polemics====
After the publication of his Op. 10 Ballades for piano, Brahms published no further works until 1860. His major project of this period was the Piano Concerto in D minor, which he had begun as a work for two pianos in 1854 but soon realized needed a larger-scale format. Based in Hamburg at this time, he gained, with Clara&#x27;s support, a position as musician to the tiny court of Detmold, the capital of the Principality of Lippe, where he spent the winters of 1857 to 1860 and for which he wrote his two Serenades (1858 and 1859, Opp. 11 and 16). In Hamburg he established a women&#x27;s choir for which he wrote music and conducted. To this period also belong his first two Piano Quartets (Op. 25 and Op. 26) and the first movement of the third Piano Quartet, which eventually appeared in 1875.

The end of the decade brought professional setbacks for Brahms. The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in Hamburg on 22 January 1859, with the composer as soloist, was poorly received. Brahms wrote to Joachim that the performance was &quot;a brilliant and decisive – failure ... [I]t forces one to concentrate one&#x27;s thoughts and increases one&#x27;s courage ... But the hissing was too much of a good thing ...&quot; At a second performance, audience reaction was so hostile that Brahms had to be restrained from leaving the stage after the first movement. As a consequence of these reactions Breitkopf and Härtel declined to take on his new compositions. Brahms consequently established a relationship with other publishers, including Simrock, who eventually became his major publishing partner.

Brahms further made an intervention in 1860 in the debate on the future of German music which seriously misfired. Together with Joachim and others, he prepared an attack on Liszt&#x27;s followers, the so-called &quot;New German School&quot; (although Brahms himself was sympathetic to the music of Richard Wagner, the School&#x27;s leading light). In particular they objected to the rejection of traditional musical forms and to the &quot;rank, miserable weeds growing from Liszt-like fantasias&quot;. A draft was leaked to the press, and the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; published a parody which ridiculed Brahms and his associates as backward-looking. Brahms never again ventured into public musical polemics.

====Failed aspirations====
Brahms&#x27;s personal life was also troubled. In 1859 he became engaged to Agathe von Siebold. The engagement was soon broken off, but even after this Brahms wrote to her: &quot;I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters. Please write me ... whether ... I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, and tell you that I love you.&quot; They never saw one another again, and Brahms later confirmed to a friend that Agathe was his &quot;last love&quot;.

Brahms had hoped to be given the conductorship of the Hamburg Philharmonic, but in 1862 this post was given to baritone Julius Stockhausen. Brahms continued to hope for the post. But he demurred when he was finally offered the directorship in 1893, as he had &quot;got used to the idea of having to go along other paths&quot;.

===Maturity (1862–1876)===
====Move to Vienna====
In autumn 1862 Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter. Although Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home. In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Wiener Singakademie. He surprised his audiences by programming many works by the early German masters such as Heinrich Schütz and J. S. Bach, and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli; more recent music was represented by works of Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn. Brahms also wrote works for the choir, including his Motet, Op. 29. Finding however that the post encroached too much of the time he needed for composing, he left the choir in June 1864.

From 1864 to 1876 he spent many of his summers in Lichtental on the north side of Vienna, where Clara Schumann and her family also spent some time. His house in Lichtental, where he worked on many of his major compositions including &quot;A German Requiem&quot; and his middle-period chamber works, is preserved as a museum.

====Wagner and his circle====
In Vienna Brahms became an associate of two close members of Wagner&#x27;s circle, his earlier friend Peter Cornelius and Karl Tausig, and of Joseph Hellmesberger Sr. and Julius Epstein, respectively the Director and head of violin studies, and the head of piano studies, at the Vienna Conservatoire. Brahms&#x27;s circle grew to include the notable critic (and opponent of the &#x27;New German School&#x27;) Eduard Hanslick, the conductor Hermann Levi and the surgeon Theodor Billroth, who were to become among his greatest advocates.

In January 1863 Brahms met Richard Wagner for the first time, for whom he played his &quot;Handel Variations&quot; Op. 24, which he had completed the previous year. The meeting was cordial, although Wagner was in later years to make critical, and even insulting, comments on Brahms&#x27;s music. Brahms however retained at this time and later a keen interest in Wagner&#x27;s music, helping with preparations for Wagner&#x27;s Vienna concerts in 1862/63, and being rewarded by Tausig with a manuscript of part of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (which Wagner demanded back in 1875). The &quot;Handel Variations&quot; also featured, together with the first Piano Quartet, in his first Viennese recitals, in which his performances were better received by the public and critics than his music.

====Requiem and personal beliefs====
In February 1865 Brahms&#x27;s mother died, and he began to compose his large choral work &quot;A German Requiem&quot;, Op. 45, of which six movements were completed by 1866. Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo &quot;Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit&quot;) was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869). The work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahms&#x27;s arrival on the world stage.

Baptised into the Lutheran church as an infant and confirmed at age fifteen in St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Brahms has been described as an agnostic and a humanist. The devout Catholic Antonín Dvořák wrote in a letter: &quot;Such a man, such a fine soul – and he believes in nothing! He believes in nothing!&quot; When asked by conductor Karl Reinthaler to add additional explicitly religious text to his &quot;German Requiem&quot;, Brahms is reported to have responded, &quot;As far as the text is concerned, I confess that I would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human; also with my best knowledge and will I would dispense with passages like John 3:16. On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another because I am a musician, because I needed it, and because with my venerable authors I can&#x27;t delete or dispute anything. But I had better stop before I say too much.&quot;

====Mounting successes and failed romance====
Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot; (1869), the &quot;Liebeslieder Waltzes&quot;, Op. 52, (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46–49). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (1863–1868), his first two string quartets Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his first symphony which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.

During 1869, Brahms felt himself falling in love with the Schumanns&#x27; daughter Julie (then aged 24 to his 36). He did not declare himself. When later that year Julie&#x27;s engagement to Count Marmorito was announced, he wrote and gave to Clara the manuscript of his &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot; (Op. 53). Clara wrote in her diary that &quot;he called it &quot;his&quot; wedding song&quot; and noted &quot;the profound pain in the text and the music&quot;.

From 1872 to 1875, Brahms was director of the concerts of the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, where he ensured that the orchestra was staffed only by professionals. He conducted a repertoire noted and criticized for its emphasis on early and often &quot;serious&quot; music, running from Isaac, Bach, Handel, and Cherubini to the nineteenth century composers who were not of the New German School. Among these were Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Joachim, Ferdinand Hiller, Max Bruch and himself (notably his large scale choral works, the &quot;German Requiem&quot;, the &quot;Alto Rhapsody&quot;, and the patriotic &quot;Triumphlied&quot;, Op. 55, which celebrated Prussia&#x27;s victory in the 1870/71 Franco-Prussian War). 1873 saw the premiere of his orchestral &quot;Variations on a Theme by Haydn&quot;, originally conceived for two pianos, which has become one of his most popular works.

===Success (1876–1889)===
====First symphonies and orchestral music====
Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony, Op. 68, appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement had been announced by Brahms to Clara and to Albert Dietrich) in the early 1860s. During the decade it evolved very gradually; the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868. Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was &quot;long and difficult&quot;, &quot;not exactly charming&quot; and, significantly, &quot;long and in C Minor&quot;, which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear &quot;that Brahms was taking on the model of models [for a symphony]: Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth.&quot;

Despite the warm reception the First Symphony received, Brahms remained dissatisfied and extensively revised the second movement before the work was published. There followed a succession of well-received orchestral works: the Second Symphony Op. 73 (1877), the Violin Concerto Op. 77 (1878; dedicated to Joachim, who was consulted closely during its composition), and the &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot; (written following the conferring of an honorary degree by the University of Breslau) and &quot;Tragic Overture&quot; of 1880.

====Fame, criticism, and Dvořák====
In May 1876, Cambridge University offered to grant honorary degrees of Doctor of Music to both Brahms and Joachim, provided that they composed new pieces as &quot;theses&quot; and were present in Cambridge to receive their degrees. Brahms was averse to traveling to England and requested to receive the degree &#x27;in absentia&#x27;, offering as his thesis the previously performed (November 1876) symphony. But of the two, only Joachim went to England and was granted a degree. Brahms &quot;acknowledged the invitation&quot; by giving the manuscript score and parts of his First Symphony to Joachim, who led the performance at Cambridge 8 March 1877 (English premiere).

The commendation of Brahms by Breslau as &quot;the leader in the art of serious music in Germany today&quot; led to a bilious comment from Wagner in his essay &quot;On Poetry and Composition&quot;: &quot;I know of some famous composers who in their concert masquerades don the disguise of a street-singer one day, the hallelujah periwig of Handel the next, the dress of a Jewish Czardas-fiddler another time, and then again the guise of a highly respectable symphony dressed up as Number Ten&quot; (referring to Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony as a putative tenth symphony of Beethoven).

Brahms was now recognised as a major figure in the world of music. He had been on the jury which awarded the Vienna State Prize to the (then little-known) composer Antonín Dvořák three times, first in February 1875, and later in 1876 and 1877, and had successfully recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock. The two men met for the first time in 1877, and Dvořák dedicated to Brahms his String Quartet, Op. 34 of that year. He also began to be the recipient of a variety of honours: Ludwig II of Bavaria awarded him the Maximilian Order for Science and Art in 1874, and the music-loving Duke George of Meiningen awarded him the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of the House of Meiningen in 1881.

At this time Brahms also chose to change his image. Having been always clean-shaven, in 1878 he surprised his friends by growing a beard, writing in September to the conductor Bernhard Scholz: &quot;I am coming with a large beard! Prepare your wife for a most awful sight.&quot; The singer George Henschel recalled that after a concert &quot;I saw a man unknown to me, rather stout, of middle height, with long hair and a full beard. In a very deep and hoarse voice he introduced himself as &#x27;Musikdirektor Müller&#x27; ... an instant later, we all found ourselves laughing heartily at the perfect success of Brahms&#x27;s disguise.&quot; The incident also displays Brahms&#x27;s love of practical jokes.

In 1882 Brahms completed his Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83, dedicated to his teacher Marxsen. Brahms was invited by Hans von Bülow to undertake a premiere of the work with the Meiningen Court Orchestra. This was the beginning of his collaboration with Meiningen and with von Bülow, who was to rank Brahms as one of the &#x27;Three Bs&#x27;; in a letter to his wife he wrote: &quot;You know what I think of Brahms: after Bach and Beethoven the greatest, the most sublime of all composers.&quot;

====Later symphonies and continuing recognition====
The following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony, Op. 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony, Op. 98 (1885). Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms&#x27;s music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: &quot;a giant work, great in concept and invention&quot;. Another, but more cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler, who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance. He considered Brahms a conservative master who was more turned toward the past than the future. He rated Brahms as technically superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven.

In 1889, Theo Wangemann, a representative of the American inventor Thomas Edison, visited the composer in Vienna and invited him to make an experimental recording. Brahms played an abbreviated version of his first Hungarian Dance and of Josef Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Libelle&quot; on the piano. Although the spoken introduction to the short piece of music is quite clear, the piano playing is largely inaudible due to heavy surface noise.

In that same year, Brahms was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg.

===Old age (1889–1897)===
====Friendship with J. Strauss====
Brahms and Johann Strauss II were acquainted in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after. Brahms admired much of Strauss&#x27;s music and encouraged the composer to sign with his publisher Simrock. In autographing a fan for Strauss&#x27;s wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; waltz, adding the words &quot;unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms&quot;. He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Johann Strauss&#x27;s operetta &quot;Die Göttin der Vernunft&quot; (The Goddess of Reason) in March 1897.

====Late chamber music and songs====
After the successful Vienna premiere of his Second String Quintet, Op. 111 in 1890, the 57-year-old Brahms came to think that he might retire from composition, telling a friend that he &quot;had achieved enough; here I had before me a carefree old age and could enjoy it in peace.&quot; He also began to find solace in escorting the mezzo-soprano Alice Barbi and may have proposed to her (she was only 28). His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op. 114 (1891); Clarinet Quintet, Op. 115 (1891); and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120 (1894).

Brahms also wrote at this time his final cycles of piano pieces, Opp. 116–119 and the &quot;Vier ernste Gesänge&quot; (Four Serious Songs), Op. 121 (1896), which were prompted by the death of Clara Schumann and dedicated to the artist Max Klinger, who was his great admirer. The last of the Eleven Chorale Preludes for organ, Op. 122 (1896) is a setting of &quot;O Welt ich muss dich lassen&quot; (&quot;O world I must leave thee&quot;) and the last notes that Brahms wrote. Many of these works were written in his house in Bad Ischl, where Brahms had first visited in 1882 and where he spent every summer from 1889 onwards.

====Terminal illness====
In the summer of 1896 Brahms was diagnosed with jaundice and pancreatic cancer, and later in the year his Viennese doctor diagnosed him with liver cancer, from which his father Jakob had died. His last public appearance was on 7 March 1897, when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No. 4; there was an ovation after each of the four movements. His condition gradually worsened and he died on 3 April 1897, in Vienna at the age of 63. Brahms is buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery in Vienna, under a monument designed by Victor Horta with sculpture by Ilse von Twardowski.

==Music==

Though most of his music is vocal, Brahms&#x27;s major works are for orchestra, including four symphonies, two piano concertos (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in B-flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and the &quot;Academic Festival&quot; and &quot;Tragic&quot; Overtures. He also wrote two Serenades.

His large choral work &quot;A German Requiem&quot;—not a setting of the liturgical &quot;Missa pro defunctis&quot;, but a setting of texts which Brahms selected from the Luther Bible—was composed in three major periods of his life. An early version of the second movement was first composed in 1854 after Robert Schumann&#x27;s attempted suicide (and later used in his first piano concerto). Most of the Requiem was composed after Brahms&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death in 1865. He added the fifth movement after the 1868 premiere, and in 1869 the final work was published.

His works in variation form include the &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel&quot; and the &quot;Paganini Variations&quot;, both for solo piano, and the &quot;Variations on a Theme by Haydn&quot; (now sometimes called the &quot;Saint Anthony Variations&quot;) in versions for two pianos and for orchestra. The final movement of the Symphony No. 4 is a passacaglia.

His chamber works include three string quartets, two string quintets, two string sextets, a clarinet quintet, a clarinet trio, a horn trio, a piano quintet, three piano quartets, and four piano trios (the A-major trio being published posthumously). He composed several instrumental sonatas with piano, including three for violin, two for cello, and two for clarinet (which were subsequently arranged for viola by the composer). His solo piano works range from his early piano sonatas and ballades to his late sets of character pieces. His Eleven Chorale Preludes, Op. 122, written shortly before his death and published posthumously in 1902, have become an important part of the organ repertoire.

Brahms was an extreme perfectionist, which Schumann&#x27;s early enthusiasm only exacerbated. He destroyed many early work—including a violin sonata he had performed with Reményi and violinist Ferdinand David—and once claimed to have destroyed 20 string quartets before he issued his official First in 1873. Over the course of several years, he changed an original project for a symphony in D minor into his first piano concerto. In another instance of devotion to detail, he laboured over the official First Symphony for almost fifteen years, from about 1861 to 1876. Even after its first few performances, Brahms destroyed the original slow movement and substituted another before the score was published.

===Style, influences, and historiography===
The music of Brahms is known for its debts to the Viennese Classical and earlier traditions, including its use of traditional genres and forms (e.g., sonata form). In the shadow of Beethoven, Brahms and his contemporaries increasingly exploited harmonies and emphasized motifs as fundamental structural elements. The music of some of his contemporaries, especially the New German School, was more obviously innovative, virtuosic, and emotional or evocative, often with well defined dramatic or programmatic elements. In this context, many like Hanslick (and more recently Harold C. Schonberg) saw in Brahms a conservative or reactionary champion of tradition and absolute music.

Such views have been variously challenged or qualified. In terms of technique, Brahms&#x27;s use of developing variation, Carl Dahlhaus argued, was an expository procedure analogous to that of Liszt&#x27;s and Wagner&#x27;s modulating sequences. Though Brahms often wrote music without an explicit or public program, in his Symphony No. 4 alone he musically alluded to the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, the texted chaconne of Bach&#x27;s Cantata No. 150, and to Schumann&#x27;s music, from musical cryptograms of Clara to the Fantasie in C with its use of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;An die ferne Geliebte&quot;, perhaps intending these as ironic, autobiographical reflections on the work&#x27;s tragic character.

Most of his music was in fact vocal, including hundreds of folk-song arrangements and &quot;Lieder&quot; often about rural life. As was common from Schubert to Mahler, Brahms faithfully relied on such songs for melodic inspiration in his instrumental music from his very first opus, the Piano Sonata No. 1 (its Andante is based on a ). Though Brahms never wrote an opera, he was sometimes interested in composing one, and he admired Wagner&#x27;s music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner&#x27;s theory. In his Symphony No. 3, Brahms alluded to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in the first movement (mm. 31–35) and to &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; in the second (mm. 108–110).

Brahms considered giving up composition when it seemed that other composers&#x27; innovations in extended tonality resulted in the rule of tonality being broken altogether.

====Beethoven and the Viennese Classical tradition====
Brahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer&#x27;s home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven&#x27;s style. Brahms&#x27;s First Symphony bears the influence of Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth, for example, in struggling toward a C major triumph from C minor. The main theme of the finale of the First Symphony is also reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth, and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any dunce could see that. In 1876, when the work was premiered in Vienna, it was immediately hailed as &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Tenth&quot;. Indeed, the similarity of Brahms&#x27;s music to that of late Beethoven had first been noted as early as November 1853 in a letter from Albert Dietrich to Ernst Naumann.

Brahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn. He especially admired Mozart, so much so that in his final years he reportedly declared Mozart as the greatest composer. On 10 January 1896, Brahms conducted the Academic Festival Overture and both piano concertos in Berlin, and during the following celebration Brahms interrupted Joachim&#x27;s toast with &quot;Ganz recht; auf Mozart&#x27;s Wohl&quot; (Quite right; here&#x27;s Mozart&#x27;s health). Brahms also compared Mozart with Beethoven to the latter&#x27;s disadvantage, in a letter to Richard Heuberger in 1896: &quot;Dissonance, true dissonance as Mozart used it, is not to be found in Beethoven. Look at &quot;Idomeneo&quot;. Not only is it a marvel, but as Mozart was still quite young and brash when he wrote it, it was a completely new thing. You couldn&#x27;t commission great music from Beethoven since he created only lesser works on commission—his more conventional pieces, his variations and the like.&quot; Brahms collected first editions and autographs of Mozart and Haydn&#x27;s works and edited performing editions.

====Early Romantics====
Some early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer. During his stay in Vienna in 1862–63, Brahms became particularly interested in the music of Schubert. The latter&#x27;s influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op. 25 and Op. 26, and the Piano Quintet, which alludes to Schubert&#x27;s String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands.

Any influence of Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms is less obvious. Brahms perhaps alludes to Chopin&#x27;s Scherzo in B-flat minor in the Scherzo, Op. 4. In the Piano Sonata, Op. 5, scherzo, he may allude to the finale of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Piano Trio in C minor.
Brahms looked to older music, with its counterpoint, for inspiration. He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and Johann Sebastian Bach.

His friends included leading musicologists. He co-edited an edition of the works of François Couperin with Friedrich Chrysander. He also edited works by C. P. E. Bach and W. F. Bach.

Peter Phillips heard affinities between Brahms&#x27;s rhythmically charged, contrapuntal textures and those of Renaissance masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd. Referring to Byrd&#x27;s &quot;Though Amaryllis dance&quot;, Philips remarked that &quot;the cross-rhythms in this piece so excited E. H. Fellowes that he likened them to Brahms&#x27;s compositional style.&quot;

Some of Brahms&#x27;s music is modeled on Baroque sources, especially Bach (e.g., the fugal finale of Cello Sonata No. 1 on Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, the passacaglia theme of the Fourth Symphony&#x27;s finale on Bach&#x27;s Cantata No. 150).

====Textures====
Brahms was a master of counterpoint. &quot;For Brahms, ... the most complicated forms of counterpoint were a natural means of expressing his emotions,&quot; writes Geiringer. &quot;As Palestrina or Bach succeeded in giving spiritual significance to their technique, so Brahms could turn a canon in motu contrario or a canon per augmentationem into a pure piece of lyrical poetry.&quot; Writers on Brahms have commented on his use of counterpoint. For example, of Op. 9, &quot;Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann,&quot; Geiringer writes that Brahms &quot;displays all the resources of contrapuntal art&quot;. In the A major piano quartet Opus 26, Jan Swafford notes that the third movement is &quot;demonic-canonic, echoing Haydn&#x27;s famous minuet for string quartet called the &#x27;Witch&#x27;s Round. Swafford further opines that &quot;thematic development, counterpoint, and form were the dominant technical terms in which Brahms ... thought about music&quot;.

Allied to his skill in counterpoint was his subtle handling of rhythm and meter. Bozarth speculates that his contact with Hungarian and gypsy folk music as a teenager led to &quot;his lifelong fascination with the irregular rhythms, triplet figures and use of rubato&quot; in his compositions. The Hungarian Dances are among Brahms&#x27;s most-appreciated pieces. Michael Musgrave considered that only Stravinsky approached the advancement of his rhythmic thinking.

His use of counterpoint and rhythm is present in &quot;A German Requiem&quot;, a work that was partially inspired by his mother&#x27;s death in 1865 (at a time in which he composed a funeral march that was to become the basis of Part Two, &quot;Denn alles Fleisch&quot;), but which also incorporates material from a symphony which he started in 1854 but abandoned following Schumann&#x27;s suicide attempt. He once wrote that the Requiem &quot;belonged to Schumann&quot;. The first movement of this abandoned symphony was re-worked as the first movement of the First Piano Concerto.

===Performance practice===
Brahms played principally on German and Viennese pianos. In his early years he used a piano made by the Hamburg company Baumgarten &amp; Heins. Later, in 1864, he wrote to Clara about his attraction to instruments by Streicher. In 1873 he received a Streicher piano op. 6713 and kept it in his house until his death. He wrote to Clara: &quot;There [on my Streicher] I always know exactly what I write and why I write one way or another.&quot; Another instrument in Brahms&#x27;s possession was a Conrad Graf piano – a wedding present of the Schumanns, that Clara Schumann later gave to Brahms and which he kept until 1873.

In the 1880s for his public performances Brahms used a Bösendorfer several times. In his Bonn concerts he played on a Steinweg Nachfolgern in 1880 and a Blüthner in 1883. Brahms also used a Bechstein in several of his concerts: 1872 in Würzburg, 1872 in Cologne and 1881 in Amsterdam.

==Reception==

Brahms looked both backward and forward. His output was often bold in its exploration of harmony and textural elements, especially rhythm. As a result, he influenced composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies.

Brahms&#x27; symphonies are prominent in the standard repertoire of symphony orchestras; only Beethoven&#x27;s are more frequently performed. Brahms&#x27;s have often been measured against Beethoven&#x27;s.

Brahms often sent manuscripts to friends Billroth, Elisabeth von Herzogenberg, Joachim, and Clara Schumann for review. They noted its textures and frequent dissonances, which Brahms wrote (to Henschel) that he preferred on the strong beat, &quot;resolve[d] ... lightly and gently!&quot; In 1855, Clara felt Brahms&#x27;s harshness most distinguished his music from Robert&#x27;s. Billroth described Brahms&#x27;s dissonances as &quot;cutting&quot;, &quot;toxic&quot;, or (in the case of &quot;In stiller Nacht&quot;) &quot;divine&quot;. In 1855, Joachim noted &quot;steely harshness&quot; in the &quot;Benedictus&quot; of the &quot;Missa canonica&quot;, with its &quot;bold independence of the voices&quot;. But in 1856 he objected to &quot;extensive harshness&quot; in &quot;Geistliches Lied&quot;, telling Brahms: 

Some criticized Brahms&#x27;s music as overly academic, dense, or muddy. Even Hanslick criticized the First Symphony as academic. (He later praised the &quot;harmonic and contrapuntal art&quot; of the Fourth Symphony&#x27;s passacaglia.) Elisabeth von Herzogenberg initially considered the Fourth&#x27;s first movement a &quot;work of [the] brain ... designed too much&quot; (her opinion improved within weeks). Arnold Schoenberg would later defend Brahms: &quot;It is not the heart alone which creates all that is beautiful [or] emotional&quot;. Benjamin Britten lost his taste for Brahms&#x27;s &quot;thickness of texture&quot; and studied expressivity.

Schoenberg and others, among them Theodor W. Adorno and Carl Dahlhaus, sought to advance Brahms&#x27;s reputation in the early and mid-20th century against the criticisms of Paul Bekker and Wagner. For Brahms&#x27;s centenary in 1933, Schoenberg wrote and broadcast an essay &quot;Brahms the Progressive&quot; (rev. 1947, pub. 1950), establishing Brahms&#x27;s historical continuity (perhaps self-servingly). Schoenberg portrayed him as a forward-looking innovator, somewhat polemically against the image of Brahms as an academic traditionalist. He highlighted Brahms&#x27;s fondness for motivic saturation and irregularities of rhythm and phrase, terming Brahms&#x27;s compositional principles &quot;developing variation&quot;. In &quot;Structural Functions of Harmony&quot; (1948), Schoenberg analyzed Brahms&#x27;s &quot;enriched harmony&quot; and exploration of remote tonal regions.

===Influence===

Within his lifetime, Brahms&#x27;s idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, who strongly admired his music, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen, as well as on Gustav Jenner, who was his only formal composition pupil. Antonín Dvořák, who received substantial assistance from Brahms, deeply admired his music and was influenced by it in several works, such as the Symphony No. 7 in D minor and the F minor Piano Trio.

Features of the &quot;Brahms style&quot; were absorbed in a more complex synthesis with other contemporary (chiefly Wagnerian) trends by Hans Rott, Wilhelm Berger, Max Reger and Franz Schmidt, whereas the British composers Hubert Parry and Edward Elgar and the Swede Wilhelm Stenhammar all testified to learning much from Brahms. As Elgar said, &quot;I look at the Third Symphony of Brahms, and I feel like a pygmy.&quot; In France, Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s music showed Brahmsian concern for rhythm and texture; in Russia, Sergei Taneyev was called &quot;the Russian Brahms&quot;; and in the United States, Amy Beach&#x27;s musical textures were noted for their Brahmsian richness.

Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s early music shows much Brahmsian influence, and Brahms took an interest in him, though Busoni later tended to disparage Brahms. Towards the end of his life, Brahms offered substantial encouragement to Ernst von Dohnányi and to Alexander von Zemlinsky. Their early chamber works, those of Béla Bartók (who was friendly with Dohnányi), show a thoroughgoing absorption of the Brahmsian idiom.

====Second Viennese School====
Zemlinsky in turn taught Schoenberg, and Brahms was apparently impressed when in 1897 Zemlinsky showed him drafts of two movements of Schoenberg&#x27;s early D-major quartet. Webern and later Walter Frisch identified Brahms&#x27;s influence in the dense, cohesive textures and variation techniques of Schoenberg&#x27;s first quartet.

In 1937, Schoenberg orchestrated Brahms&#x27;s Piano Quartet No. 1 as an exercise suggested by Otto Klemperer to break writer&#x27;s block; Klemperer regarded it as better than the original. (George Balanchine later set it to dance in &quot;Brahms–Schoenberg Quartet&quot;.)

In Anton Webern&#x27;s 1933 lectures, posthumously published under the title &quot;The Path to the New Music&quot;, he claimed Brahms as one who had anticipated the developments of the Second Viennese School. Webern&#x27;s 1908 Passacaglia, Op. 1, is clearly in part a homage to, and development of, the variation techniques of the passacaglia-finale of Brahms&#x27;s Fourth Symphony. Ann Scott argued Brahms anticipated the procedures of the serialists by redistributing melodic fragments between instruments, as in the first movement of the Clarinet Sonata, Op. 120, No. 2.

====Later composers====
Still later composers, like Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and György Ligeti paid respect to Brahms in their music, especially in terms of their treatment of meter, motives, rhythm, or texture. More recently, composers like Wolfgang Rihm (e.g., Klavierstück Nr. 6, &quot;Brahmsliebewalzer&quot;, &quot;Ernster Gesang&quot;, &quot;Das Lesen der Schrift&quot;, Symphonie &quot;Nähe Fern&quot;) and Thomas Adès (e.g., &quot;Brahms&quot;) also engaged with Brahms&#x27;s music, often as seen through Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;progressive&quot; lens.

===Memorials===
On 14 September 2000, Brahms was honoured in the Walhalla, a German hall of fame. He was introduced there as the 126th &quot;&quot; [honorably distinguished German] and 13th composer among them, with a bust by sculptor .

<text>Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (, ; ; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, political activist, biographer, and literary critic, considered a leading figure in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism. Sartre was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism (and phenomenology). His work has influenced sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies. He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honors and that &quot;a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution.&quot;

Sartre held an open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the cultural and social assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered bourgeois, in both lifestyles and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive conformity (&quot;mauvaise foi&quot;, literally, &#x27;bad faith&#x27;) and an &quot;authentic&quot; way of &quot;being&quot; became the dominant theme of Sartre&#x27;s early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Être et le Néant&quot;, 1943). Sartre&#x27;s introduction to his philosophy is his work &quot;Existentialism Is a Humanism&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;existentialisme est un humanisme&quot;, 1946), originally presented as a lecture.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Jean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in Paris as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the French Navy, and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer). When Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in Indochina. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents&#x27; house in Meudon, where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to classical literature at a very early age. When he was twelve, Sartre&#x27;s mother remarried, and the family moved to La Rochelle, where he was frequently bullied, in part due to the wandering of his blind right eye (sensory exotropia).

As a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading Henri Bergson&#x27;s essay &quot;Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness&quot;. He attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school in Paris. He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his &quot;&quot; (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) in Paris at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS), an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals. (His 1928 MA thesis under the title &quot;L&#x27;Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature&quot; [&quot;Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature&quot;] was supervised by Henri Delacroix.) It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with Raymond Aron. Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre&#x27;s philosophical development was his weekly attendance at Alexandre Kojève&#x27;s seminars, which continued for a number of years.

From his first years in the École normale, Sartre was one of its fiercest pranksters. In 1927, his antimilitarist satirical cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with Georges Canguilhem, particularly upset the director Gustave Lanson. In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland, he organized a media prank following Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers, including &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot;, announced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious spectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh look-alike. The scandal led Lanson to resign.

In 1929 at the École normale, he met Simone de Beauvoir, who studied at the Sorbonne and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship, though they were not monogamous. The first time Sartre took the agrégation, he failed. He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded first place, with Beauvoir second.

From 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various lycées of Le Havre (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day , 1931–1936), Laon (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the Lycée Pasteur, 1937–1939, and at the Lycée Condorcet, 1941–1944; see below).

In 1932, Sartre read &quot;Voyage au bout de la nuit&quot; by Louis-Ferdinand Céline, a book that had a remarkable influence on him.

In 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the Institut français d&#x27;Allemagne in Berlin where he studied Edmund Husserl&#x27;s phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read Emmanuel Levinas&#x27;s &quot;Théorie de l&#x27;intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl&quot; (&quot;The Theory of Intuition in Husserl&#x27;s Phenomenology&quot;).

The neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;.

===World War II===
In 1939, Sartre was drafted into the French Army, where he served as a meteorologist. He was captured by German troops in 1940 in Padoux, and he spent nine months as a prisoner of war—in Nancy and finally in , Trier, where he wrote his first theatrical piece, &quot;Barionà, fils du tonnerre&quot;, a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot;, later to become a major influence on his own essay on phenomenological ontology. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and exotropia affected his balance), Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist. Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris and settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941, he was given a position, previously held by a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by Vichy law, at Lycée Condorcet in Paris.
After coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group &quot;Socialisme et Liberté&quot; (&quot;Socialism and Liberty&quot;) with other writers Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Toussaint Desanti, Dominique Desanti, Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with &quot;cheerful ferocity&quot; at a meeting that the &quot;Socialisme et Liberté&quot; assassinate prominent war collaborators like Marcel Déat, but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as &quot;none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades&quot;. The British historian Ian Ousby observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General Otto von Stülpnagel, and the popular slogan always was &quot;Death to Laval!&quot; rather than &quot;Death to Hitler!&quot;. In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of André Gide and André Malraux. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre&#x27;s disappointment and discouragement. &quot;Socialisme et liberté&quot; soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, &quot;The Flies&quot;, and &quot;No Exit&quot;, none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.

In his essay &quot;Paris under the Occupation&quot;, Sartre wrote that the &quot;correct&quot; behaviour of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural:

Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark &quot;We could not be &quot;natural&quot;&quot;. French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation. Ousby wrote: &quot;But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre&#x27;s worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life&quot;. Sartre wrote the very &quot;correctness&quot; of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the &quot;correct&quot; behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one&#x27;s day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the &quot;New Order in Europe&quot;, which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.

Throughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France, and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany. Sartre wrote about the &quot;languid existence&quot; of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing: &quot;Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life&quot;. Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvoir living in Anjou. The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay, full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat. Sartre also remarked that conversations at the Café de Flore between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a &quot;&quot; (informer) or a writer of the &quot;&quot; (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship. Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the &quot;Abwehr&quot; alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as &quot;mouches&quot; while by 1942 the Paris &quot;Kommandantur&quot; was receiving an average of 1,500 letters per day sent by the &quot;corbeaux&quot;.

Sartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a &quot;sham&quot;, resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone. Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris &quot;was peopled by the absent&quot;. Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation, writing:

Sartre wrote the &quot;feldgrau&quot; (&quot;field grey&quot;) uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called &quot;a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians&quot;. Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans &quot;les autres&quot; (&quot;the others&quot;), which inspired Sartre&#x27;s aphorism in his play &quot;Huis clos&quot; (&quot;No Exit&quot;) of &quot;l&#x27;enfer, c&#x27;est les Autres&quot; (&quot;Hell is other people&quot;). Sartre intended the line &quot;l&#x27;enfer, c&#x27;est les Autres&quot; at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.

Sartre was a very active contributor to &quot;Combat&quot;, a newspaper created during the clandestine period by Albert Camus, a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Rebel&quot;. Sartre wrote extensively post-war about neglected minority groups, namely French Jews and black people. In 1946, he published &quot;Anti-Semite and Jew,&quot; after having published the first part of the essay, &quot;Portrait de l&#x27;antisémite&quot;, the year before in &quot;Les Temps modernes, No. 3.&quot; In the essay, in the course of explaining the etiology of &quot;hate&quot; as the hater&#x27;s projective fantasies when reflecting on the Jewish question, he attacks antisemitism in France during a time when the Jews who came back from concentration camps were quickly abandoned. In 1947, Sartre published several articles concerning the condition of African Americans in the United States—specifically the racism and discrimination against them in the country—in his second &quot;Situations&quot; collection. Then, in 1948, for the introduction of Léopold Sédar Senghor&#x27;s &quot;l&#x27;Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache (Anthology of New Negro and Malagasy Poetry)&quot;, he wrote &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; (re-published in &quot;Situations III),&quot; a critique of colonialism and racism in light of the philosophy Sartre developed in &quot;Being and Nothingness.&quot; Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant Vladimir Jankelevitch criticized Sartre&#x27;s lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.

In 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the rue Bonaparte, where he was to produce most of his subsequent work and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political review, &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot; (&quot;Modern Times&quot;), in part to popularize his thought. He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, &quot;Les Chemins de la Liberté&quot; (&quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;) (1945–1949).

===Cold War politics and anticolonialism===

The first period of Sartre&#x27;s career, defined in large part by &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the Resistance after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the &quot;résistants&quot; were a &quot;band of brothers&quot; who had enjoyed &quot;real freedom&quot; in a way that did not exist before nor after the war. Sartre was &quot;merciless&quot; in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach from being executed. His 1948 play &quot;Les mains sales&quot; (&quot;Dirty Hands&quot;) in particular explored the problem of being a politically &quot;engaged&quot; intellectual. He embraced Marxism but did not join the Communist Party. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as &quot;provincial&quot; and in a 1949 essay called for a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;. In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal &quot;Politique étrangère&quot;, Sartre wrote:

About the Korean War, Sartre wrote: &quot;I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans&quot;. In July 1950, Sartre wrote in &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot; about his and de Beauvoir&#x27;s attitude to the Soviet Union:

Sartre held that the Soviet Union was a &quot;revolutionary&quot; state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of &quot;bourgeois&quot; states were due to their innate shortcomings. The Swiss journalist François Bondy wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre&#x27;s numerous essays, speeches and interviews &quot;a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary&quot; and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges &quot;may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power&quot;, deeming Sartre&#x27;s position to be &quot;existentialist&quot;.

Sartre believed at this time in the moral superiority of the Eastern Bloc, arguing that this belief was necessary &quot;to keep hope alive&quot; and opposed any criticism of Soviet Union to the extent that Maurice Merleau-Ponty called him an &quot;ultra-Bolshevik&quot;. Sartre&#x27;s expression &quot;workers of Billancourt must not be deprived of their hopes&quot; (Fr. &quot;il ne faut pas désespérer Billancourt&quot;), became a catchphrase meaning communist activists should not tell the whole truth to the workers in order to avoid decline in their revolutionary enthusiasm.

In 1954, just after Stalin&#x27;s death, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a &quot;complete freedom of criticism&quot; while condemning the United States for sinking into &quot;prefascism&quot;. Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers&#x27; Union &quot;still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books&quot;. Sartre&#x27;s comments on Hungarian revolution of 1956 are quite representative to his frequently contradictory and changing views. On one hand, Sartre saw in Hungary a true reunification between intellectuals and workers only to criticize it for &quot;losing socialist base&quot;.

In 1964 Sartre attacked Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot; which condemned the Stalinist repressions and purges. Sartre argued that &quot;the masses were not ready to receive the truth&quot;.

In 1969 Sartre, along with other fifteen prominent French writers, including Louis Aragon and Michel Butor, signed the letter of protest against the expulsion of &quot;the writer most representative of the great Russian tradition, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn – already a victim of Stalinist repression&quot;, from the Union of Soviet Writers.

In 1973 he argued that &quot;revolutionary authority always needs to get rid of some people that threaten it, and their death is the only way&quot;. A number of people, starting from Frank Gibney in 1961, classified Sartre as a &quot;useful idiot&quot; due to his uncritical position.

Sartre came to admire the Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, a man who favored a &quot;Polish road to socialism&quot; and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue. Sartre&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot; devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms. Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sartre&#x27;s &quot;ultra Bolshevism&quot; as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader Mao Zedong as the man who led the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.

As an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the FLN in the Algerian War and was one of the signatories of the &quot;Manifeste des 121&quot;. Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary Organisation armée secrète (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early &#x27;60s. He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the Algerian War of Independence. (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and, along with Bertrand Russell and others, organized a tribunal intended to expose U.S. war crimes, which became known as the Russell Tribunal in 1967.
His work after Stalin&#x27;s death, the &quot;Critique de la raison dialectique&quot; (&quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot;), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the &quot;Critique&quot; Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx&#x27;s notion of &quot;class&quot; as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre&#x27;s emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, Louis Althusser, who claimed that the ideas of the young Marx were decisively superseded by the &quot;scientific&quot; system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by Frantz Fanon started to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the &quot;real damned of the earth&quot;, who would carry out the revolution. A major theme of Sartre&#x27;s political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the &quot;Americanization&quot; of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.

Sartre was a sponsor of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. He went to Cuba in the 1960s to meet Fidel Castro and spoke with Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara. After Guevara&#x27;s death, Sartre would declare him to be &quot;not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age&quot; and the &quot;era&#x27;s most perfect man&quot;. Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that &quot;he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel&quot;. However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro&#x27;s government, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: &quot;In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals&quot;.

During a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited Red Army Faction member Andreas Baader in Stammheim Prison and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.

Towards the end of his life, Sartre began to describe himself as a &quot;special kind&quot; of anarchist.

===Late life and death===

In 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, &quot;Les Mots&quot; (&quot;The Words&quot;). The book is an ironic counterblast to Marcel Proust, whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of André Gide (who had provided the model of &quot;littérature engagée&quot; for Sartre&#x27;s generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize, and remains one of only two laureates to do so. According to Lars Gyllensten, in the book &quot;Minnen, bara minnen&quot; (&quot;Memories, Only Memories&quot;) published in 2000, Sartre himself or someone close to him got in touch with the Swedish Academy in 1975 with a request for the prize money, but was refused. In 1945, he had refused the Légion d&#x27;honneur. The Nobel prize was announced on 22 October 1964; on 14 October, Sartre had written a letter to the Nobel Institute, asking to be removed from the list of nominees, and warning that he would not accept the prize if awarded, but the letter went unread; on 23 October, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; published a statement by Sartre explaining his refusal. He said he did not wish to be &quot;transformed&quot; by such an award, and did not want to take sides in an East vs. West cultural struggle by accepting an award from a prominent Western cultural institution. Nevertheless, he was that year&#x27;s prizewinner. 
Though his name was then a household word (as was &quot;existentialism&quot; during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the May 1968 strikes in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for civil disobedience. President Charles de Gaulle intervened and pardoned him, commenting that &quot;you don&#x27;t arrest Voltaire&quot;.
In 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:

Sartre&#x27;s physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of amphetamine) he put himself through during the writing of the &quot;Critique&quot; and a massive analytical biography of Gustave Flaubert (&quot;The Family Idiot&quot;), both of which remained unfinished. He had hypertension, and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious chain smoker, which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.

Sartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from pulmonary edema. He had not wanted to be buried at Père-Lachaise Cemetery between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at Montparnasse Cemetery. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto boulevard du Montparnasse to accompany Sartre&#x27;s cortege. The funeral started at &quot;the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre&#x27;s haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet&quot;. Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate. Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.

==Thought==
Sartre&#x27;s primary idea is that people, as humans, are &quot;condemned to be free&quot;. He explained, &quot;This may seem paradoxical because condemnation is normally an external judgment which constitutes the conclusion of a judgment. Here, it is not the human who has chosen to be like this. There is a contingency of human existence. It is a condemnation of their being. Their being is not determined, so it is up to everyone to create their own existence, for which they are then responsible. They cannot not be free, there is a form of necessity for freedom, which can never be given up.&quot;
This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the paper cutter. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;. This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one&#x27;s own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. &quot;We are left alone, without excuse.&quot; &quot;We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us.&quot;

Sartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience &quot;death consciousness&quot; so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge. Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world. In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence. &quot;We can oppose authenticity to an inauthentic way of being. Authenticity consists in experiencing the indeterminate character of existence in anguish. It is also to know how to face it by giving meaning to our actions and by recognizing ourselves as the author of this meaning. On the other hand, an inauthentic way of being consists in running away, in lying to oneself in order to escape this anguish and the responsibility for one&#x27;s own existence.&quot;

While Sartre had been influenced by Heidegger, the publication of &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; did mark a split in their perspectives, with Heidegger remarking in &quot;Letter on Humanism:&quot;

Herbert Marcuse also had issues with Sartre&#x27;s metaphysical interpretation of human existence in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; and suggested the work projected anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: 

Sartre also took inspiration from phenomenological epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: &quot;Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances.&quot; Also important is Sartre&#x27;s analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions. &quot;When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself.&quot; However his critique of psychoanalysis, particularly of Freud has faced some counter-critique. Richard Wollheim and Thomas Baldwin argued that Sartre&#x27;s attempt to show that Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.

==Career as public intellectual==

While the broad focus of Sartre&#x27;s life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944–1945. Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: &quot;Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined [with] women. He wrote. And he was published.&quot; Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where &quot;the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out&quot;.

The war opened Sartre&#x27;s eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: &quot;the world itself destroyed Sartre&#x27;s illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time.&quot; Returning to Paris in 1941, he formed the &quot;Socialisme et Liberté&quot; resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers&#x27; Resistance group, in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this &quot;crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature&quot;.

The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre&#x27;s work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;, in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment. Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.

During the trial of Robert Brasillach Sartre was among a small number of prominent intellectuals advocating for his execution for &#x27;intellectual crimes&#x27;.

Sartre&#x27;s philosophy lent itself to his being a public intellectual. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true existential fashion, &quot;culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention.&quot; This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a pragmatist, willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in human freedom, preferring to retain a pacifist&#x27;s objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work &quot;subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines&quot;. Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: &quot;the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world.&quot;

Sartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the French Communist Party (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the Liberation the PCF were infuriated by Sartre&#x27;s philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre&#x27;s own existentialism. From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its &quot;authoritarian tendencies&quot;. In the late 1960s Sartre supported the Maoists, a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties. However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: &quot;If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist.&quot; He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.

In the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which &quot;reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there&quot;. The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre&#x27;s opinion, the &quot;traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior&quot;, but there is &quot;a recognition that the new technological &#x27;mass media&#x27; forms must be embraced&quot; if Sartre&#x27;s ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of bourgeois political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.

The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.

Sartre&#x27;s role as a public intellectual occasionally put him in physical danger, such as in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian self-determination at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists&#x27; position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from Oran, Algeria.

Sartre&#x27;s role in this conflict included his comments in his preface to Frantz Fanon&#x27;s &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; that, &quot;To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man&quot;. This comment led to some criticisms from the right, such as by Brian C. Anderson and Michael Walzer. Writing for &quot;Dissent&quot;, Walzer suggested that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.

However Sartre&#x27;s stances regarding post-colonial conflict have not been entirely without controversy on the left; Sartre&#x27;s preface is omitted from some editions of &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; printed after 1967. The reason for this is for his public support for Israel in the Six-Day War. Fanon&#x27;s widow, Josie considered Sartre&#x27;s pro-Israel stance as inconsistent with the anti-colonialist position of the book, from which his preface was eventually omitted. When interviewed at Howard University in 1978, she explained &quot;when Israel declared war on the Arab countries [during the Six-Day War], there was a great pro-Zionist movement in favor of Israel among western (French) intellectuals. Sartre took part in this movement. He signed petitions favoring Israel. I felt that his pro-Zionist attitudes were incompatible with Fanon&#x27;s work&quot;. Recent reprints of Fanon&#x27;s book have generally included Sartre&#x27;s preface.

==Literature==
Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, &quot;Huis-clos&quot; (&quot;No Exit&quot;), contains the famous line &quot;L&#x27;enfer, c&#x27;est les autres&quot;, usually translated as &quot;Hell is other people.&quot; Aside from the impact of &quot;Nausea&quot;, Sartre&#x27;s major work of fiction was &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot; trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre&#x27;s ideas. In this way, &quot;Roads to Freedom&quot; presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to existentialism.

John Huston got Sartre to script his film &quot;&quot;. However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film&#x27;s credits. Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre&#x27;s script survive in the finished film.

Despite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre&#x27;s literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Church placed Sartre&#x27;s &quot;œuvre&quot; on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (List of Prohibited Books).

==Allegations of sexual abuse==

In 1993, French author Bianca Lamblin (originally Bianca Bienenfeld) wrote in her book &quot;Mémoires d&#x27;une jeune fille dérangée&quot; (Memoirs of a deranged girl, published in English under the title &quot;A Disgraceful Affair&quot;) of her sexual exploitation by Sartre and Beauvoir. Lamblin claims that, while a student at Lycée Molière, she was sexually exploited by her teacher Beauvoir, who introduced her to Sartre a year later. Bianca wrote her &quot;Mémoires&quot; in response to the posthumous 1990 publication of Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Lettres au Castor et à quelques autres: 1926–1963&quot; (Letters to Castor and other friends), in which she noted that she was referred to by the pseudonym Louise Védrine.

Sartre and Beauvoir frequently followed this pattern, in which Beauvoir would seduce female students and then pass them on to Sartre.

<text>John Paul Jones (born John Paul; July 6, 1747 – July 18, 1792) was a Scottish Naval Officer who served in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War. Often referred to as the &quot;Father of the American Navy&quot;, Jones is regarded by several commentators as one of the greatest naval commanders in the military history of the United States. Born in Arbigland, Kirkcudbrightshire, Jones became a sailor at the age of thirteen, and served in the British Merchant Navy, including several slave ships. He referred to the British slave trade as “abominable trade”. After killing a mutinous subordinate, he fled to the British colony of Virginia to avoid being arrested and in joined the newly established Continental Navy.

During the ensuing war with Great Britain, Jones participated in several naval engagements with the British Royal Navy. Commanding the warship &quot;Ranger&quot;, Jones conducted a naval campaign in the North Sea, attacking British merchant shipping and other civilian targets. As part of the campaign, he raided the English town of Whitehaven, won the North Channel Naval Duel and fought at the Battle of Flamborough Head, gaining him an international reputation. Left without a command in 1787, Jones joined the Imperial Russian Navy and rose to the rank of rear admiral. However, after he was accused of raping a 10-year-old girl, Katerina Stepanova, he was forced out of the Russian navy and soon died in Paris at the age of 45. A Freemason, Jones made many friends among U.S. political elites, including John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.

==Early life and training==

John Paul, as he was then known, was born on the estate of Arbigland near Kirkbean in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright on the southwest coast of Scotland. His parents had married on November 29, 1733, in New Abbey, Kirkcudbrightshire.

John Paul started his maritime career when he was 13, sailing out of Whitehaven in the northern English county of Cumberland as apprentice aboard &quot;Friendship&quot; under Captain Benson. Paul&#x27;s older brother William Paul had married and settled in Fredericksburg, Colony of Virginia. Virginia was the destination of many of the younger Paul&#x27;s voyages.

For several years, Paul served in the British Merchant Navy, sailing aboard several merchantmen and slave ships, including the &quot;King George&quot; in 1764 (age 17) as third mate and &quot;Two Friends&quot; as first mate in 1766 (age 19). Once John Paul matured, he grew dissatisfied in slavery, and in 1768, he abandoned his prestigious position on the profitable &quot;Two Friends&quot; while docked in the British colony of Jamaica. He found his own passage back to Scotland and eventually obtained another position.

John Paul&#x27;s career was quickly and unexpectedly advanced during his next voyage aboard the brig &quot;John&quot;, which sailed from port in 1768, when both the captain and a ranking mate suddenly died of yellow fever. With the crew encouraging and voting him to, Paul managed to navigate the ship back to a safe port, and in reward for this feat the vessel&#x27;s grateful Scottish owners made him master of the ship and its crew, giving him ten percent of the cargo. He led two voyages to the West Indies before running into difficulty.

During his second voyage in 1770, John Paul had one of his crew flogged after trying to start a mutiny about early payment of wages, leading to accusations that his discipline was &quot;unnecessarily cruel&quot;. These claims were initially dismissed, but his favorable reputation was destroyed when the sailor died a few weeks later. John Paul was arrested for his involvement in the man&#x27;s death. He was imprisoned in Kirkcudbright Tolbooth but later released on bail. The negative effect of this episode on his reputation is indisputable. The local governor encouraged John Paul to leave the area and change his name while on bail. The man who died of his injuries was not a usual sailor but an adventurer from a very influential Scottish family.

Leaving Scotland, John Paul commanded a London-registered vessel named &quot;Betsy&quot;, a West Indiaman mounting 22 guns, engaging in commercial speculation in Tobago for about 18 months. This came to an end, however, when he killed a mutinous crew member with a sword in a dispute over wages. Years later, in a letter to Benjamin Franklin describing the incident, John Paul claimed that the killing was committed in self-defense, but he was not willing to wait to be tried in an Admiral&#x27;s Court, which would have taken months to assemble, and where the family of his first victim had been influential.

He felt compelled to flee. There is an 18-month gap in Jones&#x27;s history, and some biographers explore the possibility that in order to escape Tobago, he may have become a pirate. Rumors of piracy followed him, but may have been created by his detractors. But he eventually reappeared in Fredericksburg, Virginia, leaving his fortune behind; he also sought to arrange the affairs of his brother, who had died there without leaving any immediate family. He was granted land in Frederick County, Virginia. About this time, John Paul assumed the surname of Jones (in addition to his original surname). There is a long-held tradition in the state of North Carolina that John Paul adopted the name &quot;Jones&quot; in honor of Willie Jones of Halifax, North Carolina. Jones courted Dorothea Spotswood Dandridge, the future bride of Patrick Henry, and made a valuable friendship with Dr. John K. Read during his time in Virginia. In the summer of 1775, Jones met Joseph Hewes and other revolutionary leaders in Philadelphia.

From that period, America became &quot;the country of his fond election&quot;, as he afterwards expressed himself to Baron Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol. It was not long afterward that John Paul Jones joined the American navy to fight against Britain.

==Naval career==

===American colonies===
Sources struggle with this period of Jones&#x27;s life, especially the specifics of his family situation, making it difficult to pinpoint historically Jones&#x27;s motivations for emigrating to America. It is not known whether his plans were not developing as expected for the plantation or if he was inspired by a revolutionary spirit. It is known that he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1774.

Jones left for Philadelphia shortly after settling in North America to volunteer his services around 1775 to the newly founded Continental Navy, precursor to the United States Navy. During this time, the Navy and Marines were being formally established, and suitable ship&#x27;s officers and captains were in great demand. Jones&#x27;s potential would likely have gone unrecognized were it not for the endorsement of Richard Henry Lee, who knew of his abilities. With help from influential members of the Continental Congress, Jones was appointed as a 1st Lieutenant of the newly converted 24-gun frigate in the Continental Navy on December 7, 1775. 

===Revolutionary War command===

====Early command====
Jones sailed from the Delaware River in February 1776 aboard &quot;Alfred&quot; on the Continental Navy&#x27;s maiden cruise. It was aboard this vessel that Jones took the honour of hoisting the first U.S. ensign, the Grand Union Flag, over a naval vessel.

The fleet had been expected to cruise along the coast but was ordered instead by Commodore Esek Hopkins to sail for The Bahamas, where Nassau was raided for military supplies. The fleet had an unsuccessful encounter with a British packet ship on their return voyage. Jones was then assigned command of the sloop . Congress had recently ordered the construction of thirteen frigates for the American Navy, one of which was to be commanded by Jones. In exchange for this prestigious command, Jones accepted his commission aboard the smaller &quot;Providence&quot;. Over the summer of 1776 as commander of &quot;Providence&quot;, Jones performed various services for the Continental Navy and Congress. These services included the transport of troops, the movement of supplies, and the escort of convoys. During this time, Jones was able to assist a &#x27;brig from Hispaniola&#x27; that was being chased by HMS &quot;Cerberus&quot; and laden with military stores. The brig was then purchased by Congress and put in commission as with Captain Hoysted Hacker commanding. During a later six-week voyage to Nova Scotia, Jones captured sixteen prizes and inflicted significant damage in the Raid on Canso.

Jones&#x27;s next command came as a result of Commodore Hopkins&#x27;s orders to liberate hundreds of American prisoners forced to labour in coal mines in Nova Scotia, and also to raid British shipping. On November 1, 1776, Jones set sail in command of &quot;Alfred&quot; to carry out this mission. Winter conditions prevented freeing the prisoners, but the mission did result in the capture of &quot;Mellish&quot;, a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for General John Burgoyne&#x27;s troops in Canada.

====Command of &quot;Ranger&quot;====
Despite his successes at sea, Jones&#x27; disagreements with those in authority reached a new level upon arrival in Boston on December 16, 1776. While at the port, he began feuding with Commodore Hopkins, as Jones believed that Hopkins was hindering his advancement by talking down his campaign plans. As a result of this and other frustrations, Jones was assigned the smaller command of the newly constructed on June 14, 1777, the same day that the new Stars and Stripes flag was adopted.

After making the necessary preparations, Jones sailed for France on November 1, 1777, with orders to assist the American cause however possible. The American commissioners in France were Benjamin Franklin, Silas Deane, and Arthur Lee, and they listened to Jones&#x27;s strategic recommendations. They promised him the command of , a new vessel being constructed for America by the Netherlands in Amsterdam. Britain, however, was able to divert &quot;L&#x27;Indien&quot; away from American hands by exerting pressure to ensure its sale to France instead (which had not yet allied with America). Jones was again left without a command, an unpleasant reminder of his stagnation in Boston from late 1776 until early 1777. It is thought that during this time Jones developed his close friendship with Franklin, whom he greatly admired.

On February 6, 1778, France signed the Treaty of Alliance with America, formally recognizing the independence of the new American republic. Eight days later, Captain Jones&#x27;s &quot;Ranger&quot; became the first American naval vessel to be formally saluted by the French, with a nine-gun salute fired from Captain La Motte-Piquet&#x27;s flagship. Jones wrote of the event: &quot;I accepted his offer all the more for after all it was a recognition of our independence and in the nation&quot;. On April 10, Jones set sail from Brest, France, for the western coasts of Great Britain.

====&quot;Ranger&quot; attacks the British====

Jones had some early successes against British merchant shipping in the Irish Sea. He persuaded his crew on April 17, 1778, to participate in an assault on Whitehaven, the town where his maritime career had begun. Jones later wrote about the poor command qualities of his senior officers (having tactfully avoided such matters in his official report): &quot;&#x27;Their object&#x27;, they said, &#x27;was gain not honor&#x27;. They were poor: instead of encouraging the morale of the crew, they excited them to disobedience; they persuaded them that they had the right to judge whether a measure that was proposed to them was good or bad&quot;. Contrary winds forced them to abandon the attempt and drive &quot;Ranger&quot; towards Ireland, causing more trouble for British shipping on the way.

On April 20, Jones learned from captured sailors that the Royal Navy sloop of war was anchored off Carrickfergus, Ireland. According to the diary of &quot;Ranger&quot;″s surgeon, Jones&#x27;s first intention was to attack the vessel in broad daylight, but his sailors were &quot;unwilling to undertake it&quot;, another incident omitted from the official report. Therefore, the attack took place just after midnight, but the mate responsible for dropping the anchor to halt &quot;Ranger&quot; right alongside &quot;Drake&quot; misjudged the timing in the dark (Jones claimed in his memoirs that the man was drunk), so Jones had to cut his anchor cable and run. The wind shifted, and &quot;Ranger&quot; recrossed the Irish Sea to make another attempt at raiding Whitehaven.

Jones led the assault with two boats of fifteen men just after midnight on April 23, hoping to set fire to and sink all of the ships anchored in Whitehaven&#x27;s harbor, which numbered between 200 and 400 wooden vessels and consisted of a full merchant fleet and many coal transporters. They also hoped to terrorize the townspeople by lighting further fires. As it happened, the journey to shore was slowed by the shifting wind, as well as a strong ebb tide. They successfully spiked the town&#x27;s big defensive guns to prevent them being fired, but lighting fires proved difficult, as the lanterns in both boats had run out of fuel. To remedy this, some of the party were sent to raid a public house on the quayside, but the temptation to stop for a quick drink led to a further delay. Dawn was breaking by the time they returned and began the arson attacks, so efforts were concentrated on the coal ship &quot;Thompson&quot; in the hope that the flames would spread to adjacent vessels, all grounded by the low tide. However, in the twilight, one of the crew slipped away and alerted residents on a harbourside street. A fire alert was sounded, and large numbers of people came running to the quay, forcing the Americans to retreat, and extinguishing the flames with the town&#x27;s two fire-engines. The townspeople&#x27;s hopes of sinking Jones&#x27;s boats with cannon fire were dashed because of the prudent spiking.
Jones next crossed the Solway Firth from Whitehaven to Scotland, hoping to hold for ransom Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk, who lived on St Mary&#x27;s Isle near Kirkcudbright. The earl, Jones reasoned, could be exchanged for American sailors impressed into the Royal Navy. The earl was discovered to be absent from his estate, so his wife entertained the officers and conducted the negotiations. Canadian historian Peter C. Newman gives credit to the governess for protecting the young heir to the Earldom of Selkirk, Thomas Douglas, and to the butler for filling a sack half with coal and topping it up with the family silver, in order to fob off the Americans. Jones claimed that he intended to return directly to his ship and continue seeking prizes elsewhere, but his crew wished to &quot;pillage, burn, and plunder all they could&quot;. Ultimately, Jones allowed the crew to seize a silver plate set adorned with the family&#x27;s emblem to placate their desires, but nothing else. Jones bought the plate when it was later sold off in France, and he returned it to the Earl of Selkirk after the war.

The attacks on St Mary&#x27;s Isle and Whitehaven resulted in no prizes or profits which would be shared with the crew under normal circumstances. Throughout the mission, the crew acted as if they were aboard a privateer, not a warship, led by Lieutenant Thomas Simpson, Jones&#x27;s second-in-command.

====Return to Ireland====
Jones led &quot;Ranger&quot; back across the Irish Sea, hoping to make another attempt at &quot;Drake&quot;, still anchored off Carrickfergus. Late in the afternoon of April 24, the ships, roughly equal in firepower, engaged in combat. Earlier in the day, the Americans had captured the crew of a reconnaissance boat and learned that &quot;Drake&quot; had taken on dozens of soldiers with the intention of grappling and boarding &quot;Ranger&quot;, so Jones made sure that did not happen, capturing &quot;Drake&quot; after an hour-long gun battle in which British captain George Burdon was killed. Lieutenant Simpson was given command of &quot;Drake&quot; for the return journey to Brest. The ships separated during the return journey as &quot;Ranger&quot; chased another prize, leading to a conflict between Simpson and Jones. Both ships arrived at port safely, but Jones filed for a court-martial of Simpson, keeping him detained on the ship.

Partly through the influence of John Adams, who was still serving as a commissioner in France, Simpson was released from Jones&#x27;s accusation. Adams implies in his memoirs that the overwhelming majority of the evidence supported Simpson&#x27;s claims. Adams seemed to believe Jones was hoping to monopolize the mission&#x27;s glory, especially by detaining Simpson on board while he celebrated the capture with numerous important European dignitaries. Even with the wealth of perspectives, including the commander&#x27;s, it is difficult to determine what occurred. It is clear, however, that the crew felt alienated by their commander, who might well have been motivated by his pride. Jones believed his intentions were honorable and his actions were strategically essential to the Revolution. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the mission, &quot;Ranger&quot;″s capture of &quot;Drake&quot; was one of the Continental Navy&#x27;s few significant military victories during the Revolution. &quot;Ranger&quot;″s victory became an important symbol of the American spirit and served as an inspiration for the permanent establishment of the U.S. Navy after the revolution.

====&quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;====

In 1779, Captain Jones took command of the 42-gun , a merchant ship rebuilt and given to America by the French shipping magnate, Jacques-Donatien Le Ray. On August 14, as a vast French and Spanish invasion fleet approached England, he provided a diversion by heading for Ireland at the head of a five-ship squadron including the 36-gun , 32-gun USS &quot;Pallas&quot;, 12-gun , and &quot;Le Cerf&quot;, also accompanied by two privateers, and &quot;Granville&quot;. When the squadron was only a few days out of Groix, &quot;Monsieur&quot; separated because of a disagreement between her captain and Jones. Several Royal Navy warships were sent towards Ireland in pursuit of Jones, but on this occasion, he continued right around the north of Scotland into the North Sea. Jones&#x27;s main problems, as on his previous voyage, resulted from insubordination, particularly by Pierre Landais, captain of &quot;Alliance&quot;. On September 23, the squadron met a large merchant convoy off the coast of Flamborough Head, East Yorkshire. The 44-gun British frigate and the 22-gun hired armed ship placed themselves between the convoy and Jones&#x27;s squadron, allowing the merchants to escape.

Shortly after 7 p.m. the Battle of Flamborough Head began. &quot;Serapis&quot; engaged &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, and &quot;Alliance&quot; fired from a considerable distance at &quot;Countess&quot;. After sustaining significant damage from the Serapis and Alliance&#x27;s bombardment, Jones quickly recognized that he could not win a battle of big guns, and with the wind dying, made every effort to lock &quot;Richard&quot; and &quot;Serapis&quot; together (his famous, albeit apocryphal, quotation, &quot;I have not yet begun to fight!&quot; was said to have been uttered in reply to a demand to surrender in this phase of the battle). After about an hour, he succeeded, and he began clearing the British decks with his deck guns and his Marine marksmen in the rigging. &quot;Alliance&quot; sailed past and fired a broadside, doing at least as much damage to &quot;Richard&quot; as to &quot;Serapis&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Countess of Scarborough&quot; had enticed &quot;Pallas&quot; downwind of the main battle, beginning a separate engagement. When &quot;Alliance&quot; approached this contest, about an hour after it had begun, the badly damaged &quot;Countess&quot; surrendered.

With &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; burning and sinking, it seems that her ensign was shot away; when one of the officers shouted a surrender, believing his captain to be dead, the British commander asked, seriously this time, if they had struck their colors. Jones later remembered saying something like &quot;I am determined to make you strike&quot;, but the words allegedly heard by crew-members and reported in newspapers a few days later were more like: &quot;I may sink, but I&#x27;ll be damned if I strike&quot;. An attempt by the British to board &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; was thwarted, and a grenade thrown by an American sailor caused the explosion of a large quantity of gunpowder on &quot;Serapis&quot; lower gun-deck. &quot;Alliance&quot; returned to the main battle, firing two broadsides. Again, these did at least as much damage to &quot;Richard&quot; as to &quot;Serapis&quot;, but the tactic worked to the extent that &quot;Serapis&quot; was unable to move. With &quot;Alliance&quot; keeping well out of the line of his own great guns, Captain Pearson of &quot;Serapis&quot; accepted that prolonging the battle could achieve nothing, so he surrendered. Most of &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;″s crew transferred to other vessels, and after a day and a half of frantic repair efforts, it was decided that the ship could not be saved. &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; was allowed to sink, and Jones took command of &quot;Serapis&quot; for the trip to the island of Texel in neutral (but American-sympathizing) Holland.

In the following year, King Louis XVI of France honored Jones with the title &quot;Chevalier&quot;. Jones accepted the honor and desired the title to be used thereafter: when the Continental Congress in 1787 resolved that a medal of gold be struck in commemoration of his &quot;valor and brilliant services&quot; it was to be presented to &quot;Chevalier John Paul Jones&quot;. He also received from Louis XVI a decoration of &quot;l&#x27;Institution du Mérite Militaire&quot; and a sword. By contrast, in Britain at this time, he was usually denigrated as a pirate.

Jones was also admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati in the state of Pennsylvania when it was established in 1783.

===Russian service===

In June 1782, Jones was appointed to command the 74-gun , but his command fell through when Congress decided to give &quot;America&quot; to the French as replacement for the wrecked &quot;Le Magnifique&quot;. As a result, he was given assignment in Europe in 1783 to collect prize money due his former hands. At length, this too expired and Jones was left without prospects for active employment, leading him on April 23, 1787, to enter into the service of the Empress Catherine II of Russia, who placed great confidence in Jones, saying: &quot;He will get to Constantinople&quot;. He was granted name as a French subject Павел де Жонес (&quot;Pavel de Zhones&quot;, Paul de Jones).

Jones avowed his intention, however, to preserve the condition of an American citizen and officer. As a rear admiral aboard the 24-gun flagship &quot;Vladimir&quot;, he took part in the naval campaign in the Dnieper-Bug Liman, an arm of the Black Sea, into which the Southern Bug and Dnieper rivers flow, against the Turks, in concert with the Dnieper Flotilla commanded by Prince Charles of Nassau-Siegen.

Jones faced a considerable and larger Turkish fleet that consisted of over 100 vessels including 18 ships of the line and 40 frigates. Jones ships were poorly built, manned by impressed serfs, and were not fully armed. Additionally, he had to communicate with his fleet through a translator. He wanted to use a defensive strategy, and bickered with Nassau Segan, who wanted to rush in and attack. Jones wanted to use a V shape with his fleet, placing it at the mouth of the Bug river to funnel the Turkish navy down the river into a killing field created by deadly cross-fire, but the wind was against him. Still, he had his fleet create this formation by throwing their anchors out and dragging themselves into place. The strategy worked, and the larger Turkish navy was defeated. During the battle, Nassau Segan&#x27;s flagship fled the battle to a safe position. But when the battle was won, and the enemy flagship was trapped, grounded on a sandbar, Jones ordered his crew to approach and capture the flagship. Instead, his Russian captain pulled up short, anchored himself, and let Nassau Segan claim the prize. Despite it being Jones&#x27;s successes and strategies, during this time, Potemkin&#x27;s letters to Empress Catherine gave credit to Nassau Segan to prevent Jones from gathering power at court. When Jones confronted Potemkin and told him that he (Potemkin) was being manipulated by Nassau Segan, Potemkin responded &quot;No one manipulates me, not even the Empress!&quot;

Jones (and Nassau-Siegen) repulsed the Ottoman forces from the area, but the jealous intrigues of Nassau-Siegen (and perhaps Jones&#x27;s own ineptitude for Imperial politics) turned the Russian commander Prince Grigory Potemkin against Jones.

Jones was recalled to Saint Petersburg for the claimed purpose of transfer to a command in the North Sea. Other factors may have included the theoretical resentment of rival officers, some of whom were several ex-British naval officers also in Russian employment, who regarded Jones as a renegade and refused to speak to him.

As a foreigner among the Russian court, Jones threatened the existing power structures. He had successfully defeated the Turkish Navy, and was no longer as important to the war. His immediate superior, Prince Potemkin, was known for his deviousness and court intrigue, and as a man who allowed only sycophants to serve under him, and chafed at Jones&#x27; pride and inexpert courtly intrigue. After Jones&#x27; Victory, Potemkin began to assign him impossible missions, designed to force him to fail.

On June 8, 1788, Jones was awarded the Order of Saint Anna, but he left the following month, an embittered man.

In 1789, Jones arrived in Warsaw, Poland, where he befriended Tadeusz Kościuszko, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Kościuszko advised him to leave the service of the autocratic Russia and serve another power, suggesting Sweden.

==== Rape suit and exile ====
On March 31, 1789, Jones was accused of raping a 10-year-old Russian girl named Katerina Stepanova, a &quot;daughter of German immigrants living in St. Petersburg.&quot; She lived with her mother, who took care of her and began the legal proceedings.

Stepanova testified to the police that she had been summoned to Jones&#x27; apartment to sell him butter, when she was punched in the face by &quot;a man wearing a white uniform, gold braids and a red ribbon,&quot; who then gagged her with a white handkerchief and vaginally penetrated her. A regimental surgeon and a midwife both examined her and found evidence to substantiate these physical and sexual assaults. Jones&#x27; manservant, Johann Gottfried Bahl, testified that Jones had been wearing his dress uniform when Stepanova entered Jones&#x27; chamber. He reported that on looking through a keyhole he saw Jones was in a gown, not his uniform. Bahl also stated he &quot;...later saw the girl leaving, her lips covered in blood and face swollen from weeping. He further told the police that he entered his master’s chamber to make the bed that night and discovered drops of blood on the floor.&quot;

The rape had been reported slightly over a day after it was said to have occurred, which meant the case would ordinarily not have continued due to Russian statutory codes considering any such delay evidence of consent, but Catherine intervened directly to allow the legal proceedings to continue (she was known to intercede in &quot;cases where women faced insurmountable odds&quot;).

Jones hired a lawyer, who soon quit the case, speculatively by order of Catherine via the Governor-General of St. Petersburg. Jones claimed in a statement to prosecutors that he had &quot;often&quot; paid Stepanova for sex previously, but denied that he had raped her. Jones stated he had not taken her virginity and believed her to be older than was being claimed; he wrote &quot;I love women, I confess, and the pleasures that one only obtains from that sex; but to get such things by force is horrible to me.&quot; However, Jones later claimed the accusation was entirely false, stemming from the supposed desire of Katerina&#x27;s mother, Sophia Fyodorovna, to gain financially from a prominent man. He also produced Katerina&#x27;s father, Stephan Holtszwarthen, to testify in court that his daughter was 12 rather than 10 years old and that his wife had left him for another man, lived in a brothel, and was herself promiscuous. Jones involved the Comte de Ségur, the French representative at the Russian court (and also Jones&#x27;s last friend in the capital), to whom he claimed that Stepanova had come asking him for &quot;linen or lace to mend&quot; and then &quot;Performed indecent gestures,&quot; but that he had &quot;Advised her not to enter upon so vile a career; gave her some money, and dismissed her.” Ségur investigated the accusation and suggested to Potemkin that it was false, and that Jones was the victim of a plot by Prince Charles for his own purposes. Ségur advanced theories that Jones had either &quot;offended men who shared the Empress&#x27;s bed&quot; or else that he had angered Catherine by refusing &quot;advances&quot; from her.

Jones&#x27; appeal to Potemkin &quot;...fell on deaf ears, leaving Jones without Russian support against the judgment of the Russian sovereign.&quot; However, the international pressure applied by American and French connections via the Comte de Ségur persuaded Catherine to grant Jones two years&#x27; leave abroad, a de facto exile, rather than the usual punishment for rape by an officer of decapitation or a lifetime of penal labor; according to Jacob Bell:The Empress&#x27; actions here proved her priorities. She dismissed a tried naval commander, especially sought out by her agents abroad, during wartime, showing that she merited the allegations against Jones higher than his potential martial service.

==Later life==
In May 1790, Jones arrived in Paris. He still retained his position as Russian Rear Admiral, with a corresponding pension which allowed him to remain in retirement until his death two years later, but he was no longer able to find a foothold in Paris society. Thomas Carlyle wrote of him, &quot;Poor Paul! Hunger and dispiritment track thy sinking footsteps&quot;. During this time he made several attempts to re-enter the service in the Russian Navy. However, Catherine did not respond to his letters, explaining to their go-between Baron von Grimm that Jones&#x27; service record was not exceptional, and that as a result of the rape suit against Jones, Russian seamen refused to serve under him. Catherine also used her influence to block attempts by Jones to join the Danish and Swedish navies.

By this time, his memoirs had been published in Edinburgh. Inspired by them, James Fenimore Cooper and Alexandre Dumas later wrote their own adventure novels: Cooper&#x27;s 1824 novel &quot;The Pilot&quot; contains fictionalized accounts of Jones&#x27;s maritime activities, and Dumas&#x27; &quot;Captain Paul&quot; is a follow-up novel to &quot;The Pilot&quot;, published in 1846.

During this period, he wrote his &quot;Narrative of the Campaign of the Liman&quot;.

In his addendum to the Encyclopedia of American Biography entry on Jones, Walter R. Herrick—citing S. E. Morison&#x27;s, &quot;John Paul Jones: A Sailor&#x27;s Biography&quot; (1959)—concluded &quot;In sum, Jones was a sailor of indomitable courage, of strong will, and of great ability in his chosen career. On the other side of the coin, it must be admitted that he was also a hypocrite, a brawler, a rake, and a professional and social climber. Although these elements of his character do not detract from his feats at sea, they do, perhaps, cast in doubt his eligibility for a prominent place in the ranks of America&#x27;s immortals.&quot;

==Death==
In June 1792, Jones was appointed U.S. Consul to treat with the Dey of Algiers for the release of American captives. Before Jones was able to fulfill his appointment, he was found dead lying face-down on his bed in his third-floor Paris apartment, No. 19 Rue de Tournon, on July 18, 1792. He was 45 years old. The cause of death was interstitial nephritis. A small procession of servants, friends and loyal family walked his body for burial. He was buried in Paris at the Saint Louis Cemetery, which belonged to the French royal family. In their obituaries, the American press had partially forgotten his achievements and some described him as a French war hero.

Upon his death, Jones was owed significant money and land by others. He was never directly paid for his service on the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, and had instead been forced to purloin part of the sum paid to the vessel&#x27;s officers. Three of the seven ships he had captured had been requisitioned by Denmark, which never reimbursed him; he had instead been granted an annual pension by the Danish king, but this was never paid either. He was also owed nearly 13,000 acres of land in western Pennsylvania, purchased from William Trent in 1783. Jones&#x27; will left both claims to his niece Janette Taylor, who came to America in 1830 to pursue them. She seems to have been unsuccessful and following her death in 1843 the claims were more aggressively pursued by her own successor, George Leckie Lowden. Lowden obtained restitution for the ships but Congress ignored his petition for the land. 

Jones&#x27;s grave was either unmarked, or the marker was stolen at an unknown point. By the time Americans began searching for his coffin in 1899, the record of his burial plot had also been lost, burned by the Paris Commune during the &quot;semaine sanglante&quot;. Meanwhile, his personal papers had been transferred among several people and finally were displayed in the shop window of a New York bakery, where in 1824 a customer noticed them and purchased them. A New York newspaper described the papers as documents belonging to &quot;Franklin, Hancock, La Fayette and John Adams,&quot; failing to mention Jones himself.

===Exhumation and reburial===

In 1905, Jones&#x27; remains were identified by U.S. Ambassador to France General Horace Porter, who had searched for six years to track down the body using a poor 1851 copy of the missing burial record. After Jones&#x27;s death, Frenchman Pierrot Francois Simmoneau had donated over 460 francs to mummify the body. It had been preserved in alcohol and interred in a lead coffin &quot;in the event that should the United States decide to claim his remains, they might more easily be identified.&quot; Porter knew what to look for in his search. With the aid of an old map of Paris, Porter&#x27;s team, which included anthropologist Louis Capitan, identified the site of the former St. Louis Cemetery for Alien Protestants. Sounding probes were used to search for lead coffins, and five coffins were ultimately exhumed. The third, unearthed on April 7, 1905, was immediately recognized as Jones&#x27; by the excavators. A post-mortem examination by Doctors Capitan and Georges Papillault confirmed their impression, finding several points by which the corpse could be identified as Jones. The autopsy confirmed the original listing of cause of death. The face was later compared to a bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon.

Jones&#x27;s body was brought to the United States aboard the , escorted by three other cruisers, one being the . On approaching the American coastline, seven United States Navy battleships joined the procession escorting Jones&#x27;s body back to America. On April 24, 1906, Jones&#x27;s coffin was installed in Bancroft Hall at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, following a ceremony in Dahlgren Hall, presided by President Theodore Roosevelt who gave a speech paying tribute to Jones and holding him up as an example to the officers of the Navy. On January 26, 1913, the captain&#x27;s remains were finally re-interred in a bronze and marble sarcophagus, designed by Sylvain Salières, at the Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis.

==Posthumous pardon at Whitehaven==
Jones was given an honorary pardon in 1999 by the port of Whitehaven for his raid on the town, in the presence of Lieutenant Steve Lyons representing the United States Naval Attaché to the UK, and Yuri Fokine the Russian Ambassador to the UK. The United States Navy was also awarded the Freedom of the Port of Whitehaven, the only time the honour has been granted in its 400-year history. The pardon and freedom were arranged by Gerard Richardson as part of the launch of the series of Maritime Festival. Richardson&#x27;s of Whitehaven, a wine and coffee merchant in the town, is now the honorary consulate to the United States Navy for the Town and Port of Whitehaven. The consul is US Navy Rear Admiral (retired) Steve Morgan, and the deputy consul is Rob Romano.

==In literature and the arts==
James Fenimore Cooper wrote a historical novel &quot;The Pilot: A Tale of the Sea&quot;, published in 1823, featuring John Paul Jones as its main character. This novel was later reinterpreted by the French writer Alexandre Dumas in &quot;Captain Paul&quot; (&quot;Le Capitaine Paul&quot;), published in 1838.

There is a single Hollywood film about him, &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959), which includes a largely fictionalized portrayal of his private life. There is also a 45-minute documentary about him, produced in 1995. In 1923, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wrote a screenplay about Jones and sent it to Paramount Pictures founder Adolph Zukor, who politely rejected it.

Johnny Horton wrote a sea shanty about John Paul Jones in 1960. The English folk band The Longest Johns made a song referring to him from the British perspective titled &quot;John Paul Jones is a Pirate&quot;.

Jones is a featured character in the American animated historical fiction television series &quot;Liberty&#x27;s Kids&quot;. In the episode &quot;Not Yet Begun to Fight&quot;, Jones (voiced by Liam Neeson) helps main character Sarah see that her true loyalty lies with America during the Battle of Flamborough Head.

<text>John Edward Boulting (21 December 1913 – 17 June 1985) and Roy Alfred Clarence Boulting (21 December 1913 – 5 November 2001), known collectively as the Boulting brothers, were English filmmakers and identical twins who became known for their series of satirical comedies in the 1950s and 1960s. They produced many of their films through their own production company, Charter Film Productions, which they founded in 1937.

==Early life==
The twin brothers were born to Arthur Boulting and his wife Rosetta (Rose) &quot;née&quot; Bennett in Bray, Berkshire, England, on 21 December 1913. John was the elder by half an hour. John was named Joseph Edward John Boulting and Roy was named Alfred Fitzroy Clarence Boulting. Their elder brother Sydney Boulting became an actor and stage producer as Peter Cotes; he was the original director of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;. A younger brother, Guy, died aged eight.

Both twins were educated at Reading School, where they formed a film society. They were extras in Anthony Asquith&#x27;s 1931 film &quot;Tell England&quot; while still at school.

As a teenager, Roy emigrated to Canada, working for a while as a shop assistant, but also writing dialogue for at least one Canadian film. He worked his passage home aboard a cattle freighter in about 1933, working first in film sales before moving into film production as assistant director on a 1936 comedy quickie &quot;Apron Fools&quot;. The money he made on his passage home went to finance the brothers&#x27; first work, a short entitled &quot;Ripe Earth&quot; (1938), about the village of Thaxted, Essex, narrated by Leo Genn.

From January to November 1937, John served on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War as an ambulance driver with the Spanish Medical Aid Committee (not, as sometimes reported, with the International Brigades), where — according to Richard Attenborough — he was nearly captured. John also served with the British Film Unit as an officer in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Roy served as a captain in the British Army, first with a tank regiment for more than a year and then with the Army Film Unit, where he made several short documentaries.

==Careers==
The brothers constituted a producer-director team. For most of their careers one produced while the other directed, but the product remained essentially a &#x27;Boulting Brothers film&#x27;. They were socialists, as John demonstrated with his involvement in the Spanish Civil War (see above), and wanted all film, including comedies, to reflect the real world.

===Charter Film Productions===
In 1937, they set up Charter Film Productions and made several short features, including &quot;The Landlady&quot; (1937) and &quot;Consider Your Verdict&quot; (1938), which attracted critical and commercial attention.

They made quota quickies such as &quot;Trunk Crime&quot; (1939) and &quot;Inquest&quot; (1939).

===Feature films===
Being eager to speak out against the Third Reich, the brothers made their film, &quot;Pastor Hall&quot; (1940), a biopic of Martin Niemöller, a German preacher who refused to kowtow to the Nazis. Roy directed and John produced. The film had to have its initial release delayed by the British Government, which was not yet ready to be openly critical of Nazism. Once released, the film was well received by the critics and the public.

They followed up with &quot;Thunder Rock&quot; (1942) with Michael Redgrave, a passionate anti-isolationist allegory distinguished by imaginative cinematography and a theatrical but highly atmospheric lighthouse setting. It was financed by MGM.

===Military service===
In 1941, Roy joined the Army Film Unit, where he was responsible for &quot;Desert Victory&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1944. He also worked on &quot;Tunisian Victory&quot; (1944) and &quot;Burma Victory&quot; (1945). John joined the RAF Film Unit, where he made &quot;Journey Together&quot; in 1945, a dramatised documentary about the training and combat experience of a bomber crew with Richard Attenborough in the lead part. Terence Rattigan worked on the script.

===Post-war films===
After the war, the Boultings made the drama &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot; (1947) with Redgrave. More successful at the box-office was &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; (1947), starring Attenborough as the gangster &quot;Pinkie&quot; from the novel by Graham Greene. Also well liked was &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot; (1948), starring Richard Attenborough as a young working-class boy sent to a public school. It was made for Pilgrim Pictures who the Boultings left shortly afterwards. The Boultings co-directed the thriller &quot;Seven Days to Noon&quot; (1950), which won an Oscar for Best Story. It led to a less popular sequel, &quot;High Treason&quot; (1951). John directed &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (1951), a biopic of William Friese-Greene and a film containing numerous cameo appearances. It was shown at the 1951 Festival of Britain but on general release the following year proved a box office disappointment.

===Hollywood-financed films===
Roy received an offer to direct a World War Two naval film, &quot;Sailor of the King&quot; (1953), starring Jeffrey Hunter for 20th Century Fox. &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot; (1954) was another war naval story financed by a Hollywood studio (in this case MGM) with an imported star (Gene Kelly); it was not a big success. The brothers collaborated on a comedy, &quot;Josephine and Men&quot; (1955) then Roy was hired by United Artists to do an action film with Hollywood stars, &quot;Run for the Sun&quot; (1956).

===Satires===
In the mid-50s, the Boulting brothers became identified with &quot;affectionate&quot; satires on British institutions. The sequence began with John&#x27;s &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1956), a look at army life, starring Attenborough, Terry-Thomas and Ian Carmichael and co written by Frank Harvey. It was the second most commercially successful film in Britain in 1956.

They followed it with &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; (1957), set in academe, adapted from the novel by Kingsley Amis. It starred Carmichael and Terry-Thomas. &quot;Brothers in Law&quot; (1957) with Carmichael, Attenborough and Thomas, took on the legal profession. They had a break from satirising institutions with &quot;Happy Is the Bride&quot; (1958), an adaptation of &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot;, then returned to it with &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot; (1959), focusing on diplomacy.

The Boultings took on increasingly powerful trade unions and ever corrupt board room power with &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959), a sequel to &quot;Private&#x27;s Progress&quot; with Carmichael, Thomas and Attenborough reprising their roles, and Harvey co-writing. The film featured a performance by Peter Sellers as trade union foreman Fred Kite. It was the most popular film at the British box office in 1959. &quot;Suspect&quot; (1960) was a return to the thriller genre for the brothers. &quot;A French Mistress&quot; (1960) was a comedy farce. &quot;Heavens Above!&quot; (1963) looked at religion in Britain, starring Sellers and Carmichael. It was a minor hit. &quot;Rotten to the Core&quot; (1965) was a heist comedy which attempted to make a star of Anton Rodgers in a Peter Sellers-type role, playing multiple parts. It featured a young Charlotte Rampling.

===Hayley Mills===
The Boultings directed and produced the northern comedy &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966), starring John Mills and his teenage daughter Hayley. Roy Boulting and Hayley Mills began a relationship during the shoot despite a 33-year age difference; they married in 1971. Roy wrote and directed &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1968), a thriller starring Mills and Hywel Bennett. The brothers had a massive hit with &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; (1970) starring Sellers and Goldie Hawn. Roy was called in to replace the director on &quot;Mr. Forbush and the Penguins&quot; (1971), and he brought in Mills to star. The movie was not successful. Neither was the comedy &quot;Soft Beds, Hard Battles&quot; (1974) made by the brothers starring Peter Sellers. Roy Boulting lost a considerable amount of money on the film. In 1975, Roy was working on a stage play, &quot;The Family Games&quot;. He worked on the script for &quot;The Kingfisher Caper&quot; (1975), starring Mills.

===Later career===
In the US, Roy directed &quot;The Last Word&quot; (1979), a comedy starring Richard Harris that was barely seen. When John died of cancer in 1985, Roy stopped making films. His last credit was directing an episode of the &quot;Miss Marple&quot; series for TV, &quot;The Moving Finger&quot; (1985). He was working on an adaptation of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s play &quot;Deja Vu&quot; when he died. When the National Film Theatre mounted its biggest retrospective to date of British cinema in the late 1980s, Roy who launched it, introduced &quot;Desert Victory&quot;. The Boulting Brother&#x27;s films have been described as being &quot;a sensitive barometer of the changing times&quot;.

==Personal lives==
John Boulting was married four times. He had six children: two sons by his first marriage; three daughters by his second. He also had a third son. With his first wife, Veronica, daughter of Irish barrister, John Craig Nelson Davidson, he had sons Norris (b. 1941) and Nicholas (b. 1943). Norris is the father of TV presenter and journalist Ned Boulting. With his second wife, Jacqueline (Jackie), he had three daughters: Jody, Emma &amp; Lucy; the last of whom, Lucy Boulting Hill, has become a successful casting director. John&#x27;s grandson, Jordan Stephens (son of Emma), is one half of British hip hop duo Rizzle Kicks.

Roy Boulting was married five times. He had seven children, all sons: two by his second marriage; three by his third; one through his relationship with Victoria Vaughan; and one by his fourth. With his second wife, Jean Capon (née Gamage), he had sons Jonathan (b. 1944) and Laurence (b. 1945), the latter becoming a successful film producer and director in his own right. With his second marriage, in March 1951, to Enid Munnik (née Groenewald/Grünewald), he had three children: first, Fitzroy (b. 1951); then identical twins Edmund and Rupert (b. 1952). The couple divorced in 1964. Enid, an established fashion model and later fashion editor at the French magazine &quot;Elle&quot;, married the 9th Earl of Hardwicke in April 1970. The model and actress Ingrid Boulting is Enid&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage, to Cornelius Munnik.

Following his split with his third wife, Roy entered into a relationship with another fashion model, Victoria Vaughan. They had one son together. The relationship ended with his involvement with Hayley Mills. In 1971, Roy married, for the fourth time, Hayley Mills, 33 years his junior, whom he had met on the set of &quot;The Family Way&quot;. Their son is musician and filmmaker Crispian Mills. The couple separated in 1975, and divorced in 1977. His fifth and final marriage, in October 1978, was to actress Sandra Payne. They divorced in 1984.

==Deaths==
John Boulting died on 17 June 1985 at his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, and Roy Boulting 16 years later on 5 November 2001 in the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford; both died of cancer.

== In popular culture ==
A still from &quot;The Family Way&quot; was used for The Smiths single &quot;I Started Something I Couldn&#x27;t Finish&quot;.

<text>John Michael Frankenheimer (February 19, 1930 – July 6, 2002) was an American film and television director known for social dramas and action/suspense films. Among his credits were &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), &quot;The Train&quot; (1964), &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966), &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), &quot;French Connection II&quot; (1975), &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1977), &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1996), and &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998).

He won four Emmy Awards – three consecutive – in the 1990s for directing the television movies &quot;Against the Wall&quot;, &quot;The Burning Season&quot;, &quot;Andersonville&quot;, and &quot;George Wallace&quot;, the last of which also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film.

Frankenheimer&#x27;s nearly 40 feature films and over 50 plays for television were notable for their influence on contemporary thought. He became a pioneer of the &quot;modern-day political thriller&quot;, having begun his career at the height of the Cold War.

He was technically highly accomplished from his days in live television; many of his films were noted for creating &quot;psychological dilemmas&quot; for his male protagonists along with having a strong &quot;sense of environment&quot;, similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a &quot;tremendous propensity for exploring political situations&quot; which would ensnare his characters.

Movie critic Leonard Maltin writes that &quot;in his time [1960s] ... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment – things that were facing us all.&quot;

==Childhood and schooling==
Frankenheimer was born in Queens, New York City, the son of Helen Mary (&quot;née&quot; Sheedy) and Walter Martin Frankenheimer, a stockbroker. His father was of German Jewish descent, his mother was Irish Catholic, and Frankenheimer was raised in his mother&#x27;s religion. As a youth Frankenheimer, the eldest of three siblings, struggled to assert himself with his domineering father.

Growing up in New York City he became fascinated with cinema at an early age, and recalls avidly attending movies every weekend. Frankenheimer reports that in 1938, at the age of seven or eight, he attended a 25-episode, 7 hour marathon of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; accompanied by his aunt.

In 1947, he graduated from La Salle Military Academy in Oakdale, Long Island, New York, and in 1951 he earned a baccalaureate in English from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. As captain of the tennis team at Williams, Frankenheimer briefly considered a professional career in tennis, but reconsidered:

===Air Force Film Squadron: 1951–1953===

After graduating Williams College, Frankenheimer was drafted into the Air Force and assigned to the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC), serving in the Pentagon mailroom at Washington, D. C. He quickly applied for and was transferred, without any formal qualifications, to an Air Force film squadron in Burbank, California. It was there that Lieutenant Frankenheimer &quot;really started to think seriously about directing.&quot;

Frankenheimer recollects his early apprenticeship with the Air Force photography unit as one of almost unlimited freedom. When he was a junior officer, Frankenheimer claimed, his superiors &quot;couldn&#x27;t have cared less&quot; what he did in terms of utilizing the filmmaking equipment. Frankenheimer reports that he was free to set up the lighting, operate the camera and perform the editing on projects he personally conceived. His first film was a documentary about an asphalt manufacturing plant in Sherman Oaks, California.
Lieutenant Frankenheimer recalls moonlighting, at $40-a-week, as writer, producer and cameraman making television infomercials for a local cattle breeder in Northridge, California, in which livestock were presented on the interior stage sets. The FCC terminated the programming after 15 weeks. In addition to mastering the basic elements of filmmaking, Frankenheimer began reading widely on film technique, including the writings of Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein.
Frankenheimer was discharged from the military in 1953.

==Television&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot;: 1953–1960==
During his years in military service, Frankenheimer strenuously sought a film career in Southern California. Failing this, at age 23, he returned to New York upon his military discharge to seek work in the emerging television industry. His earnestness impressed Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) television executives, landing him a job in the summer of 1953 to serve as a director of photography on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;. Frankenheimer recalls his apprenticeship at CBS:

Frankenheimer was picked up as assistant to director Sidney Lumet&#x27;s for CBS&#x27;s historical dramatization series &quot;You Are There&quot;, and further on Charles Russell&#x27;s &quot;Danger&quot; and Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;Person to Person&quot;. In late 1954 Frankenheimer replaced Lumet as director on &quot;You Are There&quot; and &quot;Danger&quot; under a 5-year contract (with a studio standard option to terminate a director with a two-week notice). Frankenheimer&#x27;s directorial début was &quot;The Plot Against King Solomon&quot; (1954), a critical success.

Throughout the 1950s he directed over 140 episodes of shows like &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; and &quot;Climax!&quot; under the auspices of CBS executive Hubbell Robinson and producer Martin Manulis. These included outstanding adaptations of works by Shakespeare, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Arthur Miller. Leading actors and actresses from stage and film starred in these live productions, among them Ingrid Bergman, John Gielgud, Mickey Rooney, Geraldine Page and Jack Lemmon. Frankenheimer is widely considered a preeminent figure in the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Television&quot;.

Film historian Stephen Bowie offers this appraisal of Frankenheimer&#x27;s legacy from the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of television:

==Film career==

Frankenheimer&#x27;s earliest films addressed contemporary issues such as &quot;juvenile delinquency, criminality and the social environment&quot; and are represented by &quot;The Young Stranger&quot; (1957), &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961) and &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962).

===&quot;The Young Stranger&quot; (1957)===

Frankenheimer&#x27;s first foray into filmmaking occurred while he was still under contract to CBS television. The head of CBS in California, William Dozier, became the CEO of RKO movie studios. Frankenheimer was assigned to direct a film version of his television &quot;Climax!&quot; production entitled &quot;Deal a Blow&quot;, written by William Dozier&#x27;s son, Robert. The 1956 movie version, &quot;The Young Stranger&quot; stars James MacArthur as the rebellious teenage son of a powerful Hollywood movie producer (James Daly). Frankenheimer recalled that he found his first film experience unsatisfactory:

Frankenheimer adds that in the late 1950s, television was transitioning from live productions to taped shows: &quot;... a live television director was like being a village blacksmith after the advent of the automobile ... I knew I had to get out...&quot; In 1961 Frankenheimer abandoned television and returned to filmmaking after a four-year hiatus, continuing his examination of the social themes that informed his 1957 &quot;The Young Stranger&quot;. Film historian Gordon Gow distinguishes Frankenheimer&#x27;s handling of themes addressing individualism and &quot;misfits&quot; during the Fifties&#x27; obsession with disaffected teenagers:

===&quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961)===

Frankenheimer&#x27;s second cinematic effort is based on novelist Evan Hunter&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Conviction&quot; (1959). United Artists publicity executives changed the box-office title to the vaguely lurid &quot;The Young Savages,&quot; to which Frankenheimer objected. The story involves the attempted political exploitation of a brazen murder involving Puerto Rican and Italian youth gangs set in New York City&#x27;s Spanish Harlem. District Attorney, Dan Cole (Edward Andrews), who is seeking the state governorship, sends assistant D. A. Hank Bell (Burt Lancaster) to gather evidence to secure a conviction. Bell, who grew up in the tenement district, has escaped from his impoverished origins to achieve social and economic success. He initially adopts a cynical hostility towards the youths he investigates, which serves his own career aims. The narrative explores the human and legal complexities of the case and Bell&#x27;s struggle to confront his personal and social prejudices and commitments. The film&#x27;s arresting opening sequence depicting a killing, which is key to the plot, reveals Frankenheimer&#x27;s origins in television. The action, &quot;brilliantly filmed and edited&quot;, occurs preliminary to the credits, and is accompanied by an impelling soundtrack by composer David Amram, serving to quickly rivet audience interest.

&quot;The Young Savages&quot;, though focusing on juvenile delinquency, is cinematically a significant advance over Frankenheimer&#x27;s similarly themed first film effort &quot;The Young Stranger&quot; (1957). Film historian Gerald Pratley attributes this to Frankenheimer&#x27;s insistence on hand-picking his leading technical support for the project, including set designer Bert Smidt, cinematographer Lionel Lindon and scenarist JP Miller. Pratley observed:

Though &quot;contrived and familiar in its social concerns&quot; Frankenheimer and leading man Burt Lancaster, both Liberals in their political outlook, dramatize the &quot;poverty, violence and despair of city life&quot; with a restraint such that &quot;the events and characters seem consistently believable.&quot;
Frankenheimer recalled &quot;I shot &quot;The Young Savages&quot; mainly to show people that I could make a movie, and while it was not completely successful, my point was proved...The film was made on a relatively cheap budget and shooting on location in New York for a Hollywood company is very expensive. Those were the days before Mayor Lindsay when you had to pay off every other cop on the beat…&quot;

===&quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962)===

The coming of age film &quot;All Fall Down&quot; was both filmed and released while Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962) was in post-production and his &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962) was in pre-production.

The picture was scripted by William Inge, who also wrote &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961) and concerns character Berry-Berry (Warren Beatty), an emotionally irresponsible hustler, and his adoring younger brother Clinton (Brandon deWilde), to whom Berry-Berry appears as a romantic Byronesque figure. The older brother&#x27;s cruel treatment of Echo O&#x27;Brien (Eva Marie Saint), his lover who becomes pregnant, disabuses the naive Clinton of Berry-Berry&#x27;s perfection. His anguished insight permits Clinton to achieve emotional maturity and independence. Film critic David Walsh comments:

===&quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962)===
Based on a biography by Thomas E. Gaddis, &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962) is a documentary-like dramatization of the life of Robert Stroud, sentenced to life imprisonment in solitary confinement for killing a prison guard. While serving his sentence, Stroud (Burt Lancaster) becomes a respected expert in avian diseases though the study of canaries. Frankenheimer traces Stroud&#x27;s emergence from his anti-social misanthropy towards a humane maturity, despite the brutal conditions of his incarceration.

In 1962, the production and filming of &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; was already underway when United Artists enlisted Frankenheimer to replace British director Charles Crichton. As such, key production decisions had already been made, and Frankenheimer regarded himself as a “hired director” with little direct control over the production. Producer Harold Hecht and screenwriter Guy Trosper insisted on an exhaustive adaption of the Gaddis biography. The filmed rough cut that emerged was over four hours in length. When simply editing the work was ruled out as impracticable, the script was rewritten and the film largely re-shot, producing a final cut of 2 ½ hours. According to Frankenheimer, he had an option in the 1950s to make a television adaption of the Stroud story, but CBS was warned off by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the project was dropped.

===&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962)===

Frankenheimer&#x27;s 1962 political thriller &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is widely regarded as his most remarkable cinematic work. Biographer Gerald Prately observes that “the impact of this film was enormous. With it, John Frankenheimer became a force to be reckoned with in contemporary cinema; it established him as the most artistic, realistic and vital filmmaker at work in America or elsewhere.”

Frankenheimer and producer George Axelrod bought Richard Condon&#x27;s 1959 novel after it had already been turned down by many Hollywood studios. After Frank Sinatra committed to the film, they secured backing from United Artists. The plot centers on Korean War veteran Raymond Shaw, part of a prominent political family. Shaw is brainwashed by Chinese and Russian captors after his Army platoon are imprisoned. He returns to civilian life in the United States, where he becomes an unwitting “sleeper” assassin in an international communist conspiracy to subvert and overthrow the U.S. government.

The film co-starred Laurence Harvey (as Sergeant Raymond Shaw), Janet Leigh, James Gregory and John McGiver. Angela Lansbury, as the mother and controller to her “sleeper” assassin son, garnered an Academy Award nomination for a “riveting” performance” in “the greatest screen role of her career.” Frank Sinatra, as Major Bennett Marco, who reverses Shaw&#x27;s mind control mechanisms and exposes the conspiracy, delivers perhaps his most satisfactory film performance.
Frankenheimer declared that both technically and conceptually, he had “complete control” over the production.

The technical “fluency” exhibited in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; reveals Frankenheimer&#x27;s struggle to convey this Cold War narrative. Film historian Andrew Sarris remarked that the director was “obviously sweating over his technique...instead of building sequences, Frankenheimer explodes them prematurely, preventing his films from coming together coherently.” &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, nonetheless, conveys the “paranoia and delirium of the Cold War years” through its documentary-style mise-en-scène. A demonstration of Frankenheimer&#x27;s bravura direction and “visual inventiveness” appears in the notable brainwashing sequence, presenting the sinister proceedings from the perspective of both the perpetrator and victim. The complexity of the sequence and its antecedents in television are described by film critic Stephen Bowie:
 
In 1968, Frankenheimer acknowledged that the methods he used on television were “the same kind of style I used on &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. It was the first time I had the assurance and self-confidence to go back to what I had been really good at in television.” Compositionally, Frankenheimer concentrates his actors into “long lens” menage, in which dramatic interactions occur at close-up, mid-shot and long-shot, a configuration that he repeated “obsessively.” Film critic Stepen Bowie observes that “this style meant that Frankenheimer&#x27;s early output became a cinema of exactitude rather than spontaneity.”
&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; was released in the post-Red Scare period of the early 1960s, when anti-Communist political ideology still prevailed. Just one month after the film&#x27;s release, the John F. Kennedy administration was in the midst of Cuban Missile Crisis and nuclear brinkmanship with the Soviet Union.

That Frankenheimer and screenwriter Axelrod persisted in the production is a measure of their political liberalism, in a historical period when, according to biographer Gerald Pratley “ it was clearly dangerous to speak of politics in the out-spoken, satiric vein that characterized this picture.” Film critic David Walsh adds that “the level of conviction and urgency” that informs &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, reflects “the relative confidence and optimism American liberals felt in the early 1960s.”
Frankenheimer&#x27;s “terrifying parable” of the American political milieu was sufficiently well-received to avoid its summary rejection by distributors.

&quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, due its subject matter and its proximity to the Kennedy assassination is inextricably linked to that event. Frankenheimer acknowledged as much when, in 1968, he described &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; as “a horribly prophetic film. It&#x27;s frightening what&#x27;s happened in our country since that film was made.”

After completing &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, Frankenheimer recalls that he was determined to continue filmmaking: “I wanted to initiate the project, I wanted to have full control, I never wanted to go back to be hired as a director again.” He was offered a contract to direct a biopic about French singer Edith Piaf, with Natalie Wood in the starring role. He emphatically rejected the offer when he learned that Piaf&#x27;s songs would be sung in English, rather than in the original French.

In 1963, Frankenheimer and screenwriter George Axelrod were introduced to the producer Edward Lewis, considering a TV production concerning the American Civil Liberties Union. When the project was deemed too expensive for television, Frankenheimer was approached by an associate of Lewis, actor and producer Kirk Douglas, to purchase and adapt to film the novel &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II.

===&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964)===

&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964), based closely on Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II&#x27;s best-selling novel and a screenplay by Rod Serling, dramatizes an attempted military coup d’état in the United States, set in 1974. The perpetrators are led by General James M. Scott (Burt Lancaster), chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) a virulently anti-Communist authoritarian. When US President Jordan Lyman (Fredric March) negotiates a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union—an act that Scott considers treasonable—Scott mobilizes his military cabal. Operating at a remote base in West Texas, they prepare to commandeer the nation&#x27;s communication networks and seize control of Congress. When Scott&#x27;s JCS aide Colonel Martin “Jiggs” Casey (Kirk Douglas) discovers the planned coup he is appalled, and convinces President Lyman as to the gravity of the threat. Lyman mobilizes his own governmental loyalists, and a clash over Constitutional principles between Lyman and Scott plays out in the Oval Office, with the President denouncing the General as a traitor to the US Constitution. When Scott is exposed publicly, his military supporters abandon him, and the conspiracy collapses. Frankenheimer points to the topical continuity of his political thrillers:

The character of General Scott has been identified by film historians as a composite of two leading military and political figures: Curtis LeMay and Edwin Walker. The film places great emphasis on the sanctity of US Constitutional norms as a bulwark against encroachments by anti-democratic elements in the United States. Biographer Gerald Pratley writes:

Film critic Joanne Laurier adds that “screenwriter Rod Serling and Frankenheimer&#x27;s major theme is the need for the military to be subordinated to elected civilian rule.” As visual emphasis “the opening credits of &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; roll over an image of the original 1787 draft of the Constitution of the United States.

&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; has been widely praised for the high caliber of the performances by the cast. Biographer Charles Higham writes that “the film is played with extraordinary skill, proving that Frankenheimer&#x27;s intensity communicated itself successfully to his actors.”

Frankenheimer, a former Air Force officer who worked briefly in the Pentagon, anticipated hostility from the military establishment to the premise of &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;. Indeed, internal memos circulated in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) registering alarm that &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; could potentially damage the bureau&#x27;s reputation. Film critics Joanne Laurier and David Walsh report that “The military and FBI took a very definite note of Seven Days in May, revealing their intense sensitivity to such criticism. A memo uncovered in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s FBI file reveals that the bureau was concerned the film would be used as Communist propaganda and was therefore ‘harmful to our Armed Forces and Nation.’” President Kennedy personally expressed approval for the film adaption, and his Press Secretary Pierre Salinger permitted Frankenheimer to view the Oval Office so as to sketch its interior.

&quot;Seven Days in May&quot;, filmed in the summer of 1963, was scheduled for release in December that year, but was delayed due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November. The release of director Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s satire Dr. Strangelove (1964) was similarly postponed.
Frankenheimer recognized the “prophetic” aspects of his &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), a film that examines conspiratorial political assassinations. The historical context in which &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; appeared inevitably links it to the 1963 Kennedy assassination. Film critic David Walsh makes the connection explicit: “By the time &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; reached movie theaters, Kennedy had been assassinated, in an operation widely believed to have been organized by those with CIA or military connections.”

&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; was well received by critics and movie-goers.

===&quot;The Train&quot; (1964)===

In early 1964, Frankenheimer was reluctant to embark upon another film project due to fatigue: “&quot;The Train&quot; is a film I had no intention of ever doing [and was] not a subject that I cared that much about...I&#x27;d just finished &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964). I was quite tired.” 

Adapted from the novel &quot;Le Front de l’Art: Le front de l’art: Défense des collections françaises, 1939-1945&quot; by Rose Valland, the documentary-styled picture examines the desperate struggle by the French Resistance to intercept a train loaded with priceless art treasures and sabotage it before Wehrmacht officers could escape with it to Nazi Germany. The film dramatizes a contest of wills between French railway inspector Labiche (Burt Lancaster) and German art connoisseur Colonel von Waldheim (Paul Scofield), tasked with seizing the art work. Shooting for &quot;The Train&quot; had commenced in France when filmmaker Arthur Penn, originally enlisted to direct the adaption, was dismissed by actor-producer Lancaster, allegedly over personal incompatibility and irreconcilable interpretive differences.

Frankenheimer, who had successfully directed Lancaster on three previous films, consented to replace Penn, but with grave reservations, considering the screenplay “almost appalling” and noting that “the damn train didn&#x27;t leave the station until p. 140.” Frankenheimer postponed production of &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966) to accommodate Lancaster&#x27;s production.

Filming for &quot;The Train&quot; was temporarily shut down and the existing footage discarded. Frankenheimer, in collaboration with screenwriters Nedrick Young (uncredited), Franklin Coen, Frank Davis and Walter Bernstein framed an entirely new script that combined suspense, intrigue and action, reflecting Lancaster&#x27;s prerequisites.
Frankenheimer inserts an ethical question into the narrative: Is it justified to sacrifice a human life to save a work of art? His controversial answer was emphatically, no. Film critic Stephen Bowie observes ““Frankenheimer&#x27;s thesis—that human life has more value than art—may seem simplistic, but it adds an essential moral component to what would otherwise be just an expensive live-action version of an electric train set.”
The Train is lauded for its documentary-like realism and Frankenheimer&#x27;s masterful integration of the human narrative with its tour-de-force action scenes.
 Biographer Gerald Pratley offers this appraisal of Frankenheimer&#x27;s handling of the complex series of train sequences, discerning the influence of Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein:
 
Film critic Tim Palen elaborates on Frankenheimer&#x27;s technical expertise in &quot;The Train&quot;: “The director makes excellent use of wide angle lenses, long tracking shots, and extreme close-ups whilst maintaining depth of field...deliberately ensures that elaborate camera movement and cutting was planned so that ‘logistically you knew where each train was,’ in relation to the action.” The Train exemplifies the centrality of technical applications that began to characterize Frankenheimer&#x27;s approach to film in the late 1960s “brandishing style for its own sake.”

&quot;The Train&quot;’s original screenplay received an Academy Award nomination. It had cost $6.7 million. and was one of the 13 most popular films in the UK in 1965.

===&quot;Seconds&quot; (1966)===

&quot;Seconds&quot; presents a surreal and disturbing tale of a disillusioned corporate executive, Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph). In an effort to escape his empty existence, he submits to a traumatic surgical procedure that transforms his body into that of a younger man, Tony Wilson (Rock Hudson). Randolph&#x27;s effort to erase his former self in a new persona proves futile and leads to his horrific demise. Biographer Gerald Pratley describes &quot;Seconds&quot; as “a cold, grey, frightening picture of a dehumanized world...based on the age-old search for eternal youth...an amalgam of mystery, horror and science fiction…”

Based on a novel by David Ely and a screenplay by Lewis John Carlino, Frankenheimer explained his thematic objectives:

Frankenheimer acknowledged his difficulty in casting for the elderly and demoralized Arthur Hamilton, which required the director to convincingly show his metamorphosis, both surgically and physiologically, into the youthful and artistic Tony Wilson. A dual role played by a single actor was considered, with Frankenheimer advocating for British actor Laurence Olivier. Paramount rejected this in favor of two players, in which one actor (Randolph) undergoes a radical transformation to emerge with the appearance and identity of the other (Hudson). Rock Hudson&#x27;s portrayal of Wilson introduced a troubling plausibility issue that Frankenheimer fully recognized: “We knew we were going to have a terrible time getting audiences to believe that the man who went into the operating room (Randolph) could emerge as Rock Hudson, citing the physical disparity between the actors as problematic. Film historian Gerald Pratley concurs: “the weakness [in &quot;Seconds&quot;] is trying to convince audiences that the actor playing Hamilton could emerge, after plastic surgery, as Wilson in the form of Rock Hudson. This is where the star system has worked against Frankeheimer.”
Frankenheimer identified the source of the film&#x27;s weakness less on the physical disparities in his actors, and more on his difficulties conveying the themes required to explain Wilson&#x27;s inability to adjust socially to his new life: “We thought we had shown why [Wilson] failed, but after the film was finished I realized we had not.” 

Frankenheimer&#x27;s technical prowess is on display in &quot;Seconds&quot;, where the director and his cameraman James Wong Howe experimented with various lenses, including the 9.5 mm fisheye lens to achieve the “distortion and exaggeration” that would dramatize Hamilton&#x27;s struggle to “break free of his emotional straightjacket.”

Howe and Frankenheimer&#x27;s use of visual distortions are central to revealing his character&#x27;s hallucinatory mental states, and according to Frankenheimer “almost psychedelic”. In one scene, a total of four Arriflexes are brought to bear to emphasis Hamilton&#x27;s sexual impotency with his estranged wife. Film historian Peter Wilshire considers Frankenheimer&#x27;s choice of James Wong Howe as cameraman for the project was his “most important directional decision.” Howe was nominated at the Academy Awards in Best Cinematography for his efforts.
At Frankenheimer&#x27;s urging, Paramount executives agreed to enter &quot;Seconds&quot; at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, hoping the film might confer prestige on the studio and enhance box office returns. On the contrary, Seconds was savaged by European critics at the film competition, regarding it as misanthropic and “cruel”. Frankenheimer recalled “it was a disaster” and declined to attend the festival&#x27;s post-preview press conference. In the aftermath of this fiasco, Paramount withdraw promotional resources and &quot;Seconds&quot; failed at the box office. As consolation for its critical and commercial failures, &quot;Seconds&quot; was ultimately rewarded with a cult following among cineastes.

Critical appraisal of the film has varied widely. Gerald Pratley, in 1968, declares that &quot;Seconds&quot;, despite its poor reception in 1966, will one day be recognized as “a masterpiece.” Film critic Peter Wilshire offers qualified praise: “In spite of its obvious weaknesses, &quot;Seconds&quot; is an extremely complex, innovative, and ambitious film.” Brian Baxter disparages &quot;Seconds&quot; as “embarrassing...unconvincing, even as science fiction.” and critic David Walsh considers &quot;Seconds&quot; “particularly wrongheaded, strained and foolish.” Biographer Charles Higham writes:

===&quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966)===
By the mid-sixties, Frankenheimer had emerged as one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading directors.
As such, M-G-M provided lavish financing for &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), Frankenheimer&#x27;s first color film and shot in 70mm Cinerama. A former amateur race car driver himself, he approached the project with genuine enthusiasm.

The screenplay by Robert Alan Aurthur and an uncredited Frankenheimer, concerns the professional and personal fortunes of Formula One racer Pete Aron (James Garner) during an entire season of competitive racing. The action climaxes at Monza, where Aron, Scott Stoddard (Brian Bedford), Jean Pierre Sarti (Yves Montand) and Nino Barlini (Antonio Sabàto Sr.) compete for the championship, with tragic results.
Wishing to craft a highly realistic rendering of racing and its milieu, he assembled a panoply of innovative film techniques with ingenious apparatus and special effects. Working closely with cinematographer Lionel Lindon, Frankenheimer mounted cameras directly onto the race cars, eliminating process shots and providing audiences with a driver&#x27;s-eye view of the action. 
Frankenheimer incorporated split-screens to juxtapose documentary-like interviews of the racers with high-speed action shots on the track. Frankenheimer explains his use of the “hydrogen cannon”:

Characterized largely by Frankenheimer&#x27;s bravura application of his striking cinematic style, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; has been termed “largely a technical exercise” by film critic David Walsh and “brandishing style for its own sake” according to The Film Encyclopedia. Film historian Andrew Sarris observed that Frankenheimer&#x27;s style had “degenerated into an all-embracing academicism, a veritable glossary of film techniques.”
A commercial success, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; garnered three Oscars at the Academy Awards for Best Sound Effects (by Gordon Daniel), Best Editing (Henry Berman, Stu Linder and Frank Santillo), and for Best Sound Recording (Franklin Milton and Roy Charman).

===&quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot; (1969)===

Frankenheimer&#x27;s first foray into “light comedy” represents a major departure from his often dystopian and dramatic work addressing social issues and his big budget action films. &quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot; presents a menagerie of misfit characters set in the final days of World War II in the Pacific theatre. British Lt. Commander Finchhaven, R. N. (David Niven), a ghost, is condemned to a Flying Dutchman-like existence, roaming the seas in his ship &quot;Curmudgeon&quot; in search of redemption for his shameful ineptitude during a World War I combat mission. During World War II, the &quot;Curmudgeon&quot; is chartered, then beached on a remote Pacific Island by party goers. Four castaway American sailors stumble upon the unseaworthy vessel: Lt. Morton Krim (Alan Alda), Cook 3/C W.W. J. Oglethorpe (Mickey Rooney), Gunner&#x27;s Mate Orville Toole (Jack Carter) and Seaman 1/C Lightfoot Star (Manu Tupou). Jennifer Winslow (Faye Dunaway), the proprietor of a jungle garage, provides supplies to repair the derelict &quot;Curmudgeon&quot; for passage off the island. Commander Finchaven enlists the largely incompetent crew to seek out and sink a Japanese battleship and thus vindicate his family honor. The 79-minute picture depicts the crew&#x27;s subsequent “hazards and misadventures.” 
&quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot;, based on a screenplay and story by Phillip Rock, is a spoof of war-time conventions and clichés which integrates newsreel clips from the period for comic effect.
Frankenheimer engages in a mock-heroic burlesque, titling the film&#x27;s episodes “Grand Alliance”, “The Gathering Storm”, “Their Finest Hour”, The Hinge of Fate” and “Triumph and Tragedy”, borrowed from Winston Churchill&#x27;s post-war memoirs.

Filmed during the Vietnam War, film historian Gerald Pratley discerns “a strong thematic relationship” between Frankenheimer&#x27;s opposition to US invasion of Indo-China and &quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot;. Frankenheimer recalls that he and screenwriter Phillip Rock “decided we could really use this premise [of a ghostly naval officer] to make an anti-war statement. I think we did, and it terrified MGM.&quot;

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer delayed the release of the film for two years, reportedly due its poor response among critics and “dismal screenings”, though Frankenheimer attributes the delay to legalities obtaining release of historic newsreel footage. The studio made only perfunctory efforts to promote and exhibit the film after &quot;The Extraordinary Seaman&quot;’s poor critical reviews and weak box-office response.

===&quot;The Fixer&quot; (1968)===

Frankenheimer approached his film adaption of Bernard Malamud&#x27;s &quot;The Fixer&quot; with alacrity, obtaining the galleys for the 1966 novel in advance of its publication. &quot;The Fixer&quot; is based on the 1913 persecution and trial of the Jewish peasant Menahem Mendel Beilis, accused of Blood Libel during the reign of Czar Nicholas II

&quot;The Fixer&quot; was widely praised by movie critics for Frankenheimer&#x27;s success in eliciting outstanding performances from Alan Bates as the brutalized Yakov Shepsovitch Bok, Dirk Bogarde as Boris Bibikov, his humane court appointed defense attorney, and David Warner as Count Odoevsky. Minister of Justice. Bates received his only Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in this role. Renata Adler of the New York Times observed “the direction, by John Frankenheimer, is powerful and discreet. It averts its eyes at the easy, ugly consummations of violence...and gives you credit for imagining the result.” This, despite Frankenheimer&#x27;s admission that “there is a very violent scene in &quot;The Fixer&quot;”:


Whereas Frankenheimer was deeply gratified with his cinematic handling of Malamud&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize winning work, declaring “I feel better about &quot;The Fixer&quot; than anything I’ve ever done in my life”, a number of movie critics registered severe critiques. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote:

Ebert adds “What were needed were fewer self-conscious humanistic speeches... Frankenheimer should have shown us his hero&#x27;s suffering, and the Kafkaesque legal tortures of the state, without commenting on them.”

Film critic Renata Adler singles out screenwriter and blacklist victim Dalton Trumbo for disparagement:


Adler concludes “it is not enough to put [Bok-Bates] in a few cliché predicaments...[the dialogue] becomes demeaning and vulgar when drawn out with hack-plot fiction approximations of eloquence.” Biographer Charles Higham dismisses the film, writing that “since the commercial failure of &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966), Frankenheimer&#x27;s films have been mediocre, ranging from &quot;The Fixer&quot; (1968) to &quot;The Horsemen&quot; (1971).”

Frankenheimer became a close friend of Senator Robert F. Kennedy during the making of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; in 1962. In 1968, Kennedy asked Frankenheimer to make some commercials for use in the presidential campaign, at which he hoped to become the Democratic candidate. On the night he was assassinated in June 1968, it was Frankenheimer who had driven Kennedy from Los Angeles Airport to the Ambassador Hotel for his acceptance speech.

&quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot; was a romantic drama about a troupe of barnstorming skydivers and their impact on a small midwestern town. The celebration of Americana starred Frankenheimer regular Lancaster, reuniting him with &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; co-star Deborah Kerr, and it also featured Gene Hackman. The film failed to find an audience, but Frankenheimer claimed it was one of his favorites.

===1970s===
Frankenheimer followed this with &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; in 1970. The film, starring Gregory Peck and Tuesday Weld, about a Tennessee sheriff who falls in love with a moonshiner&#x27;s daughter, was set to songs by Johnny Cash. Frankenheimer&#x27;s next project took him to Afghanistan. &quot;The Horseman&quot; focused on the relationship between a father and son, played by Jack Palance and Omar Sharif. Sharif&#x27;s character, an expert horseman, played the Afghan national sport of buzkashi.

&quot;Impossible Object&quot;, also known as &quot;Story of a Love Story&quot;, suffered distribution difficulties and was not widely released. Next came a four-hour film of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, in 1973, starring Lee Marvin, and the decidedly offbeat &quot;99 and 44/100% Dead&quot;, a crime black comedy starring Richard Harris.

With his fluent French and knowledge of French culture, Frankenheimer was asked to direct &quot;French Connection II&quot;, set entirely in Marseille. With Hackman reprising his role as New York cop Popeye Doyle, the film was a success and got Frankenheimer his next job. &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, based on author Thomas Harris&#x27;s only non-Hannibal Lecter novel up to that point, involves an Israeli Mossad agent (Robert Shaw) chasing a pro-Palestinian terrorist (Marthe Keller) and a PTSD-afflicted Vietnam vet (Bruce Dern), who plan a spectacular mass-murder involving the Goodyear Blimp which flies over the Super Bowl. It was shot on location at the actual Super Bowl X in January 1976 in Miami, with the use of a real Goodyear Blimp. The film tested very highly, and Paramount and Frankenheimer had high expectations for it, but it was not a hit (with Paramount blaming the failure on the special effects work in the climax, and Universal Studios releasing the similarly themed thriller &quot;Two-Minute Warning&quot; only six months prior).

In 1977, Carter DeHaven hired Frankenheimer to direct William Sackheim and Michael Kozoll&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;First Blood&quot;. After considering Michael Douglas, Powers Boothe, and Nick Nolte for the role of John Rambo Frankenheimer cast Brad Davis. He also cast George C. Scott as Colonel Trautman. However, the production was abandoned after Orion Pictures acquired its distributor Filmways, and Sackheim and Kozoll&#x27;s script would be rewritten by Sylvester Stallone as the basis for Ted Kotcheff&#x27;s 1982 film.

Frankenheimer is quoted in Champlin&#x27;s biography as saying that his alcohol problem caused him to do work that was below his own standards on &quot;Prophecy&quot; (1979), an ecological monster movie about a mutant grizzly bear terrorizing a forest in Maine.

===1980s===
In 1981, Frankenheimer travelled to Japan to shoot the cult martial-arts action film &quot;The Challenge&quot;, with Scott Glenn and Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. He told Champlin that his drinking became so severe while shooting in Japan that he actually drank on set, which he had never done before, and as a result he entered rehab on returning to America. The film was released in 1982, along with his HBO television adaptation of the acclaimed play &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;.

In 1985, Frankenheimer directed an adaptation of the Robert Ludlum bestseller &quot;The Holcroft Covenant&quot;, starring Michael Caine. That was followed the next year with another adaptation, &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot;, from the novel by Elmore Leonard. &quot;Dead Bang&quot; (1989) followed Don Johnson as he infiltrated a group of white supremacists. In 1990, he returned to the Cold War political thriller genre with &quot;The Fourth War&quot; with Roy Scheider (with whom Frankenheimer had worked previously on &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot;) as a loose cannon Army colonel drawn into a dangerous personal war with a Soviet officer. It was not a commercial success.

===1990s===
Most of his 1980s films were less than successful, both critically and financially, but Frankenheimer was able to make a comeback in the 1990s by returning to his roots in television. He directed two films for HBO in 1994: &quot;Against the Wall&quot; and &quot;The Burning Season&quot; that won him several awards and renewed acclaim. The director also helmed two films for Turner Network Television, &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1996) and &quot;George Wallace&quot; (1997), that were highly praised.

Frankenheimer&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The Island of Doctor Moreau&quot;, which he took over after the firing of original director Richard Stanley, was the cause of countless stories of production woes and personality clashes and received scathing reviews. Frankenheimer was said to be unable to stand Val Kilmer, the young co-star of the film and whose disruption had reportedly led to the removal of Stanley half a week into production. When Kilmer&#x27;s last scene was completed, Frankenheimer reportedly said, &quot;Now get that bastard off my set.&quot; He also stated, &quot;There are two things I will never ever do in my whole life: I will never climb Mt. Everest and I will never work with Val Kilmer ever again.&quot; The veteran director also professed that &quot;Will Rogers never met Val Kilmer&quot;. In an interview, Frankenheimer refused to discuss the film, saying only that he had a miserable time making it.

However, his next film, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Ronin&quot;, starring Robert De Niro, was a return to form, featuring Frankenheimer&#x27;s now trademark elaborate car chases woven into a labyrinthine espionage plot. Co-starring an international cast including Jean Reno and Jonathan Pryce, it was a critical and box-office success. As the 1990s drew to a close, he even had a rare acting role, appearing in a cameo as a U.S. general in &quot;The General&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1999). He earlier had an uncredited cameo as a TV director in his 1977 film &quot;Black Sunday&quot;.

===Last years and death===
Frankenheimer&#x27;s last theatrical film, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Reindeer Games&quot;, starring Ben Affleck, underperformed. In 2001, he worked on the BMW action short-film &quot;Ambush&quot; for the promotional series &quot;The Hire&quot;, starring Clive Owen. Frankenheimer&#x27;s final film, &quot;Path to War&quot; (2002) for HBO was nominated for numerous awards. A look back at the Vietnam War, it starred Michael Gambon as President Lyndon Johnson along with Alec Baldwin and Donald Sutherland.

Frankenheimer was scheduled to direct &quot;&quot;, but it was announced before filming started that he was withdrawing, citing health concerns. Paul Schrader replaced him. About a month later he died suddenly in Los Angeles, California, from a stroke due to complications following spinal surgery at the age of 72.

==Politics==

Frankenheimer was born into a politically conservative family and attended a Catholic military academy. He served as a junior officer in the US Air Force during the Korean War. In his youth, he briefly considered entering the priesthood.
He came of age during the height of the Red Scare and the Anti-Communist House Un-American Activities Committee investigations during the early 1950s, a period that saw the blacklisting of left-wing filmmakers and screenwriters by the Hollywood studios. Frankenheimer&#x27;s early liberal political sensibilities first manifested themselves in disputes with his conservative father, a stockbroker:


Frankenheimer&#x27;s “liberal sensibility” emerged professionally when he began his apprenticeship in the early TV industry:
 
Film critic David Walsh notes that “any medium which emerged as the profit-driven property of large American corporations and under the close scrutiny of the US authorities in the midst of the Cold War, with its anticommunism, conformism and generally stagnant intellectual climate, would inevitably be deformed by those processes...Frankenheimer worked and apparently thrived within this overall artistic and ideological framework.”
===Political relationships with the Kennedys===

In a 1998 interview with film critic Alex Simon, Frankenheimer recalled that his first contact with Kennedy family politics occurred during the 1960 presidential campaigns: 

In light of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, Frankenheimer lamented, &quot;Then he was killed, and I&#x27;d always felt guilty about not having done that work for him early on.&quot; 
During his filming of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), Frankenheimer reports that he and producer/screenwriter George Axelrod were anxious that the Kennedy administration might object to the plot, which graphically depicts an assassination attempt on a liberal presidential candidate by a right-wing conspiracy. When cast member Frank Sinatra, a personal friend of Kennedy, was sent to sound out his reaction to the film, Kennedy (who had read the Richard Condon novel) responded enthusiastically: &quot;I love The Manchurian Candidate. Who&#x27;s going to play the mother?&quot;

When Frankenheimer began pre-production on his political thriller &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1964) in the summer of 1963, he approached Kennedy&#x27;s press secretary, Pierre Salinger, to arrange to film a segment on location in vicinity of the White House. The story concerns a political coup organized by a fascistic Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (played by Burt Lancaster) to depose the liberal president (played by Fredric March) and install a military dictatorship. Kennedy approved the picture and accommodated Frankenheimer by withdrawing to his home in Hyannisport for the weekend during the White House shoot.
As to whether Frankenheimer ever met Kennedy, the director offered contradictory versions. To biographer Gerald Pratley in 1968, Frankenheimer said, &quot;I never had the pleasure of meeting [JFK] personally&quot; but noted that Kennedy had fully supported the production of &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;. In 1998, during an interview with film critic Alex Simon, Frankenheimer recalled that Kennedy purportedly said to Salinger, &quot;if it&#x27;s John Frankenheimer [directing &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;] I want to meet him.&quot; Frankenheimer adds, “So I met him, went to a press conference with him. He was wonderful to me.”

Frankenheimer regarded Kennedy&#x27;s assassination as a profound calamity for America: “I think we lost our innocence as a country with John F. Kennedy&#x27;s death.”
Film critics Joanne Laurier and David Walsh observe that “The Kennedy assassination marked a historical turning point. One of its aims, in which it ultimately succeeded, was to shift US government policies to the right and intimidate political opposition.”
Frankenheimer&#x27;s most significant bond with the Kennedys was his political and personal relationship with Senator Robert F. Kennedy, to whom he quickly committed his services during the 1968 presidential campaign: “When [Robert Kennedy] declared his candidacy in &#x27;68, I immediately called [campaign manager] Pierre Salinger and said ‘Pierre, I want to be part of this.’&quot; 
Frankenheimer reports that he filmed Robert Kennedy&#x27;s campaign appearances and coached the senator on improving his political persona, providing this support for Kennedy over three months in the spring of 1968.
Frankenheimer was devastated by RFK&#x27;s assassination in June 1968, due in part to his proximity to the event. Kennedy spent the night before the California primary in Frankenheimer’s Malibu home. He had first been scheduled to accompany Kennedy through the Ambassador Hotel after the candidate&#x27;s victory speech in the California primaries. Early news reports listed Frankenheimer as one of the wounded in Kennedy&#x27;s entourage. Frankenheimer and spouse Evans Evans were waiting at a side entrance of the Ambassador Hotel to pick up Kennedy when he emerged from the press conference and drive him to their home. According to Frankenheimer, they witnessed police removing Sirhan Sirhan, later convicted of the shooting, from the premises, then discovered Kennedy had been mortally wounded.
Traumatized by the event, Frankenheimer withdrew from politics, and after completing &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot; (1969) moved to France to study the culinary arts. He recalled in 1998: “Yeah. I managed to finish one film, &quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot;, but I just felt like &#x27;What&#x27;s the point? What does any of this really matter?&#x27; I mean, when you&#x27;re a part of something like that and then all of the sudden it&#x27;s taken away with just one bullet [snaps fingers]. It really makes you take stock in what&#x27;s important...That&#x27;s when I went to France, and that&#x27;s when I went to Le Cordon Bleu, because I just had to do something else with my life, and I really couldn&#x27;t go near politics for a long time after that.” Walsh comments:

<doc id="16346" wikidata="Q335028" url="?curid=16346" title="John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, (5 December 1859 – 20 November 1935) was a Royal Navy officer. He fought in the Anglo-Egyptian War and the Boxer Rebellion and commanded the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 during the First World War. His handling of the fleet at that battle was controversial. Jellicoe made no serious mistakes and the German High Seas Fleet retreated to port, at a time when defeat would have been catastrophic for Britain, but the public was disappointed that the Royal Navy had not won a more dramatic victory given that they outnumbered the enemy. Jellicoe later served as First Sea Lord, overseeing the expansion of the Naval Staff at the Admiralty and the introduction of convoys, but was relieved at the end of 1917. He also served as the governor-general of New Zealand in the early 1920s.

==Early life==
Jellicoe was born on 5 December 1859 in Southampton, Hampshire. Jellicoe was the son of John Henry Jellicoe, a captain in the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, and Lucy Henrietta Jellicoe (née Keele). He was educated at Field House School in Rottingdean and aboard the training ship , which he joined as a naval cadet in 1872. He was made a midshipman in the steam frigate in September 1874 before transferring to the ironclad in the Mediterranean Fleet in July 1877. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 5 December 1878, he joined , flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet, as signal sub-lieutenant in 1880. Promoted to lieutenant on 23 September 1880, he returned to HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot; in February 1881 and commanded a rifle company of the Naval Brigade at Ismailia during the Egyptian war of 1882.

===Early career ===
Jellicoe qualified as a gunnery officer in 1883 and was appointed to the staff of the gunnery school in May 1884. He joined the turret ship as gunnery officer in September 1885 and was awarded the Board of Trade Silver Medal for rescuing the crew of a capsized steamer near Gibraltar in May 1886. He joined the battleship in April 1886 and was put in charge of the experimental department at HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; in December 1886 before being appointed an assistant to the Director of Naval Ordnance in September 1889.
Promoted to commander on 30 June 1891, Jellicoe joined the battleship in the Mediterranean Fleet in March 1892. He transferred to the battleship in 1893 (the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon) and was aboard when it collided with and sank off Tripoli in Lebanon on 22 June 1893. He was then appointed to the new flagship, , in October 1893.

Promoted to captain on 1 January 1897, Jellicoe became a member of the Admiralty&#x27;s Ordnance Committee. He served as Captain of the battleship and chief of staff to Vice Admiral Sir Edward Seymour during the Seymour Expedition to relieve the legations at Peking during the Boxer Rebellion in June 1900. He was badly wounded during the Battle of Beicang and told he would die but confounded the attending doctor and chaplain by living. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and given the German Order of the Red Eagle, 2nd class, with Crossed Swords for services rendered in China. &quot;Centurion&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in August 1901, and was paid off the following month, when Captain Jellicoe and the crew went on leave. He became Naval Assistant to Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy in February 1902 and was given command of the armoured cruiser on the North America and West Indies Station in August 1903.

== Naval career ==
===High command===

As a protege of Admiral John Fisher, Jellicoe became Director of Naval Ordnance in 1905 and, having been appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on the occasion of launching of on 10 February 1906, he was also made an Aide-de-Camp to the King on 8 March 1906. Promoted to rear admiral on 8 February 1907, he pushed hard for funds to modernise the navy, supporting the construction of new -type battleships and s. He supported F. C. Dreyer&#x27;s improvements in gunnery fire-control systems, and favoured the adoption of Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Fire Control Table&quot;, a form of mechanical computer for calculating firing solutions for warships. Jellicoe arranged for the output of naval ordnance to be transferred from the War Office to the Admiralty.

Jellicoe was appointed second-in-command of the Atlantic Fleet in August 1907, hoisting his flag in the battleship . He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on the occasion of the King&#x27;s Review of the Home Fleet in the Solent on 3 August 1907. He went on to be Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy in October 1908 and, having taken part in the funeral of King Edward VII in May 1910, he became Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet in December 1910, hoisting his flag in the battleship . He advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on the Coronation of King George V on 19 June 1911 and confirmed in the rank of vice admiral on 18 September 1911. He went on to be Second-in-Command of the Home Fleet, hoisting his flag in the battleship , in December 1911 and, having also been appointed commander of the 2nd Battle Squadron in May 1912, joined the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines on 1 August 1912. He became Second Sea Lord in December 1912.

===First World War===

At the start of the First World War, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, removed Admiral George Callaghan, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet (August 1914). Jellicoe was promoted to full admiral on 4 August 1914 and assigned command of the renamed Grand Fleet in Admiral Callaghan&#x27;s place, though he was appalled by the treatment of his predecessor. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 8 February 1915.

When Fisher (First Sea Lord) and Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty) both had to leave office (May 1915) after their quarrel over the Dardanelles, Jellicoe wrote to Fisher: &quot;We owe you a debt of gratitude for having saved the Navy from a continuance in office of Mr Churchill, and I hope that never again will any politician be allowed to usurp the functions that he took upon himself to exercise&quot;.

Jellicoe commanded the British Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, the largest (and only major) clash of dreadnoughts, albeit an indecisive one. His handling of the Grand Fleet during the battle remains controversial, with some historians characterising Jellicoe as too cautious and other historians faulting the battlecruiser commander, Admiral David Beatty, for making various tactical errors. Jellicoe certainly made no significant mistakes during the battle: based on limited intelligence, he correctly deployed the Grand Fleet with a turn to port so as to &quot;cross the T&quot; of the German High Seas Fleet as it appeared. After suffering heavy damage from shells, the German fleet turned 180 degrees and headed away from the battle. At the time the British public expressed disappointment that the Royal Navy had not won a victory on the scale of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar. Churchill described Jellicoe later as &quot;the only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon&quot; essentially hinting that Jellicoe&#x27;s decision to prefer caution was strategically correct. He was appointed a member of the Order of Merit on 31 May 1916, advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 17 June 1916 and awarded the Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honour on 15 September 1916.

===First Sea Lord===

Jellicoe was appointed First Sea Lord in November 1916. His term of office saw Britain brought within danger of starvation by German unrestricted U-Boat warfare.

At the War Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1915–16) in November 1916, the admirals present, including Jellicoe, told Lloyd George that convoys presented too large a target for enemy ships, and that merchant ship masters lacked the discipline to &quot;keep station&quot; in a convoy. In February 1917, Maurice Hankey wrote a memorandum for Lloyd George calling for the introduction of &quot;scientifically organised convoys&quot;, almost certainly after being persuaded by Commander Henderson and the Shipping Ministry officials with whom he was in contact. After a breakfast meeting (13 February 1917) with Lloyd George, Carson (First Lord of the Admiralty) and Admirals Jellicoe and Duff agreed to &quot;conduct experiments&quot;. However, convoys were not in general use until August 1917, by which time shipping losses to U-boats were already falling from their April peak.

Jellicoe continued to take a pessimistic view, advising the War Policy Committee (a Cabinet Committee which discussed strategy in 1917) during planning meetings for the Third Ypres Offensive in June and July that nothing could be done to defeat the U-boats. However, removing Jellicoe in July, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of Churchill (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as Minister of Munitions. In August and September Lloyd George was preoccupied with Third Ypres and the possible transfer of resources to Italy, whilst the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Eric Campbell Geddes, was reforming the Naval Staff (including creating a post for Wemyss as Deputy First Sea Lord). Geddes and Lloyd George met with Balfour and Carson (both former First Lords of the Admiralty) on 26 October to discuss sacking Jellicoe after he had failed to act on &quot;secret, but absolutely reliable&quot; information about a German attack on a Norwegian convoy, but again nothing came of this as Lloyd George was soon preoccupied by the Battle of Caporetto and the setting up of the Supreme War Council. Geddes wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transportation in France, and by December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Geddes.

Jellicoe was rather abruptly dismissed by Geddes in December 1917. Before he left for leave on Christmas Eve he received a letter from Geddes demanding his resignation. Geddes&#x27; letter stated that he was still in the building and available to talk, but after consulting Admiral Halsey Jellicoe replied in writing that he would &quot;do what was best for the service&quot;. The move became public knowledge two days later.

The Christmas holiday, when Parliament was not sitting, provided a good opportunity to remove Jellicoe with a minimum of fuss. Geddes squared matters with the King and with the Grand Fleet commander Admiral Beatty (who had initially written to Jellicoe of his &quot;dismay&quot; over his sacking and promised to speak to Geddes, but then did not write to him again for a month) over the holiday. The other Sea Lords talked of resigning (although Jellicoe advised them not to do so), especially when Geddes suggested in a meeting (31 December) that Balfour and Carson had specifically recommended Jellicoe&#x27;s removal at the 26 October meeting; they had not done so, although Balfour&#x27;s denial was less than emphatic. There was no trouble from the generals, who had a low opinion of Jellicoe. In the end the Sea Lords remained in place, whilst Carson remained a member of the War Cabinet, resigning in January over Irish Home Rule.

Although it was pretended that the decision had been Geddes&#x27; alone, he let slip in the Naval Estimates debate (6 March 1918) that he had been conveying &quot;the decision of the Government&quot;, i.e. of Lloyd George, who had never put the matter to the War Cabinet. MPs picked up on his slip immediately, and Bonar Law (Conservative Leader) admitted in the same debate that he too had had prior knowledge.

As First Sea Lord Jellicoe was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 21 April 1917, the Russian Order of St. George, 3rd Class on 5 June 1917, the Grand Cross of the Italian Military Order of Savoy on 11 August 1917 and the Grand Cordon of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun on 29 August 1917.

== Later life ==
=== After war ===
Jellicoe was created Viscount Jellicoe of Scapa Flow on 7 March 1918.

At the Supreme War Council at the start of June 1918, amidst concerns that—following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk—the Germans were about to requisition the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Lloyd George proposed Jellicoe as Allied Supreme Naval Commander in the Mediterranean. The French were in favour of a combined Allied naval command, but the Italians were not, so nothing came of the suggestion.
Jellicoe was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 April 1919. He became Governor-General of New Zealand in September 1920 and while there also served as Grand Master of New Zealand&#x27;s Masonic Grand Lodge. Following his return to England, he was created Earl Jellicoe and Viscount Brocas of Southampton in the County of Southampton on 1 July 1925. He also served as the Commissioner for London Boy Scouts from 1925 to 1928. He was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire in 1932. He died of pneumonia at his home in Kensington in London on 20 November 1935 and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Legacy==
In 1919, &quot;Sleep, beneath the wave! a requiem&quot; with words by Rev. Alfred Hall and Music by Albert Ham was &quot;Dedicated to Admiral Viscount Jellicoe.&quot;

The attempt of his official biographer, Admiral Reginald Bacon, to portray him as the conqueror of the U-boats is, in John Grigg&#x27;s view, absurd, as the main decisions were allegedly taken by other men. Bacon also claimed that his elevation to a viscountcy on dismissal was a deliberate snub, but in fact Sir John French, the former Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, was only a viscount at the time (both he and Jellicoe became Earls subsequently), whilst Fisher was never more than a Baron. Bacon&#x27;s neutrality may be questionable as he had himself been sacked by Geddes from command of the Dover Patrol, replaced by Roger Keyes, shortly after Jellicoe&#x27;s removal.

==Family==
Jellicoe married, at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, on 1 July 1902, Florence Gwendoline Cayzer, daughter of the shipping magnate Sir Charles Cayzer. His brother, Rev. Frederick Jellicoe (1858–1927), conducted the service. Lord and Lady Jellicoe had a son and five daughters. His son George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe had a military career during the Second World War, after which he was a parliamentarian and a businessman.

<text>Admiral Sir John Forster &quot;Sandy&quot; Woodward, (1 May 1932 – 4 August 2013) was a senior Royal Navy officer who commanded the Task Force of the Falklands War.

==Early life==
Woodward was born on 1 May 1932 at Marazion, near Penzance, Cornwall, to a bank clerk. He was educated at Stubbington House School, preparatory school in Stubbington, Hampshire. He then continued his education at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon.

==Naval career==
On graduation from the Royal Naval College Dartmouth Woodward joined the Royal Navy in 1946. He became a submariner in 1954, and was promoted to lieutenant that May. In 1960 he passed the Royal Navy&#x27;s rigorous Submarine Command Course known as &quot;The Perisher&quot;, and received his first command, the T-class submarine HMS &quot;Tireless&quot;. Promoted to lieutenant-commander in May 1962, he then commanded HMS &quot;Grampus&quot; before becoming the second in command of the nuclear fleet submarine HMS &quot;Valiant&quot;. In 1967, he was promoted to commander and became the Instructor (known as &quot;Teacher&quot;) of The Perisher Course. He took command of HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; in December 1969. He was promoted to the rank of captain in 1972. In 1974, he became Captain of Submarine Training and in 1976 he took command of HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;.

He became Head of Naval Plans in the Ministry of Defence in 1978. In July 1981, he was promoted to rear admiral and appointed as Flag Officer First Flotilla.

===Falklands War===
In 1982, he commanded HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; aircraft carrier group, Task Group 317.8, in the Falklands War. The Commander-in-Chief Fleet Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse, served as the Task Force commander, CTF-317. The task group containing the amphibious ships which launched the invasion TG 317.0 was commanded by Commodore Michael Clapp, with Task Group 317.1 being the landing force itself.

He worked out the timetable for the campaign, starting from the end and working to the start. Knowing that the Argentine forces had to be defeated before the Southern Hemisphere winter made conditions too bad, he set a latest date by which the land forces had to be ashore, that in turn set a latest date by which control of the air had to be achieved, and so on.

Possibly the best known single incident was the sinking of the ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot;. He knew that &quot;General Belgrano&quot;, and particularly her Exocet-armed escorts, were a threat to the task force and he ordered that she be sunk. Admiral Sir George Zambellas credited &quot;Woodward&#x27;s inspirational leadership and tactical acumen ... [as] a major factor in shaping the success of the British forces in the South Atlantic&quot;.

Woodward was knighted for his services in the conflict. He wrote a book entitled &quot;One Hundred Days&quot;, co-authored by Patrick Robinson, describing his Falklands experiences.

===Later career===
In 1983, Woodward was appointed Flag Officer Submarines and NATO Commander Submarines Eastern Atlantic. In 1984, he was promoted to vice admiral, and in 1985 he was Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments). In 1987, he was promoted to admiral. That year he also served, as Commander-in-Chief Naval Home Command and Flag Aide-de-Camp to the Queen. Woodward retired in 1989.

==Later life==

The first edition of Woodward&#x27;s memoirs was published in 1992. They were well received and were updated in 2003 and 2012 with updated recollections as well as responses to the memoirs and responses made by Commodore Michael Clapp. In his later life Woodward wrote various opinion pieces for British newspapers regarding defence matters, particularly the Strategic Defence and Security Review.

==Death==
He died of heart failure in his 82nd year on 4 August 2013 at Bosham, West Sussex. A memorial service was held for him at Chichester Cathedral on 14 November 2013, with Admiral Sir George Zambellas representing the Queen.

==Personal life==
Woodward married Charlotte McMurtrie in 1960, the marriage producing a son and a daughter. Lady Woodward died in 2022.

==Honours and decorations==



On 11 October 1982, Woodward was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) &#x27;in recognition of service within the operations in the South Atlantic&#x27;. In the 1989 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

<text>Johann Friedrich Endersch (25 October 1705 – 28 March 1769) was a German cartographer and mathematician. Endersch also held the title of Royal Mathematician to King Augustus III of Poland. 
==Life==
Endersch was born in Dörnfeld an der Heide, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Thuringia, but lived most of his life in Elbing (Elbląg), Royal Prussia in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1755 Endersch completed for Imperial Prince-Bishop Adam Stanisław Grabowski (&quot;Celsissimo ac Reverendissimo S. Rom. Imp. Principi Domino Adam Stanislao in Grabowo Grabowski Episcopo Warmiensi et Sambiesi, Terrarum Prussiae Praesidis ...&quot;) a map of Warmia titled &quot;Tabula Geographica Episcopatum Warmiensem in Prussia Exhibens&quot;. The map, detailing the towns of Warmia (Ermland), was commissioned for the court of Holy Roman Emperor Francis I.

Endersch also made a copper etching that depicted a galiot that had been built in Elbing in 1738 and was named &quot;D&#x27; Stadt Elbing&quot; (German for &quot;City of Elbląg&quot;).

<text>James Paul Blaylock (born September 20, 1950) is an American fantasy author. He is noted for a distinctive, humorous style, as well as being one of the pioneers of the steampunk genre of science fiction. Blaylock has cited Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Dickens as his inspirations.

He was born in Long Beach, California; studied English at California State University, Fullerton, receiving an M.A. in 1974; and lives in Orange, California, teaching creative writing at Chapman University. He taught at the Orange County School of the arts until 2013. Many of his books are set in Orange County, California, and can more specifically be termed &quot;fabulism&quot;that is, fantastic things happen in our present-day world, rather than in high fantasy, where the setting is often some other world. His works have also been categorized as magic realism.

He and his friends Tim Powers and K. W. Jeter were mentored by Philip K. Dick. Along with Powers, Blaylock invented the poet William Ashbless. Blaylock and Powers have often collaborated with each other on writing stories, including &quot;The Better Boy&quot;, &quot;On Pirates&quot;, and &quot;The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook&quot;.

Blaylock previously served as director of the Creative Writing Conservatory at the Orange County High School of the Arts until 2013, where Powers has also been Writer in Residence.

He has been married to his wife, Viki Blaylock, for more than 40 years. They have two sons.

==Awards==
Blaylock&#x27;s short story &quot;Thirteen Phantasms&quot; won the 1997 World Fantasy Award for best Short Fiction. &quot;Paper Dragons&quot; won the award in 1986. &quot;Homunculus&quot; won the Philip K. Dick award in 1987.

<text>Jerry Eugene Pournelle (; August 7, 1933 – September 8, 2017) was an American scientist in the area of operations research and human factors research, a science fiction writer, essayist, journalist, and one of the first bloggers. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he worked in the aerospace industry, but eventually focused on his writing career. In an obituary in &quot;Gizmodo&quot;, he was described as &quot;a tireless ambassador for the future.&quot;

Pournelle&#x27;s hard science fiction writing received multiple awards. In addition to his solo writing, he wrote several novels with collaborators including Larry Niven. Pournelle served a term as President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.

Pournelle&#x27;s journalism focused primarily on the computer industry, astronomy, and space exploration. From the 1970s until the early 1990s, he contributed to the computer magazine &quot;Byte&quot;, writing from the viewpoint of an intelligent user, with the oft-cited credo, &quot;We do this stuff so you won&#x27;t have to.&quot; He created one of the first blogs, entitled &quot;Chaos Manor&quot;, which included commentary about politics, computer technology, space technology, and science fiction.

Pournelle held paleoconservative political views, which were sometimes expressed in his fiction. He was one of the founders of the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on National Space Policy, which developed some of the Reagan Administration&#x27;s space initiatives, including the earliest versions of what would become the Strategic Defense Initiative.

==Early years==
Pournelle was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the seat of Caddo Parish in northwestern Louisiana, and later lived with his family in Capleville, Tennessee, an unincorporated area near Memphis. Percival Pournelle, his father, was a radio advertising executive and general manager of several radio stations. Ruth Pournelle, his mother, was a teacher, although during World War II, she worked in a munitions factory.

He attended first grade at St. Anne&#x27;s Elementary School, in Memphis, which had two grades to a classroom. Beginning with third grade, he attended Coleville Consolidated Elementary School, in Colevile, which had about 25 pupils per grade and four rooms and four teachers for 8 grades Pournelle attended high school at Christian Brothers College in Memphis, run by the De La Salle Christian Brothers; despite its name, it was a high school at the time.

He served in the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1953–54, after his military service, Pournelle attended the University of Iowa in Iowa City. Subsequently, he studied at the University of Washington, where he received a B.S. in psychology on June 11, 1955; an M.S. in psychology (experimental statistics) on March 21, 1958; and a Ph.D. in political science in March 1964.

His master&#x27;s thesis is titled &quot;Behavioural observations of the effects of personality needs and leadership in small discussion groups&quot;, and is dated 1957. Pournelle&#x27;s Ph.D. dissertation is titled &quot;The American political continuum; an examination of the validity of the left-right model as an instrument for studying contemporary American political &#x27;isms&#x27;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pournelle married Roberta Jane Isdell in 1959; the couple had five children. His wife, and son, naval officer Phillip, and daughter, archaeologist Jennifer, have also written science fiction in collaboration with their father.

In 2008, Pournelle battled a brain tumor, which appeared to respond favorably to radiation treatment. An August 28, 2008 report on his weblog claimed he was now cancer-free. Pournelle suffered a stroke on December 16, 2014, for which he was hospitalized for a time. By June 2015, he was writing again, though impairment from the stroke had slowed his typing. Pournelle died in his sleep of heart failure at his home in Studio City, California, on September 8, 2017.

==Faith and worldview==
Pournelle was raised a Unitarian. He converted to Roman Catholicism while attending Christian Brothers College.

Pournelle was introduced to Malthusian principles upon reading the book &quot;Road to Survival&quot; by the ecologist (and ornithologist) William Vogt, who depicted an Earth denuded of species other than humans, all of them headed for squalor. Concerned about the Malthusian dangers of human overpopulation, and considering the Catholic Church&#x27;s position on contraception to be untenable, he left the Catholic Church while an undergraduate at the University of Iowa. Pournelle eventually returned to religion, and for a number of years was a high church Anglican, in part because Anglican theology was virtually identical to Catholic theology, with the exception that the Anglicans accepted as moral the use of birth control.

Pournelle eventually returned to the Catholic Church, as his other beliefs were consistent with the Catholic communion, although he did not agree with the Church&#x27;s position on birth control. Despite his estrangement from the Catholic Church, he opposed having the government require that Catholic institutions provide access to birth control or abortion. He wrote that Sunday attendance at St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church, in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, was part of his family&#x27;s routine. Upon his death, his family arranged a memorial mass at the church, on 16 September 2017.

==Career==
Pournelle was an intellectual protégé of Russell Kirk and Stefan T. Possony. Pournelle wrote numerous publications with Possony, including &quot;The Strategy of Technology&quot; (1970). &quot;The Strategy&quot; has been used as a textbook at the United States Military Academy (West Point), the United States Air Force Academy (Colorado Springs), the Air War College, and the National War College.

He told fellow author Robert Heinlein, Pournelle recalled, &quot;that once I got into advance plans at Boeing I probably wrote more science fiction than he did, and I didn&#x27;t have to put characters in mine&quot;. In the late 1950s, while conducting operations research at the company, he envisioned a weapon consisting of massive tungsten rods dropped from high above the Earth. These super-dense, super-fast kinetic energy projectiles delivered enormous destructive force to the target without contaminating the environs with radioactive isotopes, as would occur with a nuclear bomb. Pournelle named his superweapon “Project Thor”. Others called it &quot;Rods from God&quot;. Pournelle headed the Human Factors Laboratory at Boeing, where his group did pioneering work on astronaut heat tolerance in extreme environments. His group also did experimental work that resulted in certification of the passenger oxygen system for the Boeing 707 airplane. He later worked as a Systems Analyst in a design and analysis group at the company, where he did strategic analysis of proposed new weapons systems.

In 1964, Pournelle joined the Aerospace Corporation in San Bernardino, California where he was Editor of &quot;Project 75&quot;, a major study of all ballistic missile technology for the purpose of making recommendations to the US Air Force on investment in technologies required to build the missile force to be deployed in 1975. After Project 75 was completed Pournelle became manager of several advanced concept studies.

At North American Rockwell’s Space Division, Pournelle was associate director of operations research, where he took part in the Apollo program and general operations.

He was founding President of the Pepperdine Research Institute. In 1989, Pournelle, Max Hunter, and retired Army Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham made a presentation to then Vice President Dan Quayle promoting development of the DC-X rocket.

Pournelle was among those who in 1968 signed a pro-Vietnam War advertisement in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;. During the 1970s and 1980s, he also published articles on military tactics and war gaming in the military simulations industry in Avalon Hill&#x27;s magazine &quot;The General&quot;. That led him into correspondences with some of the early figures in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other fantasy role-playing games.

Two of his collaborations with Larry Niven reached the top rankings in the New York Times Best Seller List. In 1977, &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; reached number two. &quot;Footfall&quot; — wherein Heinlein was a thinly veiled minor character — reached the number one spot in 1986.

Pournelle served as President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1973.

In 1994, Pournelle&#x27;s friendly relationship with Newt Gingrich led to Gingrich securing a government job for Pournelle&#x27;s son, Richard. At the time, Pournelle and Gingrich were reported to be collaborating on &quot;a science fiction political thriller.&quot; Pournelle&#x27;s relationship with Gingrich was long established even then, as Pournelle had written the preface to Gingrich&#x27;s book, &quot;Window of Opportunity&quot; (1985).

Years after &quot;Byte&quot; shuttered, Pournelle wrote his Chaos Manor column online. He reprised it at Byte.com, which he helped launch with journalist Gina Smith, John C. Dvorak, and others. However, after a shakeup, he announced that rather than stay at United Business Media, he would follow Smith, Dvorak, and 14 other news journalists to start an independent tech and politics site called anewdomain.net. As an active director of that site and others it launched, Pournelle wrote, edited, and worked with young writers and journalists on the craft of writing about science and tech.

==Fiction==
Beginning during his tenure at Boeing Company, Pournelle submitted science fiction short stories to John W. Campbell, the editor of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (later called &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;), but Campbell did not accept any of Pournelle&#x27;s submissions until shortly before Campbell&#x27;s death in 1971, when he accepted for publication Pournelle&#x27;s novelette &quot;Peace with Honor.&quot; From the beginning, Pournelle&#x27;s work has engaged strong military themes. Several books are centered on a fictional mercenary infantry force known as &quot;Falkenberg&#x27;s Legion&quot;. There are strong parallels between these stories and the &quot;Childe Cycle&quot; mercenary stories by Gordon R. Dickson, as well as Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, although Pournelle&#x27;s work takes far fewer technological leaps than either of these.

Pournelle was one of the few close friends of H. Beam Piper and was granted by Piper the rights to produce stories set in Piper&#x27;s Terro-Human Future History. This right has been recognized by the Piper estate. Pournelle worked for some years on a sequel to &quot;Space Viking&quot; but abandoned this in the early 1990s, however John F. Carr and Mike Robertson completed this sequel, entitled &quot;The Last Space Viking&quot;, and it was published in 2011.

In 2013, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that motion picture rights to Pournelle&#x27;s novel &quot;Janissaries&quot; had been acquired by the newly formed Goddard Film Group, headed by Gary Goddard. The IMDb website reported that the film was in development, and that husband-and-wife writing team, Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, had written the screenplay.

===Pseudonyms and collaborations===
Pournelle began fiction writing non-SF work under a pseudonym in 1965. His early SF was published under the name &quot;Wade Curtis&quot;, in &quot;Analog&quot; and other magazines. Some works were also published under the name &quot;J.E. Pournelle&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Pournelle began a fruitful collaboration with Larry Niven; he has also collaborated on novels with Roland J. Green, Michael F. Flynn, and Steven Barnes, and collaborated as an editor on an anthology series &quot;The Endless Frontier&quot; with John F. Carr.

In 2010, his daughter Jennifer R. Pournelle (writing as J.R. Pournelle), an archaeology professor, e-published a novel &quot;Outies&quot;, an authorized sequel to the &quot;Mote in God&#x27;s Eye&quot; series.

==Journalism and tech writing==
===Computing at Chaos Manor===
Pournelle began using a computer to write in 1977 on the advice of his &quot;mad&quot; friend Dan MacLean. He wrote the &quot;Computing at Chaos Manor&quot; column in &quot;Byte&quot;, describing experiences with computer hardware and software, some purchased and some sent by vendors for review, at his home office. Because Pournelle was then, according to the magazine, &quot;virtually &quot;Byte″s&quot; only writer who was a mere user—he didn&#x27;t create compilers and computers, he merely used them&quot;, it began as &quot;The User&#x27;s Column&quot; in July 1980. Subtitled &quot;Omikron TRS-80 Boards, NEWDOS+, and Sundry Other Matters&quot;, an Editor&#x27;s Note accompanied the article:

Pournelle stated that

Among recurring characters were Pournelle&#x27;s family members, friends, and many computers. He introduced to readers &quot;my friend Ezekiel, who happens to be a Cromemco Z-2 with iCom 8-inch soft-sectored floppy disk drives&quot;; he also owned a TRS-80 Model I, and the first subject discussed in the column was an add-on that permitted it to use the same data and CP/M applications as the Cromemco. The next column appeared in December 1980 with the subtitle &quot;BASIC, Computer Languages, and Computer Adventures&quot;; Ezekiel II, a Compupro S-100 CP/M system, debuted in March 1983. Other computers received nicknames, such as Zorro, Pournelle&#x27;s &quot;colorful&quot; Zenith Z-100, and Lucy Van Pelt, a &quot;fussbudget&quot; IBM PC; he referred to generic PC compatibles as &quot;PClones&quot;. Pournelle often denounced companies that announced vaporware, sarcastically writing that they would arrive &quot;&quot; (later abbreviated to just &quot;RSN&quot;), and those that used software copy protection. As part of a redesign in June 1984, the magazine renamed the popular column to &quot;Computing at Chaos Manor&quot;, and the accompanying letter column became &quot;Chaos Manor Mail&quot;.

Pournelle preferred 5 1/4-inch floppy disks to 8-inch disks as late as 1982, and still used &quot;Zeke&quot; to write as late as 1987, but admitted that he would soon have to use PCs because tools like Borland Sidekick were unavailable. He hesitated, Pournelle said, because Niven would buy two exact copies of his writing computer and software. He announced in February 1989 that the Smithsonian had asked for &quot;Zeke&quot; as part of a history of computing. A memorable column in August 1989 was &quot;The Great Power Spike&quot;, which gives a digital necropsy of his electronic equipment after high voltage transmission wires dropped onto the power line for his neighborhood.

After the print version of &quot;Byte&quot; ended publication in the United States, Pournelle continued publishing the column for the online version and international print editions of &quot;Byte&quot;. In July 2006, Pournelle and &quot;Byte&quot; declined to renew their contract and Pournelle moved the column to his own web site, Chaos Manor Reviews.

===Other technical writing===
Pournelle claimed to be the first author to have written a published book contribution using a word processor on a personal computer, in 1977.

In the 1980s, Pournelle was an editor and columnist for &quot;Survive&quot;, a survivalist magazine. He wrote the monthly column &quot;The Micro Revolution&quot; for &quot;Popular Computing&quot; from April 1984 until the magazine&#x27;s closure in December 1985. The column focused on the ways microcomputers were reshaping society.

In 2011, Pournelle joined journalist Gina Smith, pundit John C. Dvorak, political cartoonist Ted Rall, and several other Byte.com staff reporters to launch an independent tech and political news site, aNewDomain.net Pournelle served as director of aNewDomain until his death.

After 1998, Pournelle maintained a website with a daily online journal, &quot;View from Chaos Manor,&quot; a blog dating from before the use of that term. It is a collection of his &quot;Views&quot; and &quot;Mail&quot; from a large variety of readers. This is a continuation of his 1980s blog-like online journal on GEnie. He said he resists using the term &quot;blog&quot; because he considered the word ugly, and because he maintained that his &quot;View&quot; is primarily a vehicle for writing rather than a collection of links. In his book &quot;Dave Barry in Cyberspace&quot;, humorist Dave Barry has fun with Pournelle&#x27;s guru column in &quot;Byte&quot; magazine.

==Software==
Pournelle, in collaboration with his wife, Roberta (who was an expert on reading education) wrote the commercial education software program called Reading: The Learning Connection.

==Politics==
Pournelle served as campaign research director for the mayoral campaign of 1969 for Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty (Democrat), working under campaign director Henry Salvatori. The election took place on May 27, 1969. Pournelle was later named Executive Assistant to the Mayor in charge of research in September 1969, but resigned from the position after two weeks. After leaving Yorty&#x27;s office, in 1970 he was a consultant to the Professional Educators of Los Angeles (PELA), a group opposed to the unionization of school teachers in LA.

He is sometimes quoted as describing his politics as &quot;somewhere to the right of Genghis Khan.&quot; Pournelle resisted others classifying him into any particular political group, but acknowledged the approximate accuracy of the term paleoconservatism as applying to him. He distinguished his conservativism from the alternative neoconservatism, noting that he had been drummed out of the Conservative movement by &quot;the egregious Frum&quot;, referring to prominent neoconservative, David Frum. Notably, Pournelle opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War, maintaining that the money would be better spent developing energy technologies for the United States. According to a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article, &quot;Pournelle estimates that for what the Iraq war has cost so far, the United States could have paid for a network of nuclear power stations sufficient to achieve energy independence, and bankrupt the Arabs for once and for all.&quot;

===Pournelle chart===
Pournelle created the Pournelle chart in his doctoral dissertation, a 2-dimensional coordinate system used to distinguish political ideologies. It is a cartesian diagram in which the X-axis gauges opinion toward state and centralized government (farthest right being state worship, farthest left being the idea of a state as the &quot;ultimate evil&quot;), and the Y-axis measures the belief that all problems in society have rational solutions (top being complete confidence in rational planning, bottom being complete lack of confidence in rational planning).

===Strategic Defense Initiative===
In a 1997 article, Norman Spinrad wrote that Pournelle had written the SDI portion of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s State of the Union Address, as part of a plan to use SDI to get more money for space exploration using the larger defense budget. Pournelle wrote in response that while the Citizens&#x27; Advisory Council on National Space Policy &quot;wrote parts of Reagan&#x27;s 1983 SDI speech, and provided much of the background for the policy, we certainly did not write the speech… We were not trying to boost space, we were trying to win the Cold War&quot;. The Council&#x27;s first report in 1980 became the transition team policy paper on space for the incoming Reagan administration. The third report was quoted in the Reagan &quot;Star Wars&quot; speech.

===Politics in fiction===

James Wheatfield wrote that &quot;Pournelle delights in setting up complex background situations and plots, leading the reader step by step towards a solution which is the very opposite of &quot;politically correct&quot; and… defying a dissenting reader to find where in this logical chain he or she would have acted differently.&quot;

==Pournelle&#x27;s laws==
Pournelle suggested several &quot;laws&quot;. He used the term &quot;Pournelle&#x27;s law&quot; for the expression &quot;One user, one CPU&quot;. He later amended this to &quot;One user, at least one CPU&quot; in a column in &quot;InfoWorld&quot;. He also used the term &quot;Pournelle&#x27;s law&quot; for &quot;Silicon is cheaper than iron.&quot; That is, a computer is cheaper to upgrade than replace. A second aspect of this law was Pournelle&#x27;s prediction that hard disk drives would eventually be replaced by solid-state memory, although he admitted that bubble memory had failed to do so as he had expected. He has also used &quot;Pournelle&#x27;s law&quot; to apply to the importance of checking cable connections when diagnosing computer problems: &quot;You&#x27;ll find by and large, the trouble is a cable.&quot; Another Pournelle&#x27;s Law is &quot;If you don’t know what you’re doing, deal with those who do&quot;.

=== Pournelle&#x27;s iron law of bureaucracy ===
Another &quot;law&quot; of his is &quot;Pournelle&#x27;s iron law of bureaucracy&quot;:

He eventually restated it as:

This is related to the iron law of oligarchy and to the Self-licking ice cream cone. His blog, &quot;The View from Chaos Manor&quot;, often references apparent examples of the law. Some of Pournelle&#x27;s standard themes that recur in the stories are: welfare states become self-perpetuating, building a technological society requires a strong defense and the rule of law, and &quot;those who forget history are condemned to repeat it&quot;.

==Awards==
Pournelle never won a Hugo Award. He said, &quot;Money will get you through times of no Hugos better than Hugos will get you through times of no money.&quot; The Mote in God&#x27;s Eye and Inferno were both nominated for a Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1975.

<text>Barlaam and Josaphat, also known as Bilawhar and Budhasaf, are Christian saints. Their story tells of the conversion of Josaphat to Christianity. According to tradition, an Indian king persecuted the Christian Church in his realm. After astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, the king imprisoned the young prince Josaphat, who nevertheless met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. After much tribulation the young prince&#x27;s father accepted the Christian faith, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.

== History ==

The story of Barlaam and Josaphat or Joasaph is a Christianized and later version of the story of Siddhartha Gautama, who became the Buddha. The tale derives from a second to fourth century Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhist text, via a Manichaean version, then the Arabic &quot;Kitāb Bilawhar wa-Būd̠āsaf&quot; (Book of Bilawhar and Budhasaf), current in Baghdad in the eighth century, from where it entered into Middle Eastern Christian circles before appearing in European versions.

The first Christianized adaptation was the Georgian epic &quot;Balavariani&quot; dating back to the 10th century. A Georgian monk, Euthymius of Athos, translated the story into Greek, some time before he died in an accident while visiting Constantinople in 1028. There the Greek adaptation was translated into Latin in 1048 and soon became well known in Western Europe as &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot;. The Greek legend of &quot;Barlaam and Ioasaph&quot; is sometimes attributed to the 8th century John of Damascus, but F. C. Conybeare argued it was transcribed by Euthymius in the 11th century.

The story of Barlaam and Josaphat was popular in the Middle Ages, appearing in such works as the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, and a scene there involving three caskets eventually appeared, via Caxton&#x27;s English translation of a Latin version, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. The poet Chardri produced an Anglo-Norman version, &quot;La vie de seint Josaphaz&quot;, in the 13th century. The story of Josaphat and Barlaam also occupies a great part of book xv of the Speculum Historiale (Mirror of History) by the 13th century French encyclopedist Vincent of Beauvais.

One of the Marco Polo manuscripts notes the remarkable similarity between the tale of &quot;Sakyamuni Burkham&quot; (the name that Polo uses for the Buddha) and St. Josaphat, apparently unaware of the origins of the Josaphat story.

Two Middle High German versions were produced: one, the &quot;Laubacher &quot;Barlaam&quot;&quot;, by Bishop Otto II of Freising and another, &quot;Barlaam und Josaphat&quot;, a romance in verse, by Rudolf von Ems. The latter was described as &quot;perhaps the flower of religious literary creativity in the German Middle Ages&quot; by Heinrich Heine.

In the 16th century, the story of Josaphat was re-told as a defence of monastic life during the Protestant Reformation and of free will against Protestant doctrines regarding predestination.

== Legend ==
According to the legend, King Abenner in India persecuted the Christian Church in his realm, founded by the Apostle Thomas. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, Abenner had the young prince Josaphat isolated from external contact. Despite the imprisonment, Josaphat met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. Josaphat kept his faith even in the face of his father&#x27;s anger and persuasion. Eventually Abenner converted, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.

== Names ==
In this context, the name Josaphat is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;bodhisattva&quot;. The Sanskrit word was changed to &#x27; in Middle Persian texts in the 6th or 7th century, then to &#x27; or &#x27; in an 8th-century Arabic document (Arabic initial &quot;b&quot; changed to &quot;y&quot; by duplication of a dot in handwriting). This became &#x27; in Georgian in the 10th century, and that name was adapted as &quot;Ioasaph&quot; () in Greece in the 11th century, and then was assimilated to &quot;Iosaphat/Josaphat&quot; in Latin.

The name Barlaam derives from the Arabic name &quot;Bilawhar&quot; () borrowed through Georgian ( ) into Byzantine Greek ( ). The Arabic &quot;Bilawhar&quot; has historically been thought to derive from the Sanskrit &quot;bhagavan&quot;, an epithet of the Buddha, but this derivation is unproven and others have been proposed. Almuth Degener suggests derivation from Sanskrit &quot;purohita&quot; through a hypothetical Middle Persian intermediate.

The name of Josaphat&#x27;s father, King Abenner, derives from the Greek name &quot;Abenner&quot; (), although another Greek version of the legend gives this name as &quot;Avenir&quot; (). These Greek names were adapted from the Georgian &quot;Abeneser&quot; (; later shortened to , ), which was itself derived from the Arabic version of the legend where he is named King &quot;Junaysar&quot; (). According to I.V. Abuladze, during borrowing from Arabic to Georgian, misplaced &quot;i&#x27;jām&quot; resulted in the misreading of &quot;Junaysar&quot; as &quot;Habeneser&quot;, after which the initial &quot;H&quot;- was omitted. The origin of the Arabic name is unclear.

== Sainthood ==
=== Feast days ===
Barlaam and Josaphat were included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology with a joint feast day on 27 November, however, they were not included in the Roman Missal. Since 1960 a different Saint, St. Josephat, Bishop and Martyr, has a celebration on 16 November. 

Barlaam and Josaphat were entered into the Greek Orthodox liturgical calendar on 26 August &quot;Julian&quot; (8 September &quot;Gregorian&quot;), and into liturgical calendar of the Slavic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, on 19 November &quot;Julian&quot; (2 December &quot;Gregorian&quot;).

== Texts ==

There are a large number of different books in various languages, all dealing with the lives of Saints Barlaam and Josaphat in India. In this hagiographic tradition, the life and teachings of Josaphat have many parallels with those of the Buddha. &quot;But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years.&quot; This was ascertained through the researches of Edouard de Laboulaye and Felix Liebrecht in 1859-1860. The authorship of the work is disputed. The origins of the story may be a Central Asian manuscript written in the Manichaean tradition. This book was translated into Georgian and Arabic.

===Greek manuscripts===
The best-known version in Europe comes from a separate, but not wholly independent, source, written in Greek, and, although anonymous, attributed to &quot;John the monk&quot;. It was first attributed to John of Damascus in the 12th century. Although this attribution was attacked in the 19th century, George Ratcliffe Woodward and Harold Mattingly sum up the arguments in favor of John of Damascus&#x27; authorship as follows: The work&#x27;s doctrine is remarkably similar to St. John&#x27;s, to the point where &quot;in many passages the resemblance amounts almost to verbal identity&quot;; there are frequent quotations from St. John&#x27;s favorite authors, such as St. Gregory of Nazianus and St. Basil; &quot;The defence of images, coupled with the denunciation of Idolatry, the enthusiasm for the monastic ideal, and the scant regard shown for the bishops and the secular clergy, almost compel us to place the work in the time of the Iconoclastic Controversy. The position, taken up and defended, is exactly that of the Icon-venerators; and we regard this fact alone as conclusive evidence for an eighth century date.&quot;; that St. John was often known as &quot;John the Monk&quot;, so the fact that he wasn&#x27;t specifically named in the earliest manuscripts doesn&#x27;t rule him out. 

Nonetheless, many modern scholars do not accept this attribution, citing much evidence pointing to Euthymius of Athos, a Georgian who died in 1028.

The modern edition of the Greek text, from the 160 surviving variant manuscripts (2006), with introduction (German, 2009) is published as Volume 6 of the works of John the Damascene by the monks of the Abbey of Scheyern, edited by Robert Volk. It was included in the edition due to the traditional ascription, but marked &quot;spuria&quot; as the translator is the Georgian monk Euthymius the Hagiorite (ca. 955–1028) at Mount Athos and not John the Damascene of the monastery of Saint Sabas in the Judaean Desert. The 2009 introduction includes an overview.

===English manuscripts===
Among the manuscripts in English, two of the most important are the British Library MS Egerton 876 (the basis for Ikegami&#x27;s book) and &quot;MS Peterhouse 257&quot; (the basis for Hirsh&#x27;s book) at the University of Cambridge.
The book contains a tale similar to The Three Caskets found in the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; and later in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;.

====Croatian====
Three Croatian versions exist, all translations from Italian. The older Shtokavian untitled version originated in the Republic of Ragusa and was transcribed to a codex from an earlier source in the 17th century, while the younger Chakavian translations, one manuscript and one printed, originated in the beginning of the 18th century. The book was published by Petar Maçukat in Venice in 1708 and titled Xivot S[veto]ga Giosafata obrachien od Barlaama and is currently held in the National and University Library in Zagreb. Both manuscripts were published in 1913 by Czech slavist Josef Karásek and Croatian philologist Franjo Fancev and reprinted in 1996. The Chakavian translations had a common source while the older Shtokavian one used an earlier Italian version as well as the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;.

====Old Norse====
Barlaams saga ok Jósafats is an Old Norse (specifically Old Norwegian) rendering of the story of &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat&quot;. This Old Norwegian version is based on a Latin translation from the 12th century; the saga of Guðmundur Arason records that it was translated by King Haakon III Sverresson (died 1204). There are several other Old Norse versions of the same story, translated independently from different sources. There are two Old Swedish versions, the older of which draws on the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, while the younger uses the &quot;Speculum historiale&quot; as its main source. The early sixteenth-century Icelandic legendary Reykjahólarbók includes a version translated from Low German.

<doc id="16362" wikidata="Q388820" url="?curid=16362" title="Jaggies">
<text>Jaggies are artifacts in raster images, most frequently from aliasing, which in turn is often caused by non-linear mixing effects producing high-frequency components, or missing or poor anti-aliasing filtering prior to sampling.

Jaggies are stair-like lines that appear where there should be &quot;smooth&quot; straight lines or curves. For example, when a nominally straight, un-aliased line steps across one pixel either horizontally or vertically, a &quot;dogleg&quot; occurs halfway through the line, where it crosses the threshold from one pixel to the other.

Jaggies should not be confused with most compression artifacts, which are a different phenomenon.

== Causes ==
Jaggies occur due to the &quot;staircase effect&quot;. This is because a line represented in raster mode is approximated by a sequence of pixels. Jaggies can occur for a variety of reasons, the most common being that the output device (display monitor or printer) does not have sufficient resolution to portray a smooth line. In addition, jaggies often occur when a bit-mapped image is scaled to a higher resolution. This is one of the advantages that vector graphics have over bitmapped graphics – a vector image can be losslessly scaled to any arbitrary resolution or stretched infinitely in either axis without introducing jaggies.

== Solutions ==
The effect of jaggies can be reduced by a graphics technique known as spatial anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing smooths out jagged lines by surrounding them with transparent pixels to simulate the appearance of fractionally-filled pixels when viewed at a distance. The downside of anti-aliasing is that it reduces contrast – rather than sharp black/white transitions, there are shades of gray – and the resulting image can appear fuzzy. This is an inescapable trade-off: if the resolution is insufficient to display the desired detail, the output will either be jagged, fuzzy, or some combination thereof. While machine learning-based upscaling techniques such as DLSS can be used to infer this missing information, other types of artifacts may be introduced in the process.

In real-time 3D rendering such as in video games, various anti-aliasing techiques are used to remove jaggies created by the edges of polygons and other contrasting lines. Since anti-aliasing can impose a significant performance overhead, games for home computers often allow users to choose the level and type of anti-aliasing in use in order to optimize their experience, whereas on consoles this setting is typically fixed for each title to ensure a consistent experience. While anti-aliasing is generally implemented through graphics APIs like DirectX and Vulkan, some consoles such as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are also capable of anti-aliasing to little direct performance cost by way of dedicated hardware which performs anti-aliasing on the contents of the framebuffer once it has been rendered by the GPU. Jaggies in bitmaps, such as sprites and surface materials, are most often dealt with by separate texture filtering routines, which are far easier to perform than anti-aliasing filtering. Texture filtering became ubiquitous on PCs after the introduction of 3Dfx&#x27;s Voodoo GPU.

== Notable uses of the term ==
In the 1985 game &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot; for the Atari 8-bit computers, the graphics depicting the cockpit of the player&#x27;s spacecraft contains two window struts, which are not anti-aliased and are therefore very &quot;jagged&quot;. The developers made fun of this and named the in-game enemies &quot;Jaggi&quot;, and also initially titled the game &quot;Behind Jaggi Lines!&quot;. The latter idea was scrapped by the marketing department before release.

<doc id="16364" wikidata="Q125402" url="?curid=16364" title="Judicial economy">
<text>Judicial economy or procedural economy is the principle that the limited resources of the legal system or a given court should be conserved by the refusal to decide one or more claims raised in a case. For example, the plaintiff may claim that the defendant&#x27;s actions violated three distinct laws. Having found for the plaintiff for a violation of the first law, the court then has the discretion to exercise judicial economy and refuse to make a decision on the remaining two claims, on the grounds that the finding of one violation should be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff.

==Threshold issue in a given case ==
In the presence of a threshold issue that will ultimately decide a case, a court may, depending on the degree of prejudice to the litigants rights, elect to hear that issue rather than proceeding with a full-blown trial.

==Class action lawsuits ==
Class action lawsuits are another example of judicial economy in action, as they are often tried as a single case, yet involve many cases with similar facts. Rather than trying each case individually, which would unduly burden the judicial system, the cases can be consolidated into a class action.

<doc id="16365" wikidata="Q6502501" url="?curid=16365" title="Jury instructions">
<text>Jury instructions, also known as charges or directions, are a set of legal guidelines given by a judge to a jury in a court of law. They are an important procedural step in a trial by jury, and as such are a cornerstone of criminal process in many common law countries.

The purpose of instructions are to inform the jury about the legal principles and standards that they must apply in order to reach a verdict. This ensures that criminal trials are fair and lawful. They are typically delivered after closing arguments, but sometimes may be delivered mid-trial if necessary.

In some cases, the instructions given by a judge to the jury are incorrect, which may (depending on the issue) result in a mistrial.

== Content of jury instructions ==
Jury instructions often cover the following issues: 

=== Use of templates ===
Jury instructions are typically drafted using standardized language and templates, which are formulated from various sources such as jury instruction manuals, legal treatises, and case law. However, judges often modify these standard instructions to fit the unique circumstances and legal issues present in each case. Attorneys from both sides may also request specific instructions or modifications and may object to proposed instructions, but the final decision on the content and wording of the instructions lies with the judge.

== Issues ==

=== Role in appeals ===
Jury instructions play a significant role in the appellate process; errors or omissions in the instructions can provide grounds for an appeal. Appellate courts may review instructions given to the jury to determine if they were made in a legally permissible manner. If the appellate court finds an error in the instructions process, it may, if sufficiently problematic, reverse a decision or order a new trial.

=== Comprehending jury instructions ===

A significant issue with standard jury instructions is the language comprehension difficulties for the average juror. The purpose of jury instructions is to inform jurors of relevant laws and their application in the process of coming to a verdict. However, studies have shown that juries consistently run into problems understanding the instructions given to them. Poor comprehension is noted across juror demographics, as well as across legal contexts. Various linguistic features of legalese or legal English, such as complex sentence structures and technical jargon, have been pinpointed as major factors contributing to low comprehension.

Simplifying jury instructions through the use of plain English has been shown to markedly increase juror comprehension. In one study of California’s jury instructions in cases involving the death penalty, approximately 200 university students participated in a research experiment. Half of the participants heard the original standard instructions written in legal English, and half heard revised instructions in plain English. Instructions were read twice to each group, and the participants then answered questions for researchers to gauge their understanding. The results showed a notable disparity in comprehension between the two groups. The group that received revised instructions demonstrated stronger understanding of relevant points such as key concepts, and the ability to differentiate between legal terms.

In another California study, jury instructions were again simplified to make them easier for jurors to understand. The courts moved cautiously because, although verdicts are rarely overturned due to jury instructions in civil court, this is not the case in criminal court. For example, the old instructions on burden of proof in civil cases read:

The new instructions read:

Resistance to the movement towards the revision of standard jury instructions exists as well. This is due to the concern that moving away from legal English will result in jury instructions becoming imprecise. There is also the belief that jurors prefer judges to speak in legal language so that they come across as educated and respectable.

=== Jury nullification instructions ===
There is also debate, particularly active in the US, over whether juries that are to judge a criminal case should be informed of the possibility of jury nullification during jury instructions. One argument states that if juries have the power of jury nullification, then they should be informed of it and that neglecting to do so is an act of intervention. Another argument states that defendants should be judged according to the law, and that jury nullification interferes with this process. It is also debated that instructions permitting jury nullification is to be criticized as promoting chaos, as it brings the decision between having a structured set of rules and having less of said rules for a more free set of choices that could also promote the likes of anarchy and tyranny.

Studies have indicated that being informed of jury nullification is likely to affect the judgement of juries when they decide on verdicts. One study that looked into 144 juries showed that they were less harsh on sympathetic defendants and harsher on unsympathetic defendants when they had been briefed on jury nullification. Another study that looked into 45 juries showed that they were likelier to reach a guilty verdict in drunk driving cases and less likely in euthanasia cases, with no reported difference in likelihood in murder cases, with the inclusion of explicit jury nullification details in jury instructions.

== Specific jurisdictional issues ==

===United States===
Under the American judicial system, juries are often the trier of fact when they serve in a trial. In other words, it is their job to sort through disputed accounts presented in evidence. The judge decides questions of law, meaning he or she decides how the law applies to a given set of facts. Jury instructions are given to the jury by the judge, who usually reads them aloud to the jury. The judge issues a judge&#x27;s charge to inform the jury how to act in deciding a case. The jury instructions provide something of a flowchart on what verdict jurors should deliver based on what they determine to be true. Put another way, &quot;If you believe A (set of facts), you must find X (verdict). If you believe B (set of facts), you must find Y (verdict).&quot; Jury instructions can also serve an important role in guiding the jury how to consider certain evidence.

All 50 states have a model set of instructions, usually called &quot;pattern jury instructions&quot;, which provide the framework for the charge to the jury; sometimes, only names and circumstances have to be filled in for a particular case. Often they are much more complex, although certain elements frequently recur. For instance, if a criminal defendant chooses not to testify, the jury will often be instructed not to draw any negative conclusions from that decision. Many jurisdictions are now instructing jurors not to communicate about the case through social networking services like Facebook and Twitter.

=== United Kingdom ===
The judge presents directions to the jury court, after overlapping instructions have been provided by a DVD and a jury manager.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, as in other common law jurisdictions, jury instructions serve as essential guidelines for jurors in both criminal and civil trials, although trial by jury for civil matters is now rare. Each state and territory has its own legislation and rules governing jury instructions; although commonalities exist across the jurisdictions. These commonalities are due to harmonious legislation, and a nationally unified common law.

To promote consistency and clarity in jury instructions, Australian jurisdictions have developed standard jury directions or &quot;Bench Books&quot; that provide judges with templates and guidance on instructing jurors. The Bench Books are regularly updated to reflect changes in legislation and case law. Examples include the Victorian Criminal Charge Book, the New South Wales Criminal Trial Bench Book, and the Queensland Supreme and District Courts Benchbook.

<doc id="16366" wikidata="Q4932206" url="?curid=16366" title="Jurisprudence">
<text>Jurisprudence, also known as theory of law or philosophy of law, is the examination in a general perspective of what law is and what it ought to be. It investigates issues such as the definition of law; legal validity; legal norms and values; and the relationship between law and other fields of study, including economics, ethics, history, sociology, and political philosophy.

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems and problems of law as a social institution that relates to the larger political and social context in which it exists. Jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered:

* Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers, the foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force.
* Analytic jurisprudence rejects natural law&#x27;s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be, espousing the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems. It encompasses theories such as legal positivism and legal realism. 
* Normative jurisprudence is concerned with evaluative theories of law, dealing with what the goal or purpose of law is and what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. It attempts to determine what the proper function of law should be, what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.
* Sociological jurisprudence studies the nature and functions of law in the light of social scientific knowledge. It emphasises variation of legal phenomena between different cultures and societies. It relies especially on empirically-oriented social theory, but draws theoretical resources from diverse disciplines.
* Experimental jurisprudence seeks to investigate the content of legal concepts using the methods of social science, unlike the philosophical methods of traditional jurisprudence.
The terms &quot;philosophy of law&quot; and &quot;jurisprudence&quot; are often used interchangeably, though jurisprudence sometimes encompasses forms of reasoning that fit into economics or sociology.

== Overview ==
Whereas lawyers are interested in what the law is on a specific issue in a specific jurisdiction, analytical philosophers of law are interested in identifying the features of law shared across cultures, times, and places. Taken together, these foundational features of law offer the kind of universal definition philosophers are after. The general approach allows philosophers to ask questions about, for example, what separates law from morality, politics, or practical reason. While the field has traditionally focused on giving an account of law&#x27;s nature, some scholars have begun to examine the nature of domains within law, e.g. tort law, contract law, or criminal law. These scholars focus on what makes certain domains of law distinctive and how one domain differs from another. A particularly fecund area of research has been the distinction between tort law and criminal law, which more generally bears on the difference between civil and criminal law.

In addition to analytic jurisprudence, legal philosophy is also concerned with normative theories of law. &quot;Normative jurisprudence involves normative, evaluative, and otherwise prescriptive questions about the law.&quot;

==Etymology and terminology==
The English word is derived from the Latin, . is the genitive form of meaning law, and meaning prudence (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection). It refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters. The word first appeared in written English in 1628, at a time when the word &quot;prudence&quot; meant knowledge of, or skill in, a matter. It may have entered English via the French , which appeared earlier.

== History ==

Ancient jurisprudence begins with various Dharmaśāstra texts of India. Dharmasutras of Āpastaṃba and Baudhāyana are examples.

In Ancient China, the Daoists, Confucians, and Legalists all had competing theories of jurisprudence.

Jurisprudence in ancient Rome had its origins with the &quot;periti&quot;—experts in the &quot;jus&quot; &quot;mos maiorum&quot; (traditional law), a body of oral laws and customs. Praetors established a working body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the &quot;edicta&quot;, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offences, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the &quot;edicta&quot;. A &quot;iudex&quot; (originally a magistrate, later a private individual appointed to judge a specific case) would then prescribe a remedy according to the facts of the case.

The sentences of the &quot;iudex&quot; were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but—apart from considering what traditional customs applied in each case—soon developed a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to newer social exigencies. The law was then adjusted with evolving &quot;institutiones&quot; (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional mode. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of &quot;prudentes&quot;. Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience. Under the Roman Empire, schools of law were created, and practice of the law became more academic. From the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant body of literature was produced by groups of scholars, including the Proculians and Sabinians. The scientific nature of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times. After the 3rd century, &quot;juris prudentia&quot; became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the Eastern Roman Empire (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that Justinian&#x27;s was born.

Modern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was based on the first principles of natural law, civil law, and the law of nations.

== Natural law ==
Natural law holds that there are rational objective limits to the power of rulers, the foundations of law are accessible through reason, and it is from these laws of nature that human laws gain force. The moral theory of natural law asserts that law is inherent in nature and constitutive of morality, at least in part, and that an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlies natural law.
On this view, while legislators can enact and even successfully enforce immoral laws, such laws are &quot;legally&quot; invalid. The view is captured by the maxim: &quot;an unjust law is no law at all&quot;, where &#x27;unjust&#x27; means &#x27;contrary to the natural law.&#x27; Natural law theory has medieval origins in the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas, especially in his &quot;Treatise on law&quot;. In late 20th century, John Finnis revived interest in the theory and provided a modern reworking of it. For one, Finnis has argued that the maxim &quot;an unjust law is no law at all&quot; is a poor guide to the classical Thomist position.

In its general sense, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of being analogous to the laws of physical science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition. Another approach to natural-law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law must be in response to compelling reasons for action. There are two readings of the natural-law jurisprudential stance.
*&quot;The strong natural law thesis&quot; holds that if a human law fails to be in response to compelling reasons, then it is not properly a &quot;law&quot; at all. This is captured, imperfectly, in the famous maxim: &quot;lex iniusta non est lex&quot; (an unjust law is no law at all).
*&quot;The weak natural law thesis&quot; holds that if a human law fails to be in response to compelling reasons, then it can still be called a &quot;law&quot;, but it must be recognised as a defective law.

===Aristotle===

Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law. Like his philosophical forefathers Socrates and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (&quot;dikaion physikon&quot;, &quot;δικαίον φυσικόν&quot;, Latin &quot;ius naturale&quot;). His association with natural law is largely due to how he was interpreted by Thomas Aquinas. This was based on Aquinas&#x27; conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (Book IV of the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;). Aquinas&#x27;s influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages, though more recent translations render them more literally.

Aristotle&#x27;s theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the golden mean. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls &quot;political justice&quot; derives from his discussion of &quot;the just&quot; as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes. His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term &quot;justice&quot; actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice. When a person&#x27;s actions toward others are completely virtuous in all matters, Aristotle calls them &quot;just&quot; in the sense of &quot;general justice&quot;; as such, this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue. &quot;Particular&quot; or &quot;partial justice&quot;, by contrast, is the part of &quot;general justice&quot; or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably.

Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention. This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves.

The best evidence of Aristotle&#x27;s having thought there was a natural law comes from the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, where Aristotle notes that, aside from the &quot;particular&quot; laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a &quot;common&quot; law that is according to nature. The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the &quot;particular&quot; law of one&#x27;s own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law. Aristotle, moreover, considered certain candidates for a universally valid, natural law to be wrong. Aristotle&#x27;s theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.

===Thomas Aquinas===

Thomas Aquinas is the foremost classical proponent of natural theology, and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the Roman Catholic Church. The work for which he is best known is the &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;. One of the thirty-five Doctors of the Church, he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church&#x27;s greatest theologian. Consequently, many institutions of learning have been named after him.

Aquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, divine, and human:

* Eternal law refers to divine reason, known only to God. It is God&#x27;s plan for the universe. Man needs this plan, for without it he would totally lack direction.
*Natural law is the &quot;participation&quot; in the eternal law by rational human creatures, and is discovered by reason
* Divine law is revealed in the scriptures and is God&#x27;s positive law for mankind
* Human law is supported by reason and enacted for the common good.

Natural law is based on &quot;first principles&quot;:

&quot;... this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this ...&quot;

The desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.

===School of Salamanca===
Francisco de Vitoria was perhaps the first to develop a theory of &quot;ius gentium&quot; (law of nations), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to international affairs, concluding that such affairs ought to be determined by forms respecting of the rights of all and that the common good of the world should take precedence before the good of any single state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text &quot;De iure belli ac pacis&quot; by Hugo Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez&#x27;s importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field. Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.

Francisco Suárez, regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of &quot;ius gentium&quot;. Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished &quot;ius inter gentes&quot; from &quot;ius intra gentes&quot;. &quot;Ius inter gentes&quot; (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, it was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, &quot;ius intra gentes&quot;, or civil law, is specific to each nation.

===Lon Fuller===
Writing after World War II, Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argued, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, the law must have a morality that goes beyond the societal rules under which laws are made.

===John Finnis===
Sophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other and may have certain points in common. Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist&#x27;s work. The natural law theorists of the distant past, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence, while modern natural law theorists, such as John Finnis, who claim to be positivists, still argue that law is moral by nature. In his book &quot;Natural Law and Natural Rights&quot; (1980, 2011), John Finnis provides a restatement of natural law doctrine.

==Analytic jurisprudence==
Unlike experimental jurisprudence, which investigates the content of legal concepts using the methods of social science, analytical jurisprudence seeks to provide a general account of the nature of law through the tools of conceptual analysis. The account is general in the sense of targeting universal features of law that hold at all times and places.

Analytic, or &quot;clarificatory&quot;, jurisprudence takes a neutral point of view and uses descriptive language when referring to various aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law&#x27;s fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. David Hume argued, in &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, that people invariably slip from describing what the world &quot;is&quot; to asserting that we therefore &quot;ought&quot; to follow a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we &quot;ought&quot; to do something merely because something &quot;is&quot; the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world &quot;is&quot; must be treated as a strictly separate question from normative and evaluative questions of what &quot;ought&quot; to be done.

The most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: &quot;What are laws?&quot;; &quot;What is &quot;the&quot; law?&quot;; &quot;What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?&quot;; and &quot;What is the relationship between law and morality?&quot; Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there is a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.

===Historical school===
Historical jurisprudence came to prominence during the debate on the proposed codification of German law. In his book &quot;On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence&quot;, Friedrich Carl von Savigny argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs, and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. Historicists believe that law originates with society.

===Sociological jurisprudence===
An effort systematically to inform jurisprudence from sociological insights developed from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany, Austria and France, the work of the &quot;free law&quot; theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, Hermann Kantorowicz, Eugen Ehrlich and François Gény) encouraged the use of sociological insights in the development of legal and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy for a &quot;sociological jurisprudence&quot; occurred in the United States, where, throughout the first half of the twentieth century, Roscoe Pound, for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy. In the United States, many later writers followed Pound&#x27;s lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, Julius Stone strongly defended and developed Pound&#x27;s ideas.

In the 1930s, a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century, sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy; but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of legal philosophy in English-speaking countries in the present century, it has attracted renewed interest. Increasingly, its contemporary focus is on providing theoretical resources for jurists to aid their understanding of new types of regulation (for example, the diverse kinds of developing transnational law) and the increasingly important interrelations of law and culture, especially in multicultural Western societies. As an approach to jurisprudence, sociological jurisprudence uses the resources of social science to serve value-oriented juristic purposes. As such, it should be distinguished from sociology of law which as a field of social science has no necessary commitment to juristic aims.

===Legal positivism===
Legal positivism is the view that the content of law is dependent on social facts and that a legal system&#x27;s existence is not constrained by morality. Within legal positivism, theorists agree that law&#x27;s content is a product of social facts, but theorists disagree whether law&#x27;s validity can be explained by incorporating moral values. Legal positivists who argue against the incorporation of moral values to explain law&#x27;s validity are labeled exclusive (or hard) legal positivists. Joseph Raz&#x27;s legal positivism is an example of exclusive legal positivism. Legal positivists who argue that law&#x27;s validity can be explained by incorporating moral values are labeled inclusive (or soft) legal positivists. The legal positivist theories of H. L. A. Hart and Jules Coleman are examples of inclusive legal positivism.

Legal positivism has traditionally been associated with three doctrines: the pedigree thesis, the separability thesis, and the discretion thesis. The pedigree thesis says that the right way to determine whether a directive is law is to look at the directive&#x27;s source. The thesis claims that it is the fact that the directive was issued by the proper official within a legitimate government, for example, that determines the directive&#x27;s legal validity—not the directive&#x27;s moral or practical merits. The separability thesis states that law is conceptually distinct from morality. While law might contain morality, the separability thesis states that &quot;it is in no sense a necessary truth that laws reproduce or satisfy certain demands of morality, though in fact they have often done so.&quot; Legal positivists disagree about the extent of the separability thesis. Exclusive legal positivists, notably Joseph Raz, go further than the standard thesis and deny that it is possible for morality to be a part of law at all. The discretion thesis states that judges create new law when they are given discretion to adjudicate cases where existing law underdetermines the result.

====Thomas Hobbes====
Hobbes was a social contractarian and believed that the law had peoples&#x27; tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a state of nature to protect people from the state of war that would exist otherwise. In &quot;Leviathan&quot;, Hobbes argues that without an ordered society life would be &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.&quot; It is commonly said that Hobbes&#x27;s views on human nature were influenced by his times. The English Civil War and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place; and, in reacting to that, Hobbes felt that absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.

====Bentham and Austin====

John Austin and Jeremy Bentham were early legal positivists who sought to provide a descriptive account of law that describes the law as it is. Austin explained the descriptive focus for legal positivism by saying, &quot;The existence of law is one thing; its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not conformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry.&quot; For Austin and Bentham, a society is governed by a sovereign who has de facto authority. Through the sovereign&#x27;s authority come laws, which for Austin and Bentham are commands backed by sanctions for non-compliance. Along with Hume, Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept, and was an avid prison reformer, advocate for democracy, and firm atheist. Bentham&#x27;s views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student John Austin. Austin was the first chair of law at the new University of London, from 1829. Austin&#x27;s utilitarian answer to &quot;what is law?&quot; was that law is &quot;commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience&quot;. H. L. A. Hart criticized Austin and Bentham&#x27;s early legal positivism because the command theory failed to account for individual&#x27;s compliance with the law.

====Hans Kelsen====
Hans Kelsen is considered one of the preeminent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common law countries. His Pure Theory of Law describes law as &quot;binding norms&quot;, while at the same time refusing to evaluate those norms. That is, &quot;legal science&quot; is to be separated from &quot;legal politics&quot;. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a  ()—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which all &quot;lower&quot; norms in the hierarchy of a legal system, beginning with constitutional law, are understood to derive their authority or the extent to which they are binding. Kelsen contends that the extent to which legal norms are binding, their specifically &quot;legal&quot; character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.

====H. L. A. Hart====
In the English-speaking world, the most influential legal positivist of the twentieth century was H. L. A. Hart, professor of jurisprudence at Oxford University. Hart argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. In &quot;The Concept of Law&quot;, Hart rejected Kelsen&#x27;s views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, cannot be grounded in non-normative social facts.

Hart claimed that law is the union of primary rules and secondary rules. Primary rules require individuals to act or not act in certain ways and create duties for the governed to obey.
Secondary rules are rules that confer authority to create new primary rules or modify existing ones. Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (how to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (how laws are amended), and the rule of recognition (how laws are identified as valid). The validity of a legal system comes from the &quot;rule of recognition&quot;, which is a customary practice of officials (especially barristers and judges) who identify certain acts and decisions as sources of law. In 1981, Neil MacCormick wrote a pivotal book on Hart (second edition published in 2008), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his &quot;Institutions of Law&quot;, 2007). Other important critiques include those of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and Joseph Raz.

In recent years, debates on the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called &quot;exclusive legal positivism&quot; and is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled &quot;inclusive legal positivism&quot;, a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and is associated with the view that moral considerations , but do not necessarily, determine the legal validity of a norm.

====Joseph Raz====
Joseph Raz&#x27;s theory of legal positivism argues against the incorporation of moral values to explain law&#x27;s validity. In Raz&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;The Authority of Law&quot;, he criticised what he called the &quot;weak social thesis&quot; to explain law. He formulates the weak social thesis as &quot;(a) Sometimes the identification of some laws turn on moral arguments, but also with, (b) In all legal systems the identification of some law turns on moral argument.&quot; Raz argues that law&#x27;s authority is identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. This view he calls &quot;the sources thesis&quot;. Raz suggests that any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence. Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that held that there was &quot;no necessary connection&quot; between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists—including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green—reject that view. Raz claims it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).

===Legal realism===

Legal realism is the view that a theory of law should be descriptive and account for the reasons why judges decide cases as they do. Legal realism had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by humans and thus should account for reasons besides legal rules that led to a legal decision.

There are two separate schools of legal realism: American legal realism and Scandinavian legal realism. American legal realism grew out of the writings of Oliver Wendell Holmes. At the start of Holmes&#x27;s &quot;The Common Law&quot;, he claims that &quot;[t]he life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience&quot;. This view was a reaction to legal formalism that was popular the time due to the Christopher Columbus Langdell. Holmes&#x27;s writings on jurisprudence also laid the foundations for the predictive theory of law. In his article &quot;The Path of the Law&quot;, Holmes argues that &quot;the object of [legal] study...is prediction, the prediction of the incidence of the public force through the instrumentality of the courts.&quot;

For the American legal realists of the early twentieth century, legal realism sought to describe the way judges decide cases. For legal realists such as Jerome Frank, judges start with the facts before them and then move to legal principles. Before legal realism, theories of jurisprudence turned this method around where judges were thought to begin with legal principles and then look to facts.

It has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include Roscoe Pound, Karl Llewellyn, and Justice Benjamin Cardozo). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices.

The Scandinavian school of legal realism argued that law can be explained through the empirical methods used by social scientists. Prominent Scandinavian legal realists are Alf Ross, Axel Hägerström, and Karl Olivecrona. Scandinavian legal realists also took a naturalist approach to law.

Despite its decline in popularity, legal realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including critical legal studies, feminist legal theory, critical race theory, sociology of law, and law and economics.

===Critical legal studies===
Critical legal studies are a new theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. The theory can generally be traced to American legal realism and is considered &quot;the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective&quot;. It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group. Roberto Mangabeira Unger and other authors in the movement contrast critical legal studies as a method, critical in approach, from the impersonal purposes and principles made necessary in legal reasoning such as formalism. He writes that it was &quot;consequently also by rejecting judges as the chief addressees of legal analysis, and refusing to take the question—how should judges decide cases?—as the defining problem in jurisprudence.&quot;

===Constitutionalism===
===Legal interpretivism===
American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin&#x27;s legal theory attacks legal positivists that separate law&#x27;s content from morality. In his book &quot;Law&#x27;s Empire&quot;, Dworkin argued that law is an &quot;interpretive&quot; concept that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the best moral justification for the institutional facts and practices that form a society&#x27;s legal tradition. It follows from Dworkin&#x27;s view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some truths about the moral justifications of the social and political practices of that society. It is consistent with Dworkin&#x27;s view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best moral justification for its practices.

Interpretation, according to Dworkin&#x27;s &quot;integrity theory of law&quot;, has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of &quot;fit&quot;. Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that portrays the practices of the community in their best light, or makes them &quot;the best that they can be&quot;. But many writers have doubted whether there a single best moral justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there is, it should be counted as part of the law of that community.

===Therapeutic jurisprudence===
Consequences of the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or of the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. Therapeutic jurisprudence (&quot;TJ&quot;) studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses social science methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it impacts.

==Normative jurisprudence==
In addition to the question, &quot;What is law?&quot;, legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or &quot;evaluative&quot; theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to punishment, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are discussed below.

===Virtue jurisprudence===

Aretaic moral theories, such as contemporary virtue ethics, emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous character in citizens. Historically, this approach has been mainly associated with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.

===Deontology===
Deontology is the &quot;theory of duty or moral obligation&quot;. The philosopher Immanuel Kant formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.

===Utilitarianism===


Utilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law has been associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham&#x27;s and was the torch bearer for utilitarian philosophy throughout the late nineteenth century. In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.

===John Rawls===
John Rawls was an American philosopher; a professor of political philosophy at Harvard University; and author of &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971), &quot;Political Liberalism&quot;, &quot;Justice as Fairness: A Restatement&quot;, and &quot;The Law of Peoples&quot;. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a method called &quot;original position&quot; to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;. Imagine we do not know who we are—our race, sex, wealth, status, class, or any distinguishing feature—so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argued from this &quot;original position&quot; that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote, and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls&#x27;s famous &quot;difference principle&quot;. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.

There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including constitutionalism, critical legal studies and libertarian theories of law.

<text>A jury trial, or trial by jury, is a legal proceeding in which a jury makes a decision or findings of fact. It is distinguished from a bench trial, in which a judge or panel of judges makes all decisions.

Jury trials are increasingly used in a significant share of serious criminal cases in many common law judicial systems, but not all. Juries or lay judges have also been incorporated into the legal systems of many civil law countries for criminal cases.

The use of jury trials, which evolved within common law systems rather than civil law systems, has had a profound impact on the nature of American civil procedure and criminal procedure rules, even if a bench trial is actually contemplated in a particular case. In general, the availability of a jury trial if properly demanded has given rise to a system in which fact finding is concentrated in a single trial rather than multiple hearings, and appellate review of trial court decisions is greatly limited. Jury trials are of far less importance (or of no importance) in countries that do not have a common law system.

==History==
===Greece===
Ancient Athens had a mechanism, called &quot;dikastaí&quot;, to assure that no one could select jurors for their own trial. For normal cases, the courts were made up of &quot;dikastai&quot; of up to 500 citizens. For capital cases—those that involved death, loss of liberty, exile, loss of civil rights, or seizure of property—the trial was before a jury of 1,001 to 1,501 &quot;dikastai&quot;. In such large juries, they rule by majority. Juries were appointed by lot. Jurists cast a ceramic disk with an axle in its middle: the axle was either hollow or solid. Thus the way they voted was kept secret because the jurists would hold their disk by the axle by thumb and forefinger, thus hiding whether its axle was hollow or solid. Since Periclean times, jurists were compensated for their sitting in court, with the amount of one day&#x27;s wages.

The institution of trial by jury was ritually depicted by Aeschylus in &quot;The Eumenides&quot;, the third and final play of his &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy. In the play, the innovation is brought about by the goddess Athena, who summons twelve citizens to sit as jury. The god Apollo takes part in the trial as the advocate for the defendant Orestes and the Furies as prosecutors for the slain Clytemnestra. In the event the jury is split six to six, Athena dictates that the verdict should henceforth be for acquittal.

===Roman Republic and Empire===
From the beginning of the republic and in the majority of civil cases towards the end of the empire, there were tribunals with the characteristics of the jury in the sense that Roman judges were civilian, lay and not professionals. Capital trials were held in front of hundreds or thousands of &#x27;juries&#x27; in the commitias or centuries, the same as in Athenian trials. Roman law provided for the yearly selection of judices, who would be responsible for resolving disputes by acting as jurors, with a praetor performing many of the duties of a judge. High government officials and their relatives were barred from acting as judices, due to conflicts of interest. Those previously found guilty of serious crimes (felonies) were also barred as were gladiators for hire, who likely were hired to resolve disputes through trial by combat. The law was as follows:

===Islamic law===
In classical Islamic jurisprudence, litigants in court may obtain notarized statements from between three and twelve witnesses. When the statements of all witnesses are consistent, the notaries will certify their unanimous testimony in a legal document, which may be used to support the litigant&#x27;s claim. The notaries serve to free the judge from the time-consuming task of hearing the testimony of each eyewitness himself, and their documents serve to legally authenticate each oral testimony. The Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence requires two notaries to collect a minimum of twelve eyewitness statements in certain legal cases, including those involving unregistered marriages and land disputes. John Makdisi has compared this to English Common Law jury trials under King Henry II, surmising a link between the king’s reforms and the legal system of the Kingdom of Sicily.

=== Holy Roman Empire and modern Germany ===
A Swabian ordinance of 1562 called for the summons of jurymen (&#x27;), and various methods were in use in Emmendingen, Oppenau, and Oberkirch. Hauenstein&#x27;s charter of 1442 secured the right to be tried in all cases by 24 fellow equals, and in Freiburg the jury was composed of 30 citizens and councilors. The modern jury trial was first introduced in the Rhenish provinces in 1798, with a court consisting most commonly of 12 citizens (&#x27;).

The system whereby citizens were tried by their peers chosen from the entire community in open court was gradually superseded by a system of professional judges in Germany, in which the process of investigation was more or less confidential and judgements were issued by judges appointed by the state. In Constance the jury trial was suppressed by decree of the Habsburg monarchy in 1786. The Frankfurt Constitution of the failed Revolutions of 1848 called for jury trials for &quot;the more serious crimes and all political offenses&quot;, but was never implemented after the Frankfurt Parliament was dissolved by Württemberg dragoons. An 1873 draft on criminal procedure produced by the Prussian Ministry of Justice proposed to abolish the jury and replace it with the mixed system, causing a significant political debate. In the Weimar Republic the jury was abolished by the Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924.

Between 1948 and 1950 in American-occupied Germany and the Federal Republic of Germany, Bavaria returned to the jury trial as it had existed before the 1933 emergency decrees, but they were again abolished by the 1950 Unification Act (&quot;&quot;) for the Federal Republic. In 1979, the United States tried the East German LOT Flight 165 hijacking suspects in the United States Court for Berlin in West Berlin, which declared the defendants had the right to a jury trial under the United States Constitution, and hence were tried by a West German jury.

===England and Wales===

According to George Macaulay Trevelyan in &quot;A Shortened History of England&quot;, during the Viking occupation:

The English king Æthelred the Unready set up an early legal system through the Wantage Code of Ethelred, one provision of which stated that the twelve leading thegns (minor nobles) of each wapentake (a small district) were required to swear that they would investigate crimes without a bias. These juries differed from the modern sort by being self-informing; instead of getting information through a trial, the jurors were required to investigate the case themselves.

In the 12th century, Henry II took a major step in developing the jury system. Henry II set up a system to resolve land disputes using juries. A jury of twelve free men were assigned to arbitrate in these disputes. As with the Saxon system, these men were charged with uncovering the facts of the case on their own rather than listening to arguments in court. Henry II also introduced what is now known as the &quot;grand jury&quot; through his Assize of Clarendon. Under the assize, a jury of free men was charged with reporting any crimes that they knew of in their hundred to a &quot;justice in eyre&quot;, a judge who moved between hundreds on a circuit. A criminal accused by this jury was given a trial by ordeal.

The Church banned participation of clergy in trial by ordeal in 1215. Without the legitimacy of religion, trial by ordeal collapsed. The juries under the assizes began deciding guilt as well as providing accusations. The same year, trial by jury became an explicit right in one of the most influential clauses of Magna Carta. Article 39 of Magna Carta read:

It is translated thus by Lysander Spooner in his &quot;Essay on the Trial by Jury&quot;:

Although it says &quot;and or by the law of the land&quot;, this in no manner can be interpreted as if it were enough to have a positive law, made by the king, to be able to proceed legally against a citizen. The law of the land was the consuetudinary law, based on the customs and consent of John&#x27;s subjects, and since they did not have Parliament in those times, this meant that neither the king nor the barons could make a law without the consent of the people.

According to some sources, in the time of Edward III, &quot;by the law of the land&quot; had been substituted &quot;by due process of law&quot;, which in those times was a trial by twelve peers.

In 1215, Magna Carta further secured defendants the right to a judgement of &quot;reputable men of the neighbourhood&quot;/&quot;their equals&quot; by stating that

During the mid-14th century, persons who had sat on the presenting jury (i.e., in modern parlance, the grand jury) were forbidden to sit on the trial jury for that crime. (25 Edw. 3. Stat 5. c. 3) (1353). Medieval juries were self-informing, in that individuals were chosen as jurors because they either knew the parties and the facts, or they had the duty to discover them. This spared the government the cost of fact-finding. Over time, English juries became less self-informing and relied more on the trial itself for information on the case. Jurors remained free to investigate cases on their own until the 17th century. Magna Carta being forgotten after a succession of benevolent reigns (or, more probably, reigns limited by the jury and the barons, and only under the rule of laws that the juries and barons found acceptable), the kings, through the royal judges, began to extend their control over the jury and the kingdom. In David Hume&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot;, he tells something of the powers that the kings had accumulated in the times after Magna Carta, the prerogatives of the crown and the sources of great power with which these monarchs counted:

The first paragraph of the act that abolished the Star Chamber repeats the clause on the right of a citizen to be judged by his peers:

In 1670 two Quakers charged with unlawful assembly, William Penn and William Mead, were found not guilty by a jury. The judge then fined the jury for contempt of court for returning a verdict contrary to their own findings of fact and removed them to prison until the fine was paid. Edward Bushel, a member of the jury, nonetheless refused to pay the fine. Bushel petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. The ruling in the &quot;Bushel&#x27;s Case&quot; was that a jury could not be punished simply on account of the verdict it returned.

Many British colonies, including the United States, adopted the English common law system in which trial by jury is an important part. Jury trials in criminal cases were a protected right in the original United States Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendments of the U.S. Constitution extend the right to a jury trial for both criminal and civil matters and a grand jury for serious cases.

==Role==

In most common law jurisdictions, the jury is responsible for finding the facts of the case, while the judge determines the law. These &quot;peers of the accused&quot; are responsible for listening to a dispute, evaluating the evidence presented, deciding on the facts, and making a decision in accordance with the rules of law and their jury instructions. Typically, the jury only judges a verdict of guilty or not guilty, but the actual penalty is set by the judge.

===Various verdicts===
====Russia====
Following the judicial reform of Alexander II in Russia, unlike in modern jury trials, jurors decided not only whether the defendant was guilty or not guilty, but they had a third choice: &quot;Guilty, but not to be punished&quot;, since Alexander II believed that justice without morality was wrong.

====France====
In France and some countries organized in the same fashion, the jury and several professional judges sit together to determine guilt first. Then, if guilt is determined, they decide the appropriate penalty.

===Bench trials===
Some jurisdictions with jury trials allow the defendant to waive their right to a jury trial, thus leading to a bench trial. Jury trials tend to occur only when a crime is considered serious. In some jurisdictions, such as France and Brazil, jury trials are reserved, and compulsory, for the most severe crimes and are not available for civil cases. In Brazil, trials by jury are applied in cases of voluntary crimes against life, such as first and second degree murder, forced abortion and instigation of suicide, even if only attempted. 
In others, jury trials are only available for criminal cases and very specific civil cases (malicious prosecution, civil fraud and false imprisonment).

In the United States, jury trials are available in both civil and criminal cases. In Canada, an individual charged with an indictable offence may elect to be tried by a judge alone in a provincial court, by judge alone in a superior court, or by judge and jury in a superior court; summary offences cannot be tried by jury. In England and Wales, offences are classified as summary, indictable, or either way; jury trials are not available for summary offences (using instead a summary proceeding with a panel of three lay magistrates or a district judge sitting alone), unless they are tried alongside indictable or either way offences that are themselves tried by jury, but the defendant has a right to demand a jury trial for either way offences. The situation is similar in Scotland; whereas in Northern Ireland even summary offences carry a right to jury trial, with some exceptions.

In the United States, because jury trials tend to be high profile, the general public tends to overestimate the frequency of jury trials. Approximately 150,000 jury trials are conducted in state courts annually, and an additional 5,000 jury trials are conducted in federal courts. Two-thirds of jury trials are criminal trials, while one-third are civil and &quot;other&quot; (e.g., family, municipal ordinance, traffic). Nevertheless, the vast majority of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain, which bypasses the jury trial.

Some commentators contend that the guilty-plea system (and the high costs incurred in trials) unfairly coerces defendants into relinquishing their right to a jury trial.

Others contend that there never was a golden age of jury trials, but rather that juries in the early nineteenth century (before the rise of plea bargaining) were &quot;unwitting and reflexive, generally wasteful of public resources and, because of the absence of trained professionals, little more than slow guilty pleas themselves&quot;, and that the guilty-plea system that emerged in the latter half of the nineteenth century was a superior, more cost-effective method of achieving fair outcomes.

==Discussion==

Robert Burns argues that the jury trial provides the discipline and rigor needed to limit raw discretion of judges and other bureaucrats. In particular, he praises the adversarial nature of the American system as a more effective way to uncover truths than the judge-led process in Europe. He further argues that being face-to-face in open court can help to bring humanity into the courtroom, by reminding decision-makers that everyone involved are humans with souls.

==In various countries==

Overall, jury use has been increasing worldwide.

===Argentina===
Argentina is one of the first countries in Latin America that has implemented trial by jury. Although it has a civil law process, since November 2015, it has a jury system for serious criminal cases.

===Australia===
Section 80 of the Australian Constitution provides that: &quot;The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.

The first trials by civilian juries of 12 in the colony of New South Wales were held in 1824, following a decision of the NSW Supreme Court on 14 October 1824. The New South Wales Constitution Act 1828 (7 &amp; 8 Geo. 4. c. 73) effectively terminated trial by jury for criminal matters. Jury trials for criminal matters revived with the passing of the Jury Trials Amending Act of 1833 (NSW) (2 William IV No 12).

====Challenging potential jurors====
The &quot;voir dire&quot; system of examining the jury pool before selection is not permitted in Australia as it violates the privacy of jurors. Therefore, though it exists, the right to challenge for cause during jury selection cannot be employed much. Peremptory challenges are usually based on the hunches of counsel and no reason is needed to use them. All Australian states allow for peremptory challenges in jury selection; however, the number of challenges granted to the counsels in each state are not all the same. Until 1987 New South Wales had twenty peremptory challenges for each side where the offence was murder, and eight for all other cases. In 1987 this was lowered to three peremptory challenges per side, the same amount allowed in South Australia. Eight peremptory challenges are allowed for both counsels for all offences in Queensland. Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory allow for six. Western Australia allows three peremptory challenges per side unless there is more than one accused in which case the prosecution can peremptorily challenge three times the number of accused and each accused has three peremptory challenges.

====Majority and unanimous verdicts in criminal trials====
In Australia, majority verdicts are allowed in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and Queensland, while the ACT requires unanimous verdicts.

Since 1927 South Australia has permitted majority verdicts of 11-1 (or 10-1 or 9-1 in cases where the jury has been reduced) in criminal trials if a unanimous verdict cannot be reached in four hours. These are accepted in all cases except for guilty verdicts if the defendant is on trial for murder or treason.

Victoria has accepted majority verdicts with the same conditions since 1994, though deliberations must have gone for at least six hours before a majority verdict can be made.

Western Australia accepted majority verdicts in 1957 for all trials except where the crime is murder or has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment: a 10-2 verdict is accepted.

Majority verdicts of 10-2 have been allowed in Tasmania since 1936 for all cases, except murder and treason, if a unanimous decision has not been made within two hours. Since 1943, verdicts of not guilty for murder and treason have also been included, but must be deliberated for six hours.

The Northern Territory has allowed majority verdicts of 10-2, 10-1 and 9-1 since 1963 for all charges. Deliberation must go for at least six hours before delivering a majority verdict.

The Queensland &quot;Jury Act 1995&quot; (s 59F) allows majority verdicts for all crimes except for murder and other offences that carry a life sentence, although only 11-1 or 10-1 majorities are allowed.

Majority verdicts were introduced in New South Wales in 2006. In New South Wales, a majority verdict can only be returned if the jury consists of at least 11 jurors, and the deliberation has occurred for at least eight hours or for a period that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the case. Additionally, the court must be satisfied through examination of one or more of the jurors on oath that a unanimous verdict will not be reached if further deliberation were to occur.

===Austria===
Austria, in common with a number of European civil law jurisdictions, retains elements of trial by jury in serious criminal cases.

===Belgium===
Belgium, in common with a number of European civil law jurisdictions, retains the trial by jury through the Court of Assize for serious criminal cases and for political crimes and for press delicts (except those based on racism or xenophobia), and for crimes of international law, such as genocide and crime against humanity.

===Brazil===
Brazil instated jury trial since 1822, surviving seven constitutions. It is limited to criminal law, specifically to intentional crimes against life.

===Canada===
Under Canadian law, a person has the constitutional right to a jury trial for all crimes punishable by five years of imprisonment or more. The Criminal Code also provides for the right to a jury trial for most indictable offences, including those punishable by less than five years&#x27; imprisonment, though the right is only constitutionally enshrined for those offences punishable by five years&#x27; imprisonment or more. Generally, it is the accused person who is entitled to elect whether their trial will proceed by judge alone or by judge and jury; however, for the most severe criminal offences—murder, treason, intimidating Parliament, inciting to mutiny, sedition, and piracy—trial by jury is mandatory unless the prosecution consents to trial by judge alone.

====Jury panel exhaustion====

Criminal Code Section 642(1): If a full jury and alternate jurors cannot be provided, the court may order the sheriff or other proper officer, at the request of the prosecutor, to summon without delay as many people as the court directs for the purpose of providing a full jury and alternate jurors.

Section 642(2): Jurors may be summoned under subsection (1) by word of mouth, if necessary.

Section 642(3): The names of the people who are summoned under this Section shall be added to the general panel for the purposes of the trial, and the same proceedings with respect to calling, challenging, excusing and directing them shall apply to them. 
According to the case of &quot;R v Mid-Valley Tractor Sales Limited&quot; (1995 CarswellNB 313), there are limitations on the powers granted by Section 642. These powers are conferred specifically upon the judge, and the section does not confer a further discretion to delegate that power to others, such as the sheriff&#x27;s officer, even with the consent of counsel. The Court said that to hold otherwise would nullify the rights of the accused and the prosecution to object to a person being excused inappropriately, and may also interfere with the rights of the parties to challenge for cause. The selection of an impartial jury is the basis of a fair trial.

The Supreme Court of Canada also held in &quot;Basarabas and Spek v The Queen&quot; (1982 SCR 730) that the right of an accused to be present in court during the whole of his trial includes the jury selection process.

In &quot;Tran v The Queen&quot; (1994 2 SCR 951), it was held that an accused only has to show that they were excluded from a part of the trial that affected their vital interests, they do not have to demonstrate actual prejudice, just the potential for prejudice. As well, a valid waiver of such a right must be clear, unequivocal and done with full knowledge of the rights that the procedure was enacted to protect, as well as the effect that the waiver will have on those rights.

===China===
====Hong Kong====

Hong Kong, as a former British colony has a common law legal system. Article 86 of Hong Kong&#x27;s Basic Law, which came into force on 1 July 1997 following the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China provides: &quot;The principle of trial by jury previously practised in Hong Kong shall be maintained.&quot;

Criminal trials in the High Court are by jury. The juries are generally made of seven members, who can return a verdict based on a majority of five.

There are no jury trials in the District Court, which can impose a sentence of up to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. This is despite the fact that all court rooms in the District Court have jury boxes. The lack of juries in the District Court has been severely criticized. Clive Grossman SC in a commentary in 2009 said conviction rates were &quot;approaching those of North Korea&quot;.

Many complex commercial cases are prosecuted in the District Court rather than before a jury in the High Court. In 2009, Lily Chiang, former chairwoman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, lost an application to have her case transferred from the District Court to the High Court for a jury trial. Justice Wright in the Court of First Instance held that there was no absolute right to a trial by jury and that the &quot;decision as to whether an indictable offence be tried in the Court of First Instance by a judge and jury or in the District Court by a judge alone is the prerogative of the Secretary for Justice.&quot; Chiang issued a statement at the time saying &quot;she was disappointed with the judgment because she has been deprived of a jury trial, an opportunity to be judged by her fellow citizens and the constitutional benefit protected by the Basic Law&quot;.

In civil cases in the Court of First Instance jury trials are available for defamation, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution or seduction unless the court orders otherwise. A jury can return a majority verdict in a civil case.

The government can issue a judge-only trial order under the Hong Kong national security law, in cases which contain &quot;involvement of foreign elements&quot;, &quot;personal safety of jurors and their family members&quot; or &quot;risk of perverting the course of justice if the trial is conducted with a jury&quot;.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
====Kuba Kingdom====
The Kuba Kingdom, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, developed trial by jury independently prior to the arrival of Europeans in 1884.

===France===
In France, a defendant is entitled to a jury trial only when prosecuted for a felony (&quot;crime&quot; in French). Crimes encompass all offenses that carry a penalty of at least 10 years&#x27; imprisonment (for natural persons) or a fine of €75,000 (for legal persons). The only court that tries by jury is the &quot;cour d&#x27;assises,&quot; in which three professional judges sit together with six or nine jurors (on appeal). Conviction requires a two-thirds majority (four or six votes).

===Greece===
The country that originated the concept of the jury trial retains it in an unusual form. The Constitution of Greece and Code of criminal procedure provide that felonies (Greek: Κακουργήματα) are tried by a &quot;mixed court&quot; composed of three professional judges, including the President of the Court, and four lay judges who decide the facts, and the appropriate penalty if they convict. Certain felonies, such as terrorism, are exempt, due to their nature, from the jurisdiction of the &quot;mixed courts&quot; and are tried instead by the Court of Appeals both in first and second instance.

===Hungary===

Hungary used a jury system from 1897 to 1919. Since 1949, Hungary uses the mixed court system. According to the Fundamental Law of Hungary, &quot;non-professional judges shall also participate in the administration of justice in the cases and ways specified in an Act.&quot; In these cases, the court adjudicates in a panel which is composed of 1 professional judge as chair of the panel and 2 lay judges or 2 professional judges and 3 lay judges. Lay judges are elected by city councils and can be Hungarian citizens between the age of 30 and 70 years who have not been convicted. Non-professional judges have the same rights and responsibilities as professional judges, meaning that if they vote against the professional judge(s), their vote will decide the verdict. According to procedural laws, the youngest judge votes first and the chair of the panel votes last in case they reach a verdict through a vote.

===India===

The history of jury trials in India dates back to the period of European colonization. In 1665, a petit jury in Madras composed of twelve English and Portuguese jurors acquitted a Mrs. Ascentia Dawes, who was on trial for the murder of her enslaved servant. During the period of Company rule in India, jury trials within a dual-court system territories were implemented in Indian territories under East India Company (EIC) control. In Presidency towns (such as Calcutta, Bombai and Madras), Crown Courts employed juries to judge European and Indian defendants in criminal cases. Outside of Presidency towns, Company Courts staffed by EIC officials judged both criminal and civil cases without the use of a jury.

In 1860, after the British Crown assumed control over the EIC&#x27;s possessions in India, the Indian Penal Code was adopted. A year later, the Code of Criminal Procedure was adopted in 1861. These new regulations stipulated that criminal juries were only mandatory in the High courts of Presidency towns; in all other parts of British India, they were optional and rarely utilized. In cases where the defendants were either European or American, at least half of the jury was required to be European or American men, with the justification given that juries in these cases had to be &quot;acquainted with [the defendant&#x27;s] feelings and dispositions.&quot;

During the 20th century, the jury system in British India came under criticism from both colonial officials and independence activists. The system received no mentions in the 1950 Indian Constitution and frequently went unimplemented in many Indian legal jurisdictions after independence in 1947. In 1958, the Law Commission of India recommended its abolition in the fourteenth report that the commission submitted to the Indian government. Jury trials in India were gradually abolished during the 1960s, culminating in the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, which remains in effect into the 21st century.

Parsis in India are legally permitted to use jury trials to decide divorces wherein randomly selected jurors (referred to in the Indian legal system as &quot;delegates&quot;) from the local Parsi community are used to decide the outcome of the matrimonial disputes in question during civil trials. This jury system consists of a mixture of common law juries and the Panchayati raj form of local government, and was first implemented during the period of British rule, with the colonial administration passing the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act in 1936. Post-independence, it was amended by the Indian government in 1988.

=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, a common law jurisdiction, jury trials are available for criminal cases before the Circuit Court, Central Criminal Court and defamation cases, consisting of twelve jurors.

Juries only decide questions of fact; they have no role in criminal sentencing in criminal cases or awarding damages in libel cases. It is not necessary that a jury be unanimous in its verdict. In civil cases, a verdict may be reached by a majority of nine of the twelve members. In a criminal case, a verdict need not be unanimous where there are not fewer than eleven jurors if ten of them agree on a verdict after considering the case for a reasonable time.

Juries are selected from a jury panel, which is picked at random by the county registrar from the electoral register. The principal statute regulating the selection, obligations and conduct of juries is the Juries Act 1976 as amended by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008, which scrapped the upper age limit of 70. Juries are not paid, nor do they receive travel expenses. They do receive lunch for the days that they are serving; however, for jurors in employment, their employer is required to pay them as if they were present at work.

For certain terrorist and organised crime offences the Director of Public Prosecutions may issue a certificate that the accused be tried by the Special Criminal Court composed of three judges instead of a jury, one from the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court.

===Italy===
The Corte d&#x27;Assise is composed of 2 judges and 6 laypersons chosen at random among Italian citizens 30 to 65 years old. Only serious crimes like murder can be tried by the Corte d&#x27;Assise.

=== Japan ===
On May 28, 2004, the Diet of Japan enacted a law requiring selected citizens to take part in criminal court trials of certain severe crimes to make decisions together with professional judges, both on guilt and on the sentence. These citizens are called &quot;saiban-in&quot; (裁判員 &quot;lay judge&quot;). The &quot;saiban-in&quot; system was implemented in May 2009.

=== Malaysia ===
Malaysia abolished trials by jury on 1 January 1995. The impartiality of jury trials had been brought into question for several years prior, but their abolition was expedited by the notorious Mona Fandey case in 1993. The sensational nature of the crime heightened concerns that jury verdicts could be coloured by emotions and media bias.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provides a defendant with the right to a jury trial if they are charged with a criminal offence punishable by two years&#x27; imprisonment or more. For most offences, the defendant can choose to forego a jury trial in favour of a judge-alone (bench) trial. Serious &quot;category 4&quot; offences such as murder, manslaughter and treason are always tried by jury, with some exceptions. Civil jury trials are restricted to cases involving defamation, false imprisonment or malicious prosecution.

New Zealand previously required jury verdicts to be passed unanimously, but since the passing of the Criminal Procedure Bill in 2009 the Juries Act 1981 has permitted verdicts to be passed by a majority of one less than the full jury (that is an 11–1 or a 10–1 majority) under certain circumstances.

=== Norway ===
Norway has a system where the lower courts (&quot;tingrett&quot;) is set with a judge and two lay judges, or in bigger cases two judges and three lay judges.
All of these judges convict or acquit, and set sentences. Simple majority is required in all cases, which means that the lay-judges are always in control.

In the higher court/appellate court (&quot;lagmannsrett&quot;) there is a jury (&quot;lagrette&quot;) of 10 members, which need a minimum of seven votes to be able to convict. The judges have no say in the jury deliberations, but jury instructions are given by the chief judge (&quot;lagmann&quot;) in each case to the jury before deliberations. The &quot;voir-dire&quot; is usually set with 16 prospective jurors, which the prosecution and defence may dismiss the six persons they do not desire to serve on the jury.

This court (&quot;lagmannsretten&quot;) is administered by a three-judge panel (usually one &quot;lagmann&quot; and two &quot;lagdommere&quot;), and if seven or more jury members want to convict, the sentence is set in a separate proceeding, consisting of the three judges and the jury foreman (&quot;lagrettens ordfører&quot;) and three other members of the jury chosen by ballot. This way the laymen are in control of both the conviction and sentencing, as simple majority is required in sentencing.

The three-judge panel can set aside a jury conviction or acquittal if there has been an obvious miscarriage of justice. In that event, the case is settled by three judges and four lay-judges.

In May 2015, the Norwegian Parliament asked the government to bring an end to jury trials, replacing them with a bench trial (&quot;meddomsrett&quot;) consisting of two law-trained judges and five lay judges (&quot;lekdommere&quot;). This has now been fully implemented as of March 2021.

=== Russia ===
In the judiciary of Russia, for serious crimes the accused has the option of a jury trial consisting of 12 jurors. The number of jury trials remains small, at about 600 per year, out of about 1 million trials. A juror must be at least 25 years old, legally competent, and without a criminal record. The 12 jurors are selected by the prosecution and defense from a list of 30–40 eligible candidates. The Constitution of Russia stipulates that, until the abolition of the death penalty, all defendants in a case that may result in a death sentence are entitled to a jury trial. Lawmakers are continuously chipping away at what types of criminal offenses merit a jury trial.

They are similar to common law juries, and unlike lay judges, in that they sit separately from the judges and decide questions of fact alone while the judge determines questions of law. They must return unanimous verdicts during the first 3 hours of deliberation, but may return majority verdicts after that, with 6 jurors being enough to acquit. They may also request that the judge show leniency in sentencing.

Juries have granted acquittals in 15–20% of cases, compared with less than 1% in cases decided by judges. Juries may be dismissed and skeptical juries have been dismissed on the verge of verdicts, and acquittals are frequently overturned by higher courts.

Trial by jury was first introduced in the Russian Empire as a result of the Judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864, and abolished after the October Revolution in 1917. They were reintroduced in the Russian Federation in 1993, and extended to another 69 regions in 2003. Its reintroduction was opposed by the Prosecutor General.

===Singapore===
Singapore fully abolished the jury system in 1969, though jury trials for non-capital offenses had already been abolished a decade earlier. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, a former trial lawyer, explained why he supported the policy to the BBC and in his memoirs, saying, &quot;I had no faith in a system that allowed the superstition, ignorance, biases, and prejudices of seven jurymen to determine guilt or innocence.&quot;

===South Africa===
The jury system was abolished in South Africa in 1969 by the Abolition of Juries Act, 1969. The last jury trial to be heard was in the District of Kimberley. Some judicial experts had argued that a system of whites-only juries (as was the system at that time) was inherently prejudicial to &#x27;non-white&#x27; defendants (the introduction of nonracial juries would have been a political impossibility at that time). More recently it has been argued that, apart from being a racially divided country, South African society was, and still is, characterised by significant class differences and disparities of income and wealth that could make re-introducing the jury system problematic. Arguments for and against the re-introduction of a jury system have been discussed by South African constitutional expert Professor Pierre de Vos in the article &quot;Do we need a jury system?&quot; On 28 March 2014, the Oscar Pistorius trial was adjourned due to the illness of one of the two assessors that assist the judge on questions of fact (rather than law), in place of the jury, to reach a verdict. The legal system in the UK sees no reason to block extradition on this, as witnessed in the Shrien Dewani case.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offence against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors (out of nine) must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges out of five) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may &quot;not&quot; be overruled after appeal, unlike a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict in the district court. Hence, &quot;both&quot; the layman majority and the jury must convict to sentence a culprit; however, if the deciding two-thirds jury majority approves and the district court finds the defendant &quot;not&quot; guilty, the not guilty verdict may still be appealed to the Court of Appeals where, conversely, the professional judges outvotes the layman judges. (Should a case be appealed to the Supreme Court of Sweden, only professional judges decide, and may impose a sentence or re-impose a sentence imposed by the district court but quashed by the Court of Appeals.) In such a case, the jury provides a unique lock on the ability of the professional judges, upon appeal, outvoting the layman judges. 

In Swedish civil process, the &quot;English rule&quot; applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the &quot;American rule&quot;, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012.

===Switzerland===
As of 2008, only the code of criminal procedure of the Canton of Geneva provides for genuine jury trials. Several other cantons—Vaud, Neuchâtel, Zürich and Ticino—provide for courts composed of both professional judges and laymen (&quot;Schöffengerichte&quot; / &quot;tribunaux d&#x27;échevins&quot;). Because the unified Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure (set to enter into force in 2011) does not provide for jury trials or lay judges, however, they are likely to be abolished in the near future.

===Taiwan===
The Citizen Judges Act (國民法官法) was passed by the Legislative Yuan on July 22, 2022, promulgated by the President on August 12 and was implemented on January 1, 2023. Under the act, Lay judges in Taiwan are to be randomly selected as citizen judges who would participate in trial proceedings and adjudicate cases alongside professional judges in certain felony cases. The citizen judge system is based on Japan’s saiban-in system, which also resembles a lay judge system.

===Ukraine===
The judiciary of Ukraine allows jury trials for criminal cases where the sentence can reach life imprisonment if the accused so wishes. But this seldom happens. A jury is not formed from random citizens, but only from those who have previously applied for this role who do meet certain criteria.

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom consists of three separate legal jurisdictions, but there are some features common to all of them. In particular there is seldom anything like the U.S. voir dire system; jurors are usually just accepted without question. Controversially, in England there has been some screening in sensitive security cases, but the Scottish courts have firmly set themselves against any form of jury vetting.

====England and Wales====

In England and Wales (which have the same legal system), everyone accused of an offence which carries more than six months&#x27; imprisonment has a right to trial by jury. Minor (&quot;summary&quot;) criminal cases are heard without a jury in the Magistrates&#x27; Courts. Middle-ranking (&quot;triable either way&quot;) offences may be tried by magistrates or the defendant may elect trial by jury in the Crown Court. Serious (&quot;indictable-only&quot;) offences, however, must be tried before a jury in the Crown Court. Juries sit in few civil cases, being restricted to false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and civil fraud (unless ordered otherwise by a judge). Juries also sit in coroner&#x27;s courts for more contentious inquests. All criminal juries consist of 12 jurors, those in a County Court having 8 jurors and Coroner&#x27;s Court juries having between 7 and 11 members. Jurors must be between 18 and 75 years of age, and are selected at random from the register of voters. In the past a unanimous verdict was required. This has been changed so that, if the jury fails to agree after a given period, at the discretion of the judge they may reach a verdict by a 10–2 majority. This was designed to make it more difficult for jury tampering to succeed.

In 1999 the Home Secretary Jack Straw introduced a controversial bill to limit the right to trial by jury. This became the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which sought to remove the right to trial by jury for cases involving jury tampering or complex fraud. The provision for trial without jury to circumvent jury tampering succeeded and came into force in 2007; the provision for complex fraud cases was defeated. Lord Goldsmith, the then Attorney General, then pressed forward with the Fraud (Trials Without a Jury) Bill in Parliament, which sought to abolish jury trials in major criminal fraud trials. The Bill was subject to sharp criticism from both sides of the House of Commons before passing its second Commons reading in November 2006 but was defeated in the Lords in March 2007.

The trial for the first serious offence to be tried without a jury in 350 years was allowed to go ahead in 2009. Three previous trials of the defendants had been halted because of jury tampering and the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, cited cost and the additional burden on the jurors as reasons to proceed without a jury. Previously in cases where jury tampering was a concern the jurors were sometimes closeted in a hotel for the duration of the trial. Liberty director of policy Isabella Sankey said that &quot;This is a dangerous precedent. The right to jury trial isn&#x27;t just a hallowed principle but a practice that ensures that one class of people don&#x27;t sit in judgement over another and the public have confidence in an open and representative justice system.&quot;

The trial started in 2010, with the four defendants convicted on 31 March 2010 by Mr Justice Treacy at the Old Bailey.

====Gibraltar====
Being a Common Law jurisdiction, Gibraltar retains jury trial in a similar manner to that found in England and Wales, the exception being that juries consist of nine lay people, rather than twelve.

====Scotland====

In Scots law the jury system has some similarities with England but some important differences; in particular, there are juries of 15 in criminal trials, with verdicts by simple majority.

====Northern Ireland====
In Northern Ireland, the role of the jury trial is roughly similar to England and Wales, except that jury trials have been replaced in cases of alleged terrorist offences by courts where the judge sits alone, known as &quot;Diplock courts&quot;. Diplock courts are common in Northern Ireland for crimes connected to terrorism.

Diplock courts were created in the 1970s during The Troubles, to phase out Operation Demetrius internments, and because of the argument that juries were intimidated, though this is disputed. The Diplock courts were shut in 2007, but between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2009, 13 non-jury trials were held, down from 29 in the previous year, and 300 trials per year at their peak.

===United States===
The availability of a trial by jury in U.S. jurisdictions varies. Because the United States legal system separated from that of the English one at the time of the American Revolution, the types of proceedings that use juries depends on whether such cases were tried by jury under English common law at that time rather than the methods used in English courts now. For example, at the time, English &quot;courts of law&quot; tried cases of torts or private law for monetary damages using juries, but &quot;courts of equity&quot; that tried civil cases seeking an injunction or another form of non-monetary relief did not. As a result, this practice continues in American civil laws, but in modern English law, only criminal proceedings and some inquests are likely to be heard by a jury.

A distinctive feature of jury trials in the United States is that verdicts in criminal cases must be unanimous.

The right to a trial by jury is contained in Article Three of the United States Constitution, which states in part, &quot;The Trial of all Crimes...shall be by Jury&quot;. The right was expanded with the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which states in part, &quot;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury&quot;. Due to the Fourteenth Amendment, these rights also apply to the states through incorporation. Most states&#x27; constitutions also grant the right of trial by jury in lesser criminal matters, though most have abrogated that right in offenses punishable by fine only. The Supreme Court has ruled that if imprisonment is for six months or less, trial by jury is not required, meaning a state may choose whether or not to permit trial by jury in such cases. Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, they may waive their right to have a jury, but both the government (prosecution) and court must consent to the waiver. Several states require jury trials for all crimes, &quot;petty&quot; or not.

In the cases &quot;Apprendi v. New Jersey&quot;, , and &quot;Blakely v. Washington&quot;, , the Supreme Court of the United States held that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but on any fact used to increase the defendant&#x27;s sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines. This invalidated the procedure in many states and the federal courts that allowed sentencing enhancement based on &quot;a preponderance of evidence&quot;, where enhancement could be based on the judge&#x27;s findings alone. A jury must be unanimous for either a guilty or not guilty decision. A hung jury results in the defendants release; however, charges against the defendant are not dropped and can be reinstated if the government so chooses.

Jurors in some states are selected through voter registration and drivers&#x27; license lists. A form is sent to prospective jurors to pre-qualify them by asking the recipient to answer questions about citizenship, disabilities, ability to understand the English language, and whether they have any conditions that would excuse them from being a juror. If they are deemed qualified, a summons is issued.

English common law and the United States Constitution recognize the right to a jury trial to be a fundamental civil liberty or civil right that allows the accused to choose whether to be judged by judges or a jury.

In the United States, it is understood that juries usually weigh the evidence and testimony to determine questions of fact, while judges usually rule on questions of law, although the dissenting justices in the Supreme Court case &quot;Sparf et al. v. U.S. 156 U.S. 51 (1895)&quot;, generally considered the pivotal case concerning the rights and powers of the jury, declared: &quot;It is our deep and settled conviction, confirmed by a re-examination of the authorities that the jury, upon the general issue of guilty or not guilty in a criminal case, have the right, as well as the power, to decide, according to their own judgment and consciences, all questions, whether of law or of fact, involved in that issue.&quot; Jury determination of questions of law, sometimes called jury nullification, cannot be overturned by a judge if doing so would violate legal protections against double jeopardy. Although a judge can throw out a guilty verdict if it was not supported by the evidence, a jurist has no authority to override a verdict that favors a defendant.

It was established in Bushel&#x27;s Case that a judge cannot order the jury to convict, no matter how strong the evidence is. In civil cases, a special verdict can be given, but in criminal cases a general verdict is rendered, because requiring a special verdict could apply pressure to the jury, and because of the jury&#x27;s historic function of tempering rules of law by common sense brought to bear upon the facts of a specific case. For this reason, Justice Black and Justice Douglas indicated their disapproval of special interrogatories even in civil cases.

There has been much debate about the advantages and disadvantages of the jury system, the competence or lack thereof of jurors as fact-finders, and the uniformity or capriciousness of the justice they administer. The jury has been described by one author as &quot;an exciting and gallant experiment in the conduct of serious human affairs&quot;. Because they are fact-finders, juries are sometimes expected to perform a role similar to a lie detector, especially when presented with testimony from witnesses.

A civil jury is typically made up of 6 to 12 persons. In a civil case, the role of the jury is to listen to the evidence presented at a trial, to decide whether the defendant injured the plaintiff or otherwise failed to fulfill a legal duty to the plaintiff, and to determine what the compensation or penalty should be.

A criminal jury is usually made up of 12 members, though fewer may sit on cases involving lesser offenses. Criminal juries decide whether the defendant committed the crime as charged. In several southern states, the jury sets punishment, while in most states and at the federal level, it is set by the judge.

Prior to 2020, under most states&#x27; laws, verdicts in criminal cases had to be unanimous, with the exception of Oregon and Louisiana. In Oregon, a 10–2 majority was enough to reach a verdict, except for guilty verdicts for capital crimes, which required unanimity. Louisiana also did not require unanimous juries in serious felony cases until passage of a state constitutional amendment that required unanimity for crimes committed after 2018. However, in &quot;Ramos v. Louisiana&quot;, decided in April 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that convictions for serious offenses require unanimity, overturning Oregon&#x27;s and Louisiana&#x27;s prior allowances for split decisions.

In civil cases, the law (or the agreement of the parties) may permit a non-unanimous verdict.

A jury&#x27;s deliberations are conducted in private, out of sight and hearing of the judge, litigants, witnesses, and others in the courtroom.

Not every case is eligible for a jury trial. For example, in the majority of U.S. states there is no right to a jury trial in family law actions not involving a termination of parental rights, such as divorce and custody modifications. As of 1978, eleven U.S. states allow juries in any aspect of divorce litigation, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin. Most of these limit the right to a jury to try issues regarding grounds or entitlement for divorce only. Texas provides jury trial rights most broadly, including even the right to a jury trial on questions regarding child custody. However, anyone who is charged with a criminal offense, breach of contract or federal offence has a Constitutional right to a trial by jury.

====Civil trial procedure====
The right to trial by jury in a civil case in federal court is addressed by the Seventh Amendment. Importantly, however, the Seventh Amendment does not guarantee a right to a civil jury trial in state courts (although most state constitutions guarantee such a right). The Seventh Amendment provides: &quot;In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.&quot; In Joseph Story&#x27;s 1833 treatise &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States&quot;, he wrote, &quot;[I]t is a most important and valuable amendment; and places upon the high ground of constitutional right the inestimable privilege of a trial by jury in civil cases, a privilege scarcely inferior to that in criminal cases, which is conceded by all to be essential to political and civil liberty.&quot;

The Seventh Amendment does not guarantee or create any right to a jury trial; rather, it preserves the right to jury trial in the federal courts that existed in 1791 at common law. In this context, common law means the legal environment the United States inherited from England. In England in 1791, civil actions were divided into actions at law and actions in equity. Actions at law had a right to a jury, actions in equity did not. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 2 says &quot;[t]here is one form of action—the civil action&quot;, which abolishes the legal/equity distinction. Today, in actions that would have been &quot;at law&quot; in 1791, there is a right to a jury; in actions that would have been &quot;in equity&quot; in 1791, there is no right to a jury. However, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 39(c) allows a court to use one at its discretion. To determine whether the action would have been legal or equitable in 1791, one must first look at the type of action and whether such an action was considered &quot;legal&quot; or &quot;equitable&quot; at that time. Next, the relief being sought must be examined. Monetary damages alone were purely a legal remedy, and thus entitled to a jury. Non-monetary remedies such as injunctions, rescission, and specific performance were all equitable remedies, and thus up to the judge&#x27;s discretion, not a jury. In &quot;Beacon Theaters, Inc. v. Westover&quot;, , the US Supreme Court discussed the right to a jury, holding that when both equitable and legal claims are brought, the right to a jury trial still exists for the legal claim, which would be decided by a jury before the judge ruled on the equitable claim.

There is not a United States constitutional right under the Seventh Amendment to a jury trial in state courts, but in practice, almost every state except Louisiana, which has a civil law legal tradition, permits jury trials in civil cases in state courts on substantially the same basis that they are allowed under the Seventh Amendment in federal court. The right to a jury trial in civil cases does not extend to the states, except when a state court is enforcing a federally created right, of which the right to trial by jury is a substantial part.

The court determines the right to jury based on all claims by all parties involved. If the plaintiff brings only equitable claims but the defendant asserts counterclaims of law, the court grants a jury trial. In accordance with Beacon Theaters, the jury first determines the facts, then the judge enter judgment on the equitable claims.

Following the English tradition, U.S. juries have usually been composed of 12 jurors, and the jury&#x27;s verdict has usually been required to be unanimous. However, in many jurisdictions, the number of jurors is often reduced to a lesser number (such as five or six) by legislative enactment, or by agreement of both sides. Some jurisdictions also permit a verdict to be returned despite the dissent of one, two, or three jurors.

====Waiver of jury trial====
The vast majority of U.S. criminal cases are not concluded with a jury verdict, but rather by plea bargain. Both prosecutors and defendants often have a strong interest in resolving the criminal case by negotiation resulting in a plea bargain. If the defendant waives a jury trial, a bench trial is held.

For civil cases, a jury trial must be demanded within a certain period of time per Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 38.

In United States Federal courts, there is no absolute right to waive a jury trial. Per Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 23(a), only if the prosecution and the court consent may a defendant waive a jury trial for criminal cases. However, most states give the defendant the absolute right to waive a jury trial, and it has become commonplace to find such a waiver in routine contracts as a 2004 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article states:

The article goes on to claim:
In the years since this 2004 article, this practice has become pervasive in the US and, especially in online agreements, it has become commonplace to include such waivers to trial by jury in everything from user agreements attached to software downloads to merely browsing a website. This practice, however, means that while such waivers may have legal force in one jurisdiction—in this case the United States—in the jurisdiction where a verdict is sought in the absence of jury trial (or indeed the presence of a defendant, or any legal representation &quot;in absentia&quot;) may well run directly counter to law in the jurisdiction—such as the United Kingdom—where the defendant resides, thus:

The judgment on &quot;R v Jones&quot; [2002] UKHL 5 issued by the United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords states (in part, in Item 55) &quot;the issue has to be determined by looking at the way in which the courts handled the problem under English criminal procedure and by deciding whether, in the result, the appellant can be said to have had a fair hearing.&quot;

==== Jury trials: terminating parental rights ====
Only five of the 50 states require or permit jury trials for cases where the state is seeking to legally sever a parent-child relationship. Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In Virginia, the jury is called an &quot;advisory jury&quot;. The remaining 46 jurisdictions have case law or statutes or local court rules or common practice that specifically prohibits a jury trial in termination of parental rights cases. The fate of a family is exclusively placed in the hands of a single judge when there is no jury trial.

<text>In its broadest sense, justice is the idea that individuals should be treated fairly. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the most plausible candidate for a core definition comes from the Institutes of Justinian, a codification of Roman Law from the sixth century AD, where justice is defined as &quot;the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due&quot;.

A society where justice has been achieved would be one in which individuals receive what they &quot;deserve&quot;. The interpretation of what &quot;deserve&quot; means draws on a variety of fields and philosophical branches including ethics, rationality, law, religion, and fairness. The state may pursue justice by operating courts and enforcing their rulings.

== History ==
Early Western theories of justice were developed in part by Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato in his work &quot;The Republic&quot;, and Aristotle, in his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and &quot;Politics&quot;. Modern-day Western notions of justice also have their roots in Christian theology, which largely follows the divine command theory, according to which God dictates morality and determines whether or not an action is seen as morally &quot;good&quot;. This, in turn, determines justice. 

Western thinkers later advanced different theories about where the foundations of justice lie. In the 17th century, philosophers such as John Locke said justice derives from natural law. Jean-Jacques Rosseau was one of the advocates for social contract theory which states that justice derives from the mutual agreement of members of society to be governed in a political order. In the 19th century, utilitarian philosophers such as John Stuart Mill proposed that justice is served by what creates the best outcomes for the greatest number of people.

Modern frameworks include concepts such as distributive justice, utilitarianism, retributive justice and restorative justice. 

In broad terms, Distributive justice considers what is fair based on what goods are to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the &quot;proper&quot; distribution. &quot;Utilitarian&quot; theories look forward to the future consequences of punishment, &quot;retributive&quot; theories look back to particular acts of wrongdoing and attempt to match them with appropriate punishment, and &quot;restorative&quot; theories look at the needs of victims and society and seek to repair the harms from wrongdoing. Theories of retributive justice say justice is served by punishing wrongdoers, whereas restorative justice (also sometimes called &quot;reparative justice&quot;) is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.

==Platonic Justice==

Justice, according to Plato, is about balance and harmony. It represents the right relationship between conflicting aspects within an individual or a community. He defines justice as everyone having and doing what they are responsible for or what belongs to them. In other words, a just person is someone who contributes to society according to their unique abilities and receives what is proportionate to their contribution. They are in the right place, always striving to do their best, and reciprocating what they receive fairly and equitably. This applies both at the individual level and at the organizational and societal levels.

To illustrate these ideas, Plato describes a person as having three parts: reason, spirit, and desire. These parallel the three parts of a city in his philosophy, which he describes through the metaphor of a chariot: it functions effectively when the charioteer, representative of reason, successfully controls the two horses, symbolizing spirit and desire. Continuing on these themes, Plato theorizes that those who love wisdom, or philosophers, are the most ideal to govern because only they truly comprehend the nature of the good. Just like one would seek a doctor&#x27;s expertise in matters of health rather than a farmer&#x27;s, so should the city entrust its governance to someone knowledgeable about the good, rather than to politicians who might prioritize power over people&#x27;s genuine needs. Socrates later used the parable of the ship to illustrate this point: the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean, crewed by a powerful but drunken captain (the common people), a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship&#x27;s course (the politicians), and a navigator (the philosopher), the latter of whom being the only one who knows how to get the ship to port.

==Divinity and religious conceptions of justice==

Advocates of divine command theory say justice, and indeed the whole of morality is the authoritative command of God. Murder is wrong and must be punished, for instance, because God says it so. Some versions of the theory assert that God must be obeyed because of the nature of God&#x27;s relationship with humanity, others assert that God must be obeyed because God is goodness itself, and thus doing God&#x27;s command would be best for everyone.

An early meditation on the divine command theory by Plato can be found in his dialogue, Euthyphro. Called the Euthyphro dilemma, it goes as follows: &quot;Is what is morally good commanded by the gods because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by the gods?&quot; The implication is that if the latter is true, then justice is beyond mortal understanding; if the former is true, then morality exists independently from the gods and is therefore subject to the judgment of mortals. A response, popularized in two contexts by Immanuel Kant and C. S. Lewis, is that it is deductively valid to say that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of God and vice versa.

Judaistic, Christian and Muslim theology traditionally follow that justice is a present, real, right, and, specifically, governing concept along with mercy and that justice is ultimately derived from and held by God. According to the Bible, such institutions like the Mosaic Law were created by God to require the Israelites to live by and apply God&#x27;s standards of justice.

The Hebrew Bible describes God as saying about the Judeo-Christian-Islamic patriarch Abraham: &quot;No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice;...&quot; (Genesis 18:19, NRSV). The Psalmist describes God as having &quot;Righteousness and justice [as] the foundation of [His] throne;...&quot; (Psalms 89:14, NRSV).

The New Testament also describes God and Jesus Christ as having and displaying justice, often in comparison with God displaying and supporting mercy (Matthew 5:7).

==Natural law==
Many have claimed that justice is a part of natural law (e.g., John Locke).

===Despotism and skepticism===

In &quot;Republic&quot; by Plato, the character Thrasymachus argues that justice is the interest of the strong – merely a name for what the powerful or cunning ruler has imposed on the people.

===Mutual agreement===

Advocates of the social contract say that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone; or, in many versions, from what they would agree to under &quot;hypothetical&quot; conditions including equality and absence of bias. This account is considered further below, under &#x27;Justice as Fairness&#x27;. The absence of bias refers to an equal ground for all people involved in a disagreement (or trial in some cases).

===Subordinate value===
According to utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill, justice is not as fundamental as we often think. Rather, it is derived from the more basic standard of rightness, consequentialism: what is right is what has the best consequences (usually measured by the total or average welfare caused). So, the proper principles of justice are those that tend to have the best consequences. These rules may turn out to be familiar ones such as keeping contracts; but equally, they may not, depending on the facts about real consequences. Either way, what is important is those consequences, and justice is important, if at all, only as derived from that fundamental standard. Mill tries to explain our mistaken belief that justice is overwhelmingly important by arguing that it derives from two natural human tendencies: our desire to retaliate against those who hurt us, or the feeling of self-defense and our ability to put ourselves imaginatively in another&#x27;s place, sympathy. So, when we see someone harmed, we project ourselves into their situation and feel a desire to retaliate on their behalf. If this process is the source of our feelings about justice, that ought to undermine our confidence in them.

==Theories==

It has been said that &#x27;systematic&#x27; or &#x27;programmatic&#x27; political and moral philosophy in the West begins, in Plato&#x27;s Republic, with the question, &#x27;What is Justice?&#x27; According to most contemporary theories of justice, justice is overwhelmingly important: John Rawls claims that &quot;Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought.&quot; In classical approaches, evident from Plato through to Rawls, the concept of &#x27;justice&#x27; is always construed in logical or &#x27;etymological&#x27; opposition to the concept of injustice. Such approaches cite various examples of injustice, as problems which a theory of justice must overcome. A number of post-World War II approaches do, however, challenge that seemingly obvious dualism between those two concepts. Justice can be thought of as distinct from , charity, prudence, mercy, generosity, or compassion, although these dimensions are regularly understood to also be interlinked. Justice is the concept of cardinal virtues, of which it is one. Metaphysical justice has often been associated with concepts of fate, reincarnation or Divine Providence, i.e., with a life in accordance with a cosmic plan.

The equivalence of justice and fairness has been historically and culturally established.

===Instrumental theories of justice===

Instrumental theories of justice look at the consequences of punishment for wrongdoing, looking at questions such as:
# &quot;why&quot; punish?
# &quot;who&quot; should be punished?
# &quot;what&quot; punishment should they receive?
===Utilitarian justice===

According to the utilitarian, justice is the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. Utilitarianism fights crime in three ways:
# &quot;Deterrence&quot;. The credible threat of punishment might lead people to make different choices; well-designed threats might lead people to make choices that maximize welfare. This matches some strong intuitions about just punishment: that it should generally be proportional to the crime. Successful deterrence would reduce crime statistics.
# &quot;Rehabilitation&quot;. Punishment might make &quot;bad people&quot; into &quot;better&quot; ones. For the utilitarian, all that &quot;bad person&quot; can mean is &quot;person who&#x27;s likely to cause unwanted things (like suffering)&quot;. So, utilitarianism could recommend punishment that changes someone such that they are less likely to cause bad things. Successful rehabilitation would reduce recidivism.
# &quot;Security/Incapacitation&quot;. Perhaps there are people who are irredeemable causers of bad things. If so, imprisoning them might maximize welfare by limiting their opportunities to cause harm and therefore the benefit lies within protecting society.
So, the reason for punishment is the maximization of welfare, and punishment should be of whomever, and of whatever form and severity, are needed to meet that goal. This may sometimes justify punishing the innocent, or inflicting disproportionately severe punishments, when that will have the best consequences overall (perhaps executing a few suspected shoplifters live on television would be an effective deterrent to shoplifting, for instance). It also suggests that punishment might turn out &quot;never&quot; to be right, depending on the facts about what actual consequences it has.

====Welfare-maximization====
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. This may require sacrifice of some for the good of others, so long as everyone&#x27;s good is taken impartially into account. Utilitarianism, in general, says that the standard of justification for actions, institutions, or the whole world, is &quot;impartial welfare consequentialism&quot;, and only indirectly, if at all, to do with rights, property, need, or any other non-utilitarian criterion. These other criteria might be indirectly important, to the extent that human welfare involves them. But even then, such demands as human rights would only be elements in the calculation of overall welfare, not uncrossable barriers to action.

===Retributive justice===

Retributive justice argues that consequentialism is wrong, as it argues that all guilty individuals deserve appropriate punishment, based on the conviction that punishment should be proportional to the crime and for all the guilty. However, it is sometimes said that retributivism is merely revenge in disguise. However, there are differences between retribution and revenge: the former is impartial and has a scale of appropriateness, whereas the latter is personal and potentially unlimited in scale.

===Restorative justice===

Restorative justice attempts to repair the harm that was done to the victims. It encourages active participation from victims and encourages offenders to take responsibility for their actions. Restorative justice fosters dialogue between victim and offender and shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability. Meta-analyses of the effectivity of restorative justice show no improvement in recidivism.

===Mixed theories===
Some modern philosophers have said that Utilitarian and Retributive theories are not mutually exclusive. For example, Andrew von Hirsch, in his 1976 book &quot;Doing Justice&quot;, suggested that we have a moral obligation to punish greater crimes more than lesser ones. However, so long as we adhere to that constraint then utilitarian ideals would play a significant secondary role.

===Distributive justice===
Theories of distributive justice need to answer three questions:
# &quot;What goods&quot; are to be distributed? Is it to be wealth, power, respect, opportunities or some combination of these things?
# &quot;Between what entities&quot; are they to be distributed? Humans (dead, living, future), sentient beings, the members of a single society, nations?
# What is the &quot;proper&quot; distribution? Equal, meritocratic, according to social status, according to need, based on property rights and non-aggression?

Distributive justice theorists generally do not answer questions of &quot;who has the right&quot; to enforce a particular favored distribution, while property rights theorists say that there is no &quot;favored distribution&quot;. Rather, distribution should be based simply on whatever distribution results from lawful interactions or transactions (that is, transactions which are not illicit).

====Fairness====

In his &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness: an impartial distribution of goods. Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a veil of ignorance that denies us all knowledge of our personalities, social statuses, moral characters, wealth, talents and life plans, and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted, if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves. We do not know who in particular we are, and therefore can not bias the decision in our own favor. So, the decision-in-ignorance models fairness, because it excludes selfish bias. Rawls said that each of us would reject the utilitarian theory of justice that we should maximize welfare (see below) because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others. Instead, we would endorse Rawls&#x27;s &quot;two principles of justice&quot;:
* Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.
* Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
** to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and
** attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.

This imagined choice justifies these principles as the principles of justice for us, because we would agree to them in a fair decision procedure. Rawls&#x27;s theory distinguishes two kinds of goods – (1) the good of liberty rights and (2) social and economic goods, i.e. wealth, income and power – and applies different distributions to them – equality between citizens for (1), equality unless inequality improves the position of the worst off for (2).

In one sense, theories of distributive justice may assert that everyone should get what they deserve. Theories vary on the meaning of what is &quot;deserved&quot;. The main distinction is between theories that say the basis of just deserts ought to be held equally by everyone, and therefore derive egalitarian accounts of distributive justice – and theories that say the basis of just deserts is unequally distributed on the basis of, for instance, hard work, and therefore derive accounts of distributive justice by which some should have more than others.

Studies at UCLA in 2008 have indicated that reactions to fairness are &quot;wired&quot; into the brain and that, &quot;Fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats... This is consistent with the notion that being treated fairly satisfies a basic need&quot;. Research conducted in 2003 at Emory University involving capuchin monkeys demonstrated that other cooperative animals also possess such a sense and that &quot;inequity aversion may not be uniquely human&quot;.

====Property rights====

In &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, Robert Nozick said that distributive justice is not a matter of the whole distribution matching an ideal &quot;pattern&quot;, but of each individual entitlement having the right kind of &quot;history&quot;. It is just that a person has some good (especially, some property right) if and only if they came to have it by a history made up entirely of events of two kinds:
* Just &quot;acquisition&quot;, especially by working on unowned things; and
* Just &quot;transfer&quot;, that is free gift, sale or other agreement, but not theft (i.e. by force or fraud).

If the chain of events leading up to the person having something meets this criterion, they are entitled to it: that they possess it is just, and what anyone else does or does not have or need is irrelevant.

On the basis of this theory of distributive justice, Nozick said that all attempts to redistribute goods according to an ideal pattern, without the consent of their owners, are theft. In particular, redistributive taxation is theft.

Some property rights theorists (such as Nozick) also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and say that property rights based justice also has the effect of maximizing the overall wealth of an economic system. They explain that voluntary (non-coerced) transactions always have a property called Pareto efficiency. The result is that the world is better off in an absolute sense and no one is worse off. They say that respecting property rights maximizes the number of Pareto efficient transactions in the world and minimized the number of non-Pareto efficient transactions in the world (i.e. transactions where someone is made worse off). The result is that the world will have generated the greatest total benefit from the limited, scarce resources available in the world. Further, this will have been accomplished without taking anything away from anyone unlawfully.

====Meritocracy====
According to &quot;meritocratic&quot; theories, goods, especially wealth and social status, should be distributed to match individual &quot;merit&quot;, which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work. According to &quot;needs&quot;-based theories, goods, especially such basic goods as food, shelter and medical care, should be distributed to meet individuals&#x27; basic needs for them. According to &quot;contribution&quot;-based theories, goods should be distributed to match an individual&#x27;s contribution to the overall social good.

==Ideals and Standards==

===Equality===

In political theory, liberalism includes two traditional elements: liberty and equality. Most contemporary theories of justice emphasize the concept of equality, including Rawls&#x27; theory of justice as fairness. For Ronald Dworkin, a complex notion of equality is the sovereign political virtue. Dworkin raises the question of whether society is under a duty of justice to help those responsible for the fact that they need help. Complications arise in distinguishing matters of choice and matters of chance, as well as justice for future generations in the redistribution of resources that he advocates.

===Equality before the law===
Law raises important and complex issues about equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that &#x27;All are equal before the law&#x27;. The belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism. In criticism of this belief, the author Anatole France said in 1894, &quot;In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread.&quot; With this saying, France illustrated the fundamental shortcoming of a theory of legal equality that remains blind to social inequality; the same law applied to all may have disproportionately harmful effects on the least powerful.

===Proportionality===
===Social justice===

Social justice encompasses the just relationship between individuals and their society, often considering how privileges, opportunities, and wealth ought to be distributed among individuals. Social justice is also associated with social mobility, especially the ease with which individuals and families may move between social strata. Social justice is distinct from cosmopolitanism, which is the idea that all people belong to a single global community with a shared morality. Social justice is also distinct from egalitarianism, which is the idea that all people are equal in terms of status, value, or rights, as social justice theories do not all require equality. For example, sociologist George C. Homans suggested that the root of the concept of justice is that each person should receive rewards that are proportional to their contributions.

Economist Friedrich Hayek said that the concept of social justice was meaningless, saying that justice is a result of individual behavior and unpredictable market forces. Social justice is closely related to the concept of relational justice, which is about the just relationship with individuals who possess features in common such as nationality, or who are engaged in cooperation or negotiation.

===Equity===

In legal theory, equity is seen as the concept connecting law to justice, since law cannot be applied without reference to justice. In that context, justice is seen as &#x27;the rationale and the ethical foundation of equity&#x27;. One approach towards equity in justice is community policing. Marxism is a needs-based theory, expressed succinctly in Marx&#x27;s slogan &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;.

===Equality of outcome===
===Relational justice===
Relational justice examines individual connections and societal relationships, focusing on normative and political aspects. Rawls&#x27; theory of justice aims to distribute social goods to benefit the poor, but does not consider power relations, political structures, or social meanings. Even Rawls&#x27; self-respect is not compatible with distribution. Iris Marion Young charges that distributive accounts of justice fail to provide an adequate way of conceptualizing political justice in that they fail to take into account many of the demands of ordinary life and that a relational view of justice grounded upon understanding the differences among social groups offers a better approach, one which acknowledges unjust power relations among individuals, groups, and institutional structures. Young Kim also takes a relational approach to the question of justice, but departs from Iris Marion Young&#x27;s political advocacy of group rights and instead, he emphasizes the individual and moral aspects of justice. As to its moral aspects, he said that justice includes responsible actions based on rational and autonomous moral agency, with the individual as the proper bearer of rights and responsibilities. Politically, he maintains that the proper context for justice is a form of liberalism with the traditional elements of liberty and equality, together with the concepts of diversity and tolerance.

===Speed===

The phrase &quot;Justice delayed is justice denied&quot; refers to the problem of slow justice. The right to speedy trial is in some jurisdictions enshrined.
Higher quality justice tends to be speedy.

==Sentencing==
In criminal law, a sentence forms the final explicit act of a judge-ruled process, and also the symbolic principal act connected to his function. The sentence can generally involve a decree of imprisonment, a fine and/or other punishments against a defendant convicted of a crime. Laws may specify the range of penalties that can be imposed for various offenses, and sentencing guidelines sometimes regulate what punishment within those ranges can be imposed given a certain set of offense and offender characteristics. The most common purposes of sentencing in legal theory are:

In civil cases the decision is usually known as a verdict, or judgment, rather than a sentence. Civil cases are settled primarily by means of monetary compensation for harm done (&quot;damages&quot;) and orders intended to prevent future harm (for example injunctions). Under some legal systems an award of damages involves some scope for retribution, denunciation and deterrence, by means of additional categories of damages beyond simple compensation, covering a punitive effect, social disapprobation, and potentially, deterrence, and occasionally disgorgement (forfeit of any gain, even if no loss was caused to the other party).

==Evolutionary perspectives==
Evolutionary ethics and evolution of morality suggest evolutionary bases for the concept of justice. Biosocial criminology research says that human perceptions of what is appropriate criminal justice are based on how to respond to crimes in the ancestral small-group environment and that these responses may not always be appropriate for today&#x27;s societies.

== Psychology ==

There has been research into victim&#x27;s perspective of justice following crimes. Victims find respectful treatment, information and having a voice important for a sense of justice as well as the perception of a fair procedure.

Pemberton et al. proposed a &quot;Big 2&quot; model of justice in terms agency, communion and membership in a society. Victims experience a loss of perception of agency due to a loss of control, as well as a loss of communion if the offender is a member of their social group, but may also lose trust in others or institutions. It can shatter an individual&#x27;s trust that they live in a just and moral world. This suggests that a sense of justice can be restored by increasing a sense of communion and agency, rather than through retribution or restoration.

==Institutions==
In a world where people are interconnected but they disagree, institutions are required to instantiate ideals of justice. These institutions may be justified by their approximate instantiation of justice, or they may be deeply unjust when compared with ideal standards – consider the institution of slavery. Justice is an ideal the world fails to live up to, sometimes due to deliberate opposition to justice despite understanding, which could be disastrous. The question of institutive justice raises issues of legitimacy, procedure, codification and interpretation, which are considered by legal theorists and by philosophers of law. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 emphasizes the need for strong institutions in order to uphold justice.

<text>Jacob Abbott (November 14, 1803 – October 31, 1879) was an American writer of children&#x27;s books.

== Early life ==
On November 14, 1803, Abbott was born in Hallowell, Maine to Jacob Abbott II and Betsey Chandler. He attended the Hallowell Academy.

== Education ==
Abbott graduated from Bowdoin College in 1820. At some point during his years there, he supposedly added the second &quot;t&quot; to his surname, to avoid being &quot;Jacob Abbot the 3rd&quot; (although one source notes he did not actually begin signing his name with two t&#x27;s until several years later).

Abbott studied at Andover Theological Seminary in 1821, 1822, and 1824. He taught at Portland Academy and was a tutor in Amherst College during the next year.

== Career ==
From 1825 to 1829 Abbott was professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Amherst College; was licensed to preach by the Hampshire Association in 1826; founded the Mount Vernon School for Young Ladies in Boston in 1829, and was principal of it in 1829–1833; was pastor of Eliot Congregational Church (which he founded), at Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1834–1835; and was, with his brothers, a founder, and in 1843–1851 a principal of Abbott&#x27;s Institute, and in 1845–1848 of the Mount Vernon School for Boys, in New York City.

He was a prolific author, writing juvenile fiction, brief histories, biographies, religious books for the general reader, and a few works in popular science. He wrote 180 books and was a coauthor or editor of 31 more. He died in Farmington, Maine, where he had spent part of his time after 1839, and where his brother, Samuel Phillips Abbott, founded the Abbott School.

His &quot;Rollo Books&quot;, such as &quot;Rollo at Play&quot; and &quot;Rollo in Europe&quot;, are the best known of his writings, having as their chief characters a representative boy and his associates. In them Abbott did for one or two generations of young American readers a service not unlike that performed earlier, in England and the US, by the authors of &quot;Evenings at Home&quot;, &quot;The History of Sandford and Merton&quot;, and &quot;The Parent&#x27;s Assistant&quot;. To follow up his Rollo books, he wrote of &quot;Uncle George&quot;, using him to teach the young readers about ethics, geography, history, and science. He also wrote 22 volumes of biographical histories and a 10 volume set titled the &quot;Franconia Stories&quot;.

His intention was to both amuse and educate, shown by this quotation from the Preface of &quot;Bruno&quot;: The books, though called story books, are not intended to be works of amusement merely to those who may receive them, but of substantial instruction. The successive volumes will comprise a great variety, both in respect to the subjects which they treat, and to the form and manner in which the subjects will be presented; but the end and aim of all will be to impart useful knowledge, to develop the thinking and reasoning powers, to teach a correct and discriminating use of language, to present models of good conduct for imitation, and bad examples to be shunned, to explain and enforce the highest principles of moral duty, and, above all, to awaken and cherish the spirit of humble and unobtrusive, but heartfelt piety.

His brothers, John Stevens Cabot Abbott and Gorham Dummer Abbott, were also authors. 

See his &quot;Young Christian, Memorial Edition, with a Sketch of the Author&quot; by Edward Abbott with a bibliography of his works.

Other works of note: &quot;Lucy Books&quot;, &quot;Jonas Books&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Story Books&quot;, &quot;Marco Paul&quot;, &quot;Gay Family&quot;, and &quot;Juno Books&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On May 18, 1829, Abbott married Harriet Vaughan. He had four sons; Benjamin Vaughan Abbott, Austin Abbott, both eminent lawyers, Lyman Abbott, and Edward Abbott, a clergyman, were also well-known authors.

<text>John Stevens Cabot Abbott (September 19, 1805June 17, 1877) was an American historian, pastor, and pedagogical writer born in Brunswick, Maine to Jacob and Betsey Abbott.

==Early life==
He was a brother of Jacob Abbott, and was associated with him in the management of Abbott&#x27;s Institute in New York City, and in the preparation of his series of brief historical biographies. Abbott graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825, prepared for the ministry at Andover Theological Seminary, and between 1830 and 1844, when he retired from the ministry in the Congregational Church, preached successively at Worcester, Roxbury, and Nantucket, all in Massachusetts.

==Literary career==
Owing to the success of his work, &quot;The Mother at Home&quot;, he devoted himself from 1844 onwards, to literature. He was a voluminous writer of books on Christian ethics, and of popular histories, which were credited with cultivating a popular interest in history. He is best known as the author of the widely popular &quot;History of Napoleon Bonaparte&quot; (1855), in which the various elements and episodes in Napoleon&#x27;s career are described. Abbott takes a very favourable view towards his subject throughout. Also among his principal works are: &quot;History of the Civil War in America&quot; (1863–1866), &quot;History of Napoleon III Emperor of the French&quot; (1868), and &quot;The History of Frederick II, Called Frederick the Great&quot; (New York, 1871). He also did a foreword to a book called Life of Boone by W.M. Bogart, about Daniel Boone in 1876.

His biography in &quot;The Biographical Dictionary of America&quot; (1906) states that Abbot&#x27;s mind was extremely clear and active, and he could leave the subject in hand for something entirely different, and then resume his former work without the slightest inconvenience, also he had a singularly even temperament; by his personal goodness, as well as by his books, he had a great influence on the world, he continued active in work nearly to the time of his death, to which he looked forward with joy rather than resignation. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica (11th edition)&quot; stated &quot;He was a voluminous writer of books on Christian ethics, and of histories, which now seem unscholarly and untrustworthy, but were valuable in their time in cultivating a popular interest in history&quot;; and that in general, except that he did not write juvenile fiction, his work in subject and style closely resembles that of his brother, Jacob Abbott.

==Marriage and children==
On August 17, 1830, he married Jane Williams Bourne, daughter of Abner Bourne and Abagail Williams. Together they raised eight children: 
#John Brown Abbott (November 29, 1832 – May 24, 1842)
#Jane Maria Abbott (born November 25, 1833)
#Waldo Abbott (September 8, 1836 – July 7, 1864)
#Harriet Vaughan Abbott (born February 18, 1838)
#Ellen Williams Abbott(born January 11, 1840)
#Laura Sallucia Abbott (born October 30, 1843)
#Elizabeth Ballister Abbott (March 15, 1847 – February 23, 1864)
#Emma Susan Abbott (born July 12, 1849)

As a part of the 1872 Iwakura Mission Abbott was given guardianship of Shige Nagai, a Japanese girl sent to the United States to be educated. She became one of the first piano teachers in Japan, and one of the first two Japanese women to attend a college.

Abbott died at Fair Haven, Connecticut on 17 June 1877. In 1910, a series of twenty short biographies of historical characters by J. S. C. and Jacob Abbott, was published. His brother, Gorham Dummer Abbott, was a pioneer in women’s education in the United States, as well as an author. Abbott&#x27;s grandson, Willis Abbott, was a journalist and author and an editor of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;.

<doc id="16376" wikidata="Q313583" url="?curid=16376" title="J. E. B. Stuart">
<text>James Ewell Brown &quot;Jeb&quot; Stuart (February 6, 1833May 12, 1864) was a Confederate army general and cavalry officer during the American Civil War. He was known to his friends as &quot;Jeb,” from the initials of his given names. Stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations. While he cultivated a cavalier image (red-lined gray cape, the yellow waist sash of a regular cavalry officer, hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume, red flower in his lapel, often sporting cologne), his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army and inspired Southern morale.

Stuart graduated from West Point in 1854 and served in Texas and Kansas with the U.S. Army. Stuart was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with Native Americans and the violence of Bleeding Kansas, and he participated in the capture of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. He resigned his commission when his home state of Virginia seceded, to serve in the Confederate Army, first under Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley, but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the Army of Northern Virginia, playing a role in all of that army&#x27;s campaigns until his death.

He established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions (during the Peninsula Campaign and the Maryland Campaign) circumnavigated the Union Army of the Potomac, bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the North. At the Battle of Chancellorsville, he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s infantry corps.

Stuart&#x27;s most famous campaign, the Gettysburg Campaign, was flawed when his long separation from Lee&#x27;s army left Lee unaware of Union troop movements so that Lee was surprised and almost trapped at the Battle of Gettysburg. Stuart received criticism from the Southern press as well as the proponents of the Lost Cause movement after the war. During the 1864 Overland Campaign, Union Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry launched an offensive to defeat Stuart, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Yellow Tavern.

==Early life and background==

Stuart was born at Laurel Hill Farm, a plantation in Patrick County, Virginia, near the border with North Carolina. He was the eighth of eleven children and the youngest of the five sons to survive past early age. His father, Archibald Stuart, was a War of 1812 veteran, slaveholder, attorney, and Democratic politician who represented Patrick County in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, and also served one term in the United States House of Representatives. His mother Elizabeth Letcher Pannill Stuart ran the family farm, and was known as a strict religious woman with a good sense for business.

He was of Scottish descent (including some Scots-Irish). His great-grandfather, Major Alexander Stuart, commanded a regiment at the Battle of Guilford Court House during the Revolutionary War. His father Archibald was a cousin of attorney Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart.

===Education===
Stuart was educated at home by his mother and tutors until the age of twelve, when he left Laurel Hill to be educated by various teachers in Wytheville, Virginia, and at the home of his aunt Anne (Archibald&#x27;s sister) and her husband Judge James Ewell Brown (Stuart&#x27;s namesake) at Danville. He entered Emory and Henry College when he was fifteen, and attended from 1848 to 1850.

During the summer of 1848, Stuart attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army, but was rejected as underaged. He obtained an appointment in 1850 to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, from Representative Thomas Hamlet Averett, the man who had defeated his father in the 1848 election. Stuart was a popular student and was happy at the Academy. Although he was not handsome in his teen years, his classmates called him by the nickname &quot;Beauty&quot;, which they described as his &quot;personal comeliness in inverse ratio to the term employed.&quot; He quickly grew a beard after graduation and a fellow officer remarked that he was &quot;the only man he ever saw that [a] beard improved.&quot;

Robert E. Lee was appointed superintendent of the academy in 1852, and Stuart became a friend of the family, seeing them socially on frequent occasions. Lee&#x27;s nephew, Fitzhugh Lee, also arrived at the academy in 1852. In Stuart&#x27;s final year, in addition to achieving the cadet rank of second captain of the corps, he was one of eight cadets designated as honorary &quot;cavalry officers&quot; for his skills in horsemanship. Stuart graduated 13th in his class of 46 in 1854. He ranked tenth in his class in cavalry tactics. Although he enjoyed the civil engineering curriculum at the academy and did well in mathematics, his poor drawing skills hampered his engineering studies, and he finished 29th in that discipline.

==United States Army==
Stuart was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the U.S. Regiment of Mounted Riflemen in Texas. After an arduous journey, he reached Fort Davis on January 29, 1855, and was a leader for three months on scouting missions over the San Antonio to El Paso Road. He was soon transferred to the newly formed 1st Cavalry Regiment (1855) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory, where he became regimental quartermaster and commissary officer under the command of Col. Edwin V. Sumner. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1855.

===Marriage===

Also in 1855, Stuart met Flora Cooke, the daughter of the 2nd U.S. Dragoon Regiment&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke. Burke Davis described Flora as &quot;an accomplished horsewoman, and though not pretty, an effective charmer,&quot; to whom &quot;Stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle.&quot; They became engaged in September, less than two months after meeting. Stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in Latin, &quot;Veni, Vidi, Victus sum&quot; (I came, I saw, I was conquered). Although a gala wedding had been planned for Fort Riley, Kansas, the death of Stuart&#x27;s father on September 20 caused a change of plans and the marriage on November 14 was small and limited to family witnesses. Their first child, a girl, was born in 1856 but died the same day. On November 14, 1857, Flora gave birth to another daughter, whom the parents named Flora after her mother. The family relocated in early 1858 to Fort Riley, where they remained for three years. The couple owned two slaves until 1859, one inherited from his father&#x27;s estate, the other purchased.

===Bleeding Kansas===
Stuart&#x27;s leadership capabilities were soon recognized. He was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with Native Americans and the antebellum violence of Bleeding Kansas. He was wounded on July 29, 1857, while fighting at Solomon River, Kansas, against the Cheyenne. Colonel Sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of Native American arrows. Scattering the under-armed warriors, Stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down, whom Stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol. The Cheyenne turned and fired at Stuart with a .36 caliber Allen &amp; Thurber pepperbox pistol, striking him in the chest with a bullet, which did little more damage than to pierce the skin. Stuart returned in September to Fort Leavenworth and was reunited with his wife.

===John Brown===
In 1859, Stuart developed a new piece of cavalry equipment, for which he received patent number 25,684 on October 4—a saber hook, or an &quot;improved method of attaching sabers to belts.&quot; The U.S. government paid Stuart $5,000 for a &quot;right to use&quot; license and Stuart contracted with Knorr, Nece and Co. of Philadelphia to manufacture his hook. While in Washington, D.C., to discuss government contracts, and in conjunction with his application for an appointment into the quartermaster department, Stuart heard about John Brown&#x27;s raid on the U.S. Arsenal at Harpers Ferry. Stuart volunteered to be aide-de-camp to Col. Robert E. Lee and accompanied Lee with a company of U.S. Marines from the Marine Barracks, 8th &amp; I, Washington, DC and four companies of Maryland militia. While delivering Lee&#x27;s written surrender ultimatum to the leader of the group, who had been calling himself Isaac Smith, Stuart recognized &quot;Old Osawatomie Brown&quot; from his days in Kansas.

===Resignation===
Stuart was promoted to captain on April 22, 1861, but resigned from the U.S. Army on May 3, 1861, to join the Confederate States Army, following the secession of Virginia. On June 26, 1860, Flora gave birth to a son, Philip St. George Cooke Stuart, but Stuart changed the name to James Ewell Brown Stuart Jr. (&quot;Jimmie&quot;), in late 1861 out of disgust with his father-in-law. Upon learning that his father-in-law, Col. Cooke, would remain in the U.S. Army during the coming war, Stuart wrote to his brother-in-law (future Confederate Brig. Gen. John Rogers Cooke), &quot;He will regret it but once, and that will be continuously.&quot; When he learned that George H. Thomas, a fellow Virginian, had also decided to stay with the Union, Stuart wrote &quot;I would like to hang, hang Thomas as a traitor to his native state.&quot;

==Confederate Army==

===Early service===

Stuart was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of Virginia Infantry in the Confederate Army on May 10, 1861. Major General Robert E. Lee, now commanding the armed forces of Virginia, ordered him to report to Colonel Thomas J. Jackson at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Jackson chose to ignore Stuart&#x27;s infantry designation and assigned him on July 4 to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah, organized as the 1st Virginia Cavalry Regiment. He was promoted to colonel on July 16.

After early service in the Shenandoah Valley, Stuart led his regiment in the First Battle of Bull Run (where Jackson got his nickname, &quot;Stonewall&quot;), and participated in the pursuit of the retreating Federals, leading to sensationalist reports in the Northern press about the dreaded Confederate &quot;black horse&quot; cavalry. He then commanded the Army&#x27;s outposts along the upper Potomac River until given command of the cavalry brigade for the army then known as the Army of the Potomac (later named the Army of Northern Virginia). He was promoted to brigadier general on September 24, 1861.

===Peninsula===
In 1862, the Union Army of the Potomac began its Peninsula Campaign against Richmond, Virginia, and Stuart&#x27;s cavalry brigade assisted General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army as it withdrew up the Virginia Peninsula in the face of superior numbers. Stuart fought at the Battle of Williamsburg, but in general the terrain and weather on the Peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations. 

However, when General Robert E. Lee became commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he requested that Stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the Union army was vulnerable. Stuart set out with 1,200 troopers on the morning of June 12 and, having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable, took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the Union army, returning after 150 miles on June 15 with 165 captured Union soldiers, 260 horses and mules, and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies. His men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized Union cavalry, coincidentally commanded by his father-in-law, Col. Cooke, and their total casualties amounted to one man killed. The maneuver was a public relations sensation, and Stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at Richmond. He had become as famous as Stonewall Jackson in the eyes of the Confederacy.

===Northern Virginia===

Early in the Northern Virginia Campaign, Stuart was promoted to major general on July 25, 1862, and his command was upgraded to the Cavalry Division—the fact that the Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s cavalry had been brigaded and were now a full division made for an important organizational advantage over the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s mounted arm, which was ineffectually organized as regiments attached to infantry brigades and treated as an extension of the army signal corps. He was nearly captured and lost his signature plumed hat and cloak to pursuing Federals during a raid in August, but in a retaliatory raid at Catlett&#x27;s Station the following day, managed to overrun Union army commander Major General John Pope&#x27;s headquarters, and not only captured Pope&#x27;s full uniform, but also intercepted orders that provided Lee with valuable intelligence concerning reinforcements for Pope&#x27;s army.

At the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas), Stuart&#x27;s cavalry followed the massive assault by Longstreet&#x27;s infantry against Pope&#x27;s army, protecting its flank with artillery batteries. Stuart ordered Brigadier General Beverly Robertson&#x27;s brigade to pursue the Federals and in a sharp fight against Brigadier General John Buford&#x27;s brigade, Colonel Thomas T. Munford&#x27;s 2nd Virginia Cavalry was overwhelmed until Stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements. Buford&#x27;s men, many of whom were new to combat, retreated across Lewis&#x27;s Ford and Stuart&#x27;s troopers captured over 300 of them. Stuart&#x27;s men harassed the retreating Union columns until the campaign ended at the Battle of Chantilly.

===Maryland===
During the Maryland Campaign in September 1862, Stuart&#x27;s cavalry screened the army&#x27;s movement north. He bears some responsibility for Robert E. Lee&#x27;s lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing Army of the Potomac under George B. McClellan. For a five-day period, Stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at Urbana, Maryland. His reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols. As the Union Army drew near to Lee&#x27;s divided army, Stuart&#x27;s men skirmished at various points on the approach to Frederick and Stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide. He misjudged the Union routes of advance, ignorant of the Union force threatening Turner&#x27;s Gap, and required assistance from the infantry of Major General D. H. Hill to defend the South Mountain passes in the Battle of South Mountain. His horse artillery bombarded the flank of the Union army as it opened its attack in the Battle of Antietam. By mid-afternoon, Stonewall Jackson ordered Stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the Union right flank and rear, which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the West Woods. Stuart began probing the Union lines with more artillery barrages, which were answered with &quot;murderous&quot; counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by Jackson was never launched.

Three weeks after Lee&#x27;s army had withdrawn back to Virginia, on October 10–12, 1862, Stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the Army of the Potomac, his Chambersburg Raid—126 miles in under 60 hours, from Darkesville, West Virginia to as far north as Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and Chambersburg and around to the east through Emmitsburg, Maryland and south through Hyattstown, Maryland and White&#x27;s Ford to Leesburg, Virginia—once again embarrassing his Union opponents and seizing horses and supplies, but at the expense of exhausted men and animals, without gaining much military advantage. Jubal Early referred to it as &quot;the greatest horse stealing expedition&quot; that only &quot;annoyed&quot; the enemy. Stuart gave his friend Jackson a fine, new officer&#x27;s tunic, trimmed with gold lace, commissioned from a Richmond tailor, which he thought would give Jackson more of the appearance of a proper general (something to which Jackson was notoriously indifferent).

Urged by President Lincoln to pursue Lee, McClellan slowly pushed his army south, crossing the Potomac starting on October 26. As Lee began moving to counter this, Stuart screened Longstreet&#x27;s corps and skirmished numerous times in early November against Union cavalry and infantry around Mountville, Aldie, and Upperville. On November 6, Stuart was notified by telegram that his daughter Flora had died of typhoid fever on November 3, just before her fifth birthday.

===Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville===

In the December 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, Stuart and his cavalry—most notably his horse artillery under Major John Pelham—protected Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s flank at Hamilton&#x27;s Crossing. General Lee commended his cavalry, which &quot;effectually guarded our right, annoying the enemy and embarrassing his movements by hanging on his flank, and attacking when the opportunity occurred.&quot; Stuart reported to Flora the next day that he had been shot through his fur collar but was unhurt.

After Christmas, Lee ordered Stuart to conduct a raid north of the Rappahannock River to &quot;penetrate the enemy&#x27;s rear, ascertain if possible his position &amp; movements, &amp; inflict upon him such damage as circumstances will permit.&quot; With 1,800 troopers and a horse artillery battery assigned to the operation, Stuart&#x27;s raid reached as far north as four miles south of Fairfax Court House, seizing 250 prisoners, horses, mules, and supplies. Tapping telegraph lines, his signalmen intercepted messages between Union commanders, and Stuart sent a personal telegram to Union Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs, &quot;General Meigs will in the future please furnish better mules; those you have furnished recently are very inferior.&quot;

On March 17, 1863, Stuart&#x27;s cavalry clashed with a Union raiding party at Kelly&#x27;s Ford. The minor victory was marred by the death of Major Pelham, which caused Stuart profound grief, as he thought of him as close as a younger brother. He wrote to a Confederate congressman, &quot;The noble, the chivalric, the gallant Pelham is no more. ... Let the tears of agony we have shed, and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness.&quot; Flora was pregnant at the time and Stuart told her that if it were a boy, he wanted him to be named John Pelham Stuart. (Virginia Pelham Stuart was born October 9.)
At the Battle of Chancellorsville, Stuart accompanied Stonewall Jackson on his famous flanking march of May 2, 1863, and started to pursue the retreating soldiers of the Union XI Corps when he received word that both Jackson and his senior division commander, Major General A. P. Hill, had been wounded. Hill, bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps, Brigadier General Robert E. Rodes, sent a message ordering Stuart to take command of the Second Corps. Although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of May 2, Stuart, who had no prior experience leading infantry, performed creditably as an infantry corps commander the following day, launching a strong and well-coordinated attack against the Union right flank at Chancellorsville. When Union troops abandoned Hazel Grove, Stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the Union positions with artillery. Stuart relinquished his infantry command on May 6 when Hill returned to duty. Stephen W. Sears wrote:

Stonewall Jackson died on May 10 and Stuart was once again devastated by the loss of a close friend, telling his staff that the death was a &quot;national calamity.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s wife, Mary Anna, wrote to Stuart on August 1, thanking him for a note of sympathy: &quot;I need not assure you of which you already know, that your friendship &amp; admiration were cordially reciprocated by him. I have frequently heard him speak of Gen&#x27;l Stuart as one of his warm personal friends, &amp; also express admiration for your Soldierly qualities.&quot;

===Brandy Station===
Returning to the cavalry for the Gettysburg Campaign, Stuart endured the two low points in his career, starting with the Battle of Brandy Station, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war. By June 5, two of Lee&#x27;s infantry corps were camped in and around Culpeper. Six miles northeast, holding the line of the Rappahannock River, Stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers, mostly near Brandy Station, screening the Confederate Army against surprise by the enemy. Stuart requested a full field review of his troops by General Lee. This grand review on June 5 included nearly 9,000 mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery, charging in simulated battle at Inlet Station, about two miles (three km) southwest of Brandy Station.

Lee was not able to attend the review, however, so it was repeated in his presence on June 8, although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations. Despite the lower level of activity, some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all Stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses. Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock the next day and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around Brandy Station.

Army of the Potomac commander Major General Joseph Hooker interpreted Stuart&#x27;s presence around Culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his army&#x27;s supply lines. In reaction, he ordered his cavalry commander, Major General Alfred Pleasonton, to take a combined arms force of 8,000 cavalrymen and 3,000 infantry on a &quot;spoiling raid&quot; to &quot;disperse and destroy&quot; the 9,500 Confederates. Pleasonton&#x27;s force crossed the Rappahannock in two columns on June 9, 1863, the first crossing at Beverly&#x27;s Ford (Brigadier General John Buford&#x27;s division) catching Stuart by surprise, waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire. The second crossing, at Kelly&#x27;s Ford, surprised Stuart again, and the Confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat. A series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across Fleetwood Hill, which had been Stuart&#x27;s headquarters the previous night. After ten hours of fighting, Pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the Rappahannock.

Although Stuart claimed a victory because the Confederates held the field, Brandy Station is considered a tactical draw, and both sides came up short. Pleasonton was not able to disable Stuart&#x27;s force at the start of an important campaign and he withdrew before finding the location of Lee&#x27;s infantry nearby. However, the fact that the Southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of Union cavalry, and that they fell victim to a surprise attack, was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the Southern press. The fight also revealed the increased competency of the Union cavalry, and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible Southern mounted arm.

===Stuart&#x27;s ride in the Gettysburg Campaign===
Following a series of small cavalry battles in June as Lee&#x27;s army began marching north through the Shenandoah Valley, Stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again, desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at Brandy Station. General Lee gave orders to Stuart on June 22 on how he was to participate in the march north. The exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since, but the essence was that Stuart was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the Army of Northern Virginia was still south of the Potomac, and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of Ewell&#x27;s Second Corps. Instead of taking a direct route north near the Blue Ridge Mountains, however, Stuart chose to reach Ewell&#x27;s flank by taking his three best brigades (those of Brigadier General Wade Hampton, Brigadier General Fitzhugh Lee, and Colonel John R. Chambliss, the latter replacing the wounded Brigadier General W. H. F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee) between the Union Army and Washington, moving north through Rockville to Westminster and on into Pennsylvania, hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital. Stuart and his three brigades departed Salem Depot at 1 a.m. on June 25.

Unfortunately for Stuart&#x27;s plan, the Union army&#x27;s movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of Federal infantry, forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or General Lee had anticipated. This prevented Stuart from linking up with Ewell as ordered and deprived Lee of the use of his prime cavalry force, the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the army, while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory.

Stuart&#x27;s command crossed the Potomac River at 3 a.m. on June 28. At Rockville they captured a wagon train of 140 brand-new, fully loaded wagons and mule teams. This wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to Stuart&#x27;s advance, but he interpreted Lee&#x27;s orders as placing importance on gathering supplies. The proximity of the Confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two Union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the Confederates. Stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses &quot;he would have marched down the 7th Street Road [and] took Abe &amp; Cabinet prisoners.&quot;

In Westminster on June 29, his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of Union cavalry, chasing them a long distance on the Baltimore road, which Stuart claimed caused a &quot;great panic&quot; in the city of Baltimore. The head of Stuart&#x27;s column encountered Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick&#x27;s cavalry as it passed through Hanover and scattered it on June 30; the Battle of Hanover ended after Kilpatrick&#x27;s men regrouped and drove the Confederates out of town. Stuart&#x27;s brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with Kilpatrick. After a 20-mile trek in the dark, his exhausted men reached Dover on the morning of July 1, as the Battle of Gettysburg was commencing without them.

Stuart headed next for Carlisle, hoping to find Ewell. He lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of July 1 and burned the Carlisle Barracks before withdrawing to the south towards Gettysburg. He and the bulk of his command reached Lee at Gettysburg the afternoon of July 2. He ordered Wade Hampton to cover the left rear of the Confederate battle lines, and Hampton fought against Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Hunterstown before joining Stuart at Gettysburg.

===Gettysburg and its aftermath ===
When Stuart arrived at Gettysburg on the afternoon of July 2—bringing with him the caravan of captured Union supply wagons—he received a rare rebuke from Lee. No one witnessed the private meeting between Lee and Stuart, but reports circulated at headquarters that Lee&#x27;s greeting was &quot;abrupt and frosty.&quot; Colonel Edward Porter Alexander wrote, &quot;Although Lee said only, &#x27;Well, General, you are here at last,&#x27; his manner implied rebuke, and it was so understood by Stuart.&quot; On the final day of the battle, Stuart was ordered to move into the enemy&#x27;s rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time Pickett&#x27;s Charge was sent against the Union positions on Cemetery Ridge, but his attack on East Cavalry Field was repelled by Union cavalry under Brigadier Generals David Gregg and George Custer.

During the retreat from Gettysburg, Stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the army&#x27;s movement, successfully screening against aggressive Union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather. Numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat. Stuart&#x27;s men were the final units to cross the Potomac River, returning to Virginia in &quot;wretched condition—completely worn out and broken down.&quot;

The Gettysburg Campaign was the most controversial of Stuart&#x27;s career. He became one of the scapegoats (along with James Longstreet) blamed for Lee&#x27;s loss at Gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum Lost Cause movement, such as Jubal Early. This was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers, such as Stuart&#x27;s subordinate, Thomas L. Rosser, who stated after the war that Stuart did, &quot;on this campaign, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of Gettysburg.&quot; In Lee&#x27;s report on the campaign, he wrote:

One of the most forceful postbellum defenses of Stuart was by Colonel John S. Mosby, who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general, writing, &quot;He made me all that I was in the war. ... But for his friendship I would never have been heard of.&quot; He wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in 1908, a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against Stuart.

Historians remain divided on how much the defeat at Gettysburg was due to Stuart&#x27;s failure to keep Lee informed. Edward G. Longacre argues that Lee deliberately gave Stuart wide discretion in his orders. Edwin B. Coddington refers to the &quot;tragedy&quot; of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign and judges that when Fitzhugh Lee raised the question of &quot;whether Stuart exercised the discretion &quot;undoubtedly given to him, judiciously&quot;,&quot; the answer is no. Agreeing that Stuart&#x27;s absence permitted Lee to be surprised at Gettysburg, Coddington points out that the Union commander was just as surprised. Eric J. Wittenberg and J. David Petruzzi have concluded that there was &quot;plenty of blame to go around&quot; and the fault should be divided between Stuart, the lack of specificity in Lee&#x27;s orders, and Richard S. Ewell, who might have tried harder to link up with Stuart northeast of Gettysburg. Jeffry D. Wert acknowledges that Lee, his officers, and fighting by the Army of the Potomac bear the responsibility for the Confederate loss at Gettysburg, but states that &quot;Stuart failed Lee and the army in the reckoning at Gettysburg. ... Lee trusted him and gave him discretion, but Stuart acted injudiciously.&quot;

Although Stuart was not rebuked or disciplined in any official way for his role in the Gettysburg campaign, it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on September 9, 1863, did not carry with it a promotion to lieutenant general. Edward Bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the Army of Northern Virginia carried this rank, Lee&#x27;s decision to keep Stuart at major general rank, while at the same time promoting Stuart&#x27;s subordinates Wade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee to major generals, could be considered an implied rebuke. Wert wrote that there is no evidence Lee considered Stuart&#x27;s performance during the Gettysburg Campaign and that it is &quot;more likely that Lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps.&quot;

===Fall 1863 and the 1864 Overland Campaign===
Lee reorganized his cavalry on September 9, creating a Cavalry Corps for Stuart with two divisions of three brigades each. In the Bristoe Campaign, Stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemy&#x27;s rear, but General Meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving Stuart any opportunities to take advantage of. On October 13, Stuart blundered into the rear guard of the Union III Corps near Warrenton, resulting in the First Battle of Auburn. Ewell&#x27;s corps was sent to rescue him, but Stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting III Corps moved on, and the assistance was not necessary. As Meade withdrew towards Manassas Junction, brigades from the Union II Corps fought a rearguard action against Stuart&#x27;s cavalry and the infantry of Brigadier General Harry Hays&#x27;s division near Auburn on October 14. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry boldly bluffed Warren&#x27;s infantry and escaped disaster. After the Confederate repulse at Bristoe Station and an aborted advance on Centreville, Stuart&#x27;s cavalry shielded the withdrawal of Lee&#x27;s army from the vicinity of Manassas Junction. Judson Kilpatrick&#x27;s Union cavalry pursued Stuart&#x27;s cavalry along the Warrenton Turnpike, but were lured into an ambush near Chestnut Hill and routed. The Federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles (eight km) in an affair that came to be known as the &quot;Buckland Races&quot;. The Southern press began to mute its criticism of Stuart following his successful performance during the fall campaign.

The Overland Campaign, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s offensive against Lee in the spring of 1864, began at the Battle of the Wilderness, where Stuart aggressively pushed Thomas L. Rosser&#x27;s Laurel Brigade into a fight against George Custer&#x27;s better-armed Michigan Brigade, resulting in significant losses. General Lee sent a message to Stuart: &quot;It is very important to save your Cavalry &amp; not wear it out. ... You must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages.&quot; As the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at Spotsylvania Court House, Stuart&#x27;s cavalry fought delaying actions against the Union cavalry. His defense at Laurel Hill, also directing the infantry of Brigadier General Joseph B. Kershaw, skillfully delayed the advance of the Federal army for nearly five critical hours.

===Yellow Tavern and death===
The commander of the Army of the Potomac, Major General George Meade, and his cavalry commander, Major General Philip Sheridan, quarreled about the Union cavalry&#x27;s performance in the first two engagements of the Overland Campaign. Sheridan heatedly asserted that he wanted to &quot;concentrate all of cavalry, move out in force against Stuart&#x27;s command, and whip it.&quot; Meade reported the comments to Grant, who replied, &quot;Did Sheridan say that? Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it.&quot; Sheridan immediately organized a raid against Confederate supply and railroad lines close to Richmond, which he knew would bring Stuart to battle.

Sheridan moved aggressively to the southeast, crossing the North Anna River and seizing Beaver Dam Station on the Virginia Central Railroad, where his men captured a train, liberating 3,000 Union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined for Lee&#x27;s army. Stuart dispatched a force of about 3,000 cavalrymen to intercept Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry, which was more than three times their numbers. As he rode in pursuit, accompanied by his aide, Major Andrew R. Venable, they were able to stop briefly along the way to be greeted by Stuart&#x27;s wife, Flora, and his children, Jimmie and Virginia. Venable wrote of Stuart, &quot;He told me he never expected to live through the war, and that if we were conquered, that he did not want to live.&quot;

The Battle of Yellow Tavern took place on May 11 at an abandoned inn located north of Richmond. The Confederate troops resisted from the low ridgeline bordering the road to Richmond, fighting for over three hours. After receiving a scouting report from Texas Jack Omohundro, Stuart led a countercharge and pushed the advancing Union troopers back from the hilltop. Stuart, on horseback, shouted encouragement from in front of Company K of the 1st Virginia Cavalry while firing his revolver at the Union troopers.

As the 5th Michigan Cavalry streamed in retreat past Stuart, a dismounted Union private, 44-year-old John A. Huff, turned and shot Stuart with his .44-caliber revolver from a distance of 10–30 yards. The large caliber round cut through Stuart&#x27;s abdomen and exited an inch to the right of his spine. Stuart fell into the arms of Company K&#x27;s commander, Gus W. Dorsey. Dorsey caught him and took him from his horse. Stuart told him: &quot;Dorsey...save your men.&quot; Dorsey refused to leave him and brought Stuart to the rear. 

Stuart suffered great pain as an ambulance took him to Richmond to await his wife&#x27;s arrival at the home of Dr. Charles Brewer, his brother-in-law. As he was being driven from the field in an ambulance wagon, Stuart noticed disorganized ranks of retreating men and called out to them his last words on the battlefield: &quot;Go back, go back, and do your duty, as I have done mine, and our country will be safe. Go back, go back! I had rather die than be whipped.&quot;

Stuart ordered his sword and spurs be given to his son. As his aide Major McClellan left his side, Confederate President Jefferson Davis came in, took Stuart&#x27;s hand, and asked, &quot;General, how do you feel?&quot; Stuart answered &quot;Easy, but willing to die, if God and my country think I have fulfilled my destiny and done my duty.&quot; His last whispered words were: &quot;I am resigned; God&#x27;s will be done.&quot;

He died at 7:38 p.m. on May 12, the following day, before Flora Stuart reached his side. He was 31 years old. Stuart was buried in Richmond&#x27;s Hollywood Cemetery. Upon learning of Stuart&#x27;s death, General Lee is reported to have said that he could hardly keep from weeping at the mere mention of Stuart&#x27;s name and that Stuart had never given him a bad piece of information. John Huff, the private who had fatally wounded Stuart, was killed in action just a few weeks later at the Battle of Haw&#x27;s Shop.

Flora wore the black of mourning for the remainder of her life, and never remarried. She lived in Saltville, Virginia, for 15 years after the war, where she opened and taught at a school in a log cabin. She worked from 1880 to 1898 as principal of the Virginia Female Institute in Staunton, Virginia, a position for which Robert E. Lee had recommended her before his death ten years earlier. In 1907, the institute was renamed Stuart Hall School in her honor. Upon the death of her daughter Virginia, from complications in childbirth in 1898, Flora resigned from the institute and moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where she helped Virginia&#x27;s widower, Robert Page Waller, in raising her grandchildren.

She died in Norfolk on May 10, 1923, after striking her head in a fall on a city sidewalk. She is buried alongside her husband and their daughter, Little Flora, in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.

==Legacy and memorials==

Like his intimate friend, Stonewall Jackson, General J. E. B. Stuart was a legendary figure and is considered one of the greatest cavalry commanders in American history. His friend from his federal army days, Union Major General John Sedgwick, said that Stuart was &quot;the greatest cavalry officer ever foaled in America.&quot; Jackson and Stuart, both of whom were killed in battle, had colorful public images, although the latter&#x27;s seems to have been more deliberately crafted. Wert wrote about Stuart:

Stuart&#x27;s birthplace, Laurel Hill, located in Patrick County, Virginia, was purchased by the J.E.B. Stuart Birthplace Preservation Trust, Inc., in 1992 to preserve and interpret it. In December 2006, a personal Confederate battle flag, sewn by Flora Stuart, was sold in a Heritage Auction for $956,000 (including buyer&#x27;s premium), a world-record price for any Confederate flag. The 34-inch by 34-inch flag was hand-sewn for Stuart by Flora in 1862, and Stuart carried it into some of his most famous battles.

The J. E. B. Stuart Monument, a statue of Stuart by sculptor Frederick Moynihan, used to occupy a space on Richmond&#x27;s Monument Avenue at Stuart Circle. Originally dedicated in 1907, it was removed on July 7, 2020.
=== Named after Stuart ===
U.S. Route 58, in Virginia, is named the &quot;J.E.B. Stuart Highway&quot;. In 1884 the town of Taylorsville, Virginia, was renamed Stuart. The British Army named two models of American-made World War II tanks, the M3 and M5, the Stuart tank in General Stuart&#x27;s honor.

==== Schools ====
A middle school in Jacksonville, Florida, is named for him. A high school named after him on Munson&#x27;s Hill in Falls Church, Virginia, opened in 1959. In early 2017, Fairfax County Public Schools established an Ad Hoc Working Committee to assist the Fairfax County School Board in determining whether to rename the Stuart High School in Virginia, in response to suggestions from students and local community members that FCPS should not continue to honor a Confederate general who fought in support of a cause dedicated to maintaining the institution of slavery in Virginia and other states. The creation of the committee followed the circulation of a petition started by actress Julianne Moore and Bruce Cohen in 2016, which garnered over 35,000 signatures in support of changing the school&#x27;s name to one honoring the late United States Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.

On July 27, 2017, the Fairfax County School Board approved a measure to change the school name no later than the start of the 2019 school year. The measure asked that &quot;Stuart High School&quot; be considered as a possibility for the new name. On October 27, 2017, the Fairfax County School Board voted to change the name of J.E.B. Stuart High School to &quot;Justice High School.&quot; Board member Sandy Evans from the Mason District said that the name will honor Justice Thurgood Marshall, civil rights leader Barbara Rose Johns, U.S. Army officer Louis Gonzaga Mendez Jr., and all those who have fought for justice and equality.

On June 18, 2018, the school board for Richmond Public Schools in Richmond, Virginia, voted 6–1 to rename J. E. B. Stuart Elementary School to Barack Obama Elementary School. On June 12, 2018, students of the school were given the opportunity to narrow down the choices for renaming the school from seven to three. Northside Elementary received 190 votes, Barack Obama Elementary earned 166 votes, and Wishtree Elementary received 127 votes. From there, the administration of Richmond Public Schools recommended to the school board that it rename the school after Barack Obama. Superintendent Jason Kamras said, &quot;It&#x27;s incredibly powerful that in the capital of the Confederacy, where we had a school named for an individual who fought to maintain slavery, that now we&#x27;re renaming that school after the first black president. A lot of our kids, and our kids at J. E. B. Stuart, see themselves in Barack Obama.&quot; The student population of the newly named Barack Obama Elementary School is made up of more than 90 percent African-American children.

Stuart Hall School is a Staunton, Virginia, co-educational school for students from pre-kindergarten to Grade 12, and it offers a boarding program from Grades 8 to 12. It was renamed in 1907 in honor of its most famous headmistress, Mrs. Flora Cooke Stuart, the widow of Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart.
