<text>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) () (sometimes called sporadic inclusion body myositis, sIBM) is the most common inflammatory muscle disease in older adults. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive weakness and wasting of both proximal muscles (located on or close to the torso) and distal muscles (close to hands or feet), most apparent in the finger flexors and knee extensors. IBM is often confused with an entirely different class of diseases, called hereditary inclusion body myopathies (hIBM). The &quot;M&quot; in hIBM is an abbreviation for &quot;myopathy&quot; while the &quot;M&quot; in IBM is for &quot;myositis&quot;. In IBM, two processes appear to occur in the muscles in parallel, one autoimmune and the other degenerative. Inflammation is evident from the invasion of muscle fibers by immune cells. Degeneration is characterized by the appearance of holes, deposits of abnormal proteins, and filamentous inclusions in the muscle fibers. sIBM is a rare disease, with a prevalence ranging from 1 to 71 individuals per million.

Weakness comes on slowly (over months to years) in an asymmetric manner and progresses steadily, leading to severe weakness and wasting of arm and leg muscles. IBM is more common in men than women. Patients may become unable to perform activities of daily living and most require assistive devices within 5 to 10 years of symptom onset. sIBM does not significantly affect life expectancy, although death related to malnutrition and respiratory failure can occur. The risk of serious injury due to falls is increased. There is no effective treatment for the disease as of 2019.

==Classification and terminology==
IBM stands for &quot;inclusion body &quot;myositis:&quot; not &quot;inclusion body &quot;myopathy.&quot;&quot; The &#x27;inclusion body&#x27; refers to a histological finding of rimmed vacuoles in muscle tissue. However, IBM does not refer to the collection of diseases that feature these inclusion bodies. It refers to a specific disease entity.

Multiple genetic diseases that feature inclusion bodies have been grouped into &quot;&quot;hereditary&quot; inclusion body &quot;myopathies&quot; (hIBM).&quot; &quot;Myopathy&quot; is used because inflammation is not a prominent finding. There is inconsistency in what individual disease entities fall under the category of hIBM. The term &quot;&quot;sporadic&quot; inclusion body &quot;myositis&quot;&quot; (sIBM) was introduced as a way to refer to IBM to avoid confusion with hIBM. However, one author discourages use of sIBM, as it implies that IBM and hIBM differ only in inheritance; they actually have unrelated mechanisms and manifestations of disease.

==Signs and symptoms==
sIBM causes progressive muscle weakness. How sIBM affects individuals is variable, including the age of onset (which generally varies from the forties upwards) and rate of progression. Because of this variability, there is no &quot;textbook case&quot;.

Common early symptoms include frequent tripping and falling and difficulty going up stairs. Foot drop in one or both feet can occur. Part of the cause for this dysfunction is the early involvement of the quadriceps muscles. Weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle is responsible for foot drop. Another common early symptom is trouble manipulating the fingers, such as difficulty with tasks such as turning doorknobs or gripping keys. Weakness of finger flexion and ankle dorsiflexion occurs early. sIBM also preferentially affects the wrist flexors, biceps, and triceps.

During the course of the illness, the patient&#x27;s mobility is progressively restricted as it becomes difficult to bend down, reach for things, and walk quickly. Many patients say they have balance problems and fall easily, as the muscles cannot compensate for an off-balanced posture. Because sIBM makes the leg muscles weak and unstable, patients are very vulnerable to serious injury from tripping or falling down. Although pain has not been traditionally part of the &quot;textbook&quot; description, many patients report severe muscle pain, especially in the thighs.

Progressive difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) is present in 40 to 85% of IBM cases and often leads to death from aspiration pneumonia.

IBM can also result in diminished capacity for aerobic exercise. This decline is most likely a consequence of the sedentary lifestyle leading to disuse muscle atrophy that is often associated with the symptoms of IBM (i.e. progressive muscle weakness, decreased mobility, and increased level of fatigue). Therefore, one focus of treatment should be the improvement of aerobic capacity.

Patients with sIBM usually eventually need to resort to a cane or a walker and in most cases, a wheelchair eventually becomes a necessity.

&quot;The progressive course of s-IBM leads slowly to severe disability. Finger functions can become very impaired, such as manipulating pens, keys, buttons, and zippers, pulling handles, and firmly grasping handshakes. Arising from a chair becomes difficult. Walking becomes more precarious. Sudden falls, sometimes resulting in major injury to the skull or other bones, can occur, even from walking on minimally irregular ground or from other minor imbalances outside or in the home, due to weakness of quadriceps and gluteus muscles depriving the patient of automatic posture maintenance. A foot-drop can increase the likelihood of tripping. Dysphagia can occur, usually caused by upper esophageal constriction that often can be symptomatically improved, for several months to years, by bougie dilation per a GI or ENT physician. Respiratory muscle weakness can sometimes eventuate.&quot;

==Causes==
The cause of IBM is unknown. IBM likely results from the interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors.

There are two major theories about how sIBM is caused. One hypothesis suggests that the inflammation-immune reaction, caused by an unknown trigger – likely an undiscovered virus or an autoimmune disorder – is the primary cause of sIBM and that the degeneration of muscle fibers and protein abnormalities are secondary features. Despite the arguments &quot;in favor of an adaptive immune response in sIBM, a purely autoimmune hypothesis for sIBM is untenable because of the disease&#x27;s resistance to most immunotherapy.&quot;

The second school of thought advocates the theory that sIBM is a degenerative disorder related to aging of the muscle fibers and that abnormal, potentially pathogenic protein accumulations in myofibrils play a key causative role in sIBM (apparently before the immune system comes into play). This hypothesis emphasizes the abnormal intracellular accumulation of many proteins, protein aggregation and misfolding, proteosome inhibition, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

One review discusses the &quot;limitations in the beta-amyloid-mediated theory of IBM myofiber injury.&quot;

Dalakas (2006) suggested that a chain of events causes IBM – some sort of virus, likely a retrovirus, triggers the cloning of T cells. These T cells appear to be driven by specific antigens to invade muscle fibers. In people with sIBM, the muscle cells display &quot;flags&quot; telling the immune system that they are infected or damaged (the muscles ubiquitously express MHC class I antigens) and this immune process leads to the death of muscle cells. The chronic stimulation of these antigens also causes stress inside the muscle cell in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and this ER stress may be enough to cause a self-sustaining T cell response (even after a virus has dissipated). In addition, this ER stress may cause the misfolding of protein. The ER is in charge of processing and folding molecules carrying antigens. In IBM, muscle fibers are overloaded with these major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that carry the antigen protein pieces, leading to more ER stress and more protein misfolding.

A self-sustaining T cell response would make sIBM a type of autoimmune disorder. When studied carefully, it has not been possible to detect an ongoing viral infection in the muscles. One theory is that a chronic viral infection might be the initial triggering factor setting IBM in motion. There have been a handful of IBM cases – approximately 15 – that have shown clear evidence of a virus called HTLV-1. The HTLV-1 virus can cause leukemia, but in most cases lies dormant and most people end up being lifelong carriers of the virus. One review says that the best evidence points towards a connection with some type of retrovirus and that a retroviral infection combined with immune recognition of the retrovirus is enough to trigger the inflammation process.
* amyloid protein
* The hypothesis that beta amyloid protein is key to IBM has been supported in a mouse model using an Aβ vaccine that was found to be effective against inclusion body myositis in mouse models. Although this vaccine is likely, not safe for human use, it still shows that attacking Aβ has efficacy in mice against IBM.
* Following up on earlier leads, the Greenberg group report finding that the protein TDP-43 is a very prominent and highly sensitive and specific feature of IBM. This protein is normally found within the nucleus but in IBM is found in the cytoplasm of the cell. This important advance should help develop a new screening technique for IBM and may provide clues in terms of a therapeutic approach

===Genetics===
sIBM is not inherited and is not passed on to the children of IBM patients. There are genetic features that do not directly cause IBM but that appear to predispose a person to getting IBM – having this particular combination of genes increases one&#x27;s susceptibility to getting IBM. Some 67% of IBM patients have a particular combination of human leukocyte antigen genes in a section of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype in the center of the MHC class II region. sIBM is not passed on from generation to generation, although the susceptibility region of genes may be.

There are also several rare forms of hereditary inclusion body myopathy that are linked to specific genetic defects and that are passed on from generation to generation. Since these forms do not show features of muscle inflammation, they are classified as myopathies rather than forms of myositis. Because they do not display inflammation as a primary symptom, they may in fact be similar, but different diseases to sporadic inclusion body myositis. There are several different types, each inherited in different ways. See hereditary inclusion body myopathy.

A 2007 review concluded there is no indication that the genes responsible for the familial or hereditary conditions are involved in sIBM.

==Diagnosis==
Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels in the blood (at most ~10 times normal) are typical in sIBM but affected individuals can also present with normal CK levels. Electromyography (EMG) studies display variable abnormalities such as increased insertional activity, increased spontaneous activity (fibrillation potentials and sharp waves), and large/broad or short/narrow motor unit potentials. On EMG, recruitment patterns can be reduced or increased. Findings can vary even within the same muscle of an affected individual. Muscle biopsy may display several common findings including inflammatory cells invading muscle cells, vacuolar degeneration, and inclusion bodies of aggregations of multiple proteins. sIBM is a challenge to the pathologist and even with a biopsy, diagnosis can be ambiguous.

A diagnosis of inclusion body myositis was historically dependent on muscle biopsy results. Antibodies to cytoplasmic 5&#x27;-nucleotidase (cN1A; NT5C1A) have been strongly associated with the condition. However, other inflammatory conditions, such as lupus, can have a positive anti-NT5C1A. As of 2019, it remains to be established whether a positive anti-NT5C1A antibody test can make muscle biopsy unneeded.
Muscle imaging can help establish the pattern of muscle involvement and selection of a biopsy site.

===Differential diagnosis===
IBM is often initially misdiagnosed as polymyositis. A course of prednisone is typically completed with no improvement and eventually, sIBM is confirmed. sIBM weakness comes on over months or years and progresses steadily, whereas polymyositis has an onset of weeks or months. Muscular dystrophy (e.g., limb girdle muscular dystrophy) must be considered as well. sIBM can be mistaken for physical deconditioning.

Hereditary myopathies can mimic sIBM, both in signs and symptoms and in the appearance of muscle biopsies. A small percentage of those initially diagnosed with sIBM are later found to have pathogenic mutations in the genes &quot;VCP&quot; and &quot;SQSTM1&quot;, which are known to cause hIBM.

IBM has a distinctive pattern of muscle involvement that distinguishes it among inflammatory myopathies. Characteristic of IBM is weakness of finger flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Other inflammatory myopathies cause a proximal muscle weakness pattern, such as weakness of hip flexion, abduction, and extension, as well as shoulder abduction. IBM and other inflammatory myopathies both cause bicep/tricep weakness.

===Classification===
* The common type is sIBM; it strikes individuals apparently at random.
* There is a type that has been observed in multiple siblings in the same generation in several families, termed &quot;familial inflammatory sIBM&quot;, but it is not passed on from generation to generation.
* There are also several very rare forms of &quot;hereditary inclusion body myopathy&quot; (hIBM) that are linked to specific genetic defects and that are passed on from generation to generation, each inherited in different ways.

==Management==
There is no standard course of treatment to slow or stop the progression of the disease as of 2019. sIBM patients do not reliably respond to anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, or immunomodulatory medications. Most of disease management is supportive care. Prevention of falls is an important consideration. There is no consensus on exercise guidelines; however, physical therapy is recommended to teach the patient a home exercise program, to teach how to compensate during mobility-gait training with an assistive device, transfers and bed mobility. An exercise regimen preferentially minimizes a patient&#x27;s risk of injury and corresponds to the patient&#x27;s goals.

==Other related disorders==
When sIBM was originally described, the major feature noted was muscle inflammation. Two other disorders were also known to display muscle inflammation, and sIBM was classified along with them. They are dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) and all three illnesses were called idiopathic (of unknown origin) myositis or inflammatory myopathies.

It appears that sIBM and polymyositis share some features, especially the initial sequence of immune system activation, however, polymyositis comes on over weeks or months, does not display the subsequent muscle degeneration and protein abnormalities as seen in IBM, and as well, polymyositis tends to respond well to treatments, IBM does not. IBM is often confused with (misdiagnosed as) polymyositis. Polymyositis that does not respond to treatment is likely IBM.

Dermatomyositis shares a number of similar physical symptoms and histopathological traits as polymyositis, but exhibits a skin rash not seen in polymyositis or sIBM. It may have different root causes unrelated to either polymyositis or sIBM.

Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), which can present (among others) as a rare form of inclusion body myopathy.

==Epidemiology==
Prevalence of disease in a rigorous meta-analysis in 2017 was 46 patients per million. The earliest published prevalence was in 2000 and put at 5 per million. A 2017 study in Ireland reported 112 per million. It is not believed that the disease prevalence is increasing with time, but rather diagnostics and reporting are improving.

Estimates of the mean age of onset range from 61 to 68 years old.

==Society and culture==
In the biographical drama film Father Stu, the protagonist, a boxer-turned-Catholic priest, has sIBM.

Musician Peter Frampton was diagnosed with the disease in 2019.

<doc id="15539" wikidata="Q1436752" url="?curid=15539" title="Ion implantation">
<text>Ion implantation is a low-temperature process by which ions of one element are accelerated into a solid target, thereby changing the target&#x27;s physical, chemical, or electrical properties. Ion implantation is used in semiconductor device fabrication and in metal finishing, as well as in materials science research. The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the target. Ion implantation also causes chemical and physical changes when the ions impinge on the target at high energy. The crystal structure of the target can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic collision cascades, and ions of sufficiently high energy (tens of MeV) can cause nuclear transmutation.

== General principle ==

Ion implantation equipment typically consists of an ion source, where ions of the desired element are produced, an accelerator, where the ions are electrostatically accelerated to a high energy or using radiofrequency, and a target chamber, where the ions impinge on a target, which is the material to be implanted. Thus ion implantation is a special case of particle radiation. Each ion is typically a single atom or molecule, and thus the actual amount of material implanted in the target is the integral over time of the ion current. This amount is called the dose. The currents supplied by implants are typically small (micro-amperes), and thus the dose which can be implanted in a reasonable amount of time is small. Therefore, ion implantation finds application in cases where the amount of chemical change required is small.

Typical ion energies are in the range of 10 to 500 keV (1,600 to 80,000 aJ). Energies in the range 1 to 10 keV (160 to 1,600 aJ) can be used, but result in a penetration of only a few nanometers or less. Energies lower than this result in very little damage to the target, and fall under the designation ion beam deposition. Higher energies can also be used: accelerators capable of 5 MeV (800,000 aJ) are common. However, there is often great structural damage to the target, and because the depth distribution is broad (Bragg peak), the net composition change at any point in the target will be small.

The energy of the ions, as well as the ion species and the composition of the target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A monoenergetic ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The average penetration depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus, ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of ion energy in the target is called stopping and can be simulated with the binary collision approximation method.

Accelerator systems for ion implantation are generally classified into medium current (ion beam currents between 10 μA and ~2 mA), high current (ion beam currents up to ~30 mA), high energy (ion energies above 200 keV and up to 10 MeV), and very high dose (efficient implant of dose greater than 1016 ions/cm2).

=== Ion source ===
All varieties of ion implantation beamline designs contain general groups of functional components (see image). The first major segment of an ion beamline includes an ion source used to generate the ion species. The source is closely coupled to biased electrodes for extraction of the ions into the beamline and most often to some means of selecting a particular ion species for transport into the main accelerator section.

The ion source is often made of materials with a high melting point such as tungsten, tungsten doped with lanthanum oxide, molybdenum and tantalum. Often, inside the ion source a plasma is created between two tungsten electrodes, called reflectors, using a gas often based on fluorine containing the ion to be implanted whether it is germanium, boron, or silicon, such as boron trifluoride, boron difluoride, germanium tetrafluoride or silicon tetrafluoride. Arsine gas or phosphine gas can be used in the ion source to provide arsenic or phosphorus respectively for implantation. The ion source also has an indirectly heated cathode. Alternatively this heated cathode can be used as one of the reflectors, eliminating the need for a dedicated one, or a directly heated cathode is used.

Oxygen or oxide based gases such as carbon dioxide can also be used for ions such as carbon. Hydrogen or hydrogen with xenon, krypton or argon may be added to the plasma to delay the degradation of tungsten components due to the halogen cycle. The hydrogen can come from a high pressure cylinder or from a hydrogen generator that uses electrolysis. 
Repellers at each end of the ion source continually move the atoms from one end of the ion source to the other, resembling two mirrors pointed at each other constantly reflecting light.

The ions are extracted from the source by an extraction electrode outside the ion source through a slit shaped aperture in the source, then the ion beam then passes through an analysis magnet to select the ions that will be implanted and then passes through one or two linear accelerators (linacs) that accelerate the ions before they reach the wafer in a process chamber. In medium current ion implanters there is also a neutral ion trap before the process chamber to remove neutral ions from the ion beam.

Some dopants such as aluminum, are often not provided to the ion source as a gas but as a solid compound based on Chlorine or Iodine that is vaporized in a nearby crucible such as Aluminium iodide or Aluminium chloride or as a solid sputtering target inside the ion source made of Aluminium oxide or Aluminium nitride. Implanting antimony often requires the use of a vaporizer attached to the ion source, in which antimony trifluoride, antimony trioxide, or solid antimony are vaporized in a crucible and a carrier gas is used to route the vapors to an adjacent ion source, although it can also be implanted from a gas containing fluorine such as antimony hexafluoride or vaporized from liquid antimony pentafluoride. Gallium, Selenium and Indium are often implanted from solid sources such as selenium dioxide for selenium although it can also be implanted from hydrogen selenide. Crucibles often last 60–100 hours and prevent ion implanters from changing recipes or process parameters in less than 20–30 minutes. Ion sources can often last 300 hours.

The &quot;mass&quot; selection (just like in mass spectrometer) is often accompanied by passage of the extracted ion beam through a magnetic field region with an exit path restricted by blocking apertures, or &quot;slits&quot;, that allow only ions with a specific value of the product of mass and velocity/charge to continue down the beamline. If the target surface is larger than the ion beam diameter and a uniform distribution of implanted dose is desired over the target surface, then some combination of beam scanning and wafer motion is used. Finally, the implanted surface is coupled with some method for collecting the accumulated charge of the implanted ions so that the delivered dose can be measured in a continuous fashion and the implant process stopped at the desired dose level.

==Application in semiconductor device fabrication==
===Doping===
Semiconductor doping with boron, phosphorus, or arsenic is a common application of ion implantation. When implanted in a semiconductor, each dopant atom can create a charge carrier in the semiconductor after annealing. A hole can be created for a p-type dopant, and an electron for an n-type dopant. This modifies the conductivity of the semiconductor in its vicinity. The technique is used, for example, for adjusting the threshold voltage of a MOSFET. Ion implantation is practical due to the high sensitivity of semiconductor devices to foreign atoms, as ion implantation does not deposit large numbers of atoms. Sometimes such as during the manufacturing of SiC devices, ion implantation is carried out while heating the SiC wafer to 500 °C. This is known as a hot implant and it is used to control damage to the surface of the semiconductor. Cryogenic implants (Cryo-implants) can have the same effect.

The energies used in doping often vary from 1 KeV to 3 MeV and it is not possible to build an ion implanter capable of providing ions at any energy due to physical limitations. To increase the throughput of ion implanters, efforts have been made to increase the current of the beam created by the implanter. The beam can be scanned across the wafer magnetically, electrostatically, mechanically or with a combination of these techniques. A mass analyzer magnet is used to select the ions that will be implanted on the wafer. Ion implantation is also used in displays containing LTPS transistors.

Ion implantation was developed as a method of producing the p-n junction of photovoltaic devices in the late 1970s and early 1980s, along with the use of pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing, although pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing has not to date been used for commercial production. Ion implantation is not used in most photovoltaic silicon cells, instead, thermal diffusion doping is used.

===Silicon on insulator===
One prominent method for preparing silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates from conventional silicon substrates is the &quot;SIMOX&quot; (separation by implantation of oxygen) process, wherein a buried high dose oxygen implant is converted to silicon oxide by a high temperature annealing process.

===Mesotaxy===
Mesotaxy is the term for the growth of a crystallographically matching phase underneath the surface of the host crystal (compare to epitaxy, which is the growth of the matching phase on the surface of a substrate). In this process, ions are implanted at a high enough energy and dose into a material to create a layer of a second phase, and the temperature is controlled so that the crystal structure of the target is not destroyed. The crystal orientation of the layer can be engineered to match that of the target, even though the exact crystal structure and lattice constant may be very different. For example, after the implantation of nickel ions into a silicon wafer, a layer of nickel silicide can be grown in which the crystal orientation of the silicide matches that of the silicon.

==Application in metal finishing==
===Tool steel toughening===
Nitrogen or other ions can be implanted into a tool steel target (drill bits, for example). The structural change caused by the implantation produces a surface compression in the steel, which prevents crack propagation and thus makes the material more resistant to fracture. The chemical change can also make the tool more resistant to corrosion.

===Surface finishing===
In some applications, for example prosthetic devices such as artificial joints, it is desired to have surfaces very resistant to both chemical corrosion and wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As in the case of tool steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the surface to make it more chemically resistant to corrosion.

==Other applications==
===Ion beam mixing===
Ion implantation can be used to achieve ion beam mixing, i.e. mixing up atoms of different elements at an interface. This may be useful for achieving graded interfaces or strengthening adhesion between layers of immiscible materials.

===Ion implantation-induced nanoparticle formation===
Ion implantation may be used to induce nano-dimensional particles in oxides such as sapphire and silica. The particles may be formed as a result of precipitation of the ion implanted species, they may be formed as a result of the production of a mixed oxide species that contains both the ion-implanted element and the oxide substrate, and they may be formed as a result of a reduction of the substrate, first reported by Hunt and Hampikian. Typical ion beam energies used to produce nanoparticles range from 50 to 150 keV, with ion fluences that range from 1016 to 1018 ions/cm2. The table below summarizes some of the work that has been done in this field for a sapphire substrate. A wide variety of nanoparticles can be formed, with size ranges from 1 nm on up to 20 nm and with compositions that can contain the implanted species, combinations of the implanted ion and substrate, or that are comprised solely from the cation associated with the substrate.

Composite materials based on dielectrics such as sapphire that contain dispersed metal nanoparticles are promising materials for optoelectronics and nonlinear optics.

==Problems with ion implantation==
===Crystallographic damage===
Each individual ion produces many point defects in the target crystal on impact such as vacancies and interstitials. Vacancies are crystal lattice points unoccupied by an atom: in this case the ion collides with a target atom, resulting in transfer of a significant amount of energy to the target atom such that it leaves its crystal site. This target atom then itself becomes a projectile in the solid, and can cause successive collision events.
Interstitials result when such atoms (or the original ion itself) come to rest in the solid, but find no vacant space in the lattice to reside. These point defects can migrate and cluster with each other, resulting in dislocation loops and other defects.

===Damage recovery===
Because ion implantation causes damage to the crystal structure of the target which is often unwanted, ion implantation processing is often followed by a thermal annealing. This can be referred to as damage recovery.

===Amorphization===
The amount of crystallographic damage can be enough to completely amorphize the surface of the target: i.e. it can become an amorphous solid (such a solid produced from a melt is called a glass). In some cases, complete amorphization of a target is preferable to a highly defective crystal: An amorphized film can be regrown at a lower temperature than required to anneal a highly damaged crystal. Amorphisation of the substrate can occur as a result of the beam damage. For example, yttrium ion implantation into sapphire at an ion beam energy of 150 keV to a fluence of 5*1016 Y+/cm2 produces an amorphous glassy layer approximately 110 nm in thickness, measured from the outer surface. [Hunt, 1999]

===Sputtering===
Some of the collision events result in atoms being ejected (sputtered) from the surface, and thus ion implantation will slowly etch away a surface. The effect is only appreciable for very large doses.

===Ion channelling===
If there is a crystallographic structure to the target, and especially in semiconductor substrates where the crystal structure is more open, particular crystallographic directions offer much lower stopping than other directions. The result is that the range of an ion can be much longer if the ion travels exactly along a particular direction, for example the &lt;110&gt; direction in silicon and other diamond cubic materials. This effect is called &quot;ion channelling&quot;, and, like all the channelling effects, is highly nonlinear, with small variations from perfect orientation resulting in extreme differences in implantation depth. For this reason, most implantation is carried out a few degrees off-axis, where tiny alignment errors will have more predictable effects.

Ion channelling can be used directly in Rutherford backscattering and related techniques as an analytical method to determine the amount and depth profile of damage in crystalline thin film materials.

== Safety ==

=== Hazardous materials ===
In fabricating wafers, toxic materials such as arsine and phosphine are often used in the ion implanter process. Other common carcinogenic, corrosive, flammable, or toxic elements include antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, and boron. Semiconductor fabrication facilities are highly automated, but residue of hazardous elements in machines can be encountered during servicing and in vacuum pump hardware.

=== High voltages and particle accelerators ===
High voltage power supplies used in ion accelerators necessary for ion implantation can pose a risk of electrical injury. In addition, high-energy atomic collisions can generate X-rays and, in some cases, other ionizing radiation and radionuclides. In addition to high voltage, particle accelerators such as radio frequency linear particle accelerators and laser wakefield plasma accelerators present other hazards.

John Woo Yu-sen (; born 22 September 1946) is a Hong Kong film director known as a highly influential figure in the action film genre. The recipient of various accolades, including a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Editing, as well as a Golden Horse Award, an Asia Pacific Screen Award and a Saturn Award, he is regarded as a pioneer of heroic bloodshed films and the gun fu genre in Hong Kong action cinema. He is known for his highly chaotic &quot;bullet ballet&quot; action sequences, stylized imagery, Mexican standoffs, frequent use of slow motion and allusions to &quot;wuxia&quot;, film noir and Western cinema.
Considered one of the major figures of Hong Kong cinema, Woo has directed several notable action films. He is known for his collaborations with actor Chow Yun-fat in five Hong Kong action films: &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986), which made Chow a box-office superstar in Asia, &quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot; (1987), &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989), &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1991), and &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992). He has also directed martial arts films such as &quot;The Dragon Tamers&quot; (1975), &quot;Hand of Death&quot; (1976), and &quot;Last Hurrah for Chivalry&quot; (1979), and action comedies such as &quot;Follow the Star&quot; (1978), &quot;From Riches to Rags&quot; (1980), &quot;Run, Tiger, Run&quot; (1984), and &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1991).

&quot;Hard Target&quot; (1993), starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, was his first American directorial debut, and the first major Hollywood film made by a Chinese director. His other Hollywood films include &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), &quot;Face/Off&quot; (1997) and &quot;&quot; (2000). He made his Canadian debut with the action comedy film &quot;Once a Thief&quot; (1996), which is a remake of Woo&#x27;s 1991 film of the same name. He continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, directing films such as the two-part historical epic &quot;The Crossing&quot; (2014). His first Chinese-language feature since &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992) was the internationally co-produced &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008-2009), which broke the Chinese box office record previously held by &quot;Titanic&quot; in mainland China.
Woo is the creator of the comic series &quot;Seven Brothers&quot;, published by Virgin Comics. He is the founder and chairman of the production company &quot;Lion Rock Productions&quot;.

==Early life==
Woo was born as Wu Yu-seng (Ng Yu-sum in Cantonese) on 22 September 1946, in Guangzhou, China, amidst the chaotic Chinese Civil War. Due to school age restrictions, his mother changed his birth date to 22 September 1948, which is what remains on his passport. The Woo family, who were Protestant Christians, faced persecution during Mao Zedong&#x27;s early anti-bourgeois purges after the communist revolution in China, and fled to Hong Kong when he was five.

Impoverished, the Woo family lived in the slums at Shek Kip Mei. His father was a teacher, though rendered unable to work by tuberculosis, and his mother was a manual laborer on construction sites. The family was rendered homeless by the Shek Kip Mei Fire of 1953. Charitable donations from disaster relief efforts enabled the family to relocate; however, violent crime had by then become commonplace in Hong Kong housing projects. At age three he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Following surgery on his spine, he was unable to walk correctly until eight years old, and as a result his right leg is shorter than his left leg.

His Christian upbringing shows influences in his films. As a young boy, Woo had wanted to be a Christian minister. He later found a passion for movies influenced by the French New Wave especially Jean-Pierre Melville. Woo has said he was shy and had difficulty speaking, but found making movies a way to explore his feelings and thinking and would &quot;use movies as a language&quot;.

Woo found respite in Bob Dylan and in American Westerns. He has stated the final scene of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; made a particular impression on him in his youth: the device of two comrades, each of whom fire pistols from each hand, is a recurrent spectacle later found in his own work.

== Career ==

===1969–1985: Career beginnings in Hong Kong===
In 1969, Woo was hired as a script supervisor at Cathay Studios. In 1971, he became an assistant director at Shaw Studios. The same year, he watched Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, which left a strong impression on him due to how different it was from earlier martial arts films. Lee&#x27;s films inspired Woo to direct his own action films. Woo worked as assistant director for some films directed by Chang Cheh during the 1970s, and took inspiration from Cheh&#x27;s work. His directorial debut in 1974 was the feature film &quot;The Young Dragons&quot; (鐵漢柔情, &quot;Tiě hàn róu qíng&quot;). In the kung fu film genre, it was choreographed by Jackie Chan. The film was picked up by Golden Harvest Studio, where he went on to direct more martial arts films. He later had success as a comedy director with &quot;Money Crazy&quot; (發錢寒, &quot;Fā qián hàn&quot;) (1977), starring Hong Kong comedian Ricky Hui and Richard Ng.

===1986–1992: &#x27;Heroic Bloodshed&#x27;, breakthrough and international recognition===
By the mid-1980s, Woo was experiencing occupational burnout. Several of his films were commercial disappointments, and he felt a distinct lack of creative control. It was during this period of self-imposed exile that director/producer Tsui Hark provided the funding for Woo to film a longtime pet project, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986). The story of two brothers—one a law enforcement officer, the other a criminal—was a financial blockbuster. &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; became a defining achievement in Hong Kong action cinema

&quot;John Woo: Interviews&quot; includes a 36-page interview with Woo by editor Robert K. Elder, which documents the years 1968 to 1990. It includes Woo&#x27;s early career in working on comedies, his work on kung fu films (during which time he gave Jackie Chan one of his first major film roles), and more recently, his gunpowder morality plays in Hong Kong.

===1993–2000: Move to the United States and international success===
An émigré in 1993, the director experienced difficulty in cultural adjustment while contracted with Universal Studios to direct Jean-Claude Van Damme in &quot;Hard Target&quot;. Like other foreign national film directors confronted with the Hollywood environment, Woo was unaccustomed to pervasive management concerns over matters such as limitations on violence and completion schedules. When initial cuts failed to yield an &quot;R&quot; rated film, the studio assumed control of the project and edited footage to produce a cut &quot;suitable for American audiences&quot;.

A three-year hiatus saw Woo next direct John Travolta and Christian Slater in &quot;Broken Arrow.&quot; A frenetic chase-themed film, the director once again found himself hampered by studio management and editorial concerns. Despite a larger budget than his previous &quot;Hard Target,&quot; the final feature lacked the trademark Woo style. Public reception saw modest financial success.

Reluctant to pursue projects which would necessarily entail front-office controls, the director cautiously rejected the script for &quot;Face/Off&quot; several times until it was rewritten to suit him. (The futuristic setting was changed to a contemporary one.) Paramount Pictures also offered the director significantly more freedom to exercise his speciality: emotional characterisation and elaborate action. A complex story of adversaries—each of whom surgically alters their identity—law enforcement agent John Travolta and terrorist Nicolas Cage play a cat-and-mouse game, trapped in each other&#x27;s outward appearance. &quot;Face/Off&quot; opened in 1997 to critical acclaim and strong attendance. Grosses in the United States exceeded $100 million. &quot;Face/Off&quot; was also nominated for an Academy Award in the category Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger) at the 70th Academy Awards.

Around this period, Woo would also produce and direct several film and TV projects. In 1996, Woo produced and directed &quot;Once a Thief&quot;, a Canadian made-for-television remake of Woo&#x27;s 1991 caper film. The teleplay subsequently spawned a television series of the same name, which Woo executive produced. In 1998, Woo directed &quot;Blackjack&quot;, which featured Dolph Lundgren as a leukophobic bodyguard who hunts down an assassin. The film was intended as a backdoor pilot for a television series, but was not picked up. That same year, Woo served as executive producer and action choreographer on Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;The Replacement Killers&quot;, which featured Chow Yun-Fat&#x27;s first international starring role.

Later, Woo directed &quot;&quot;, the second entry in the Tom Cruise-led . Despite receiving mixed reviews, &quot;Mission: Impossible 2&quot; grossed over $549 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000, as well as of Woo&#x27;s career.

===2001–2007: Decline in Hollywood and other ventures===
Woo made two additional films in Hollywood: &quot;Windtalkers&quot; (2002) and &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003), both of which fared poorly at the box office and were summarily dismissed by critics. Also in 2003, Woo directed a television pilot entitled &quot;The Robinsons: Lost in Space&quot; for The WB Television Network, based on the 1960s television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. The pilot was not purchased.

Woo also directed and produced the 2007 video game &quot;Stranglehold&quot;, which is a sequel to his 1992 film, &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;. The game features Woo as a multiplayer playable character. That same year he produced the anime movie, &quot;&quot;, the sequel to Shinji Aramaki&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;Appleseed&quot;.

=== 2008–2017: &quot;Red Cliff&quot; and return to Asian cinema ===
In 2008, Woo returned to Asian cinema with the completion of the two-part epic war film &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, based on a historical battle from &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. Produced on a grand scale, it is his first film in China since he emigrated from Hong Kong to the United States in 1993. Part 1 of the film was released throughout Asia in July 2008, to generally favourable reviews and strong attendance. Part 2 was released in China in January 2009.

John Woo was presented with a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2010.

He followed &quot;Red Cliff&quot; with another two-part film, &quot;The Crossing&quot;, in 2014 and 2015. Featuring an all-star cast, the four-hour epic tells the parallel stories of several characters who all ultimately find themselves passengers on the doomed Taiping steamer, which sank in 1949 en route from mainland China to Taiwan and has been described as &quot;China&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot;&quot;.

Following the box-office disappointment of &quot;The Crossing&quot;, Woo and producer Terence Chang disbanded Lion Rock Productions.

Woo followed up &quot;The Crossing&quot; with &quot;Manhunt&quot;, a remake of the 1976 Japanese crime thriller of the same name. Production started on &quot;Manhunt&quot; in June 2016 in Osaka and later reported to be finished filming by the end of November. The film, co-led by Chinese actor Zhang Hanyu and Japanese actor Masaharu Fukuyama, features a large Japanese cast including Yasuaki Kurata, Jun Kunimura, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Nanami Sakuraba, Naoto Takenaka and Tao Okamoto. In addition, Chinese actress Qi Wei, Korean actress Ha Ji-won and Woo&#x27;s daughter Angeles were cast in key roles in the film. The film was released in China on 24 November 2017.

=== 2021–present: &quot;Silent Night&quot; and return to Hollywood ===
Following another hiatus, Woo returned to Hollywood to direct the action thriller &quot;Silent Night&quot;, where a normal father heads into the underworld to avenge his young son&#x27;s death. Produced by Basil Iwanyk, the film starred Joel Kinnaman and was told entirely without dialogue. It was Woo&#x27;s first American feature film since &quot;Paycheck&quot; (2003).

Woo commented in 2015 that he would remake &quot;The Killer&quot; for American audiences. Initially, actress Lupita Nyong&#x27;o had been cast for the lead role, however by March 2023, Nathalie Emmanuel was cast instead, with Omar Sy joining the film as the cop character. The film was directed by Woo, produced by Universal Studios and released exclusively on Peacock.

In September 2024, Woo&#x27;s official Instagram account and the social media accounts of the duo Sparks all posted a photo of Woo with members Ron and Russell Mael, strongly hinting at collaborating on a &quot;new project&quot; which would not be an action film. The hashtag #xcrucior points to a musical Sparks have been developing with Focus Features as their follow-up to &quot;Annette&quot; and sought a director for. Woo has previously tried to get musical projects in production, and shares a love of French cinema and Jaques Demy&#x27;s &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; with the Mael brothers. He later confirmed it to be a &quot;half-musical&quot;.

===Unrealized film projects===
In May 2008, Woo announced in Cannes that his next movie would be &quot;1949&quot;, an epic love story set between the end of World War II and Chinese Civil War to the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the shooting of which would take place in China and Taiwan. Its production was due to begin by the end of 2008, with a theatrical release planned in December 2009. However, in early April 2009, the film was cancelled due to script right issues. Reports indicated that Woo might be working on another World War II film, this time about the American Volunteer Group, or the Flying Tigers. The movie was tentatively titled &quot;Flying Tiger Heroes&quot; and Woo is reported as saying it will feature &quot;The most spectacular aerial battle scenes ever seen in Chinese cinema.&quot; It was not clear whether Woo would not be directing the earlier war film, or whether it was put on the back burner. Woo has stated that Flying Tiger Heroes would be an &quot;extremely important production&quot; and will &quot;emphasise US-Chinese friendship and the contributions of the Flying Tigers and the Yunnan people during the war of resistance.&quot; Woo has announced he will be using IMAX cameras to film the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; project. &quot;It has always been a dream of mine to explore shooting with IMAX cameras and to work in the IMAX format, and the strong visual element of this film is incredibly well-suited to the tastes of cinemagoers today [...] Using IMAX for Flying Tigers would create a new experience for the audience, and I think it would be another breakthrough for Chinese movies&quot;.

==Personal life==
Woo has been married to Annie Woo Ngau Chun-lung since 1976. They have two daughters, Kimberley Woo, Angeles Woo, and a son Frank Woo. He is a Christian and told BBC in an interview that he believes in God and has utmost admiration for Jesus, whom he calls a &quot;great philosopher&quot;.

His three favorite films are David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; and Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;. A complete list of his 48 inspirational films was published in May 2018. As of July 2024, Woo is the only filmmaker who has listed &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; by David Lean and &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; by Michael Cacoyannis as favorites on LaCinetek, a French website that collects and publishes lists from film directors.

<text>Japan is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, it is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and thousands of smaller islands, covering . Japan has a population of over 123 million as of 2025, making it the eleventh-most populous country. 

The capital of Japan and its largest city is Tokyo; the Greater Tokyo Area is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37 million inhabitants as of 2024. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. About three-quarters of the country&#x27;s terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains. The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making its islands prone to destructive earthquakes and tsunamis. 

The first known habitation of the archipelago dates to the Upper Paleolithic, with the beginning Japanese Paleolithic dating to . Between the fourth and sixth centuries, its kingdoms were united under an emperor in Nara, and later Heian-kyō. From the 12th century, actual power was held by military dictators () and feudal lords (), and enforced by warrior nobility (&quot;samurai&quot;). After rule by the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates and a century of warring states, Japan was unified in 1600 by the Tokugawa shogunate, which implemented an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, Japan pursued rapid industrialization and modernization, as well as militarism and overseas colonization. In 1937, Japan invaded China, and in 1941 attacked the United States and European colonial powers, entering World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under Allied occupation. Afterwards, the country underwent rapid economic growth and became a major non-NATO ally of the United States.

Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet. A great power and the only Asian member of the G7, Japan has constitutionally renounced its right to declare war, but maintains one of the world&#x27;s strongest militaries. A developed country with one of the world&#x27;s largest economies by nominal GDP, Japan is a global leader in the automotive, robotics, and electronics industries, and has made significant contributions to science and technology. It has one of the world&#x27;s highest life expectancies, though it is undergoing a population decline. Japan&#x27;s culture is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, film, music, and popular culture, which includes prominent animation, comics, and video game industries.
==Etymology==

The name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji and is pronounced or . Before was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as (, changed in Japan around 757 to ) and in Japan by the endonym . , the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps. is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters mean &quot;sun origin&quot;, which is the source of the popular Western epithet &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;.

The name &quot;Japan&quot; is based on Min or Wu Chinese pronunciations of and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the Early Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of the characters as . The old Malay name for Japan, or , was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as &quot;Giapan&quot; in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.

==History==

===Prehistoric to classical history===

Modern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic. This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The Japonic-speaking Yayoi people entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, intermingling with the Jōmon; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.

Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese &quot;Book of Han&quot;, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).

In 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.

The Nara period (710–784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the (712) and (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan&#x27;s population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and the lyrics of Japan&#x27;s national anthem were written during this time.

===Feudal era===

Japan&#x27;s feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo&#x27;s death, the Hōjō clan came to power as regents for the . The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336–1573). The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords () and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (&quot;Warring States&quot;).

During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other ; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi–Momoyama period. After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.

Tokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi&#x27;s son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed by Emperor Go-Yōzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including , as a code of conduct to control the autonomous , and in 1639 the isolationist (&quot;closed country&quot;) policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603–1868). Modern Japan&#x27;s economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences () continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki. The Edo period gave rise to (&quot;national studies&quot;), the study of Japan by the Japanese.

===Modern era===

The United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four &quot;Black Ships&quot; in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji period (1868–1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed state in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin, and annexed Korea in 1910. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.

The early 20th century saw a period of Taishō democracy (1912–1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and China in 1920. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded China and occupied Manchuria, which led to the establishment of puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations in 1933. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis powers.

The Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7–8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific. Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan millions of lives and its colonies, including &quot;de jure&quot; parts of Japan such as Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto, and the Kurils. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese Empire and its influence over the territories it conquered. The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders except the Emperor for Japanese war crimes.

In 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the world&#x27;s second-largest economy at that time; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the &quot;Lost Decade&quot;. In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history—the Tōhoku earthquake—triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the era.

==Geography==
Japan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over northeast–southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea. The country&#x27;s five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. , Japan&#x27;s territory is . Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at . Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone is the eighth-largest in the world, covering .

The Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural. The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation. Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country even without considering that local concentration. Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) , while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 . , approximately 0.5% of Japan&#x27;s total area is reclaimed land (). Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country&#x27;s largest freshwater lake.

Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index. Japan has 111 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century; the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.

===Climate===
The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.

In the Sea of Japan region on Honshu&#x27;s west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the Foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.

The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere. The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, , was recorded on July 23, 2018, and repeated on August 17, 2020.

===Biodiversity===

Japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ryūkyū and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife , including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. There are 53 Ramsar wetland sites in Japan. Five sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.

===Environment===
In the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan&#x27;s lack of natural resources.

Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a country&#x27;s commitment to environmental sustainability. Japan is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. In 2020, the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050. Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.

==Government and politics==
Japan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.
Japan&#x27;s legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. Shigeru Ishiba is Japan&#x27;s prime minister; he took office after winning the 2024 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election. The broadly conservative Liberal Democratic Party has been the dominant party in the country since the 1950s, often called the 1955 System.

Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as . Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post–World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan&#x27;s court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.

===Administrative divisions===

Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:


===Foreign relations===
A member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 countries seeking reform of the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and &quot;ASEAN Plus Three&quot;, and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. It is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014. In 2024, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world.

Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan. In 2016, Japan announced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision, which frames its regional policies. Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (&quot;the Quad&quot;), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India. 

Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia&#x27;s control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea&#x27;s control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.

===Military===
Japan is the third highest-ranked Asian country in the 2024 Global Peace Index. It spent 1.1% of its total GDP on its defence budget in 2022, and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2022. The country&#x27;s military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan&#x27;s right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan&#x27;s military since World War II.

The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines. In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida further confirmed this trend, instructing the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.

===Law enforcement===
Domestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads. The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.

The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics , the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.

=== Human rights ===

Japanese society traditionally places a strong emphasis on collective harmony and conformity, which has led to the suppression of individual rights. Japan&#x27;s constitution prohibits racial and religious discrimination, and the country is a signatory to numerous international human rights treaties. However, it lacks any laws against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity and does not have a national human rights institution. 

Japan has faced criticism for its gender inequality, not allowing same-sex marriages, use of racial profiling by police, and allowing capital punishment. Other human rights issues include the treatment of marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, refugees and asylum seekers.

==Economy==
Japan has the world&#x27;s fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China and Germany; and the fifth-largest economy by PPP-adjusted GDP. , Japan&#x27;s labor force is the world&#x27;s eighth-largest, consisting of over 68.6 million workers. , Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%. Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 countries, and exceeds 15.7% of the population. Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies, with a national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP . The Japanese yen is the world&#x27;s third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.

Japan was the world&#x27;s fifth-largest exporter and fourth-largest importer in 2022. Its exports amounted to 18.2% of its total GDP in 2021. In 2022, Japan&#x27;s main export markets were China (23.9 percent, including Hong Kong) and the United States (18.5 percent). Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts. Japan&#x27;s main import markets in 2022 were China (21.1 percent), the United States (9.9 percent), and Australia (9.8 percent). Japan&#x27;s main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.

The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment. Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world&#x27;s ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative . It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. Japan ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report in 2019. It attracted 31.9 million international tourists in 2019, and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism. The 2021 &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report&quot; ranked Japan first in the world out of 117 countries. Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1 billion.

===Agriculture and fishery===
The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the country&#x27;s total GDP . Only 11.5% of Japan&#x27;s land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world&#x27;s highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% . Japan&#x27;s small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected. There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.

Japan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. Japan maintains one of the world&#x27;s largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting critiques that Japan&#x27;s fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.

===Industry and services ===
Japan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the &quot;largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods&quot;. Japan&#x27;s industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. The country&#x27;s manufacturing output is the fourth highest in the world .

Japan is in the top three globally for both automobile production and export, and is home to Toyota, the world&#x27;s largest automobile company by production. The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces increasing competition from its East Asian neighbors, South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.

Once considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China. However, Japan&#x27;s video game sector remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan&#x27;s consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming. By 2015, Japan had become the world&#x27;s fourth-largest PC game market by revenue, behind only China, the United States, and South Korea.

Japan&#x27;s service sector accounts for about 69.5% of its total economic output . Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, Aeon, SoftBank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.

===Science and technology===

Relative to gross domestic product, Japan&#x27;s research and development budget is the sixth or seventh highest in the world, with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget . Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees. The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, and three Fields medalists.

Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 45% of the world&#x27;s 2020 total; down from 55% in 2017.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan&#x27;s national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibō) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe &quot;Akatsuki&quot; was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015. Japan&#x27;s plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon&#x27;s origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Japan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s. The country has approximately of roads made up of of city, town and village roads, of prefectural roads, of general national highways and of national expressways .

Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.

There are 175 airports in Japan . The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia&#x27;s second-busiest airport in 2019. The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively .

===Energy===
, 37.1% of energy in Japan is produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010. By May 2012 all of the country&#x27;s nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy. The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.

==Demographics==
Japan has a population of almost 125 million, of whom nearly 122 million are Japanese nationals (2022 estimates). A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder. 
Japan is the world&#x27;s fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population; this is the result of a post–World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates. Japan has a total fertility rate of 1.4, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world&#x27;s lowest; it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world. , over 28.7 percent of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population. As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless, Japan&#x27;s population is expected to drop to around 88 million by 2065.

The changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits. The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation&#x27;s aging population. On April 1, 2019, Japan&#x27;s revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.

In 2022, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9 million (2022). It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 37.4 million people (2024). Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, with the Japanese people forming 97.4% of the country&#x27;s population. Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan&#x27;s small minority groups. &quot;Burakumin&quot; make up a social minority group.

===Languages===
The Japanese language is Japan&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language, and is a compulsory subject at the junior and senior high school levels. Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.

Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining . Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.

===Religion===
Japan&#x27;s constitution guarantees full religious freedom. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96% of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual. The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.

Today, 1% to 1.5% of the population are Christians. Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine&#x27;s Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.

About 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants . there are an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals. Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Baháʼí Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.

===Education===

Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years. Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The top-ranking university in the country is the University of Tokyo. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math, and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world&#x27;s highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. It spent 7.4% of its total GDP on education in 2021. In 2021, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 55.6%. Approximately 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, with bachelor&#x27;s degrees being held by 34.2% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. Japanese women are more highly educated than the men: 59 percent of women possess a university degree, compared to 52 percent of men.

===Health===
Health care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.

Japan spent 10.82% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2021. In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 85 years (82 years for men and 88 years for women), the highest in the world; while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births). Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018—followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths. Japan has one of the world&#x27;s highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue. Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men. Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.

==Culture==
Contemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords, and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha, and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance. Japan is considered a cultural superpower.

===Art and architecture===

The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.

Japanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design. It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzō Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.

===Literature and philosophy===
The earliest works of Japanese literature include the and chronicles and the poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as &quot;kana&quot; (hiragana and katakana) was developed. &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; by Sei Shōnagon, while &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world&#x27;s first novel.

During the Edo period, the chōnin (&quot;townspeople&quot;) overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bashō revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinshū with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume Sōseki and Mori Ōgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Kafū Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors – Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzaburō Ōe (1994).

Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.

===Performing arts===
Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture. Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.

The four traditional theaters from Japan are &quot;noh&quot;, &quot;kyōgen&quot;, &quot;kabuki&quot;, and &quot;bunraku&quot;. Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.

Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world .

Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally. Ishirō Honda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of &quot;kaiju&quot; films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide. A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry. Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular globally.

<text>Japan is an archipelagic country comprising a stratovolcanic archipelago over along the Pacific coast of East Asia. It consists of 14,125 islands. The four main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. The other 14,120 islands are classified as &quot;remote islands&quot; by the Japanese government. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main islands.

The territory covers . It is the fourth-largest island country in the world and the largest island country in East Asia. The country has the 6th longest coastline at and the 8th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of in the world.

The terrain is mostly rugged and mountainous, with 66% forest. The population is clustered in urban areas along the coast, plains, and valleys. Japan is located in the northwestern Ring of Fire on multiple tectonic plates. East of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches. The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and stratovolcanoes. The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan, and separated it from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.

The climate varies from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical and tropical rainforests in the south. These differences in climate and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse flora and fauna, with some rare endemic species, especially in the Ogasawara Islands.

Japan extends from 20° to 45° north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122° to 153° east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima). Japan is surrounded by seas. To the north, the Sea of Okhotsk separates it from the Russian Far East; to the west, the Sea of Japan separates it from the Korean Peninsula; to the southwest, the East China Sea separates the Ryukyu Islands from China and Taiwan; to the east is the Pacific Ocean.


The Japanese archipelago is over long in a north-to-southwardly direction from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Philippine Sea in the Pacific Ocean. It is narrow, and no point in Japan is more than from the sea. In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands. The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands. This includes the Bonin Islands, Daitō Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanpō Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited. The Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan but disputed by China. This excludes the disputed Northern Territories (Kuril Islands) and Liancourt Rocks. In total, as of 2021, Japan&#x27;s territory is , of which is land and is water. Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (). It is the largest island country in East Asia and the fourth largest island country in the world.

Because of Japan&#x27;s many far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine life and mineral resources in the ocean. The Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan covers and is the 8th largest in the world. It is more than 11 times the land area of the country. The Exclusive Economic Zone stretches from the baseline out to from its coast. Its territorial sea is , but between in the international straits—La Pérouse (or Sōya Strait), Tsugaru Strait, Ōsumi, and Tsushima Strait.

Japan has a population of 126 million in 2019. It is the 11th most populous country in the world and the second most populous island country. 81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture, and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanpō Islands.

==Map of Japan==


Japan is formally divided into eight regions, from northeast (Hokkaidō) to southwest (Ryukyu Islands):
* Hokkaidō
* Tōhoku region
* Kantō region
* Chūbu region
* Kansai (or Kinki) region
* Chūgoku region
* Shikoku
* Kyūshū

Each region contains several prefectures, except the Hokkaido region, which comprises only Hokkaido Prefecture.

The regions are not official administrative units but have been traditionally used as the regional division of Japan in a number of contexts. For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions; weather reports usually give the weather by region; and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name (Kinki Nippon Railway, Chūgoku Bank, Tohoku University, etc.). While Japan has eight High Courts, their jurisdictions do not correspond with the eight regions.

==Composition, topography and geography==
About 73% of Japan is mountainous, with a mountain range running through each of the main islands. Japan&#x27;s highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of . Japan&#x27;s forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.

Since there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. Hot springs are numerous and have been exploited by the leisure industry.

The Geospatial Information Authority of Japan measures Japan&#x27;s territory annually in order to continuously grasp the state of the national land. As of July 1, 2021, Japan&#x27;s territory is . It increases in area due to volcanic eruptions such as Nishinoshima (西之島), the natural expansion of the islands, and land reclamation.

This table shows land use in 2002.

===Location===
The Japanese archipelago is relatively far away from the Asian continent. Kyushu is closest to the southernmost point of the Korean peninsula, with a distance of , which is almost six times farther away than from England to France across the English Channel. Thus, historically, Kyushu was the gateway between Asia and Japan. China is separated by of sea from Japan&#x27;s big main islands. Hokkaido is near Sakhalin, which was occupied by Japan from 1905 to 1945. Most of the population lives on the Pacific coast of Honshū. The west coast facing the Sea of Japan is less densely populated.

The Japanese archipelago has been difficult to reach since ancient history. During the Paleolithic period around 20,000 BCE, at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a land bridge between Hokkaido and Sakhalin that linked Japan with the Asian continent. The land bridge disappeared when sea levels rose in the Jōmon period around 10,000 BCE.

Japan&#x27;s remote location, surrounded by vast seas, rugged, mountainous terrain, and steep rivers, makes it secure against invaders and uncontrolled migration from the Asian continent. The Japanese can close their civilization with an isolationist foreign policy. During the Edo period, the Tokugawa Shogunate enforced the Sakoku policy, which prohibited most foreign contact and trade from 1641 to 1853. In modern times, the inflow of people is managed via seaports and airports. Thus, Japan is fairly insulated from continental issues.

Throughout history, Japan has never been fully invaded or colonized by other countries. The Mongols tried to invade Japan twice and failed in 1274 and 1281. Japan capitulated only once after nuclear attacks in World War II. At the time, Japan did not have nuclear technology. The insular geography is a major factor in the isolationist, semi-open, and expansionist periods of Japanese history.

===Mountains and volcanoes===
The mountainous islands of the Japanese archipelago form a crescent off the eastern coast of Asia. They are separated from the continent by the Sea of Japan, which serves as a protective barrier. Japan has 108 active volcanoes (10% of the world&#x27;s active volcanoes) because of active plate tectonics in the Ring of Fire.

Around 15 million years ago, the volcanic shoreline of the Asian continent was pushed out into a series of volcanic island arcs. This created the &quot;back-arc basins&quot; known as the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk with the formal shaping of the Japanese archipelago. The archipelago also has summits on mountain ridges that were uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf. About 73 percent of Japan&#x27;s area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent. A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves: the &quot;face&quot;, facing the Pacific Ocean, and the &quot;back&quot;, toward the Sea of Japan. On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.

Central Japan is marked by the convergence of the three mountain chains—the Hida, Kiso, and Akaishi mountains—that form the Japanese Alps (&quot;Nihon Arupusu&quot;), several of whose peaks are higher than . The highest point in the Japanese Alps is Mount Kita at . The highest point in the country is Mount Fuji (Fujisan, also erroneously called Fujiyama), a volcano dormant since 1707 that rises to above sea level in Shizuoka Prefecture. On the Sea of Japan side are plateaus and low mountain districts, with altitudes of 500 to 1,500 meters.

===Plains===
There are three major plains in central Honshū. The largest is the Kantō Plain, which covers in the Kantō region. The capital Tokyo and the largest metropolitan population are located there. The second largest plain in Honshū is the Nōbi Plain (), with the third-most-populous urban area being Nagoya. The third-largest plain in Honshū is the Osaka Plain, which covers in the Kinki region. It features the second-largest urban area of Osaka (part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area). Osaka and Nagoya extend inland from their bays until they reach steep mountains. The Osaka Plain is connected with Kyoto and Nara. Kyoto is located in the Yamashiro Basin () and Nara is in the Nara Basin ().

The Kantō Plain, Osaka Plain, and Nōbi Plain are the most important economic, political, and cultural areas of Japan. These plains had the largest agricultural production and large bays with ports for fishing and trade. This made them the largest population centers. Kyoto and Nara are the ancient capitals and cultural heart of Japan. The Kantō Plain became Japan&#x27;s center of power because it is the largest plain with a central location, and historically, it had the most agricultural production that could be taxed. The Tokugawa Shogunate established a &quot;bakufu&quot; in Edo in 1603. This evolved into the capital of Tokyo by 1868.

Hokkaido has multiple plains, such as the Ishikari Plain (), Tokachi Plain (), the Kushiro Plain, the largest wetland in Japan (), and the Sarobetsu Plain (). There are many farms that produce a plethora of agricultural products. The average farm size in Hokkaido was 26 hectares per farmer in 2013. That is nearly 11 times larger than the national average of 2.4 hectares. This made Hokkaido the most agriculturally rich prefecture in Japan. Nearly one-fourth of Japan&#x27;s arable land and 22% of Japan&#x27;s forests are in Hokkaido.

Another important plain is the Sendai Plain around the city of Sendai in northeastern Honshū. Many of these plains are along the coast, and their areas have been increased by land reclamation throughout recorded history.

===Rivers===

Rivers are generally steep and swift, and few are suitable for navigation except in their lower reaches. Although most rivers are less than in length, their rapid flow from the mountains is what provides hydroelectric power. Seasonal variations in flow have led to the extensive development of flood control measures. The longest, the Shinano River, which winds through Nagano Prefecture to Niigata Prefecture and flows into the Sea of Japan, is long.

These are the 10 longest rivers of Japan.

===Lakes and coasts===

The largest freshwater lake is Lake Biwa (), northeast of Kyoto in Shiga Prefecture. Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and is estimated to be the 13th oldest lake in the world, dating to at least 4 million years ago. It has consistently carried water for millions of years. Lake Biwa was created by plate tectonics in an active rift zone. This created a very deep lake with a maximum depth of . Thus, it is not naturally filled with sediment. Over the course of millions of years, a diverse ecosystem evolved in the lake. It has more than 1,000 species and subspecies. There are 46 native fish species and subspecies, including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic. Approximately 5,000 water birds visit the lake each year.

The following are the 10 largest lakes of Japan.


Extensive coastal shipping, especially around the Seto Inland Sea, compensates for the lack of navigable rivers. The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors. The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaidō, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 765 km2 of tidal flats in Japan, making it the 35th-ranked country in terms of tidal flat extent.

===Land reclamation===
The Japanese archipelago has been transformed by humans into a sort of continuous land, in which the four main islands are entirely reachable and passable by rail and road transportation thanks to the construction of huge bridges and tunnels that connect each other and various islands.

Approximately 0.5% of Japan&#x27;s total area is reclaimed land (&quot;umetatechi&quot;). It began in the 12th century. Land was reclaimed from the sea and from river deltas by building dikes, drainage, and rice paddies on terraces carved into mountainsides. The majority of land reclamation projects occurred after World War II, during the Japanese economic miracle. Reclamation of 80% to 90% of all the tidal flatland was done. Large land reclamation projects with landfills were done in coastal areas for maritime and industrial factories, such as Higashi Ogishima in Kawasaki, Osaka Bay, and Nagasaki Airport. Port Island, Rokkō Island, and Kobe Airport were built in Kobe. Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, and Wakayama Marina City. The village of Ōgata in Akita was established on land reclaimed from Lake Hachirōgata (Japan&#x27;s second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totaled .

Examples of land reclamation in Japan include:
* Kyogashima, Kobe – the first human-made island built by Taira no Kiyomori in 1173
* The Hibiya Inlet, Tokyo – the first large-scale reclamation project started in 1592
* Dejima, Nagasaki – built during Japan&#x27;s national isolation period in 1634. It was the sole trading post in Japan during the Sakoku period and was originally inhabited by Portuguese and then Dutch traders.
* Tokyo Bay, Japan – artificial island (2007)
** This includes the entirety of Odaiba, a series of island forts constructed to protect Tokyo from sea attacks (1853).
* Kobe, Japan – (1995).
* Isahaya Bay in the Ariake Sea – approximately is reclaimed with tide embankment and sluice gates (2018).
* Yumeshima, Osaka – artificial island (2025)
* Central Breakwater – 
Much reclaimed land is made up of landfill waste materials, dredged earth, sand, sediment, sludge, and soil removed from construction sites. It is used to build human-made islands in harbors and embankments in inland areas. On November 8, 2011, Tokyo City began accepting rubble and waste from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami region. This rubble was processed, and when it had the appropriate radiation levels, it was used as a landfill to build new artificial islands in Tokyo Bay. Yamashita Park in Yokohama City was made with rubble from the great Kantō earthquake in 1923.

There is a risk of contamination on artificial islands with landfills and reclaimed land if there was industry that spilled toxic chemicals into the ground. For example, the artificial island of Toyosu was once occupied by a Tokyo gas factory. Toxic substances were discovered in the soil and groundwater at Toyosu. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government spent an additional 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to pump out groundwater by digging hundreds of wells. In June 2017, plans to move the Tsukiji fish market were restarted but delayed from July to the autumn of 2018. After the new site was declared safe following a cleanup operation, Toyosu Market was opened.

==Oceanography and seabed of Japan==
Japan&#x27;s sea territory is . Japan ranks fourth with its exclusive economic zone ocean water volume from 0 to depth. Japan ranks fifth with a sea volume of 2,000–3,000 meters, fourth with 3,000–4,000 meters, third with 4,000–5,000 meters, and first with a volume of 5,000 to over 6,000 meters. The relief map of the Japanese archipelago shows that 50% of Japan&#x27;s sea territory has an ocean volume between 0 and deep. The other 50% has a depth of to over . 19% has a depth of 0 to . Thus, Japan possesses one of the largest ocean territories with a combination of all depths, from shallow to very deep. Multiple long undersea mountain ranges stretch from Japan&#x27;s main islands to the south. They occasionally reach above the sea surface as islands. East of the undersea mountain ranges are three oceanic trenches: the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench (max depth ), Japan Trench (max depth ), and Izu–Ogasawara Trench (max depth ).

There are large quantities of marine life and mineral resources in the ocean and seabed of Japan. At a depth of over , there are minerals such as manganese nodules, cobalt in the crust, and hydrothermal deposits.

==Geology==

===Tectonic plates===
The Japanese archipelago is the result of subducting tectonic plates over several 100 million years, from the mid-Silurian (443.8 Mya) to the Pleistocene (11,700 years ago). Approximately of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese archipelago in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted. It is considered a mature island arc.

The islands of Japan were created by tectonic plate movements:
* Tohoku (upper half of Honshu), Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, and Sakhalin are located on the Okhotsk Plate. This is a minor tectonic plate bounded to the north by the North American Plate. The Okhotsk Plate is bounded on the east by the Pacific Plate at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the Japan Trench. It is bounded on the south by the Philippine Sea Plate at the Nankai Trough. On the west, it is bound by the Eurasian Plate, and possibly on the southwest, by the Amurian Plate. The northeastern boundary is the Ulakhan Fault.
* The southern half of Honshu, Shikoku, and most of Kyushu are located on the Amurian Plate.
* The southern tip of Kyushu and the Ryukyu islands are located on the Okinawa Plate.
* The Nanpō Islands are on the Philippine Sea Plate.

The Pacific Plate and Philippine Sea Plate are subduction plates. They are deeper than the Eurasian plate. The Philippine Sea Plate moves beneath the continental Amurian Plate and the Okinawa Plate to the south. The Pacific Plate moves under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. These subduction plates pulled Japan eastward and opened the Sea of Japan by back-arc spreading around 15 million years ago. The Strait of Tartary and the Korea Strait opened much later. La Pérouse Strait formed about 60,000 to 11,000 years ago, closing the path used by mammoths, which had earlier moved to northern Hokkaido. The eastern margin of the Sea of Japan is an incipient subduction zone consisting of thrust faults that formed from the compression and reactivation of old faults involved in earlier rifting.

The subduction zone is where the oceanic crust slides beneath the continental crust or other oceanic plates. This is because the oceanic plate&#x27;s litosphere has a higher density. Subduction zones are sites that usually have a high rate of volcanism and earthquakes. Additionally, subduction zones develop belts of deformation. The subduction zones on the east side of the Japanese archipelago cause frequent low-intensity earth tremors. Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis occur several times per century. It is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Northeastern Japan, north of the Tanakura fault, had high volcanic activity 14–17 million years before the present.

=== Median Tectonic Line ===
The Japan Median Tectonic Line (MTL) is Japan&#x27;s longest fault system. The MTL begins near Ibaraki Prefecture, where it connects with the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) and the Fossa Magna. It runs parallel to Japan&#x27;s volcanic arc, passing through central Honshū to near Nagoya, through Mikawa Bay, then through the Seto Inland Sea from the Kii Channel and Naruto Strait to Shikoku along the Sadamisaki Peninsula and the Bungo Channel and Hōyo Strait to Kyūshū.

The MTL moves right-lateral strike-slip at about 5–10 millimeters per year. The sense of motion is consistent with the direction of the Nankai Trough&#x27;s oblique convergence. The rate of motion on the MTL is much less than the rate of convergence at the plate boundary. This makes it difficult to distinguish the motion on the MTL from interseismic elastic straining in GPS data.

===Oceanic trenches===
East of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches.
* The Kuril–Kamchatka Trench is in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It lies off the southeast coast of Kamchatka and parallels the Kuril Island chain to meet the Japan Trench east of Hokkaido.
* The Japan Trench extends from the Kuril Islands to the northern end of the Izu Islands. Its deepest part is . The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The subduction process causes bending of the down-going plate, creating a deep trench. Continuous movement on the subduction zone associated with the Japan Trench is one of the main causes of tsunamis and earthquakes in northern Japan, including the megathrust 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The rate of subduction associated with the Japan Trench has been recorded at about /year.
* The Izu–Ogasawara Trench is south of the Japan Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. It consists of the Izu Trench (at the north) and the Bonin Trench (at the south, west of the Ogasawara Plateau). It stretches to the northernmost section of the Mariana Trench. The Izu–Ogasawara Trench is an extension of the Japan Trench. There, the Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, creating the Izu Islands and Bonin Islands on the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc system.

===Composition===
The Japanese islands are formed of the mentioned geological units parallel to the subduction front. The parts of islands facing the Pacific Plate are typically younger and display a larger proportion of volcanic products, while island parts facing the Sea of Japan are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In northwest Japan, there are thick quaternary deposits. This makes the determination of the geological history and composition difficult, and it is not yet fully understood.

The Japanese island arc system has distributed volcanic series where the volcanic rocks change from tholeiite—calc-alkaline—alkaline with increasing distance from the trench. The geologic province of Japan is mostly basin and has a bit of extended crust.

==Growing archipelago==
The Japanese archipelago grows gradually because of perpetual tectonic plate movements, earthquakes, stratovolcanoes, and land reclamation in the Ring of Fire.

For example, during the 20th century, several new volcanoes emerged, including Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. The 1914 Sakurajima eruption produced lava flows that connected the former island with the Ōsumi Peninsula in Kyushu. It is the most active volcano in Japan.

During the 2013 eruption southeast of Nishinoshima, a new, unnamed volcanic island emerged from the sea. Erosion and shifting sands caused the new island to merge with Nishinoshima. A 1911 survey determined the caldera was at its deepest.

The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami caused portions of northeastern Japan to shift by closer to North America. This made some sections of Japan&#x27;s landmass wider than before. The areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. A stretch of coastline dropped vertically by , allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land. On 6 April, the Japanese coast guard said that the earthquake shifted the seabed near the epicenter and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by . A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in &quot;Science&quot; on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved east-southeast and rose about as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area.

==Sea of Japan==


===History===
During the Pleistocene (spanning 2.58 million-11,700 years ago) glacial cycles, the Japanese islands may have occasionally been connected to the Eurasian Continent via the Korea Strait and the Korean Peninsula or Sakhalin. The Sea of Japan was considered to be a frozen inner lake because of the lack of the warm Tsushima Current. Various plants and large animals, such as the elephant &quot;Palaeoloxodon naumanni,&quot; migrated into the Japanese archipelago.

The Sea of Japan was a landlocked sea when the land bridge of East Asia existed circa 18,000 BCE. During the glacial maximum, the marine elevation was 200 meters lower than present. Thus, Tsushima island in the Korea Strait was a land bridge that connected Kyushu and the southern tip of Honshu with the Korean peninsula. There were still several kilometers of sea to the west of the Ryukyu islands, and most of the Sea of Japan was open sea with a mean depth of . Comparatively, most of the Yellow Sea (Yellow Plane) had a semi-arid climate (dry steppe) because it was relatively shallow, with a mean depth of . The Korean Peninsula was landlocked on the entire west and south sides of the Yellow Plane. The onset of the formation of the Japan Arc was in the Early Miocene (23 million years ago). The Early Miocene period was when the Sea of Japan started to open and the northern and southern parts of the Japanese archipelago separated from each other. The Sea of Japan expanded during the Miocene.

The northern part of the Japanese archipelago was further fragmented until the orogenesis of the northeastern Japanese archipelago began in the Late Miocene. The orogenesis of the high mountain ranges in northeastern Japan started in the Late Miocene and lasted into the Pliocene. The southern part of the Japanese archipelago remained a relatively large landmass. The land area expanded northward during the Miocene.

During the advance of the last Ice Age, the world sea level dropped. This dried up and closed the exit straits of the Sea of Japan one by one. The deepest, and thus the last to close, was the western channel of the Korea Strait. There is controversy as to whether the Sea of Japan became a huge, cold inland lake. The Japanese archipelago had a taiga biome (open boreal woodlands). It was characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces, and larches. Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril islands had mammoth steppe biome (steppe-tundra). The vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs, and willow shrubs.

===Present===
The Sea of Japan has a surface area of , a mean depth of , and a maximum depth of . It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from southwest to northeast and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about , with the largest part () belonging to Russia. The sea extends from north to south for more than and has a maximum width of about .

There are three major basins: the Yamato Basin in the southeast, the Japan Basin in the north, and the Tsushima Basin in the southwest. The Japan Basin has an oceanic crust and is the deepest part of the sea, whereas the Tsushima Basin is the shallowest, with depths below . The Yamato Basin and Tsushima Basin have thick oceanic crusts. The continental shelves of the sea are wide on the eastern shores of Japan. On the western shores, they are narrow, particularly along the Korean and Russian coasts, averaging about .

The geographical location of the Japanese archipelago has defined the Sea of Japan for millions of years. Without the Japanese archipelago, it would just be the Pacific Ocean. The term has been the international standard since at least the early 19th century. In 2012, the International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for naming bodies of water around the world, recognized the term &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; as the only title for the sea.

==Ocean currents==
The Japanese archipelago is surrounded by eight ocean currents.
* The is a warm, north-flowing ocean current on the west side of the Ryukyu Islands and along the east coast of Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu. It is a strong western boundary current and part of the North Pacific ocean gyre.
* The Kuroshio Current starts on the east coast of Luzon, Philippines, past Taiwan, and flows northeastward past Japan, where it merges with the easterly drift of the North Pacific Current. It transports warm, tropical water northward toward the polar region. The Kuroshio extension is a northward continuation of the Kuroshio Current in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The Kuroshio countercurrent flows southward to the east of the Kuroshio current in the Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea.
** The winter-spawning Japanese Flying Squid are associated with the Kuroshio Current. The eggs and larvae develop during winter in the East China Sea, and the adults travel with minimum energy via the Kuroshio Current to the rich northern feeding grounds near northwestern Honshu and Hokkaido.
* The is a branch of the Kuroshio Current. It flows along the west coast of Kyushu and Honshu into the Sea of Japan.
* The current is a cold subarctic ocean current that flows southward and circulates counterclockwise along the east coast of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu in the western North Pacific Ocean. The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the Arctic Ocean and flow southward via the Bering Sea, passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk. It collides with the Kuroshio Current off the eastern shore of Japan to form the North Pacific Current. The nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the that provides for and nurtures marine organisms.
* The Liman Current is a southward-flowing cold ocean current that flows from the Strait of Tartary along the Asian continent in the Sea of Japan.
* The originates when the Tsushima Current is divided in two as it flows through the west entrance of the Tsugaru Strait, and along the La Perouse Strait at the north coast of Hokkaido it becomes the . The flow rate is 1 to 3 knots. There is a relatively stronger flow in the summer than in the winter.

==Natural resources==
===Land resources===
There are small deposits of coal, oil, iron, and minerals in the Japanese archipelago. Japan is scarce in critical natural resources and has long been heavily dependent on imported energy and raw materials. The oil crisis in 1973 encouraged the efficient use of energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency. In regards to agricultural products, the self-sufficiency rate of most items is less than 100%, except for rice. Rice has 100% food self-sufficiency. This makes it difficult to meet Japan&#x27;s food demand without imports.

===Marine resources===
The exclusive economic zone of Japan has an estimated large quantity of mineral resources such as methane clathrate, natural gas, metallic minerals, and rare-earth mineral reserves. Seabed mineral resources such as manganese nodules, cobalt-rich crust, and submarine hydrothermal deposits are located at depths over . Most of these deep-sea resources are unexplored at the seabed. Japan&#x27;s mining law restricts offshore oil and gas production. There are technological hurdles to mine at such extreme depths and to limit the ecological impact. There are no successful commercial ventures that mine the deep sea yet. So currently, there are few deep sea mining projects to retrieve minerals or deepwater drilling on the ocean floor.

It is estimated that there are approximately 40 trillion cubic feet of methane clathrate in the eastern Nankai Trough of Japan. As of 2019, the methane clathrate in the deep sea remains unexploited because the necessary technology has not been established yet. This is why, currently, Japan has very limited proven reserves like crude oil.

The Kantō region alone is estimated to have over 400 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves. It forms a Minami Kantō gas field in the area spanning Saitama, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Ibaraki, and Chiba prefectures. However, mining is strictly regulated in many areas because it is directly below Tokyo and is only slightly mined on the Bōsō Peninsula. In Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, there have been frequent accidents with natural gas that was released naturally from the Minami Kantō gas field.

In 2018, south of Minami-Tori-shima at deep, approximately 16 million tons of rare-earth minerals were discovered by JAMSTEC in collaboration with Waseda University and the University of Tokyo.

====Marine life====
Japan maintains one of the world&#x27;s largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch (2014). In 2005, Japan ranked sixth in the world in the tonnage of fish caught. Japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000 and 9,864,422 tons in 1980. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan&#x27;s total fishery production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation&#x27;s total fish catches in the late 1980s, although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.

===Energy===
, 46.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power, and 3.3% from hydropower. Nuclear power is a major domestic source of energy and produced 9.2 percent of Japan&#x27;s electricity , down from 24.9 percent the previous year. Following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, the nuclear reactors were shut down. Thus, Japan&#x27;s industrial sector became even more dependent than before on imported fossil fuels. By May 2012, all of the country&#x27;s nuclear power plants were taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan&#x27;s 50 nuclear reactors to service. Shinzo Abe&#x27;s government seeks to restart the nuclear power plants that meet strict new safety standards and is emphasizing nuclear energy&#x27;s importance as a base-load electricity source. In 2015, Japan successfully restarted one nuclear reactor at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, and several other reactors around the country have since resumed operations. Opposition from local governments has delayed several restarts that remain pending.

Reforms of the electricity and gas sectors, including the full liberalization of Japan&#x27;s energy market in April 2016 and the gas market in April 2017, constitute an important part of Prime Minister Abe&#x27;s economic program.

Japan has the third-largest geothermal reserves in the world. Geothermal energy is being heavily focused on as a source of power following the Fukushima disaster. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is exploring over 40 locations for potential geothermal energy plants.

On 3 July 2018, Japan&#x27;s government pledged to increase renewable energy sources from 15% to 22–24%, including wind and solar, by 2030. Nuclear energy will provide 20% of the country&#x27;s energy needs as an emissions-free energy source. This will help Japan meet climate change commitments.

==National Parks and Scenic Beauty==
===National Parks===
Japan has 34 and 56 in 2019. These are designated and managed for protection and sustainable usage by the Ministry of the Environment under the of 1957. The Quasi-National Parks have slightly less beauty, size, diversity, or preservation. They are recommended for ministerial designation and managed by the prefectures under the supervision of the Ministry of the Environment.

The Japanese archipelago has diverse landscapes. For example, the northern part of Hokkaido has a taiga biome. Hokkaido has 22% of Japan&#x27;s forestland with coniferous trees (Sakhalin fir and Sakhalin spruce) and broad-leaved trees (Japanese oak, birch, and painted maple). The seasonal views change throughout the year. In the south, the Yaeyama Islands are in the subtropics, with numerous species of subtropical and tropical plants and mangrove forests. Most natural islands have mountain ranges in the center and coastal plains.

===Places of Scenic Beauty===
The Places of Scenic Beauty and Natural Monuments are selected by the government via the Agency for Cultural Affairs in order to protect Japan&#x27;s cultural heritage. As of 2017, there are 1,027 and 410 . The highest classifications are 75 and 36 .

===Three Views of Japan===
The is the canonical list of Japan&#x27;s three most celebrated scenic sights, attributed to 1643 scholar Hayashi Gahō. These are traditionally the pine-clad islands of Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture, the pine-clad sandbar of Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture, and Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1915, the New Three Views of Japan were selected in a national election by the Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha (株式会社実業之日本社). In 2003, the Three Major Night Views of Japan were selected by the &quot;New Three Major Night Views of Japan and the 100 Night Views of Japan Club&quot; (新日本三大夜景・夜景100選事務局).

==Climate==

Most regions of Japan, such as much of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, belong to the temperate zone with a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by four distinct seasons. However, its climate varies from a cool, humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;/&quot;Dfb&quot;) in the north, such as northern Hokkaido, to a warm tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) in the south, such as the Yaeyama Islands and Minami-Tori-shima.

===Climate zones===

Japan&#x27;s varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.
* Hokkaido belongs to the humid continental climate, with long, cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation is sparse; however, winter brings large snowfalls of hundreds of inches in areas such as Sapporo and Asahikawa.
* In the Sea of Japan, the northwest seasonal wind in winter gives heavy snowfall, which south of Tōhoku mostly melts before the beginning of spring. In summer, it is a little less rainy than in the Pacific area, but it sometimes experiences extreme high temperatures because of the foehn wind phenomenon.
* Central Highland: a typical inland climate gives large temperature variations between summers and winters and between days and nights. Precipitation is lower than on the coast because of rain shadow effects.
* Seto Inland Sea: the mountains in the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions block the seasonal winds and bring a mild climate and many fine days throughout the year.
* Pacific Ocean: the climate varies greatly between the north and the south, but generally winters are significantly milder and sunnier than those of the side that faces the Sea of Japan. Summers are hot because of the southeast seasonal wind. Precipitation is very heavy in the south and heavy in the summer in the north. The climate of the Ogasawara Island chain ranges from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) to a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with temperatures being warm to hot all year round.
* The climate of the Ryukyu Islands ranges from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) in the north to a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) in the south, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very high and is especially affected by the rainy season and typhoons.

===Rainfall===
Japan is generally a rainy country with high humidity. Because of its wide range of latitude, seasonal winds, and different types of ocean currents, Japan has a variety of climates, with the latitude range of the inhabited islands ranging from 24°N to 46°N, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas on the east coast of North America. Tokyo is between 35°N and 36°N, which is comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.

As Mount Fuji and the coastal Japanese Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, or Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures—Hokkaido and Okinawa—are composed entirely of islands.

===Summer===
The climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. These air flows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land. There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month. It is followed by hot, sticky weather. Five or six typhoons pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, resulting in significant damage. Annual precipitation averages between except for areas such as Kii Peninsula and Yakushima Island, which is Japan&#x27;s wettest place, with the annual precipitation being one of the world&#x27;s highest at 4,000 to 10,000 mm.

Maximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast, where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above per month throughout the year.

Mid-June to mid-July is generally the rainy season in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaidō since the seasonal rain front, or , dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching Hokkaido. In Okinawa, the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid-June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither everyday nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, typhoons, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.

===Winter===
In winter, the Siberian High develops over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low develops over the northern Pacific Ocean. The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan but clear skies to areas fronting the Pacific.

The warmest winter temperatures are found in the Nanpō and Bonin Islands, which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian continent, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24° N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaidō in Kushiro and Nemuro Subprefectures.

===Sunshine===
Sunshine, in accordance with Japan&#x27;s uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the Sichuan Basin or Taipei. Amounts range from about six hours per day on the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kantō Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaidō. In December, there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast, where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.

===Extreme temperature records===
The highest recorded temperature in Japan was 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) on 23 July 2018. An unverified record of 42.7 °C was taken in Adachi, Tokyo, on 20 July 2004. The high humidity and the maritime influence make temperatures in the 40s rare, with summers dominated by a more stable subtropical monsoon pattern through most of Japan. The lowest was −41.0 °C (−41.8 °F) in Asahikawa on 25 January 1902. However, an unofficial −41.5 °C was taken in Bifuka on 27 January 1931. Mount Fuji broke the Japanese record lows for each month except January, February, March, and December. Record lows for any month were taken as recently as 1984.

Minami-Tori-shima has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;) and the highest average temperature in Japan of 25 °C.



==Population distribution==

Japan has a population of 126.3 million in 2019. It is the eleventh-most populous country and the second-most populous island country in the world. The population is clustered in urban areas along the coast, plains, and valleys. In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. Japan is an urban society, with about 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu.

81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture, and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanpō Islands. Nearly 1 in 3 Japanese people live in the Greater Tokyo Area, and over half live in the Kanto, Kinki, and Chukyo metropolitan areas.

===Honshu===
 is the largest island of Japan and the second most populous island in the world. It has a population of 104,000,000 with a population density of (2010). Honshu is roughly long and ranges from wide, and the total area is . It is the 7th largest island in the world. This makes it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain ().

The Greater Tokyo Area on Honshu is the largest metropolitan area (megacity) in the world, with people (2016). The area is and has a population density of 2,642 persons/km2.

===Kyushu===
 is the third-largest island of Japan of the five main islands. , Kyushu has a population of 12,970,479 and covers . It has the second-highest population density of 307.13 persons/km2 (2016).

===Shikoku===
 is the second-smallest of the five main islands (after Okinawa Island), with . It is located south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. It has the second-smallest population of 3,845,534 (2015) and the third-highest population density of 204.55 persons/km2.

===Hokkaido===
 is the second-largest island of Japan and the largest and northernmost prefecture. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu. It has the third largest population of the five main islands, with 5,383,579 (2015), and the lowest population density, with just 64.5 persons/km2 (2016). The island area ranks 21st in the world by area. It is 3.6% smaller than the island of Ireland.

===Okinawa Prefecture===
 is the southernmost prefecture of Japan. It encompasses two-thirds of the Ryukyu Islands, over long. It has a population of 1,445,812 (2017) and a density of 662 persons/km2. is the smallest and most southwestern of the five main islands, at . It has the smallest population of 1,301,462 (2014) and the highest population density of 1083.6 persons/km2.

===Nanpō Islands===
 are the groups of islands that are located to the south and east of the main islands of the Japanese archipelago. They extend from the Izu Peninsula west of Tokyo Bay southward for about to within of the Mariana Islands. The Nanpō Islands are all administered by Tokyo Metropolis.

===Taiheiyō Belt===
The Taiheiyō Belt is a megalopolis that includes the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihanshin megapoles. It is almost long, from Ibaraki Prefecture in the northeast to Fukuoka Prefecture in the southwest. Satellite images at night show a dense and continuous strip of light (demarcating urban zones) that delineates the region with overlapping metropolitan areas in Japan. It has a total population of approximately 81,859,345 (2016).
* Taiheiyō Belt – includes Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu, Mie, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyōgo, Wakayama, Okayama, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, and Ōita. (81,859,345 people)
** Greater Tokyo Area – Part of the larger Kantō region, broadly includes Tokyo and Yokohama. (38,000,000 people)
** Keihanshin – Part of the larger Kansai region, includes Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe. (19,341,976 people)

===Underwater habitats===
There are plans to build underwater habitats in Japan&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently no underwater city is constructed yet. For example, the Ocean Spiral by Shimizu Corporation would have a floating dome 500 meters in diameter with hotels, residential and commercial complexes. It could be 15 km long. This allows mining of the seabed, research and production of methane from carbon dioxide with micro-organisms. The Ocean Spiral was co-developed with JAMSTEC and Tokyo University.

==Extreme points==

Japan extends from 20° to 45° north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122° to 153° east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima). These are the points that are farther north, south, east, or west than any other location in Japan.

===Japan&#x27;s main islands===
The five main islands of Japan are Hokkaidō, Honshū, Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Okinawa. These are also called the mainland. All of these points are accessible to the public.

===Extreme altitudes===
==Largest islands of Japan==


These are the 50 largest islands of Japan. It excludes the disputed Kuril Islands, known as the northern territories.

===Northern Territories===


Japan has a longstanding claim to the Southern Kuril Islands (Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands). These islands were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. The Kuril Islands historically belonged to Japan. The Kuril Islands were first inhabited by the Ainu people and then controlled by the Japanese Matsumae clan in the Edo Period. The Soviet Union did not sign the San Francisco Treaty in 1951. The U.S. Senate Resolution of April 28, 1952, ratifying the San Francisco Treaty, explicitly stated that the USSR had no title to the Kurils. This dispute has prevented the signing of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia.

Geographically, the Kuril Islands are a northeastern extension of Hokkaido. Kunashiri and the Habomai Islands are visible from the northeastern coast of Hokkaido. Japan considers the northern territories (aka Southern Chishima) part of the Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture.

==Time zone==
There is one time zone in the whole Japanese archipelago. It is 9 hours ahead of UTC. There is no daylight saving time. The easternmost Japanese island, Minami-Tori-shima, also uses Japan Standard Time, while it is geographically southeast of Tokyo and in the UTC+10:00 time zone.

Sakhalin uses UTC+11:00, even though it is located directly north of Hokkaido. The Northern Territories and the Kuril Islands use UTC+11:00, although they are geographically in UTC+10:00.

==Natural hazards==
===Earthquakes and tsunami===

Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.

As many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 6 are common. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing slight shaking of buildings. Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from .

Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunamis, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. It triggered a large tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.

The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was the largest ever recorded in Japan and is the world&#x27;s fourth largest earthquake to strike since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Service. It struck offshore about northeast of Tokyo and east of the city of Sendai and created a massive tsunami that devastated Japan&#x27;s northeastern coastal areas. At least 100 aftershocks registering a magnitude of 6.0 or higher have followed the main shock. At least 15,000 people died as a result.

Researchers found the source of great thrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis in the Greater Tokyo Area at the Izu-Ogasawara Trench. There is a &#x27;trench-trench triple junction&#x27; of the oceanic Philippine Sea Plate that underthrusts a continental plate and is being subducted by the Pacific Plate.

Reclaimed land and human-made islands are particularly susceptible to liquefaction during an earthquake. As a result, there are specific earthquake resistance standards and ground reform work that apply to all construction in these areas. In an area that was possibly reclaimed in the past, old maps and land condition drawings are checked, and drilling is carried out to determine the strength of the ground. However, this can be very costly, so for a private residential block of land, a Swedish weight sounding test is more common.

Japan has become a world leader in research on the causes and prediction of earthquakes. The development of advanced technology has permitted the construction of skyscrapers even in earthquake-prone areas. Extensive civil defense efforts focus on training in protection against earthquakes, in particular against accompanying fire, which represents the greatest danger.

===Volcanic eruptions===

Japan has 111 active volcanoes. That is 10% of all active volcanoes in the world. Japan has stratovolcanoes near the subduction zones of the tectonic plates. During the 20th century, several new volcanoes emerged, including Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. In 1991, Japan&#x27;s Unzen Volcano on Kyushu, about east of Nagasaki, awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit. Beginning in June, repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain&#x27;s slopes at speeds as high as . Unzen erupted in 1792 and killed more than 15,000 people. It is the worst volcanic disaster in the country&#x27;s recorded history.

Mount Fuji is a dormant stratovolcano that last erupted on 16 December 1707 till about 1 January 1708. The Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji did not have a lava flow, but it did release some of volcanic ash. It spread over vast areas around the volcano and reached Edo almost away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces. In Edo, the volcanic ash was several centimeters thick. The eruption is rated a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.

There are three VEI-7 volcanoes in Japan. These are the Aira Caldera, the Kikai Caldera, and the Aso Caldera. These giant calderas are remnants of past eruptions. Mount Aso is the largest active volcano in Japan. 300,000 to 90,000 years ago, there were four eruptions of Mount Aso that emitted huge amounts of volcanic ash that covered all of Kyushu and up to Yamaguchi Prefecture.
* The Aira Caldera is 17 kilometers long and 23 kilometers wide, located in south Kyushu. The city of Kagoshima and the Sakurajima volcano are within the Aira Caldera. Sakurajima is the most active volcano in Japan.
* The Aso Caldera stretches 25 kilometers north to south and 18 kilometers east to west in Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu. It has erupted four times: 266,000 and 141,000 years ago with 32 DRE km3 (dense-rock equivalent) each; 130,000 years ago with 96 DRE km3; and 90,000 years ago with 384 DRE km3.
* The Kikai Caldera is a massive, mostly submerged caldera up to 19 kilometres (12 mi) in diameter in the Ōsumi Islands of Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is the remains of the ancient eruption of a colossal volcano. Kikai Caldera was the source of the Akahoya eruption, one of the largest eruptions during the Holocene (10,000 years ago to present). About 4,300 BC, pyroclastic flows from that eruption reached the coast of southern Kyūshū up to away, and ash fell as far as Hokkaidō. The eruption produced about 150 km3 of tephra, giving it a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7. The Jōmon culture of at least southern Kyushu was destroyed, and it took nearly 1,000 years to recover.

Surveys by KOBEC (Kobe Ocean-Bottom Exploration Center) confirm that a giant lava dome of 23 cubic kilometers formed after the Kikai Caldera erupted in 4,300 BC. There is a 1% chance of a giant caldera eruption in the Japanese archipelago within the next 100 years. Approximately 40 cubic kilometers of magma would be released in one burst and cause enormous damage.

According to a 2014 study by KOBEC of Kobe University, in a worst-case scenario, if there is a VEI-7 eruption of the Aso Caldera and if the volcanic ash is carried by westerly winds, then pyroclastic flows would cover the 7 million population near the Aso Caldera within two hours. The pyroclastic flows could reach much of Kyushu. Beyond the pyroclastic area is volcanic ash that falls from the sky. If the volcanic ash continuously flows northward, then the ash fall would make it impossible to live normally in large parts of the main islands of Japan due to the paralysis of traffic and lifelines for a limited period (a few days to 2 weeks) until the eruption subsides. In this scenario, the exception would be eastern and northern Hokkaido (the Ryukyu Islands and southern Nanpo Islands would also be excluded). Professor Yoshiyuki Tatsumi, head of KOBEC, told the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; that &quot;the probability of a gigantic caldera eruption hitting the Japanese archipelago is 1 percent in the next 100 years&quot; with a death toll of many tens of millions of people and wildlife. The potential exists for tens of millions of humans and other living beings to die during a VEI-7 volcanic eruption with significant short-term effects on the global climate. Most casualties would occur in Kyushu from the pyroclastic flows. The potential damage from the volcanic ash depends on the wind direction. If, in another scenario, the wind blows in a western or southern direction, then the volcanic ash could affect the East Asian continent or South-East Asia. If the ash flows eastward, then it will spread over the Pacific Ocean. Since the Kikai Caldera is submerged, it is unclear how much damage the hot ash clouds would cause if large quantities of volcanic ash stayed beneath the ocean surface. The underwater ash would be swept away by ocean currents.

Paektu Mountain on the Chinese–North Korean border had a VEI-7 eruption in 946. Paektu Mountain is mainly a threat to the surrounding area in North Korea and Manchuria. The west coast of Hokkaido is about away. However, a temple in Japan reported &quot;white ash falling like snow&quot; on 3 November 946 AD. So strong winds carried the volcanic ash eastward across the Sea of Japan. An average of of ashfall covered about of the Sea of Japan and northern Japan (Hokkaido and Aomori Prefecture). It took the ash clouds a day or so to reach Hokkaido. The total eruption duration was 4 and a half to 14 days (111–333 hours).

In October 2021, large quantities of pumice pebbles from the submarine volcano Fukutoku-Okanoba damaged fisheries, tourism, the environment, 11 ports in Okinawa, and 19 ports in Kagoshima prefecture. Clean-up operations took 2–3 weeks.

Improving technology and methods to predict volcano and giant caldera eruptions would help to prepare and evacuate people earlier. Technology is needed to accurately capture the state of the magma chamber, which spreads thinly with a thickness of less than several kilometers around the middle of the crust. The underground area of Kyushu must be monitored because it is a dangerous area with the potential for a caldera eruption. The most protective measure is to stop the hot ash clouds from spreading and devastating areas near the eruption so that people don&#x27;t need to evacuate. There are currently no protective measures to minimize the spread of millions of tons of deadly hot ash during a VEI-7 eruption.

In 2018, NASA published a theoretical plan to prevent a volcanic eruption by pumping large quantities of cold water down a borehole into the hydrothermal system of a supervolcano. The water would cool the huge body of magma in the chambers below the volcano so that the liquid magma would become semi-solid. Thus, enough heat could be extracted to prevent an eruption. The heat could be used by a geothermal plant to generate geothermal energy and electricity.

===Typhoons===

Since recording started in 1951, an average of 2.6 typhoons reached the main islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido per year. Approximately 10.3 typhoons approach within the 300-kilometer range near the coast of Japan. Okinawa is, due to its geographic location, most vulnerable to typhoons, with an average of 7 storms per year. The most destructive was the Isewan Typhoon, with 5,000 casualties in the Tokai region in September 1959. In October 2004, Typhoon Tokage caused heavy rain in Kyushu and central Japan, resulting in 98 casualties. Until the 1960s, the death toll was hundreds of people per typhoon. Since the 1960s, improvements in construction, flood prevention, high tide detection, and early warnings have substantially reduced the death toll, which rarely exceeds a dozen people per typhoon. Japan also has special search and rescue units to save people in distress.

Heavy snowfall during the winter in the snow country regions causes landslides, flooding, and avalanches.

==Environmental issues==
In the 2006 environment annual report, the Ministry of Environment reported that the current major issues are: global warming and preservation of the ozone layer; conservation of the atmospheric environment, water, and soil; waste management and recycling; measures for chemical substances; conservation of the natural environment; and participation in international cooperation.

<text>The demographics of Japan include birth and death rates, age distribution, population density, ethnicity, education level, healthcare system of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects regarding the Japanese population. According to the United Nations, the population of Japan was roughly 126.4 million people (as of January 2020), and peaked at 128.5 million people in 2010. It is the 6th-most populous country in Asia, and the 11th-most populous country in the world.

In 2023, the median age of Japanese people was projected to be 49.5 years, the highest level since 1950, compared to 29.5 for India, 38.8 for the United States and 39.8 for China. Japan has the second highest median age in the world (behind only Monaco). An improved quality of life and regular health checks are just two reasons why Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world.

The life expectancy from birth in Japan improved significantly after World War II, rising 20 years in the decade between 1945 and 1955. As life expectancy rises further, Japan expects to experience difficulties caring for the older generations in the future. Shortages in the service sector are already a major concern, with demand for nurses and care workers increasing.

The fertility rate among Japanese women was around 1.4 children per woman from 2010 to 2018. From then until 2022, the fertility rate further declined to 1.2. Apart from a small baby boom in the early 1970s, the crude birth rate in Japan has been declining since 1950; it reached its currently lowest point of 5.8 births per thousand people in 2023. With a falling birth rate and a large share of its inhabitants reaching old age, Japan&#x27;s total population is expected to continue declining, a trend that has been seen since 2010.

Japanese is a major language of the Japonic language family spoken by Japanese people, which is separated into several dialects with the Tokyo dialect considered Standard Japanese. It has around 128 million speakers in total, primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national language, and within the Japanese diaspora across the globe.

The sex ratio in Japan in 2021 was 95.38 males per 100 females. There are 61.53 million males and 64.52 million females in Japan. The percentage of female population is 51.18%, compared to 48.82% male population. Japan has 2.98 million more females than males.

==Historical overview==


As of 2017, Japan was the world&#x27;s eleventh-most populous country. The total population had declined by 0.8 percent from the time of the census five years previously, the first time it had declined since the 1945 census.

Since 2010, Japan has experienced net population loss due to falling birth rates and minimal immigration, despite having one of the highest life expectancies in the world, at 85.00 years (it stood at 81.25 as of 2006). Using the annual estimate for October of each year, the population peaked in 2008 at 128,083,960 and had fallen by 2,983,352 by October 2021.

Based on 2012 data from the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, Japan&#x27;s population will keep declining by about one million people every year in the coming decades, which would leave it with a population of around 70 million by 2060 and 42 million by early 22nd century if the current projections do not change. More than 40% of the population is expected to be over the age of 65 in 2060. In 2021 the population had for fifteen consecutive years declined by 644,000 on this year, the largest drop on record since 1945 and also reflecting a record low of 831,000 births. more than 20 percent of the population of Japan were aged 65 and over.

The population consisted of 47,062,743 households, with 78.7% in urban areas (July 2000). High population density; 329.5 people per square kilometer for total area; 1,523 persons per square kilometer for habitable land. More than 50% of the population lives on 2% of the land. (July 1993). According to research in 2009, the population to land density ratio has gradually increased, now at 127 million per 337 km2. Compared to the findings of July 1993 as well as in July 2000, the population density has greatly increased, from 50% of the population living on 2% of the land to 77%. However, as the years have progressed since the last recordings of the population, Japan&#x27;s population has decreased, raising concern about the future of Japan. There are many causes, such as the declining birthrates, as well as the ratio of men to women since the last measurements from the years of 2006 and 2010. According to the Japanese Health Ministry, the population is estimated to drop from its current state of 125.58 million to 86.74 million by the year 2060.

Japan dropped from the 5th most populous country in the world to 6th in 1964, 7th in 1978, 8th in 1990, to 9th in 1998, to 10th in the early 21st century, 11th in 2020, and to 12th in 2023. Over the period of 2010 to 2015, the population shrank by almost a million, and Japan lost a half-million in 2022 alone. The number of Japanese citizens decreased by 801,000 to 122,423,038 in 2022 from a year earlier, which was the most severe decrease and the first time all 47 prefectures have suffered a decline since the launch of the poll in 1968. The nation&#x27;s population reached 128,057,352 Japanese people by early 2010. However, the long-lasting effects of Japanese economic crisis during the Great Recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Japan in 2010s.

In March 2011, Japan suffered from the triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster, etc.), resulting 20,000 deaths, a reduction of about 1.39 years in the average life expectancy, an ultimate decrease in birth rates, and a marked decrease in immigration rates, worst since the end of World War II.

According to studies from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, from January 2020 to the end of September 2021 as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic, Japan registered at least 112,000 excess deaths with six times higher, a reduction of about 2.6 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in birth rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 798,214 units in that year, although the excess mortality rate for all causes has been estimated at between 100,000 and 130,000 deaths. It is the largest ever recorded since 1914 (at the time of World War I, Spanish flu pandemic, and the Great Kanto earthquake).

According to a demographic study conducted by Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japanese population (including foreign residents) has declined from 128 million people in 2010 to 124.3 million people in 2023, with a decrease of almost 511,000 people in one year.




==Population==

===Census===
Japan collects census information every five years, with censuses conducted by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The latest population census reflects the situation as of 2020.

===Population density===

Japan&#x27;s population density was 336 people per square kilometer as of 2014 (874 people per square mile) according to World Development Indicators. It ranks 44th in a list of countries by population density. Between 1955 and 1989, land prices in the six largest cities increased by 15,000% (+12% per year compound). Urban land prices generally increased 40% from 1980 to 1987; in the six largest cities, the price of land doubled over that period. For many families, this trend put housing in central cities out of reach.

The result was lengthy commutes for many workers in the big cities, especially in the Tokyo area where daily commutes of two hours each way are common. In 1991, as the bubble economy started to collapse, land prices began a steep decline, and within a few years fell 60% below their peak. After a decade of declining land prices, residents began moving back into central city areas (especially Tokyo&#x27;s 23 wards), as evidenced by 2005 census figures. Despite nearly 70% of Japan being covered by forests, parks in many major cities—especially Tokyo and Osaka—are smaller and scarcer than in major West European or North American cities. As of 2014, parkland per inhabitant in Tokyo is 5.78 square meters, which is roughly half of the 11.5 square meters of Madrid.

National and regional governments devote resources to making regional cities and rural areas more attractive by developing transportation networks, social services, industry, and educational institutions to try to decentralize settlement and improve the quality of life. Nevertheless, major cities, especially Tokyo, Yokohama and Fukuoka, and to a lesser extent Kyoto, Osaka and Nagoya, remain attractive to young people seeking education and jobs.

===Urban distribution===
Japan has a high population concentration in urban areas on the plains since 75% of Japan&#x27;s land area is made up of mountains, and also Japan has a forest cover rate of 68.5% (the only other developed countries with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden).
The 2010 census shows 90.7% of the total Japanese population live in cities.

Japan is an urban society with about only 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. Many farmers supplement their income with part-time jobs in nearby towns and cities. About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific shore of Honshu.

Metropolitan Tokyo-Yokohama, with its population of 35 million residents, is the world&#x27;s most populous city. Japan faces the same problems that confront urban industrialized societies throughout the world: overcrowded cities and congested highways.

===Age structure===

Japan&#x27;s population is aging faster than that of any other nation. The population of those 65 years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994. The same increase took 61 years in Italy, 85 years in Sweden, and 115 years in France. In 2014, 26% of Japan&#x27;s population was estimated to be 65 years or older, and the Health and Welfare Ministry has estimated that over-65s will account for 40% of the population by 2060. The demographic shift in Japan&#x27;s age profile has triggered concerns about the nation&#x27;s economic future and the viability of its welfare state.


=== Sex ratio ===
==Vital statistics==

Live births, birth and death rates, overall fertility rate, and net change in Japan from 1899 to present. The statistics below do not include foreign nationalities.

=== Current vital statistics ===


=== Total fertility rate===
In 2023, Japan&#x27;s total fertility rate was 1.20, among the lowest in the world and far below the replacement rate of 2.1. In January 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged to take urgent steps to tackle the country&#x27;s declining birth rate, calling it &quot;now or never&quot; for Japan&#x27;s aging society; he had planned to double the budget for child-related policies by June 2023 and to set up a new government agency in April.

=== Marriages and divorce ===
Many Japanese lead a sexless marriage. Japan has the lowest level of couples having sex at 45 times per year, well below the global average of 103 times. With reasons of &quot;tired&quot; and &quot;bored with intercourse&quot; usually given as an answer. Despite this, Japan ranks as number two globally on the amount spent on pornography, after South Korea.

==Ethnic groups==

Naturalized Japanese citizens and native-born Japanese nationals with a multi-ethnic background are all considered to be Japanese in the population census of Japan.

===Discrimination against ethnic minorities===
Three native Japanese minority groups can be identified. The largest are the &quot;hisabetsu buraku&quot; or &quot;discriminated communities&quot;, also known as the &quot;burakumin&quot;. These descendants of premodern outcast hereditary occupational groups, such as butchers, leatherworkers, funeral directors, and certain entertainers, may be considered a Japanese analog of India&#x27;s Dalits. Historically, discrimination against these occupational groups was based on Buddhist prohibitions on killing and Shinto notions of pollution, and it was also a feature of governmental attempts to maintain social control.

During the Edo period, such people were required to live in special &quot;buraku&quot; and, like the rest of the population, they were bound by sumptuary laws which were based on the inheritance of social class. The Meiji government abolished most of the derogatory names which were applied to these discriminated communities in 1871, but the new laws had little effect on the social discrimination which was faced by the former outcasts and their descendants. However, the laws eliminated the economic monopoly which they had on certain occupations. The &quot;buraku&quot; continued to be treated as social outcasts and some casual interactions with the majority caste were perceived taboo until the era after World War II.

Estimates of their number range from 2 to 4 million (about 4% of the national population in 2022). Although the members of these marginalized communities are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, most of them live in urban ghettoes or they live in the traditional special hamlets which are located in rural areas, and as a result, membership in a marginalized group can be surmised from the location of a family&#x27;s home, a family&#x27;s occupation, the dialect which a family speaks, or the mannerisms which a family uses when it communicates with people. Checks on the backgrounds of families which were designed to ferret out &quot;buraku&quot; were commonly performed as a condition of marriage arrangements and employment applications, but in Osaka, they have been illegal since 1985.

Among the &quot;hisabetsu buraku&quot;, past and current discrimination against them has resulted in lower educational attainments and it has also resulted in a lower socioeconomic status, by contrast, the majority of Japanese have higher educational attainments and they also have a higher economic status. Movements with objectives which range from &quot;liberation&quot; to the encouragement of integration have attempted to change this situation, with some success. Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that as of 1998, between 60 and 80% of burakumin marry a non-burakumin.

===Ryukyuans===
One of the largest minority groups among Japanese citizens is the Ryukyuan people. They are primarily distinguished by their use of several distinct Ryukyuan languages, though use of Ryukyuan is dying out. The Ryukyuan people and language originated in the Ryukyu Islands, which are in Okinawa prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture.

===Ainu===

The third largest minority group among Japanese citizens is the Ainu, whose language is an isolate. Historically, the Ainu were an indigenous hunting and gathering population who occupied most of northern Honshū as late as the Nara period (A.D. 710–94). As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward, by the Tokugawa shogunate, the Ainu were pushed into the island of Hokkaido.

Characterized as remnants of a primitive circumpolar culture, the fewer than 20,000 Ainu in 1990 were considered racially distinct and thus not fully Japanese. Disease and a low birth rate had severely diminished their numbers over the past two centuries, and intermarriage had brought about an almost completely mixed population.

Although no longer in daily use, the Ainu language is preserved in epics, songs, and stories transmitted orally over succeeding generations. Distinctive rhythmic music and dances and some Ainu festivals and crafts are preserved, but mainly in order to take advantage of tourism.

===Hāfu===

Hāfu (a kana rendition of &quot;half&quot;) is a term used for people who are biracial and ethnically half Japanese. Of the one million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or two non-Japanese parents.[70] According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, one in forty-nine babies born in Japan today are born into families with one non-Japanese parent. Most intermarriages in Japan are between Japanese men and women from other Asian countries, including China, the Philippines and South Korea. Southeast Asia too, also has significant populations of people with half-Japanese ancestry, particularly in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

In the 1940s, biracial Japanese children (Ainoko), specifically Amerasian children, encountered social problems such as poverty, perception of impurity and discrimination due to negative treatment in Japan. In the 21st century, discrimination against hāfu occurs based on how different their identity, behavior and appearance is from a typical Japanese person.

==Languages==
The Japanese society of Yamato people is linguistically homogeneous with small populations of Koreans (0.9 million), Chinese/Taiwanese (0.65 million), Filipino (306,000 some being Japanese Filipino; children of Japanese and Filipino parentage). This can be also said for Brazilians (300,000, many of whom are ethnically Japanese) as well as Peruvians and Argentineans of both Latin American and Japanese descent. Japan has indigenous minority groups such as the Ainu and Ryukyuans, who generally speak Japanese.

==Citizenship==
Japanese citizenship is conferred &quot;jure sanguinis&quot;, and monolingual Japanese-speaking minorities often reside in Japan for generations under permanent residency status without acquiring citizenship in their country of birth, although legally they are allowed to do so. This is because Japanese law does not recognize dual citizenship after the age of adulthood, and so people becoming naturalized Japanese citizens must relinquish their previous citizenship upon reaching the age of 22 years 

In addition, people taking Japanese citizenship must take a name using one or more of the Japanese character sets (hiragana, katakana, kanji). Names written in the Western alphabet, Korean alphabet, Arabic characters, etc., are not acceptable as legal names. Chinese characters are usually legally acceptable as nearly all Chinese characters are recognized as valid by the Japanese government. Transliterations of non-Japanese names using katakana (e.g. 　&quot;&quot; for &quot;Smith&quot;) are also legally acceptable.

However, some naturalizing foreigners feel that becoming a Japanese citizen should mean that they have a Japanese name and that they should abandon their foreign name, and some foreign residents do not wish to do this—although most Special Permanent Resident Koreans and Chinese already use Japanese names. Nonetheless, some 10,000 Zainichi Koreans naturalize every year. Approximately 98.6% of the population are Japanese citizens, and 99% of the population speak Japanese as their first language. Non-ethnic Japanese in the past, and to an extent in the present, also live in small numbers in the Japanese archipelago.

==Religion==

Shinto and Buddhism are Japan&#x27;s two major religions. They have co-existed for more than a thousand years. However, most Japanese people generally do not exclusively identify themselves as adherents of one religion, but rather incorporate various elements in a syncretic fashion. There are small Christian and other minorities as well, with the Christian population dating to as early as the 1500s, as a result of European missionary work before sakoku was implemented from 1635 to 1853.

==Migration==

===Internal migration===

Between 6 million and 7 million people moved their residences each year during the 1980s. About 50% of these moves were within the same prefecture; the others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan&#x27;s economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades.

In the 1980s, government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities, particularly Tokyo, and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed lifestyle than could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities, however, to attend universities and find work, but some returned to regional cities (a pattern known as U-turn) or to their prefecture of origin (referred to as &quot;J-turn&quot;), or even moved to a rural area for the first time (&quot;I-turn&quot;).

Government statistics show that in the 1980s significant numbers of people left the largest central cities (Tokyo and Osaka) to move to suburbs within their metropolitan areas. In 1988, more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year.

With a decreasing total population, internal migration results in only eight prefectures showing an increase in population. These are Okinawa 
(2.9%), Tokyo 
(2.7%), Aichi 
(1.0%), Saitama 
(1.0%), Kanagawa 
(0.9%), Fukuoka 
(0.6%), Shiga 
(0.2%), and Chiba 
(0.1%).

===Emigration===

About 663,300 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status in 1975. More than 200,000 Japanese went abroad in 1990 for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan&#x27;s historical insularity. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.

Cities with significant populations of Japanese nationals in 2015 included: 
* Los Angeles, United States: 68,689
* Bangkok, Thailand: 48,700
* Shanghai, China: 46,115
* New York, United States: 44,636
* Singapore: 36,963
* London, United Kingdom: 36,721
* Sydney, Australia: 30,448
* Vancouver, Canada: 26,999
* Hong Kong: 26,869
* San Francisco, United States: 18,777
* Toronto, Canada: 13,410

Note: The above data shows the number of Japanese nationals living overseas. It was published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan and relates to 2015.

===Immigration===

According to the Japanese immigration centre, the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents exceeded 3 410 992 people in December 2023.

In 2020, the number of foreigners in Japan was 2,887,116. This includes 325,000 Filipinos, many of whom are married to Japanese nationals and possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry, 208,538 Brazilians, the majority possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry, 778,112 Chinese, 448,053 Vietnamese and 426,908 South Koreans. Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, Filipinos and Brazilians account for about 77% of foreign residents in Japan.

The current issue of the shrinking workforce in Japan alongside its aging population has resulted in a recent need to attract foreign labour to the country. Reforms which took effect in 2015 relax visa requirements for &quot;Highly Skilled Foreign Professionals&quot; and create a new type of residence status with an unlimited period of stay.

According to the Civil Affairs Bureau of Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Justice, the number of naturalized individuals peaked in 2003 at 17,633, before declining to 8,800 by 2023. Most of the decline is accounted for by a steep reduction in the number of Japan-born Koreans taking Japanese citizenship. Historically the bulk of those taking Japanese citizenship have not been foreign-born immigrants but rather Japanese-born descendants of Koreans and Taiwanese who lost their citizenship in the Japanese Empire in 1947 as part of the American Occupation policy for Japan.

Japanese statistical authorities do not collect information on ethnicity, only nationality. As a result, both native and naturalized Japanese citizens are counted in a single group. Although official statistics therefore show homogeneity, other analyses describe the population as &quot;multi-ethnic&quot;.

====Foreign residents====

In 2021, there were 2,887,116 foreign residents in Japan, representing 2.3% of the Japanese population. Foreign Army personnel, of which there were up to 430,000 from the SCAP (post-occupation, United States Forces Japan) and 40,000 BCOF in the immediate post-war years, have not been at any time included in Japanese foreign resident statistics. Most foreign residents in Japan come from Brazil or from other Asian countries, particularly from China, Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, and Nepal.

A number of long-term resident Koreans in Japan today retain familial links with the descendants of Koreans, that either immigrated voluntarily or were forcibly relocated during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Within this group, a number hold Special Permanent Resident status, granted under the terms of the Normalisation Treaty (22nd June 1965) between South Korea and Japan. In many cases special residents, despite being born in Japan and speaking Japanese, have chosen not to take advantage of the mostly automatic granting of citizenship to special resident applicants.

Beginning in 1947 the Japanese government started to repatriate Korean nationals, who had nominally been granted Japanese citizenship during the years of military occupation. When the Treaty of San Francisco came into force many ethnic Koreans lost their Japanese citizenship from April 28, 1952, and with it the right to welfare grants, to hold a government job of any kind or to attend Japanese schools. In the following year the government contrived, with the help of the Red Cross, a scheme to &quot;repatriate&quot; Korean residents, who mainly were from the Southern Provinces, to their &quot;home&quot; of North Korea. Between 1959 and 1984 93,430 people used this route, of whom 6,737 were Japanese or Chinese dependents. Most of these departures – 78,276 – occurred before 1962.

All non-Japanese without special residential status (people whose residential roots go back to before WWII) are required by law to register with the government and carry alien registration cards. From the early 1980s, a civil disobedience movement encouraged refusal of the fingerprinting that accompanied registration every five years.

Opponents of fingerprinting argued that it was discriminatory because the only Japanese who were fingerprinted were criminals. The courts upheld fingerprinting, but the law was changed so that fingerprinting was done once rather than with each renewal of the registration, which until a law reform in 1989 was usually required every six months for anybody from the age of 16. Those refusing fingerprinting were denied re-entry permits, thus depriving them of freedom of movement.

Of these foreign residents below, the new wave which started in 2014, came to Japan as students or trainees. These foreigners are registered under student visa or trainee visa, which gives them the student residency status. Most of these new foreigners are under this visa. Almost all of these foreign students and trainees will return to their home country after three to four years (one valid period); few students extend their visa. Vietnamese makes the largest increase, however Burmese, Cambodians, Filipinos and Chinese are also increasing.

Asian migrant wives of Japanese men have also contributed to the foreign-born population in the country. Many young single Japanese male farmers choose foreign wives, mainly from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and South Korea, due to a lack of interest from Japanese women living a farming life. Migrant wives often travel as mail-order brides as a result of arranged marriages with Japanese men.

==== Foreign residents as of 2015 ====
There was an increase of 110,358 foreign residents from 2014 to 2015. Vietnamese made the largest proportion of these new foreign residents, whilst Nepalese, Filipino, Chinese and Taiwanese are also significant in numbers. Together these countries makes up 91,126 or 82.6% of all new residents from 2014 to 2015. However, the majority of these immigrants will only remain in Japan for a maximum of five years, as many of them have entered the country in order to complete trainee programmes. Once they complete their programmes, they will be required to return to their home countries.

As of December 2014 there were 2,121,831 foreigners residing in Japan, 677,019 of whom were long-term residents in Japan, according to national demographics figures. The majority of long-term residents were from Asia, totalling 478,953. Chinese made up the largest portion of them with 215,155, followed by Filipinos with 115,857, and Koreans with 65,711. Thai, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese long-term residents totaled 47,956, and those from other Asian countries totaled 34,274. The Korean figures do not include zainichi Koreans with &quot;tokubetsu eijusha&quot; (&quot;special permanent resident&quot;) visas, of whom there were 354,503 (of a total of 358,409 of all nationalities with such visas). The total number of permanent residents had declined over the previous five years due to high cost of living.

==== Foreign residents as of 2021 ====
The number of foreign residents of Japan reached a high of 2.93 million in 2019 before falling to 2.76 million at the end of 2021. The number of foreign workers was 1.46 million in 2018, 29.7% are in the manufacturing sector; 389,000 are from Vietnam and 316,000 are from China.

On April 1, 2019, Japan&#x27;s revised immigration law was enacted. The revision clarifies and better protects the rights of foreign workers. Japan formally accepts foreign blue-collar workers. This helps reduce labour shortage in certain sectors of the economy. The reform changes the status of foreign workers to regular employees and they can obtain permanent residence status. The reform includes a new visa status called . In order to qualify, applicants must pass a language and skills test (level N4 or higher of the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test). In the old &quot;Technical Trainee programme&quot; a foreign employee was tied to their employer. This caused numerous cases of exploitation. The revision gives foreign workers more freedom to leave and change their employer.

<doc id="15577" wikidata="Q865455" url="?curid=15577" title="Politics of Japan">
<text>The politics of [[Japan]] are conducted in a framework of a dominant-party bicameral parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy. A hereditary monarch, currently Emperor Naruhito, serves as head of state while the Prime Minister of Japan, currently Shigeru Ishiba since 2024, serves as the elected head of government.

Legislative power is vested in the National Diet, which consists of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The House of Representatives has eighteen standing committees ranging in size from 20 to 50 members and The House of Councillors has sixteen ranging from 10 to 45 members.

Executive power is vested in the Cabinet, which is led by the Prime Minister who is nominated by National Diet and appointed by the Emperor. A Liberal Democratic–Komeito coalition minority government has held office since 2024.

Judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and lower courts, and sovereignty is vested in the people of Japan by the 1947 Constitution, which was written during the Occupation of Japan primarily by American officials and had replaced the previous Meiji Constitution. Japan is considered a constitutional monarchy with a system of civil law.

The Japanese politics in the post-war period has largely been dominated by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been in power almost continuously since its foundation in 1955, a phenomenon known as the 1955 System. Of the 32 prime ministers since the end of the country&#x27;s occupation in 1952, 25 as well as the longest serving ones have been members of the LDP. Consequently, Japan has been described as a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state. The LDP lost its parliamentary majority in 2024, but continues to lead the country as part of a minority government.

==Constitution==
The current constitution was approved by Japan in 1947, this document aimed to address the weaknesses of the previous Meiji Constitution and lay the foundation for a vibrant democracy in Japan. Its key features include: 

* Sovereignty of the People: According to the constitutions, the sovereignty rests with the people.
* Democratic institutions: The constitution reinstated democratic institutions that had flourished under Taisho democracy.
* Expanded Suffrage: The constitution of 1947 expanded suffrage to women guaranteeing equal rights for men and women.
* Parliamentary system: Japan adopted a parliamentary system of government, maintaining a lower house and an upper house, similar to its previous democratic experiences during the Taisho era.
* Labor rights: It introduced Western-type labor practices, including a clause that declared the right to collective bargaining.
* Peace clause: The article 9 of the constitution renounces war and prohibits the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.
===Legitimacy===
The creation and ratification of this current document has been widely viewed by many geopolitical analysts and historians as one that was forced upon Japan by the United States after the end of World War II.

Although this &quot;imposition&quot; claim arose originally as a rallying cry among conservative politicians in favour of constitutional revision in the 1950s, and that it wasn&#x27;t &quot;inherently Japanese&quot;, it has also been supported by the research of several independent American and Japanese historians of the period.

A competing claim, which also emerged from the political maelstrom of the 1950s revision debate, holds that the ratification decision was actually the result of apparent &quot;collaboration&quot; between American occupation authorities, successive Japanese governments of the time, and private sector &quot;actors&quot;.

==Government==
Article 1 of the Constitution of Japan (日本国憲法, &quot;Nihon-koku kenpō&quot;) defines the Emperor (天皇, &quot;Tennō&quot;) to be &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people&quot;. He performs ceremonial duties and holds no real power. Political power is held mainly by the Prime Minister, Cabinet, and other elected members of the National Diet. The Imperial Throne is succeeded by a paternal male member of the Imperial House as designated by the Imperial Household Law.

The chief of the executive branch and head of government, the Prime Minister (内閣総理大臣, &quot;Naikaku Sōri-Daijin&quot;), is appointed by the Emperor as directed by the National Diet. The prime minister in Japan is the head of the cabinet, has the power to appoint and dismiss cabinet ministers, and can dissolve the lower house of the Diet. While formally limited in powers, the prime minister possesses informal powers such as party support, popularity, and influence over the bureaucracy. Individual leadership can significantly impact the policymaking process, especially following recent cabinet reforms that enhanced the prime minister&#x27;s influence. The Cabinet (内閣, &quot;Naikaku&quot;) members are nominated by the Prime Minister, and are also required to be civilian. The country has had a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)–Komeito coalition government, and it has been convention that the President of the LDP serves as the Prime Minister since 2012.

Japanese constitution states that the National Diet (国会, &quot;Kokkai&quot;), its law-making institution, shall consist of two Houses, namely the House of Representatives (衆議院, &quot;Shūgiin&quot;) and the House of Councillors (参議院, &quot;Sangiin&quot;). The Diet shall be the highest organ of state power, and shall be the sole law-making organ of the State. It states that both Houses shall consist of elected members, representative of all the people and that the number of the members of each House shall be fixed by law. Both houses pass legislation in identical form for it to become law. Similarly to other parliamentary systems, most legislation that is considered in the National Diet is proposed by the cabinet. The cabinet then relies on the expertise of the bureaucracy to draft actual bills.

The lower house, the House of Representatives, the most powerful of the two, holds power over the government, being able to force its resignation. The lower house also has ultimate control of the passage of the budget, the ratification of treaties, and the selection of the Prime Minister. Its power over its sister house is, if a bill is passed by the lower house (the House of Representatives) but is voted down by the upper house (the House of Councillors), the ability to override the decision of the House of Councillors. Members of the lower house, as a result of the Prime Minister&#x27;s power to dissolve them, more frequently serve for less than four years in any given terms.

The upper house, the House of Councillors, is very weak and bills are sent to the House of Councillors only to be approved, not made. Members of the upper house are elected for six-year terms with half the members elected every three years.

It is possible for different parties to control the lower house and the upper house, a situation referred to as a &quot;twisted Diet&quot;, something that has become more common since the JSP took control of the upper house in 1989.

== Political parties and elections ==

Several political parties exist in Japan. However, the politics of Japan have primarily been dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 1955, with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) playing an important role as the opposition several times. The DPJ was the ruling party from 2009 to 2012 with the LDP as the opposition. The LDP was the ruling party for decades since 1955, despite the existence of multiple parties. Most of the prime ministers (presidents of the LDP) were elected from inner factions of the LDP.

==Policy making==
Despite an increasingly unpredictable domestic and international environment, policy making conforms to well established postwar patterns. The close collaboration of the ruling party, the elite bureaucracy and important interest groups often make it difficult to tell who exactly is responsible for specific policy decisions.

===Policy development in Japan===
After a largely informal process within elite circles in which ideas were discussed and developed, steps might be taken to institute more formal policy development. This process often took place in deliberation councils (&quot;shingikai&quot;). There were about 200 &quot;shingikai&quot;, each attached to a ministry; their members were both officials and prominent private individuals in business, education, and other fields. The &quot;shingikai&quot; played a large role in facilitating communication among those who ordinarily might not meet.

Given the tendency for real negotiations in Japan to be conducted privately (in the &quot;nemawashi&quot;, or root binding, process of consensus building), the &quot;shingikai&quot; often represented a fairly advanced stage in policy formulation in which relatively minor differences could be thrashed out and the resulting decisions couched in language acceptable to all. These bodies were legally established but had no authority to oblige governments to adopt their recommendations. The most important deliberation council during the 1980s was the Provisional Commission for Administrative Reform, established in March 1981 by Prime Minister Suzuki Zenko. The commission had nine members, assisted in their deliberations by six advisers, twenty-one &quot;expert members,&quot; and around fifty &quot;councillors&quot; representing a wide range of groups. Its head, Keidanren president Doko Toshio, insisted that the government agree to take its recommendations seriously and commit itself to reforming the administrative structure and the tax system.

In 1982, the commission had arrived at several recommendations that by the end of the decade had been actualized. These implementations included tax reform, a policy to limit government growth, the establishment in 1984 of the Management and Coordination Agency to replace the Administrative Management Agency in the Office of the Prime Minister, and privatization of the state-owned railroad and telephone systems. In April 1990, another deliberation council, the Election Systems Research Council, submitted proposals that included the establishment of single-seat constituencies in place of the multiple-seat system.

Another significant policy-making institution in the early 1990s was the Liberal Democratic Party&#x27;s Policy Research Council. It consisted of a number of committees, composed of LDP Diet members, with the committees corresponding to the different executive agencies. Committee members worked closely with their official counterparts, advancing the requests of their constituents, in one of the most effective means through which interest groups could state their case to the bureaucracy through the channel of the ruling party.

== Post-war political developments in Japan ==
Political parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the Allied occupation began because of surrender of Japan in World War II. Left-wing organizations, such as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party, quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old Rikken Seiyūkai and Rikken Minseitō came back as, the Liberal Party (Nihon Jiyūtō) and the Japan Progressive Party (Nihon Shimpotō) respectively. The first postwar general election was held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first time in 1946), and the Liberal Party&#x27;s vice president, Yoshida Shigeru (1878–1967), became prime minister.

For the 1947 general election, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new Democratic Party (Minshutō). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954.

Even before Japan regained full sovereignty, the government had rehabilitated nearly 80,000 people who had been purged, many of whom returned to their former political and government positions. A debate over limitations on military spending and the sovereignty of the Emperor ensued, contributing to the great reduction in the Liberal Party&#x27;s majority in the first post-occupation elections (October 1952). After several reorganizations of the armed forces, in 1954 the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) were established under a civilian director. Cold War realities and the hot war in nearby Korea also contributed significantly to the United States-influenced economic redevelopment, the suppression of communism, and the discouragement of organized labor in Japan during this period.

Continual fragmentation of parties and a succession of minority governments led conservative forces to merge the Liberal Party (Jiyūtō) with the Japan Democratic Party (Nihon Minshutō), an offshoot of the earlier Democratic Party, to form the Liberal Democratic Party (Jiyū-Minshutō; LDP) in November 1955, called 1955 System. This party continuously held power from 1955 through 1993, except for a short while when it was replaced by a new minority government. LDP leadership was drawn from the elite who had seen Japan through the defeat and occupation. It attracted former bureaucrats, local politicians, businessmen, journalists, other professionals, farmers, and university graduates.

In October 1955, socialist groups reunited under the Japan Socialist Party (JSP), which emerged as the second most powerful political force. It was followed closely in popularity by the Komeito, founded in 1964 as the political arm of the Soka Gakkai (Value Creation Society), until 1991, a lay organization affiliated with the Nichiren Shōshū Buddhist sect. The Komeito emphasized the traditional Japanese beliefs and attracted urban laborers, former rural residents, and women. Like the Japan Socialist Party, it favored the gradual modification and dissolution of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact.

== Political developments since 1990 ==
The LDP domination lasted until the National Diet Lower House general election on 18 July 1993, in which LDP failed to win a majority. A coalition of new parties and existing opposition parties formed a governing majority and elected a new non-LDP prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa (leader of Japan New Party), in August 1993. His government&#x27;s major legislative objective was political reform, consisting of a package of new political financing restrictions and major changes in the electoral system. The coalition succeeded in passing landmark political reform legislation in January 1994.

In April 1994, Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata (leader of Japan Renewal Party) formed the successor coalition government, Japan&#x27;s first minority government in almost 40 years. Prime Minister Hata resigned less than two months later. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama (leader of JSP) formed the next government in June 1994 with the coalition of JSP, the LDP, and the small New Party Sakigake. The advent of a coalition containing the JSP and LDP shocked many observers because of their previously fierce rivalry.

Prime Minister Murayama served from June 1994 to January 1996. He was succeeded by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto (president of the LDP), who served from January 1996 to July 1998. Prime Minister Hashimoto headed a loose coalition of three parties until the July 1998 Upper House election, when the two smaller parties cut ties with the LDP. Hashimoto resigned due to a poor electoral performance by the LDP in the Upper House elections. He was succeeded as party president of the LDP and prime minister by Keizō Obuchi, who took office on 30 July 1998. The LDP formed a governing coalition with the Liberal Party in January 1999, and Obuchi remained prime minister. The LDP-Liberal coalition expanded to include the New Komeito Party in October 1999.

== Political developments since 2000 ==
Prime Minister Obuchi suffered a stroke in April 2000 and was replaced by Yoshirō Mori. After the Liberal Party left the coalition in April 2000, Prime Minister Mori welcomed a Liberal Party splinter group, the New Conservative Party, into the ruling coalition. The three-party coalition made up of the LDP, New Komeito, and the New Conservative Party maintained its majority in the Diet following the June 2000 Lower House elections.

After a turbulent year in office in which he saw his approval ratings plummet to the single digits, Prime Minister Mori agreed to hold early elections for the LDP presidency in order to improve his party&#x27;s chances in crucial July 2001 Upper House elections. On 24 April 2001, riding a wave of grassroots desire for change, maverick politician Junichiro Koizumi defeated former prime minister Hashimoto and other party stalwarts on a platform of economic and political reform.

Koizumi was elected as Japan&#x27;s 56th Prime Minister on 26 April 2001. On 11 October 2003, Prime Minister Koizumi dissolved the lower house and he was re-elected as the president of the LDP. Likewise, that year, the LDP won the general election, even though it suffered setbacks from the new opposition party, the liberal and social-democratic Democratic Party (DPJ). A similar event occurred during the 2004 Upper House election as well.

On 8 August 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called for a snap general election to the lower house, as threatened, after LDP stalwarts and opposition DPJ parliamentarians defeated his proposal for a large-scale reform and privatization of Japan Post, which besides being Japan&#x27;s state-owned postal monopoly is arguably the world&#x27;s largest financial institution, with nearly 331 trillion yen of assets. The election was scheduled for 11 September 2005, with the LDP achieving a landslide victory under Junichiro Koizumi&#x27;s leadership.

The ruling LDP started losing hold in 2006. No prime minister except Koizumi had good public support. On 26 September 2006, the new LDP President Shinzo Abe was elected by a special session of the National Diet to succeed Junichiro Koizumi as the next prime minister. He was Japan&#x27;s youngest post-World War II prime minister and the first born after the war. On 12 September 2007, Abe surprised Japan by announcing his resignation from office. He was replaced by Yasuo Fukuda, a veteran of LDP.

In the meantime, on 4 November 2007, the leader of the main opposition party, Ichirō Ozawa announced his resignation from the post of party president, after controversy over an offer to the DPJ to join the ruling coalition in a grand coalition, but has since, with some embarrassment, rescinded his resignation.

On 11 January 2008, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda forced a bill allowing ships to continue a refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan. To do so, PM Fukuda used the LDP&#x27;s overwhelming majority in the Lower House to ignore a previous &quot;no-vote&quot; of the opposition-controlled Upper House. This was the first time in 50 years that the Lower House voted to ignore the opinion of the Upper House. Fukuda resigned suddenly on 1 September 2008, just a few weeks after reshuffling his cabinet. On 1 September 2008, Fukuda&#x27;s resignation was designed so that the LDP did not suffer a &quot;power vacuum&quot;. It thus caused a leadership election within the LDP, and the winner, Tarō Asō (Shigeru Yoshida&#x27;s grandson) was chosen as the new LDP president on 24 September 2008, he was appointed as the 92nd Prime Minister after the House of Representatives voted in his favor in the extraordinary session of the National Diet.

Later, on 21 July 2009, Prime Minister Asō dissolved the House of Representatives and general election was held on 30 August.
The election results for the House of Representatives were announced on 30 and 31 August 2009. The opposition party DPJ led by Yukio Hatoyama (Ichirō Hatoyama&#x27;s grandson), won a majority by gaining 308 seats (10 seats were won by its allies the Social Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s New Party). On 16 September 2009, the leader of DPJ, Hatoyama was elected by the House of Representatives as the 93rd Prime Minister of Japan.

== Political developments since 2010 ==
On 2 June 2010, Hatoyama resigned due to lack of fulfillments of his policies, both domestically and internationally and soon after, on 8 June, Akihito, Emperor of Japan ceremonially swore in the newly elected DPJ&#x27;s leader, Naoto Kan as the 94th prime minister. Kan suffered an early setback in the 2010 Japanese House of Councillors election. In a routine political change in Japan, DPJ&#x27;s new leader and former finance minister of Kan Cabinet, Yoshihiko Noda was cleared and elected by the National Diet as 95th prime minister on 30 August 2011. He was officially appointed as prime minister in the attestation ceremony by Emperor Akihito at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 2 September 2011.

Noda dissolved the lower house on 16 November 2012 (as he failed to get support outside the Diet on various domestic issues i.e. consumption tax, nuclear energy) and general election was held on 16 December. The results were in favor of the LDP, which won an absolute majority in the leadership of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. He was appointed as the 96th Prime Minister of Japan on 26 December 2012. With the changing political situation, earlier in November 2014, Prime Minister Abe called for a fresh mandate for the Lower House. In an opinion poll the government failed to win public trust due to bad economic achievements in the two consecutive quarters and on the tax reforms.

The general election was held on 14 December 2014, and the results were in favor of the LDP and its ally New Komeito. Together they managed to secure a huge majority by winning 325 seats for the Lower House. The opposition, DPJ, could not manage to provide alternatives to the voters with its policies and programs. &quot;Abenomics&quot;, the ambitious self-titled fiscal policy of the current prime minister, managed to attract more voters in this election, many Japanese voters supported the policies. Shinzō Abe was sworn as the 97th prime minister on 24 December 2014 and would go ahead with his agenda of economic revitalization and structural reforms in Japan.

Prime Minister Abe was elected again for a fourth term after the 2017 general election. It was a snap election called by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe&#x27;s ruling coalition won a clear majority with more than two-thirds of 465 seats in the lower house of Parliament (House of Representatives). The opposition was in deep political crisis.

In July 2019, Japan had a national election. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Prime Minister Abe won a majority of seats in the upper house of Parliament (House of Councillors). However, Abe failed to achieve the two-thirds majority, and the ruling coalition could not amend the constitution.

== Political developments since 2020 ==
Contemporary issues such as economic challenges, demographic shifts, and environmental concerns play a significant role in shaping political discourse, highlighting the interplay between these social issues and political responses. Ultimately, the potential for overcoming anxiety over governance is a critical theme, suggesting that increased political participation and engagement could lead to more effective governance and a reduction in public anxiety, all of which contribute to the complex and dynamic nature of Japanese politics. 

On 28 August 2020 following reports of ill-health, Abe resigned citing health concerns, triggering a leadership election to replace him as prime minister. Abe was the longest-serving Prime Minister in the political history of Japan.

After winning the leadership of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, a close ally of his predecessor, was elected as the 99th prime minister of Japan on 16 September 2020. On 2 September 2021, Suga announced that he would not seek reelection as LDP President, effectively ending his term as prime minister. On 4 October 2021, Fumio Kishida took office as new prime minister. Kishida was elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) previous week. He was officially confirmed as the 100th prime minister following a parliamentary vote with appointment by Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo Imperial Palace. On 31 October 2021, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) held onto its single party majority in the general election.

On 8 July 2022, former prime minister Shinzo Abe was shot and killed at a campaign rally in Nara for the 2022 Japanese House of Councillors election. State funeral of Abe was held on 27 September at Nippon Budokan.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) rated Japan a &quot;full democracy&quot; its report for 2023. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Japan was the 23rd most electoral democratic country in the world as of 2023.

On 1 October 2024, Japan’s parliament confirmed Shigeru Ishiba, new leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as the new prime minister to replace Fumio Kishida.

<doc id="15578" wikidata="Q319831" url="?curid=15578" title="Economy of Japan">
<text>The economy of Japan is a highly developed mixed economy, often referred to as an East Asian model. It is the fourth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP behind the United States, China, and Germany, and the fifth-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP), below India and Russia but ahead of Germany. It constituted 4.2% of the world&#x27;s economy on a nominal basis in 2022. According to the IMF, the country&#x27;s per capita GDP (PPP) was at $55,600 (2025). Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Japan&#x27;s nominal GDP as measured in American dollars fluctuates sharply.

Being a founding member of the G7 and an early member of the OECD, Japan was the first country in Asia to achieve developed country status. In 2018, Japan was the fourth-largest in the world both as an importer and as an exporter. The country also has the world&#x27;s fourth-largest consumer market. Japan used to run a considerable trade surplus, but the decline of the manufacturing sector since the 1980s and increased fossil fuel imports after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 have changed this trend in recent years. Being the world&#x27;s largest creditor nation, Japan has a considerable net international investment surplus. The country has the world&#x27;s second-largest foreign-exchange reserves, worth $1.4 trillion. Japan has the third-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $12 trillion, or 8.6% of the global GDP total as of 2020. Japan has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 23.5% of GDP. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest stock exchange by market capitalisation.

Japan has a highly service-dominated economy, which contributes approximately 70% of GDP, with most of the remainder coming from the industrial sector. The country&#x27;s automobile industry, which is the second largest in the world, dominates the industrial sector, with Toyota being the world’s largest manufacturer of cars. Japan is often ranked among the world’s most innovative countries, leading several measures of global patent filings. However, its manufacturing industry has lost its world dominance since the 1990s. In 2022, Japan spent around 3.7% of GDP on research and development. As of 2022, 47 of the &quot;Fortune Global 500&quot; companies are based in Japan.

Long having been an agricultural country, one study estimates that Japan’s economy was among the top ten in the world by size during the second millennium before the industrial revolution started. Industrialisation in Japan began in the second half of the 19th century with the Meiji Restoration, initially focusing on the textile industry and later on heavy industries. The country rapidly built its colonial empire and the third most powerful navy in the world. After the defeat in the Second World War, Japan’s economy recovered and developed further rapidly, primarily propelled by its lucrative manufacturing exporting industries. It became the second largest economy in the world in 1968 and remained so until 2010, and on a nominal per capita basis, the most high-income among the G7 countries in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995, Japan’s share of the world’s nominal GDP was 17.8%, reaching approximately 71% of that of the United States.

Driven by speculative investments and excessive lending, the Japanese asset price bubble of the early 1990s burst, triggering a prolonged period of economic stagnation marked by deflation and persistently low or negative growth, now known as the Lost Decades. From 1995 to 2023, the country’s GDP fell from $5.5 trillion to $4.2 trillion in nominal terms. At the turn of the 21st century, the Bank of Japan set out to encourage growth through a policy of quantitative easing, with the central bank purchasing government bonds at an unprecedented scale to address the persisting deflationary pressure. In 2016, the Bank of Japan introduced a negative interest policy to stimulate economic growth and combat persistent deflationary pressure. A combination of domestic policies and global economic conditions helped the country achieve its 2% inflation target, leading to the conclusion of the policy in 2024.

As of 2021, Japan has significantly higher public debt than other developed nations, at approximately 260% of GDP. 45% of this debt is held by the Bank of Japan, and most of the remainder is also held domestically. The Japanese economy faces considerable challenges posed by an ageing and declining population, which peaked at 128.5 million people in 2010 and has fallen to 122.6 million people in 2024. In 2022, the country&#x27;s working age population consisted of approximately 59.4% of the total population, which was the lowest rate among all the OECD countries. Projections show that the population will continue to fall, potentially to below 100 million by the middle of the 21st century.

==History==

The economic history of Japan is one of the most studied. Major milestones in modern Japan&#x27;s economic progress include:

* The foundation of the Tokugawa shogunate based in Edo (in 1603), initiating a period of internal economic development.
* The Meiji Restoration (in 1868) leading to Japan becoming the first non-European modern world power.
* Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II (in 1945), after which the island nation rose to become the world&#x27;s second-largest economy.
* The Lost Decades (the 1990s, 2000s and arguably 2010s), during which the country struggled to get out of deflation and extremely low or negative growth.

=== Edo period (1603–1868) ===
The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period, marked by intense interaction with European powers. Japan built its first Western-style warships, such as the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;, and commissioned around 350 Red Seal Ships for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, were active throughout Asia.

To eradicate Christian influence, Japan entered a period of isolation called &quot;sakoku&quot; in the 1630s, which led to economic stability and mild progress. In the 1650s, Japanese export porcelain production increased significantly due to a civil war in China, mainly in Kyushu. This trade dwindled by the 1740s under renewed Chinese competition but resumed after Japan’s mid-19th century opening.

Economic development during the Edo period included urbanisation, increased commodity shipping, and expanded domestic and foreign commerce. The construction trades, banking facilities, and merchant associations flourished. &quot;Daimyō&quot;-led authorities (&quot;han&quot;) oversaw rising agricultural production and rural handicrafts. By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of over 1 million, while Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants, becoming centres for trade and handicraft production. Rice, the economy’s base, was taxed at about 40% of the harvest and sold at the fudasashi market in Edo. &quot;Daimyō&quot; used forward contracts similar to modern futures trading to sell rice before harvest.

During the &quot;sakoku&quot; period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (&quot;rangaku&quot;) through Dutch traders in Dejima, including geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, and mechanical sciences. Japan reopened its economy to the West after being pressured by the United States twice in 1853 and 1854.

=== Pre-war period (1868–1945) ===

Since the mid-19th century, after the Meiji Restoration, the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and went through a period of economic development that extended through to the First World War. Economic developments of the prewar period began with the &quot;Rich State and Strong Army Policy&quot; by the Meiji government. During the Meiji period (1868–1912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to Europe and the United States, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (&quot;Oyatoi gaikokujin&quot;). The government also built an extensive railway network, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.

To promote industrialization, the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the private sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger conglomerates such as Mitsubishi. Government emerged as chief promoter of private enterprise, enacting a series of pro-business policies.

=== Post-war period (1945–1989) ===

Japan underwent significant economic transformation and rapid recovery and growth, emerging from the devastation of the Second World War to become a global economic powerhouse. The immediate post-war period saw Japan slowly recovering as a democratic nation under the Allied Occupation. The Korean War (1950-1953), which happened in its now divided former colony, boosted the economy, as Japan served as a major supply hub for U.S. forces. By the 1950s and 1960s, Japan’s economy had entered a period of high growth, often referred to as the &#x27;Japanese Economic Miracle&#x27;. Key factors in this growth included government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, advanced technology, and a focus on export-oriented manufacturing. Japan’s economy diversified from textiles to steel, shipbuilding, and eventually electronics and automobiles, with companies such as Toyota, Sony, Hitachi and Honda becoming household names worldwide.

In 1968, Japan became the world’s third-largest economy then the second largest in the 1988, surpassing the economy of the Soviet Union. A position it held until it was surpassed by China in 2010. The government played a crucial role through policies that promoted industrial expansion and technological advancement. Japan’s emphasis on quality control and continuous improvement (kaizen) further boosted its international competitiveness. By the 1980s, Japan was leading in a wide range of industries, including automotive and consumer electronics, and was known for its formidable trade surplus and wealth. However, the late 1980s also saw the infamous Plaza Accord and the formation of an asset price bubble, with inflated real estate and stock market prices, setting the stage for the economic stagnation of the &#x27;Lost Decades&#x27; that followed.

=== Heisei period (1989–2019) ===

Growth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed the Lost Decade after the collapse of Japanese asset price bubble. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to finance large public works programs.

By 1998, Japan&#x27;s public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy&#x27;s stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook &quot;structural reform&quot; policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used quantitative easing to expand the country&#x27;s money supply in order to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period. Unlike previous recovery trends, domestic consumption has been the dominant factor of growth.
Despite having interest rates down near zero for a long period of time, the quantitative easing strategy did not succeed in stopping price deflation. This led some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians, to advocate the generation of higher inflation expectations. In July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the lowest interest rates in the developed world, but deflation had still not been eliminated and the Nikkei 225 has fallen over approximately 50% (between June 2007 and December 2008). However, on 5 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced that it would be purchasing 60–70 trillion yen in bonds and securities in an attempt to eliminate deflation by doubling the money supply in Japan over the course of two years. Markets around the world have responded positively to the government&#x27;s current proactive policies, with the Nikkei 225 adding more than 42% since November 2012. The Economist has suggested that improvements to bankruptcy law, land transfer law, and tax laws will aid Japan&#x27;s economy. In recent years, Japan has been the top export market for almost 15 trading nations worldwide.

In December 2018, a free trade agreement between Japan and the European Union was cleared to commence in February 2019. It creates the world&#x27;s largest free trade zone valued at 1/3rd of global gross domestic product. This reduces tariffs on Japanese cars by 10%, duties by 30% on cheese and 10% on wines and opens service markets.

=== Reiwa period (2020–present) ===

=== 2020–21 recession ===
In early January 2020, Japanese economy began to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic. In early April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency. Less than a quarter of Japanese people expected living conditions to improve in the coming decades. In October 2020 during the pandemic, Japan and the United Kingdom formally signed the first free-trade agreement post-Brexit, which will boost trade by approximately £15.2 billion. It enables tariff-free trade on 99% of exports to Japan. On 15 February 2021, the Nikkei average breached the 30k benchmark, the highest since November 1991. It was due to strong corporate earnings, GDP data and optimism over the COVID-19 vaccination program in the country.

=== Post-recession (2021–present) ===
At the end of March 2022, the Ministry of Finance announced that the national debt reached precisely 1.017 million billion yen. The total public debt of the country, which includes debts contracted by local governments, represents 1.210 million billion yen (9,200 billion dollars) which is nearly 250% of Japan&#x27;s GDP. Economist Kohei Iwahara said such an exceptional debt to GDP level is only possible because Japanese hold most of the debt: &quot;“Japanese households hold most of their savings in bank accounts (48%) and these sums are used by commercial banks to buy Japanese government bonds. Thus, 85.7% of these bonds are held by Japanese investors.”

The Bank of Japan&#x27;s main policy aim since the Lost Decades started had been to end deflation and eventually achieve 2% inflation. The increased international economic tension brought about by events such as the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 finally helped the country achieve the much-anticipated inflation target of 2%, and the negative interest policy since 2016 was ended in March 2024. However, while other major economies focus on suppressing inflation by raising interest rates, Japan aims to firmly establish inflation by maintaining low rates. As a side effect, the Japanese yen has become extremely weak, hitting a 37.5-year low of 161 yen/USD in July 2024. Furthermore, the real effective exchange rate in May 2024, when the 2020 average is set at 100, is 68.65, the lowest level since the start of the Bank of Japan statistics in January 1970, due to a combination of low inflation in Japan and a relatively low trade share. This devaluation of the currency caused Japan to lose its status as the world’s third largest economy to Germany in nominal terms, which was approximately half the size of the country&#x27;s economy a decade earlier. The Asahi Shimbun and other media outlets also reported that the impact of these sharp falls in the value of the currency had turned the Japanese yen into a junk currency.

Factors such as an apparent end to the 30-year struggle against deflation, improvements in corporate governance, and high corporate profits boosted the stock market. Consequently, both the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices surpassed the record highs they reached more than 30 years ago in 2024. The market capitalisation of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s prime section exceeded a quadrillion yen for the first time in July 2024.

=== Development of main indicators ===

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2023 (with IMF staff estimates in 2024–2029). Inflation under 5% is in green.

== Sectors of the economy ==
===Agriculture===
The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.1% (2017) of the total country&#x27;s GDP. Only 12% of Japan&#x27;s land is suitable for cultivation. Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world&#x27;s highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 km2 (14 million acres) cultivated.

Japan&#x27;s small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.

Rice accounts for almost all of Japan&#x27;s cereal production. Japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.

Although Japan is usually self-sufficient in rice (except for its use in making rice crackers and processed foods) and wheat, the country must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops and relies on imports for half of its supply of meat. Japan imports large quantities of wheat and soybeans. Japan is the 5th largest market for the European Union&#x27;s agricultural exports. Over 90% of mandarin oranges in Japan are grown in Japan. Apples are also grown due to restrictions on apple imports.

==== Fishery ====
Japan ranked fourth in the world in 1996 in tonnage of fish caught. Japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000, 9,558,615 tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970, 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan&#x27;s total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation&#x27;s total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.

Coastal fishing by small boats, set nets, or breeding techniques accounts for about one third of the industry&#x27;s total production, while offshore fishing by medium-sized boats makes up for more than half the total production. Deep-sea fishing from larger vessels makes up the rest. Among the many species of seafood caught are sardines, skipjack tuna, crab, shrimp, salmon, pollock, squid, clams, mackerel, sea bream, sauries, tuna and Japanese amberjack. Freshwater fishing, including salmon, trout and eel hatcheries and fish farms, takes up about 30% of Japan&#x27;s fishing industry. Among the nearly 300 fish species in the rivers of Japan are native varieties of catfish, chub, herring and goby, as well as such freshwater crustaceans as crabs and crayfish. Marine and freshwater aquaculture is conducted in all 47 prefectures in Japan.

Japan maintains one of the world&#x27;s largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan&#x27;s fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.

=== Industry ===

Japanese manufacturing and industry is very diversified, with a variety of advanced industries that are highly successful. Industry accounts for 30.1% (2017) of the nation&#x27;s GDP. The country&#x27;s manufacturing output is the third highest in the world.

Industry is concentrated in several regions, with the Kantō region surrounding Tokyo, (the Keihin industrial region) as well as the Kansai region surrounding Osaka (the Hanshin industrial region) and the Tōkai region surrounding Nagoya (the Chūkyō–Tōkai industrial region) the main industrial centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile of Osaka/Kansai&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other industrial centers include the southwestern part of Honshū and northern Shikoku around the Seto Inland Sea (the Setouchi industrial region); and the northern part of Kyūshū (Kitakyūshū). In addition, a long narrow belt of industrial centers called the Taiheiyō Belt is found between Tokyo and Fukuoka, established by particular industries, that have developed as mill towns.

Japan enjoys high technological development in many fields, including consumer electronics, automobile manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, optical fibers, optoelectronics, optical media, facsimile and copy machines, and fermentation processes in food and biochemistry. However, many Japanese companies are facing emerging rivals from the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan.

==== Automobile manufacturing ====
Japan is the third biggest producer of automobiles in the world. Toyota is currently the world&#x27;s largest car maker, and the Japanese car makers Nissan, Honda, Suzuki, and Mazda also count for some of the largest car makers in the world. By number, Japan is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of cars as of 2021.

===Mining and petroleum exploration===

Japan&#x27;s mining production has been minimal, and Japan has very little mining deposits. However, massive deposits of rare earths have been found off the coast of Japan. In the 2011 fiscal year, the domestic yield of crude oil was 820 thousand kiloliters, which was 0.4% of Japan&#x27;s total crude processing volume.

In 2019, Japan was the 2nd largest world producer of iodine, 4th largest worldwide producer of bismuth, the world&#x27;s 9th largest producer of sulfur and the 10th largest producer of gypsum.

=== Services ===
Japan&#x27;s service sector accounts for 68.7% (2017) of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, Aeon, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven &amp; i Holdings, KDDI and Japan Airlines counting as some of the largest companies in the world. two of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. The Koizumi government set Japan Post, one of the country&#x27;s largest providers of savings and insurance services for privatization by 2015. The six major &quot;keiretsus&quot; are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa. Japan is home to 251 companies from the Forbes Global 2000 or 12.55% (as of 2013).

==== Tourism ====
In 2012, Japan was the fifth most visited country in Asia and the Pacific, with over 8.3 million tourists. In 2013, due to the weaker yen and easier visa requirements for southwest Asian countries, Japan received a record 11.25 million visitors, which was higher than the government&#x27;s projected goal of 10 million visitors. The government hopes to attract 40 million visitors a year by the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Some of the most popular visited places include the Shinjuku, Ginza, Shibuya and Asakusa areas in Tokyo, and the cities of Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto, as well as Himeji Castle. Hokkaido is also a popular winter destination for visitors with several ski resorts and luxury hotels being built there.

Japan&#x27;s economy is less dependent on international tourism than those of other G7 countries and OECD countries in general; from 1995 to 2014, it was by far the least visited country in the G7 despite being the second largest country in the group, and as of 2013 was one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis. In 2013, international tourist receipts was 0.3% of Japan&#x27;s GDP, while the corresponding figure was 1.3% for the United States and 2.3% for France.

=== Infrastructure ===
In 2018, Japan ranked 5th overall in the World Bank&#x27;s Logistics Performance Index, and 2nd in the infrastructure category.

In 2005, one half of Japan&#x27;s energy was produced from petroleum, a fifth from coal, and 14% from natural gas. Nuclear power in Japan made a quarter of electricity production but due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster there has been a large desire to end Japan&#x27;s nuclear power program. In September 2013, Japan closed its last 50 nuclear power plants nationwide, causing the nation to be nuclear free. The country has since then opted to restart a few of its nuclear reactors.

Japan&#x27;s spendings on roads has been considered large. The 1.2 million kilometers of paved road are one of the major means of transportation. Japan has left-hand traffic. A single network of speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and are operated by toll-collecting enterprises. New and used cars are inexpensive, and the Japanese government has encouraged people to buy hybrid vehicles. Car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy-efficiency.

Rail transport is a major means of transport in Japan. Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; for instance, 6 passenger JR enterprises, Kintetsu Railway, Seibu Railway, and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain real estate or department stores next to stations, and many major stations have major department stores near them. The Japanese cities of Fukuoka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Yokohama all have subway systems. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. All trains are known for punctuality, and a delay of 90 seconds can be considered late for some train services.

There are 98 passenger and 175 total airports in Japan, and flying is a popular way to travel. The largest domestic airport, Tokyo International Airport, is Asia&#x27;s second busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The largest ports in Japan include Nagoya Port, the Port of Yokohama, the Port of Tokyo and the Port of Kobe.

About 84% of Japan&#x27;s energy is imported from other countries. Japan is the world&#x27;s largest liquefied natural gas importer, second largest coal importer, and third largest net oil importer. Given its heavy dependence on imported energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources. Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Japan has reduced dependence on petroleum as a source of energy from 77.4% in 1973 to about 43.7% in 2010 and increased dependence on natural gas and nuclear power. In September 2019, Japan will invest 10 billion on liquefied natural gas projects worldwide, in a strategy to boost the global LNG market and reinforce the security of energy supply. Other important energy source includes coal, and hydroelectricity is Japan&#x27;s biggest renewable energy source. Japan&#x27;s solar market is also currently booming. Kerosene is also used extensively for home heating in portable heaters, especially farther north. Many taxi companies run their fleets on liquefied natural gas. A recent success towards greater fuel economy was the introduction of mass-produced hybrid vehicles. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, who was working on Japan&#x27;s economic revival, signed a treaty with Saudi Arabia and UAE about the rising prices of oil, ensuring Japan&#x27;s stable deliveries from that region.

==Finance==

The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the third largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, as well as the 2nd largest stock market in Asia, with 2,292 listed companies. The Nikkei 225 and the TOPIX are the two important stock market indexes of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Stock Exchange, another major stock exchange in Japan, merged on 1 January 2013, creating one of the world&#x27;s largest stock exchanges. Other stock exchanges in Japan include the Nagoya Stock Exchange, Fukuoka Stock Exchange and Sapporo Securities Exchange.

==Labor force==
The unemployment rate in December 2013 was 3.7%, down 1.5 percentage points from the claimed unemployment rate of 5.2% in June 2009 due to the strong economic recovery.

In 2008 Japan&#x27;s labor force consisted of some 66 million workers—40% of whom were women—and was rapidly shrinking.
One major long-term concern for the Japanese labor force is its low birthrate. In 2005, the number of deaths in Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population had already started. While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would be to increase immigration, Japan has struggled to attract potential migrants despite immigration laws being relatively lenient (especially for high-skilled workers) compared to other developed countries. This is also apparent when looking at Japan&#x27;s work visa programme for &quot;specified skilled worker&quot;, which had less than 3,000 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000 overseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting migrants compared to other developed countries regardless of its immigration policies. A Gallup poll found that few potential migrants wished to migrate to Japan compared to other G7 countries, consistent with the country&#x27;s low migrant inflow.

In 1989, the predominantly public sector union confederation, SOHYO (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), merged with RENGO (Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) to form the Japanese Trade Union Confederation. Labor union membership is about 12 million.

As of 2019 Japan&#x27;s unemployment rate was the lowest in the G7. Its employment rate for the working-age population (15–64) was the highest in the G7.

== Law and government ==
Japan ranks 27th of 185 countries in the ease of doing business index 2013.

Japan has one of the smallest tax rates in the developed world. After deductions, the majority of workers are free from personal income taxes. Consumption tax rate is 10%, while corporate tax rates are high, second highest corporate tax rate in the world, at 36.8%. However, the House of Representatives has passed a bill which increased the consumption tax to 10% in October 2015. The government has also decided to reduce corporate tax and to phase out automobile tax.

In 2016, the IMF encouraged Japan to adopt an income policy that pushes firms to raise employee wages in combination with reforms to tackle the labor market dual tiered employment system to drive higher wages, on top of monetary and fiscal stimulus. Shinzo Abe has encouraged firms to raise wages by at least three per cent annually (the inflation target plus average productivity growth).

Shareholder activism is rare despite the fact that the corporate law gives shareholders strong powers over managers. Under Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, corporate governance reform has been a key initiative to encourage economic growth. In 2012 around 40% of leading Japanese companies had any independent directors while in 2016 most all have begun to appoint independent directors.

The government&#x27;s liabilities include the second largest public debt of any nation with debt of over one quadrillion yen, or 8,535,340,000,000 in USD. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called the situation &#x27;urgent&#x27;.

Japan&#x27;s central bank has the second largest foreign-exchange reserves after the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with over one trillion US Dollars in foreign reserves.

==Culture==
===Overview===
Nemawashi (根回し), or &quot;consensus building&quot;, in Japanese culture is an informal process of quietly laying the foundation for some proposed change or project, by talking to the people concerned, gathering support and feedback, and so forth. It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful &quot;nemawashi&quot; enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.

Japanese companies are known for management methods such as &quot;The Toyota Way&quot;. Kaizen (, Japanese for &quot;improvement&quot;) is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers. By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see Lean manufacturing). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country&#x27;s recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. The corporate application of the kaizen system has been criticized for neglecting or harming the quality of life of workers, particularly via the implementation of long working hours. However, according to the OECD, Japan&#x27;s average for annual hours worked per employee is lower than the OECD average and middling among G7 countries.

Some companies have powerful enterprise unions and &quot;shuntō&quot;. The Nenko system or Nenko Joretsu, as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of preferring to promote employees close to retirement. This is done to prioritize experience in executive positions and to allow older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement. The Nenko system has been criticised for leaving younger employees at a disadvantage against older employees who may be less capable.

Relationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms. Lifetime employment (&quot;shūshin koyō&quot;) and seniority-based career advancement have been common in the Japanese work environment. These practices have become less common in recent years.

 refers to someone whose income is salary based; particularly those working for corporations. Coined in Japan, the word&#x27;s frequent use by Japanese corporations and its prevalence in Japanese manga and anime has led to its adoption into and common usage within the English language to refer to Japanese white-collar workers, and it can be found in many English-language books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, wage slavery, and karōshi. The term salaryman refers almost exclusively to males.

An office lady, often abbreviated OL (Japanese: オーエル &quot;Ōeru&quot;), is a female office worker in Japan who performs generally pink collar tasks such as serving tea and secretarial or clerical work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often live with their parents well into early adulthood. Office ladies are usually full-time permanent staff, with little opportunity for promotion, and there is often a expectation that they leave their jobs if they get married.

 is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as &quot;underemployed&quot; or freelance workers. These people do not start a career after high school or university but instead usually live as parasite singles with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. Low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and lacking qualifications in the form of skilled labor experience makes it difficult for them to start a career at a later point in life.

, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as &quot;death from overwork&quot;, is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of karōshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.

, (sometimes also translated as &quot;corporate bouncers&quot;, &quot;meeting-men&quot;, or &quot;corporate blackmailers&quot;) are a form of specialized racketeer unique to Japan, and often associated with the yakuza that extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly humiliate companies and their management, usually in their . is a Japanese term for moneylender, or loan shark. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for salaryman and cash. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a &quot;sarakin&quot;. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals 100 billion. The biggest &quot;sarakin&quot; are publicly traded and often allied with big banks.

The first &quot;Western-style&quot; department store in Japan (called デパート, &quot;depāto&quot;) was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dating back to 1611 and becoming a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold luxurious products which contributed to them having sophisticated atmospheres. From the 1920s, private railway operators started to build department stores directly linked to their lines&#x27; terminuses. Seibu and Hankyu are examples of this practice. From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores have faced fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, and they have gradually declined in prominence. Still, &quot;depāto&quot; are seen as bastions of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for department stores are frequently given as presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services which can include foreign exchange, travel reservations, and ticket sales for local concerts and other events.

== Keiretsu ==

A is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. A &quot;keiretsu&quot; unequivocally exists as an identical form of business structure to the &quot;affiliate&quot;, or an associate. It is a type of business group. The prototypical &quot;keiretsu&quot; appeared in Japan during the &quot;economic miracle&quot; following World War II. Before Japan&#x27;s surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled vertical monopolies called &quot;zaibatsu&quot;. The Allies dismantled the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; were reintegrated. The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, &quot;keiretsu&quot; companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well. In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.

The major &quot;keiretsu&quot; were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the &quot;keiretsu&quot;&#x27;s member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the &quot;keiretsu&quot; and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimize the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.

There are two types of &quot;keiretsu&quot;: vertical and horizontal. Vertical &quot;keiretsu&quot; illustrates the organization and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal &quot;keiretsu&quot; shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.

The Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the &quot;keiretsu&quot;. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the &quot;keiretsu&quot;: Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, now known as MUFG Bank. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.

Generally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old &quot;keiretsu&quot; system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of &quot;keiretsu&quot; alliances. While the &quot;keiretsu&quot; still exist, they are not as centralized or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily &quot;bailed out&quot; by their banks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent shareholders.

== Mergers and acquisitions ==
Japanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018. This cumulates to a total value of US$2.636 billion which translates to ¥281.469 trillion. In 1999, there was an all-time high in terms of value of deals with almost US$220 billion. The most active year so far was 2017 with over 3,150 deals, but only a total value of US$114 billion (see graph &quot;M&amp;A in Japan by number and value&quot;).

Here is a list of the most important deals (ranked by value in US$ [billion]) in Japanese history:

Among the top 50 deals by value, 92% of the time the acquiring nation is Japan. Foreign direct investment is playing a much smaller role than national M&amp;A in Japan.

=== Postal services ===
Japan&#x27;s first modern postal service got started in 1871, with mail professionally traveling between Kyoto and Tokyo as well as the latter city and Osaka. This took place in the midst of the rapid industrialization and social reorganization that the Meiji period symbolized in Japanese history. Given how the nation&#x27;s railroad technology was in its infancy, Japan&#x27;s growing postal system relied heavily on human-powered transport, including rickshaws, as well as horse-drawn methods of delivery. For example, while commemorating the 50th anniversary of Japan&#x27;s postal service, the country&#x27;s 1921 government released decorative postcards depicting intrepid horseback riders carrying the mail.

In communication terms, British technicians had already been employed in assisting with Japanese lighthouses, and the country&#x27;s budding mail system looked to hybridize British ideas with local practicalities. Shipping along the nation&#x27;s coastline in particular demonstrates a key instance of how the Japanese economy developed: the government closely working with private companies to industrially expand in a way that met social needs while also allowing for large profits. Mitsubishi&#x27;s contract for mail transport by sea proved lucrative enough that it assisted with the firm becoming one of the famous &quot;zaibatsu&quot;.

Since 2007, the nation&#x27;s post offices have been managed by the firm Japan Post Network, which, in turn, is a part of the larger Japan Post Holdings conglomerate. As of December 2017, the smaller company has been managed by CEO Koji Furukawa. The simple Japanese postal mark, predating mass literacy in the nation, is still used to this day.

==General background and history==

An example of the dawn of modern Japanese communications is the shift in newspaper publication. News vendors of the Tokugawa period, taking place from 1603 to 1867, typically promoted publications by reading the contents aloud and handed out papers that were printed from hand-graven blocks. Widespread adoption of movable type took place as Japanese society modernized. In particular, &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, a national daily newspaper that became the country&#x27;s largest by circulation, was founded in 1874 and designed to be read in detail using standard Japanese vernacular. Five such dailies got started early in the Meiji period, taking place from 1868 to 1912. &quot;Yomiuri&quot; specifically took direct influence from American publications controlled by William Randolph Hearst.

The first such mass newspaper to be founded was the &quot;Nagasaki Shipping List &amp; Advertiser&quot;, established in 1861 in Nagasaki by the Englishman A.W. Hansard. Its first issue ran 22 June of that year. The newspaper, which notably discussed matters in the English language, laid the groundwork for Hansard&#x27;s later publication &quot;Japan Herald&quot;.

The broadcast industry has been dominated by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (Nippon Hoso Kyokai—NHK) since its founding in 1925.

In the postwar period, NHK&#x27;s budget and operations were under the purview of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Broadcasting Law of 1950 provides for independent management and programming by NHK. Television broadcasting began in 1953, and color television was introduced in 1960. Cable television was introduced in 1969. In 1978 an experimental broadcast satellite with two color television channels was launched. Operational satellites for television use were launched between 1984 and 1990. Television viewing spread so rapidly that, by 1987, 99 percent of Japan&#x27;s households had color television sets and the average family had its set on at least five hours a day. Starting in 1987, NHK began full-scale experimental broadcasting on two channels using satellite-to-audience signals, thus bringing service to remote and mountainous parts of the country that earlier had experienced poor reception. The new system also provided twenty-four hours a day, nonstop service.

In the late 1980s, NHK operated two public television and three radio networks nationally, producing about 1,700 programs per week. Its general and education programs were broadcast through more than 6,900 television stations and nearly 330 AM and more than 500 FM radio transmitting stations. Comprehensive service in twenty-one languages is available throughout the world.

Rapid improvements, innovations, and diversification in communications technology, including optical fiber cables, communications satellites, and fax machines, led to rapid growth of the communications industry in the 1980s. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, owned by the government until 1985, had dominated the communications industry until April 1985, when new common carriers, including Daini Denden, were permitted to enter the field. NTT Worldwide Telecommunications Corp (Kokusai Denshin Denwa Company, commonly known as KDD, now part of KDDI Inc.) lost its monopoly hold on international communications activities in 1989, when Nihon Kokusai Tsushin and other private overseas communications firms began operations.

In 1992 Japan also had more than 12,000 televisions stations, and the country had more than 350 radio stations, 300 AM radio stations and 58 FM. Broadcasting innovations in the 1980s included sound multiplex (two-language or stereo) broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, and in 1985 the University of the Air and teletext services were inaugurated.

Japan has been the world leader in telecommunications in the 1980s, but this position that has been challenged by the United States&#x27; dot-com industry in the 1990s and the emerging tiger states in Asia. While the United States is leading in digital content, South Korea is leading in broadband access, India is leading in software, and Taiwan is leading in research and development.

Japan went into the 21st century after achieving widespread saturation with telecommunication devices. For instance, by 2008 the government&#x27;s Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry stated that about 75 million people used mobile phones to access the Internet, accounting for about 82% of individual internet users.

<doc id="15580" wikidata="Q1076601" url="?curid=15580" title="Transport in Japan">
<text>Transport in Japan is modern and highly developed. Japan&#x27;s transport sector stands out for its energy efficiency: it uses less energy per person compared to other countries, thanks to a high share of rail transport and low overall travel distances. Transport in Japan is also very expensive in international comparison, reflecting high tolls and taxes, particularly on automobile transport.
Japan&#x27;s spending on roads has been large. The of paved road are the main means of transport. Traffic in Japan drives on the left. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities, which are operated by toll-collecting enterprises.

Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transport markets; for instance, seven JR Group companies, Kintetsu Railway, Seibu Railway, and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain real estate or department stores next to stations. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. All trains are known for punctuality.

There are 176 airports, and the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, was by passenger traffic the third-busiest in Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world in 2018, but not in the top ten in 2022. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The largest ports include Nagoya Port.

== Railway ==

In Japan, railways are a major means of passenger transport, especially for mass and high-speed transport between major cities and for commuter transport in metropolitan areas. Seven Japan Railways Group companies, state-owned until 1987, cover most parts of Japan. There also are railway services operated by private rail companies, regional governments, and companies funded by both regional governments and private companies.

Total railways of include several track gauges, the most common of which is narrow gauge, with of track of which is electrified.

Fukuoka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, and Yokohama have subway systems.

Most Japanese people traveled on foot until the later part of the 19th century. The first railway was built between Tokyo&#x27;s Shimbashi Station and Yokohama&#x27;s former Yokohama Station (now Sakuragichō Station) in 1872. Many more railways developed soon afterward.

Modern Japan is home to one of the world&#x27;s most developed transport networks. Mass transport is well developed in Japan, but the road system lags and is inadequate for the number of cars owned in Japan. This is often attributed to the fact that road construction is difficult in Japan because of its very high population density, and the limited amount of available usable land for road construction.

===Shinkansen (bullet train)===
The Shinkansen, or &quot;bullet trains&quot;, as they are known colloquially, are the high-speed rail trains that run across Japan. The of 8 Shinkansen lines run on completely separate lines from their commuting train counterparts, with a few exceptions. Shinkansen takes up a large portion of the long-distance travel in Japan, with the whole system carrying over 10 billion passengers in its lifetime. 1,114,000 journeys are made daily, with the fastest train being the JR East E5 and E6 series trains, which operate at a maximum speed of . Shinkansen trains are known to be very safe, with no accident-related deaths or injuries from passengers in their 50-plus year history. Shinkansen trains are also known to be very punctual, following suit with all other Japanese transport; in 2003, the average delay per train on the Tokaido Shinkansen was a mere 6 seconds. Japan has been trying to sell its Shinkansen technology overseas, and has struck deals to help build systems in India, Thailand, and the United States.

The first Shinkansen line opened between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964, and trains can now make the journey in 2 hours and 25 minutes. Additional Shinkansen lines connect Tokyo to Aomori, Niigata, Kanazawa, and Hakodate and Osaka to Fukuoka and Kagoshima, with new lines under construction to Tsuruga and Sapporo. A separate line heads out to Nagasaki, albeit through a separate relay service.

Japan has been developing maglev technology trains, and broke the world maglev speed record in April 2015 with a train traveling at the speed of . The Chūō Shinkansen, a commercial maglev service, is currently under construction from Tokyo to Nagoya and Osaka, and when completed in 2045 will cover the distance in 67 minutes, half the time of the current Shinkansen.

==Road==


According to Japan Statistical Yearbook 2015 , Japan in April 2012 had approximately 1,215,000 km of roads made up of 1,022,000 km of city, town and village roads, 129,000 km of prefectural roads, 55,000 km of general national highways and 8,050 km of national expressways. The Foreign Press Center/Japan cites a total length of expressways at 7,641 km (fiscal 2008). A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. Hokkaido has a separate network, and Okinawa Island has a highway of this type. In the year 2005, the toll collecting companies, formerly Japan Highway Public Corporation, have been transformed into private companies in public ownership, and there are plans to sell parts of them. This policy aims to encourage competition and decrease tolls.

Road passenger and freight transport expanded considerably during the 1980s as private ownership of motor vehicles greatly increased along with the quality and extent of the nation&#x27;s roads. Bus companies including the JR Bus companies operate long-distance bus services on the nation&#x27;s expanding expressway network. In addition to relatively low fares and deluxe seating, the buses are well utilized because they continue service during the night when air and train services are limited.

The cargo sector grew rapidly in the 1980s, recording 274.2 billion tonne-kilometres in 1990. The freight handled by motor vehicles, mainly trucks, in 1990, was over 6 billion tonnes, accounting for 90 percent of domestic freight tonnage and about 50 percent of tonne-kilometers.

Recent large infrastructure projects were the construction of the Great Seto Bridge and the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line (opened 1997).

===Road safety===

Road fatalities have decreased in Japan, due in part to stricter enforcement of drunk driving laws:
*2004 saw 7,358 deaths on Japanese roads,
*2017 had 3,694 deaths for 125 million population,
*2019 saw 3,215 deaths, the lowest it has been since 1948, with a rate of 25.4 deaths per million lower than many European nations, and close to the UK&#x27;s rates.

In Tokyo, road safety is 13 killed per million.

==Air==

In 2013, Japan had the fourth largest passenger air market in the world with 105,913,000 passengers. In 2013 Japan had 98 airports. The main international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The main domestic hub is Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport), by passenger traffic the third-busiest in Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world in 2018, but not in the top ten in 2022; other major traffic hubs include Osaka International Airport, New Chitose Airport outside Sapporo, and Fukuoka Airport. 14 heliports are estimated to exist (1999).

The two main airlines are Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Other passenger carriers include Skymark Airlines, Solaseed Air, Air Do, StarFlyer and Fuji Dream Airlines. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, formerly Northwest Airlines, are major international operators from Narita Airport.

Domestic air travel in Japan has historically been highly regulated. From 1972, the three major domestic airlines (JAL, ANA, and JAS) were allocated certain routes, with JAL and ANA sharing trunk routes, and ANA and JAS sharing local feeder routes. JAL and JAS have since been merged to help compete with ANA. JAL also had a flag-carrier monopoly on international routes until 1986. Airfares were set by the government until 2000, although carriers had the freedom to adjust the standard fares starting in 1995 (when discounts of up to 50% were permitted). Today, fares can be set by carriers, but the government retains the ability to veto fares that are too high.

==Maritime==
There are 1770 km of waterways in Japan; seagoing craft ply all coastal inland seas.

There are some 994 ports in Japan as of April 2014. There are overlapping classifications of these ports, some of which are multi-purpose, e.g. cargo, passenger, naval, and fishery. The five designated &quot;super&quot; container ports are Yokkaichi, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kobe, and Osaka. 23 are designated major/international, 125 designated as important, while there are also purely fisherman ports.

The twenty-three major seaports designated as special, important ports by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism: Chiba, Fushiki/Toyama, Himeji, Hiroshima, Kawasaki, Kitakyushu, Kobe, Kudamatsu, Muroran, Nagoya, Niigata, Osaka, Sakai/Senpoku, Sendai/Shiogama, Shimizu, Shimonoseki, Tokyo, Tomakomai, Wakayama, Yokkaichi, and Yokohama.

Japan has 988 ships of or over on its national ship register, totaling . However, only 17% of Japanese-owned capacity is registered in Japan. UNCTAD estimates that 224 million dwt of tonnage is controlled by Japanese owners, making Japan the second largest beneficial owner of tonnage after Greece.

Ferries connect Hokkaido to Honshu, and Okinawa Island to Kyushu and Honshu. They also connect other smaller islands and the main islands. The scheduled international passenger routes are to China, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Coastal and cross-channel ferries on the main islands decreased in routes and frequencies following the development of bridges and expressways but some are still operating (as of 2007).

<doc id="15582" wikidata="Q518530" url="?curid=15582" title="Foreign relations of Japan">
<text>The are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.

Japan maintains diplomatic relations with every United Nations member state except for North Korea, in addition to UN observer states Holy See, as well as Kosovo, Cook Islands and Niue.

Japanese foreign relations had earliest beginnings in the 14th century and after their opening to the world in 1854 with the Convention of Kanagawa. Japan rapidly modernized and built a strong military. It was imperialistic seeking control of nearby areas—with major wars against China and Russia. It gained control of parts of China and Manchuria, as well as Korea and islands such as Taiwan and Okinawa. It lost in World War II and was stripped of all of its foreign conquests and possessions. See History of Japanese foreign relations. American general Douglas MacArthur, acting for the Allied powers, supervised occupied Japan 1945–51. Since occupation ended diplomatic policy has been based on close partnership with the United States and seeking trade agreements, In the Cold War, Japan was demilitarized but it allied with the U.S. in the confrontation with the Soviet Union. It played a major support role in the Korean War (1950–1953). In the rapid economic developments in the 1960s and 1970s, Japan was one of the major economic powers in the world.

By the 1990s Japan participated in the Peacekeeping operations by the UN, and sent troops to Cambodia, Mozambique, Golan Heights and the East Timor. After the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, Japanese naval vessels have been assigned to resupply duties in the Indian Ocean to the present date. The Ground Self-Defense Force also dispatched their troops to Southern Iraq for the restoration of basic infrastructures.

==Foreign policy==
Beyond its immediate neighbors, Japan has pursued a more active foreign policy in recent years, recognizing the responsibility which accompanies its economic strength. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stressed a changing direction in a policy speech to the National Diet: &quot;Japan aspires to become a hub of human resource development as well as for research and intellectual contribution to further promote cooperation in the field of peace-building.&quot; This follows the modest success of a Japanese-conceived peace plan which became the foundation for nationwide elections in Cambodia in 1998.

List of countries which Japan maintains diplomatic relations with:
== Bilateral relations ==

=== Africa ===
Japan is increasingly active in Africa. In May 2008, the first Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize will be awarded at Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV), which signals a changing emphasis in bilateral relations.
=== Americas ===

Japan has continued to extend significant support to development and technical assistance projects in Latin America.
=== Asia ===

==== Southeast Asia ====

By 1990 Japan&#x27;s interaction with the vast majority of Asia-Pacific countries, especially its burgeoning economic exchanges, was multifaceted and increasingly important to the recipient countries. The developing countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regarded Japan as critical to their development. Japan&#x27;s aid to the ASEAN countries totaled US$1.9 billion in Japanese fiscal year (FY) 1988 versus about US$333 million for the United States during U.S. FY 1988. As of the late 1980s, Japan was the number one foreign investor in the ASEAN countries, with cumulative investment as of March 1989 of about US$14.5 billion, more than twice that of the United States. Japan&#x27;s share of total foreign investment in ASEAN countries in the same period ranged from 70 to 80 percent in Thailand to 20 percent in Indonesia.

In the late 1980s, the Japanese government was making a concerted effort to enhance its diplomatic stature, especially in Asia. Toshiki Kaifu&#x27;s much publicized spring 1991 tour of five Southeast Asian nations—Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines—culminated in a 3 May major foreign policy address in Singapore, in which he called for a new partnership with the ASEAN and pledged that Japan would go beyond the purely economic sphere to seek an &quot;appropriate role in the political sphere as a nation of peace.&quot; As evidence of this new role, Japan took an active part in promoting negotiations to resolve the Cambodian conflict.

In 1997, the ASEAN member nations and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the ASEAN Plus Three meetings. In 2005 the ASEAN plus Three countries together with India, Australia and New Zealand held the inaugural East Asia Summit (EAS).

==== South Asia ====
In South Asia, Japan&#x27;s role is mainly that of an aid donor. Japan&#x27;s aid to seven South Asian countries totaled US$1.1 billion in 1988. Except for Pakistan, which received heavy inputs of aid from the United States, all other South Asian countries received most of their aid from Japan as of the early 1990s. Four South Asian nations—India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka—are in the top ten list of Tokyo&#x27;s aid recipients worldwide as of the early 1990s. A point to note is that Indian Government has received no aid since the 2004 Tsunami that struck India but Indian registered NGOs look to Japan for much investment in their projects.

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu signaled a broadening of Japan&#x27;s interest in South Asia with his swing through the region in April 1990. In an address to the Indian parliament, Kaifu stressed the role of free markets and democracy in bringing about &quot;a new international order,&quot; and he emphasized the need for a settlement of the Kashmir territorial dispute between India and Pakistan and for economic liberalization to attract foreign investment and promote dynamic growth. To India, which was very short of hard currency, Kaifu pledged a new concessional loan of ¥100 billion (about US$650 million) for the coming year.

Japan’s engagement with the Middle East region reflects a sophisticated, multi-dimensional approach that has evolved since the 1973 oil crisis. Initially driven by energy security concerns, Japan’s strategy now includes economic partnerships, cultural exchanges, and political collaboration. By strengthening ties with both energy-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia and non-energy-focused countries such as Egypt, Japan has built a network of interdependence that extends beyond oil to broader strategic and cultural dimensions.

=== Europe ===

In what became known as the Tenshō embassy, the first ambassadors from Japan to European powers reached Lisbon, Portugal in August 1584. From Lisbon, the ambassadors left for the Vatican in Rome, which was the main goal of their journey. The embassy returned to Japan in 1590, after which time the four nobleman ambassadors were ordained by Alessandro Valignano as the first Japanese Jesuit fathers.

A second embassy, headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga and sponsored by Date Masamune, was also a diplomatic mission to the Vatican. The embassy left 28 October 1613 from Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, in the northern Tōhoku region of Japan, where Date was &quot;daimyō&quot;. It traveled to Europe by way of New Spain, arriving in Acapulco on 25 January 1614, Mexico City in March, Havana in July, and finally Seville on 23 October 1614. After a short stop-over in France, the embassy reached Rome in November 1615, where it was received by Pope Paul V. After return travel by way of New Spain and the Philippines, the embassy reached the harbor of Nagasaki in August 1620. While the embassy was gone, Japan had undergone significant change, starting with the 1614 Osaka Rebellion, leading to a 1616 decree from the Tokugawa shogunate that all interaction with non-Chinese foreigners was confined to Hirado and Nagasaki. In fact, the only western country that was allowed to trade with Japan was the Dutch Republic. This was the beginning of &quot;sakoku&quot;, where Japan was essentially closed to the western world until 1854.

===Modern era===

The cultural and non-economic ties with Western Europe grew significantly during the 1980s, although the economic nexus remained by far the most important element of Japanese – West European relations throughout the decade. Events in West European relations, as well as political, economic, or even military matters, were topics of concern to most Japanese commentators because of the immediate implications for Japan. The major issues centered on the effect of the coming West European economic unification on Japan&#x27;s trade, investment, and other opportunities in Western Europe. Some West European leaders were anxious to restrict Japanese access to the newly integrated European Union, but others appeared open to Japanese trade and investment. In partial response to the strengthening economic ties among nations in Western Europe and to the United States–Canada–Mexico North American Free Trade Agreement, Japan and other countries along the Asia-Pacific rim began moving in the late 1980s toward greater economic cooperation.

On 18 July 1991, after several months of difficult negotiations, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu signed a joint statement with the Dutch prime minister and head of the European Community Council, Ruud Lubbers, and with the European Commission president, Jacques Delors, pledging closer Japanese – European Community consultations on foreign relations, scientific and technological cooperation, assistance to developing countries, and efforts to reduce trade conflicts. Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials hoped that this agreement would help to broaden Japanese – European Community political links and raise them above the narrow confines of trade disputes.

==Disputed territories==

Japan has several territorial disputes with its neighbors concerning the control of certain outlying islands.

Japan contests Russia&#x27;s control of the Southern Kuril Islands (including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai group) which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea&#x27;s assertions concerning Liancourt Rocks (Japanese: &quot;Takeshima&quot;, Korean: &quot;Dokdo&quot;) are acknowledged, but not accepted by Japan. Japan has strained relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) over the Senkaku Islands; and with the People&#x27;s Republic of China over the status of Okinotorishima.

His other credits include &quot;When They See Us&quot; (2019), &quot;Little Fires Everywhere&quot; (2020), and &quot;Doctor Odyssey&quot; (2024).

Outside of television, he came to prominence with his role in the &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot; film series (1992–1996). His other film appearances include &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; (1998), &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (1998), &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999), &quot;The Skulls&quot; (2000), &quot;Gossip&quot; (2000), &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot; (2001), &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; (2002), &quot;Cursed&quot; (2005), &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006), and &quot;Shutter&quot; (2008).

==Early life==
Jackson was born on June 11, 1978, in Vancouver to parents John and Fiona. His mother is a casting director. Jackson&#x27;s father is from Texas, and his mother is a native of Ballyfermot, a surburb of Dublin, Ireland. She immigrated to North America in the late 1960s. He has a younger sister, Aisleagh, and two older half brothers, Jonathan and Lyman. He was raised Roman Catholic.

Jackson lived in California until the age of 8 when he moved to Vancouver with his mother and younger sister; he has said that his father was a bad parent and husband and abandoned the family when they were in the U.S. He attended Ideal Mini School and later switched to Kitsilano Secondary School. He attended high school with actor Ryan Reynolds.

==Career==

Jackson started acting in a small role in the film &quot;Crooked Hearts&quot; in 1991. The next year, he played the role of Charlie in a musical version of &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. At this point, with the help of the play&#x27;s casting director Laura Kennedy, he joined the William Morris Agency. Soon after, he landed the role of Charlie (#96) in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; series, playing a young and aspiring hockey player.

Jackson went on to appear as Pacey Witter on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, which was created by Kevin Williamson and ran on the WB network from 1998 to 2003, and also starred James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, and Katie Holmes. While the show was on hiatus, he appeared in several movies including &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; that also starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe), &quot;The Skulls&quot;, &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot;, &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; and a short cameo in the remake of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; in which he appears as himself in a poker scene with Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Holly Marie Combs. In 2000, he also guest-starred in Season 12 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, voicing the character of Jesse Grass, a &quot;hunky environmentalist&quot; and love interest for Lisa Simpson in the episode &quot;Lisa the Tree Hugger&quot;. He also was cast as &quot;Beau&quot; in the movie &quot;Gossip&quot; in 2000 with actors James Marsden, Kate Hudson and Norman Reedus.

Shortly after &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; ended in 2003, Jackson played the lead role in films alongside Dennis Hopper (&quot;Americano&quot;), Harvey Keitel (&quot;Shadows in the Sun&quot;), and Donald Sutherland (&quot;Aurora Borealis&quot;). In 2005, Jackson moved to the UK and made his stage debut on the London West End with Patrick Stewart in David Mamet&#x27;s two-man play, &quot;A Life in the Theatre&quot;. The play was a critical and popular success, and ran from February to April of that year. Jackson said that he would consider returning to the stage, to try his hand on Broadway. His next film role was in &quot;Bobby&quot;, directed by Emilio Estevez, Jackson&#x27;s co-star from &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot;. He played a lead role in &quot;Shutter&quot;, a U.S. remake of film of the same name. He starred and acted as executive producer in the Canadian independent film &quot;One Week&quot;, which opened on March 6, 2009.
From 2008 to 2013, Jackson played the lead role of Peter Bishop in the science-fiction series &quot;Fringe&quot;, created by J. J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The series was the second-highest rated new show of the 2008–2009 season after &quot;The Mentalist&quot;. BuddyTV ranked him #9 on its &quot;TV&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Men of 2010&quot; list, #19 in 2011 and #14 in 2012.

Jackson was nominated for a Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the film &quot;One Week&quot;. He won the award on April 12, 2010. He held and hosted the satirical Pacey-Con in 2010, directly across the street from the Comic-Con, sporting a bowling shirt and giving out fan fiction, written by &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; fans, to those waiting in the Comic-Con entrance line. Footage of the event was recorded for a video, entitled &#x27;Pacey-Con&#x27;, which he was filming for Will Ferrell&#x27;s Funny or Die celebrity humor website. In 2013, Jackson appeared in the IFC film &quot;Inescapable&quot; with Marisa Tomei and Alexander Siddig. Jackson wrote the first story from the comic book trilogy &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, titled &quot;Peter and the Machine&quot;. Jackson starred in the successful television show &quot;The Affair&quot;, where he played Cole Lockhart, the protagonist husband of the unfaithful Alison Lockhart.

In March 2018, Jackson made his theatrical debut on Broadway in &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;, where he played James Leeds, an unconventional teacher at a school for the deaf who gets in a conflicted professional and romantic relationship with a deaf former student, Sarah Norman (Lauren Ridloff). The play ran through May 2018.

In 2019, Jackson starred as defense attorney Mickey Joseph in the miniseries &quot;When They See Us&quot;.

In 2020, Jackson co-starred with Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington in the miniseries &quot;Little Fires Everywhere&quot; based on the novel by Celeste Ng.

Jackson was cast as Dr. Christopher Duntsch, a neurosurgeon who was convicted of intentionally maiming his patient, in &quot;Dr. Death&quot; which was based on the podcast of the same name, replacing Jamie Dornan.

In 2023, Jackson played the lead in the series &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; with Lizzy Caplan, inspired by the 1980s thriller film of the same name.

==Personal life==
Jackson was in a relationship with &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; co-star Katie Holmes during the first two seasons of the show&#x27;s run. Holmes said that Jackson was her first love.

From 2006 to 2016, he was in a relationship with German actress Diane Kruger. 

Jackson began a relationship with actress Jodie Turner-Smith in 2018. They married on August 18, 2019. 
On April 13, 2020, the couple welcomed their daughter. In October 2023, it was revealed that Turner-Smith had filed for divorce from Jackson.

In December 2023, Jackson and fellow actor Lupita Nyong&#x27;o confirmed they are dating. In October 2024, Nyong&#x27;o announced they were no longer together. 

Jackson owns his childhood home in Topanga, California. 
In 2025, the house burned down during the Palisades Fire. He previously lived in Wilmington, North Carolina, where &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; was filmed, and in New York City, where &quot;Fringe&quot; filmed its first season. In 2009, he moved back to Vancouver to shoot four seasons of the show before the last episode was aired on January 18, 2013.

Jackson is a fan of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team.

<text>John Ray FRS (29 November 1627 – 17 January 1705) was a Christian English naturalist widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English parson-naturalists. Until 1670, he wrote his name as John Wray. From then on, he used &#x27;Ray&#x27;, after &quot;having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him&quot;. He published important works on botany, zoology, and natural theology. His classification of plants in his &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;, was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified by repeated sub-division into groups according to a pre-conceived series of characteristics they have or have not, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. He was among the first to attempt a biological definition for the concept of &quot;species&quot;, as &quot;a group of morphologically similar organisms arising from a common ancestor&quot;. Another significant contribution to taxonomy was his division of plants into those with two seedling leaves (dicotyledons) or only one (monocotyledons), a division used in taxonomy today.

== Life ==

=== Early life ===


John Ray was born in the village of Black Notley in Essex. He is said to have been born in the smithy, his father having been the village blacksmith. After studying at Braintree school, he was sent at the age of sixteen to Cambridge University: studying at Trinity College. Initially at Catharine Hall, his tutor was Daniel Duckfield, and later transferred to Trinity where his tutor was James Duport, and his &quot;intimate friend&quot; and fellow-pupil the celebrated Isaac Barrow. Ray was chosen minor fellow of Trinity in 1649, and later major fellow. He held many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek (1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655), &quot;praelector&quot; (1657), junior dean (1657), and college steward (1659 and 1660); and according to the habit of the time, he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at Great St Mary&#x27;s, long before he took holy orders on 23 December 1660. Among these sermons were his discourses on &quot;The wisdom of God manifested in the works of the creation&quot;, and &quot;Deluge and Dissolution of the World&quot;. Ray was also highly regarded as a tutor and he communicated his own passion for natural history to several pupils. Ray&#x27;s student, Isaac Barrow, helped Francis Willughby learn mathematics and Ray collaborated with Willughby later. It was at Trinity that he came under the influence of John Wilkins, when the latter was appointed master of the college in 1659.

=== Later life and family ===

After leaving Cambridge in 1663 he spent some time travelling both in Britain and the continent. In 1673, Ray married Margaret Oakley of Launton in Oxfordshire; in 1676 he went to Middleton Hall near Tamworth, and in 1677 to Falborne (or Faulkbourne) Hall in Essex. Finally, in 1679, he removed to his birthplace at Black Notley, where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet and uneventful, although he had poor health, including chronic sores. Ray kept writing books and corresponded widely on scientific matters, collaborating with his doctor and contemporary Samuel Dale. He lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age of seventy-seven, dying at Black Notley. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul where there is a memorial to him. He is widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English parson-naturalists.


== Work ==

At Cambridge, Ray spent much of his time in the study of natural history, a subject which would occupy him for most of his life, from 1660 to the beginning of the eighteenth century. When Ray found himself unable to subscribe as required by the Act of Uniformity 1662 he, along with 13 other college fellows, resigned his fellowship on 24 August 1662 rather than swear to the declaration that the Solemn League and Covenant was not binding on those who had taken it. Tobias Smollett quoted the reasoning given in the biography of Ray by William Derham:

His religious views were generally in accord with those imposed under the restoration of Charles II of England, and (though technically a nonconformist) he continued as a layman in the Established Church of England.

From this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his pupil Francis Willughby, who made Ray his constant companion while he lived. They travelled extensively, carrying out field observations and collecting specimens of botany, ornithology, ichthyology, mammals, reptiles and insects. Initially they agreed that Ray would take responsibility for the plants, and Willughby for birds, beasts, fishes, and insects. Willughby arranged that after his death, Ray would have 6 shillings a year for educating Willughby&#x27;s two sons.

In the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other pupils (Philip Skippon and Nathaniel Bacon) on a tour through Europe, from which he returned in March 1666, parting from Willughby at Montpellier, whence the latter continued his journey into Spain. He had previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by George Scott in 1760, under the title of &quot;Mr Ray&#x27;s Itineraries&quot;. Ray himself published an account of his foreign travel in 1673, entitled &quot;Observations topographical, moral, and physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy, and France&quot;. From this tour Ray and Willughby returned laden with collections, on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

In 1667 Ray was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1669 he and Willughby published a paper on &quot;Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees&quot;. In 1671, he presented the research of Francis Jessop on formic acid to the Royal Society.

Following Willughby&#x27;s death in 1672, Ray took on the responsibility of bringing both Willughby&#x27;s work and his own to publication. Ray was left with an ornithology and ichthyology to edit as well as his own work dealing with mammals, reptiles and insects. Although he presented the
&quot;Ornithologia&quot; (1676) as Willughby&#x27;s, he made extensive contributions to the work. His task became more difficult after the death of Lady Cassandra, Willughby&#x27;s mother, on July 25, 1675. Lady Cassandra had supported Ray&#x27;s continued work, but the widow Willughby had no interest in her late husband&#x27;s scientific interests or his scientific friends. Ray was no longer allowed to instruct the children, and Ray and his wife Margaret Oakley were forced to leave the Willughby household in Middleton. Critically, Ray lost access to the Willughby collections, notes and manuscripts at this time. The plants gathered on his British tours had already been described in his &quot;Catalogus plantarum Angliae&quot; (1670), which formed the basis for later English floras. He had likely already used the botanical collections to lay much of the groundwork of his &quot;Methodus plantarum nova&quot; (1682), His great &quot;Historia generalis plantarum&quot; appeared in 3 vols. in 1686, 1688, 1704.

In the 1690s, he published three volumes on religion—the most popular being &quot;The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation&quot; (1691), an essay describing evidence that all in nature and space is God&#x27;s creation as in the Bible is affirmed. In this volume, he moved on from the naming and cataloguing of species like his successor Carl Linnaeus. Instead, Ray considered species&#x27; lives and how nature worked as a whole, giving facts that are arguments for God&#x27;s will expressed in His creation of all &#x27;visible and invisible&#x27; (Colossians 1:16).
Ray gave an early description of dendrochronology, explaining how to find the ash tree&#x27;s age from its tree-rings.

=== Taxonomy ===

Ray&#x27;s work on plant taxonomy spanned a wide range of thought, starting with an approach that was predominantly in the tradition of the herbalists and Aristotelian, but becoming increasingly theoretical and finally rejecting Aristotelianism. Despite his early adherence to Aristotelian tradition, his first botanical work, the &quot;Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium&quot; (1660), was almost entirely descriptive, being arranged alphabetically. His model was an account by Bauhin of the plants growing around Basel in 1622 and was the first English county flora, covering about 630 species. However at the end of the work he appended a brief taxonomy which he stated followed the usage of Bauhin and other herbalists.

==== System of classification ====

Ray&#x27;s system, starting with his Cambridge catalogue, began with the division between the imperfect or lower plants (Cryptogams), and perfect (&quot;planta perfecta&quot;) higher plants (Seed plants). The latter he divided by life forms, e.g. trees (&quot;arbores&quot;), shrubs (&quot;frutices&quot;), subshrubs (&quot;suffrutices&quot;) and herbaceous plants (&quot;herbae&quot;) and lastly grouping them by common characteristics. The trees he divided into 8 groups, e.g. &quot;Pomiferae&quot; (including apple and pear). The shrubs he placed in 2 groups, &quot;Spinosi&quot; (Berberis etc.) and &quot;Non Spinosi&quot; (Jasmine etc.). The subshrubs formed a single group and the herbs into 21 groups.

Division of Herbae;

# Bulbosae (&quot;Lilium&quot; etc.)
# Tuberosae (&quot;Asphodelus&quot; etc.)
# Umbelliferae (&quot;Foeniculum&quot; etc.)
# Verticellatae (&quot;Mentha&quot; etc.)
# Spicatae (&quot;Lysimachia&quot; etc.)
# Scandentes (&quot;Cucurbita&quot; etc.)
# Corymbiferae (&quot;Tanacetum&quot;)
# Pappiflorae (&quot;Senecio&quot; etc.)
# Capitatae (&quot;Scabiosa&quot; etc.)
# Campaniformes (&quot;Digitalis&quot; etc.)
# Coronariae (&quot;Caryophyllus&quot; etc.)
# Rotundifoliae (&quot;Cyclamen&quot; etc.)
# Nervifoliae (&quot;Plantago&quot; etc.)
# Stellatae (&quot;Rubia&quot; etc.)
# Cerealia (&quot;Legumina&quot; etc.)
# Succulentae (&quot;Sedum&quot; etc.)
# Graminifoliae (&quot;Gramina&quot; etc.)
# [omitted]
# Oleraceae (&quot;Beta&quot; etc.)
# Aquaticae (&quot;Nymphaea&quot; etc.)
# Marinae (&quot;Fucus&quot; etc.)
# Saxatiles (&quot;Asplenium&quot; etc)
As outlined in his &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot; (1685–1703):
* Herbae (Herbaceous plants)
** Imperfectae (Cryptogams)
** Perfectae (Seed plants)
*** Monocotyledons
*** Dicotyledons
* Arborae (Trees)
** Monocotyledons
** Dicotyledons

==== Definition of species ====
Ray was the first person to produce a biological definition of species, in his 1686 &quot;History of Plants&quot;:

=== Publications ===

Ray published about 23 works, depending on how they are counted. The biological works were usually in Latin, the rest in English. His first publication, while at Cambridge, was the &quot;Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium&quot; (1660), followed by many works, botanical, zoological,theological and literary. Until 1670, he wrote his name as John Wray. From then on, he used &#x27;Ray&#x27;, after &quot;having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him&quot;.

==Legacy==

Ray&#x27;s biographer, Charles Raven, commented that &quot;Ray sweeps away the litter of mythology and fable... and always insists upon accuracy of observation and description and the testing of every new discovery&quot;.p10 Ray&#x27;s works were directly influential on the development of taxonomy by Carl Linnaeus.

The Ray Society, named after John Ray, was founded in 1844. It is a scientific text publication society and registered charity, based at the Natural History Museum, London, which exists to publish books on natural history, with particular (but not exclusive) reference to the flora and fauna of the British Isles. As of 2017, the Society had published 179 volumes.

The John Ray Society (a separate organisation) is the Natural Sciences Society at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. It organises a programme of events of interest to science students in the college.

In 1986, to mark the 300th anniversary of the publication of Ray&#x27;s &quot;Historia Plantarum&quot;, there was a celebration of Ray&#x27;s legacy in Braintree, Essex. A &quot;John Ray Gallery&quot; was opened in the Braintree Museum.

The John Ray Initiative (JRI) is an educational charity that seeks to reconcile scientific and Christian understandings of the environment. It was formed in 1997 in response to the global environmental crisis and the challenges of sustainable development and environmental stewardship. John Ray&#x27;s writings proclaimed God as creator whose wisdom is &quot;manifest in the works of creation&quot;, and as redeemer of all things. JRI aims to teach appreciation of nature, increase awareness of the state of the global environment, and to promote a Christian understanding of environmental issues.

Furthermore, a nature walk has been established in Essex in memorium of John Ray. This walk was conquered by the Latimer/Hines household on 27 May 2024.

<text>James Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 – 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, poet, and literary critic. He contributed to the modernist avant-garde movement and is regarded as one of the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1922) is a landmark in which the episodes of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, particularly stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection &quot;Dubliners&quot; (1914), and the novels &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (1916) and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, letters, and occasional journalism.

Joyce was born in Dublin into a middle-class family. He attended the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare, then, briefly, the Christian Brothers–run O&#x27;Connell School. Despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father&#x27;s unpredictable finances, he excelled at the Jesuit Belvedere College and graduated from University College Dublin in 1902. In 1904, he met his future wife, Nora Barnacle, and they moved to mainland Europe. He briefly worked in Pola and then moved to Trieste in Austria-Hungary, working as an English instructor. Except for an eight-month stay in Rome working as a correspondence clerk and three visits to Dublin, Joyce lived there until 1915. In Trieste, he published his book of poems &quot;Chamber Music&quot; and his short story collection &quot;Dubliners&quot;, and began serially publishing &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; in the English magazine &quot;The Egoist&quot;. During most of World War I, Joyce lived in Zurich, Switzerland, and worked on &quot;Ulysses&quot;. After the war, he briefly returned to Trieste and in 1920 moved to Paris, which was his primary residence until 1940.

&quot;Ulysses&quot; was first published in Paris in 1922, but its publication in the United Kingdom and the United States was prohibited because of its perceived obscenity. Copies were smuggled into both countries and pirated versions were printed up until the mid-1930s when publication became legal. Joyce started his next major work, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, in 1923, publishing it sixteen years later in 1939. Between these years, Joyce travelled widely. He and Nora were married in a civil ceremony in London in 1931. He made several trips to Switzerland, frequently seeking treatment for his increasingly severe eye problems and psychological help for his daughter, Lucia. When France was occupied by Germany during World War II, Joyce moved back to Zurich in 1940. He died there in 1941 after surgery for a perforated ulcer at age 58.

&quot;Ulysses&quot; frequently ranks high in lists of great books, and academic literature analysing his work is extensive and ongoing. Many writers, film-makers, and other artists have been influenced by his stylistic innovations, such as his meticulous attention to detail, use of interior monologue, wordplay, and the radical transformation of traditional plot and character development. Though most of his adult life was spent abroad, his fictional universe centres on Dublin and is largely populated by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is set in the streets and alleyways of the city. Joyce is quoted as saying, &quot;For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.&quot;

==Early life==

Joyce was born on 2 February 1882 at 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, Ireland, to John Stanislaus Joyce and Mary Jane &quot;May&quot; ( Murray). He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings. He was baptised as James Augustine Joyce according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church in the nearby St Joseph&#x27;s Church in Terenure on 5 February 1882 by Rev. John O&#x27;Mulloy. His godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann. John Stanislaus Joyce&#x27;s family came from Fermoy in County Cork, where they owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce&#x27;s paternal grandfather, James Augustine, married Ellen O&#x27;Connell, daughter of John O&#x27;Connell, a Cork alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Her family claimed kinship with the political leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who had helped secure Catholic emancipation for the Irish in 1829.

Joyce&#x27;s father was appointed rate collector by Dublin Corporation in 1887. The family moved to the fashionable small town of Bray, from Dublin. Joyce was attacked by a dog around this time, leading to his lifelong fear of dogs. He later developed a fear of thunderstorms, from a superstitious aunt who had described them as a sign of God&#x27;s wrath.

In 1891, nine-year-old Joyce wrote the poem &quot;Et Tu, Healy&quot; on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell that his father printed and distributed to friends. The poem expressed the sentiments of the elder Joyce, who was angry at Parnell&#x27;s apparent betrayal by the Irish Catholic Church, the Irish Parliamentary Party, and the British Liberal Party that resulted in a collaborative failure to secure Irish Home Rule in the British Parliament. This sense of betrayal, particularly by the church, left a lasting impression that Joyce expressed in his life and art.

That year, his family began to slide into poverty, worsened by his father&#x27;s drinking and financial mismanagement. John Joyce&#x27;s name was published in &quot;Stubbs&#x27; Gazette&quot;, a blacklist of debtors and bankrupts, in November 1891, and he was temporarily suspended from work. In January 1893, he was dismissed with a reduced pension.

Joyce began his education in 1888 at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, but had to leave in 1891 when his father could no longer pay the fees. He studied at home and briefly attended the Christian Brothers O&#x27;Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin. Joyce&#x27;s father then had a chance meeting with the Jesuit priest John Conmee, who knew the family. Conmee arranged for Joyce and his brother Stanislaus to attend the Jesuits&#x27; Dublin school, Belvedere College, without fees starting in 1893. In 1895, Joyce, now 13, was elected by his peers to join the Sodality of Our Lady. Joyce spent five years at Belvedere, his intellectual formation guided by the principles of Jesuit education laid down in the &quot;Ratio Studiorum&quot; (&quot;Plan of Studies&quot;). He won first place for English composition in his final two years before graduating in 1898.

==University years==

Joyce enrolled at University College in 1898 to study English, French and Italian. While there, he was exposed to the scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas, which had a strong influence on his thought for the rest of his life. He participated in many of Dublin&#x27;s theatrical and literary circles. His closest colleagues included leading Irish figures of his generation including George Clancy, Tom Kettle and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. Many of the acquaintances he made at this time appeared in his work. His first publication—a laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;—was printed in &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot; in 1900. Inspired by Ibsen&#x27;s works, Joyce sent him a fan letter in Norwegian and wrote a play, &quot;A Brilliant Career&quot;, which he later destroyed.

In 1901 the National Census of Ireland listed Joyce as a 19-year-old Irish- and English-speaking unmarried student living with his parents, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road) in Clontarf, Dublin. During this year he became friends with Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for Buck Mulligan in &quot;Ulysses&quot;. In November, Joyce wrote an article, &quot;The Day of the Rabblement&quot;, criticising the Irish Literary Theatre for its unwillingness to produce the works of playwrights like Ibsen, Leo Tolstoy, and Gerhart Hauptmann. He protested against nostalgic Irish populism and argued for an outward-looking, cosmopolitan literature. Because he mentioned Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s novel (&quot;The Flame&quot;), which was on the Roman Catholic list of prohibited books, his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce and Sheehy-Skeffington—who had also had an article rejected—had their essays jointly printed and distributed. Arthur Griffith decried the censorship of Joyce&#x27;s work in his newspaper &quot;United Irishman&quot;.

Joyce graduated from the Royal University of Ireland in October 1902. He considered studying medicine and began attending lectures at the Catholic University Medical School in Dublin. When the medical school refused to provide a tutoring position to help finance his education, he left Dublin to study medicine in Paris, where he received permission to attend the course for a certificate in physics, chemistry, and biology at the École de Médecine. By the end of January 1903 he had given up plans to study medicine, but he stayed in Paris, often reading late in the . He frequently wrote home claiming ill health due to the water, the cold weather, and his change of diet, appealing for money his family could ill afford.

==Post-university years in Dublin==

In April 1903, Joyce learned his mother was dying and immediately returned to Ireland. He would tend to her, reading aloud from drafts that were eventually worked into his unfinished novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. During her final days, she unsuccessfully tried to get him to make his confession and to take communion. She died on 13 August. Afterwards, Joyce and Stanislaus refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. John Joyce&#x27;s drinking and abusiveness increased in the months following her death, and the family began to fall apart. Joyce spent much of his time carousing with Gogarty and his medical school colleagues, and tried to scrape together a living by reviewing books.

Joyce&#x27;s life began to change when he met Nora Barnacle on 10 June 1904. She was a twenty-year-old woman from Galway city, who was working in Dublin as a chambermaid. They had their first outing together on 16 June 1904, walking through the Dublin suburb of Ringsend, where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated as the date for the action of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, known in popular culture as &quot;Bloomsday&quot; in honour of the novel&#x27;s main character Leopold Bloom. This began a relationship that continued for thirty-seven years until Joyce died. Soon after this outing, Joyce, who had been out with his colleagues, approached a young woman in St Stephen&#x27;s Green and was beaten up by her companion. He was picked up and dusted off by an acquaintance of his father&#x27;s, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter, who was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife, became one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Joyce was a talented tenor and explored becoming a musical performer. On 8 May 1904, he was a contestant in the &quot;Feis Ceoil&quot;, an Irish music competition for promising composers, instrumentalists and singers. In the months before the contest, Joyce took singing lessons with two voice instructors, Benedetto Palmieri and Vincent O&#x27;Brien. He paid the entry fee by pawning some of his books. For the contest, Joyce had to sing three songs. He did well with the first two, but when he was told he had to sight read the third, he refused. Joyce won the third-place medal anyway. After the contest, Palmieri wrote to Joyce that Luigi Denza, the composer of the popular song &quot;&quot; who was the judge for the contest, spoke highly of his voice and would have given him first place but for the sight-reading and lack of sufficient training. Palmieri offered to give Joyce free singing lessons. Joyce refused the lessons, but kept singing in Dublin concerts that year. His performance at a concert given on 27 August may have solidified Nora&#x27;s devotion to him. Although Joyce did not ultimately pursue a singing career, he would include thousands of musical allusions in his literary works.

Throughout 1904, Joyce sought to develop his literary reputation. On 7 January he attempted to publish a prose work examining aesthetics called &quot;A Portrait of the Artist&quot;, but it was rejected by the intellectual journal &quot;Dana&quot;. He then reworked it into a fictional novel of his youth that he called &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; that he laboured over for years but eventually abandoned. He wrote a satirical poem called &quot;The Holy Office&quot;, which parodied W. B. Yeats&#x27;s poem &quot;To Ireland in the Coming Times&quot; and once more mocked the Irish Literary Revival. It too was rejected for publication; this time for being &quot;unholy&quot;. He wrote the collection of poems &quot;Chamber Music&quot; at this time; which was also rejected. He did publish three poems, one in &quot;Dana&quot; and two in &quot;The Speaker&quot;, and George William Russell published three of Joyce&#x27;s short stories in the Irish Homestead. These stories—&quot;The Sisters&quot;, &quot;Eveline&quot;, and &quot;After the Race&quot;—were the beginnings of &quot;Dubliners&quot;.

In September 1904, Joyce was having difficulties finding a place to live and moved into a Martello tower near Dublin, which Gogarty was renting.
Within a week, Joyce left when Gogarty and another housemate, Dermot Chenevix Trench, fired a pistol in the middle of the night at some pans hanging directly over Joyce&#x27;s bed. With the help of funds from Lady Gregory and a few other acquaintances, Joyce and Nora left Ireland less than a month later.

==1904–1906: Zurich, Pola and Trieste==
===Zurich and Pola===
In October 1904, Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile. They briefly stopped in London and Paris to secure funds before heading on to Zurich.
Joyce had been informed through an agent in England that there was a vacancy at the Berlitz Language School, but when he arrived there was no position. The couple stayed in Zurich for a little over a week. The director of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the First World War. There was no vacancy there either. The director of the school in Trieste, Almidano Artifoni, secured a position for him in Pola, then Austria-Hungary&#x27;s major naval base, where he mainly taught English to naval officers. Less than one month after the couple had left Ireland, Nora had become pregnant. Joyce soon became close friends with Alessandro Francini Bruni, the director of the school at Pola, and his wife Clothilde. By the beginning of 1905, the two families were living together. Joyce kept writing when he could. He completed a short story for &quot;Dubliners&quot;, &quot;Clay&quot;, and worked on his novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. He disliked Pola, calling it a &quot;back-of-God-speed place—a naval Siberia&quot;, and as soon as a job became available, he went to Trieste.

===First stay in Trieste===
Joyce moved to Trieste in March 1905 aged 23. He taught English at the Berlitz school. That June he published the satirical poem &quot;Holy Office&quot;.
After Nora gave birth to their first child, Giorgio, on 27 July 1905, he convinced Stanislaus to move to Trieste and obtained a position for him at the Berlitz school. Stanislaus moved in with Joyce as soon as he arrived that October, although most of his salary went directly to supporting Joyce&#x27;s family. In February 1906, the Joyce household once more shared an apartment with the Francini Brunis.

During this period Joyce completed 24 chapters of &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; and all but the final story of &quot;Dubliners&quot;, but was unable to get &quot;Dubliners&quot; published. Although the London publisher Grant Richards had a contract with Joyce, the printers were unwilling to print passages they found controversial; English law could not protect them if brought to court for circulating indecent language. Richards and Joyce tried to find a solution where the book could avoid legal liability while preserving Joyce&#x27;s artistic integrity. As they negotiated, Richards began to scrutinise the stories more carefully. He became concerned that the book might damage his publishing house&#x27;s reputation and eventually backed down from his agreement.

Trieste was Joyce&#x27;s main residence until 1920; he stayed temporarily in Rome, travelled to Dublin, and emigrated to Zurich during World War I, but Trieste became a second Dublin for him and played an important role in his development as a writer. He completed &quot;Dubliners,&quot; reworked &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; into &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, wrote his only published play &quot;Exiles&quot; and decided to make &quot;Ulysses&quot; a full-length novel as he worked through his notes and jottings, working out the characters of Leopold and Molly Bloom in Trieste. 
Many of the novel&#x27;s details were taken from Joyce&#x27;s observation of the city and its people, and some of its stylistic innovations appear to have been influenced by Futurism. There are even words of the Triestine dialect in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Joyce was introduced to the Greek Orthodox liturgy in Trieste. Under its influence, he rewrote his first short story and later drew on it in creating the liturgical parodies in &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

==1906–1915: Rome, Trieste, and sojourns to Dublin==
===Rome===

In late May 1906, the head of the Berlitz school ran away after embezzling its funds. Artifoni took over the school but let Joyce know that he could only afford to keep one brother on. Tired of Trieste and discouraged that he could not get a publisher for &quot;Dubliners&quot;, Joyce found an advertisement for a correspondence clerk in a Roman bank that paid twice his current salary. He was hired for the position and went to Rome at the end of July.

Joyce felt he accomplished very little during his brief stay in Rome, but it had a large impact on his writing. Though his new job took up most of his time, he revised &quot;Dubliners&quot; and worked on &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;. Rome was the birthplace of the idea for &quot;The Dead&quot;, which would become the final story of &quot;Dubliners&quot;, and for &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which was originally conceived as a short story. His stay in the city was one of his inspirations for &quot;Exiles&quot;. While there, he read the socialist historian Guglielmo Ferrero in depth. Ferrero&#x27;s anti-heroic interpretations of history, arguments against militarism, and conflicted attitudes toward Jews would find their way into &quot;Ulysses&quot;, particularly in the character of Leopold Bloom. In London, Elkin Mathews published &quot;Chamber Music&quot; on the recommendation of the British poet Arthur Symons. Nonetheless, Joyce was dissatisfied with his job, had exhausted his finances, and realised he would need additional support when he learned Nora was pregnant again. He left Rome after only seven months.

===Second stay in Trieste===

Joyce returned to Trieste in March 1907, but was unable to find full-time work. He went back to being an English instructor, working part-time for Berlitz and giving private lessons. The author Ettore Schmitz, better known by pen name Italo Svevo, was one of his students. Svevo was a Catholic of Jewish origin who became one of the models for Leopold Bloom. Joyce learned much of what he knew about Judaism from him. The two became lasting friends and mutual critics. Svevo supported Joyce&#x27;s identity as an author, helping him work through his writer&#x27;s block with &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;. Roberto Prezioso, editor of the Italian newspaper &quot;Piccolo della Sera&quot;, was another of Joyce&#x27;s students. He helped Joyce financially by commissioning him to write for the newspaper. Joyce quickly produced three articles aimed toward the Italian irredentists in Trieste. He indirectly paralleled their desire for independence from Austria-Hungary with the struggle against British rule in Ireland. Joyce earned additional money by giving a series of lectures at
Trieste&#x27;s Università Popolare on Ireland and the arts, as well as on William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

In May, Joyce was struck by an attack of rheumatic fever, which left him incapacitated for weeks. The illness exacerbated eye problems that plagued him for the rest of his life. While Joyce was still recovering from the attack, Lucia was born on 26 July 1907. During his convalescence, he was able to finish &quot;The Dead&quot;, the last story of &quot;Dubliners&quot;.

Although a heavy drinker, Joyce gave up alcohol for a period in 1908. He reworked &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; as the more concise and interior &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;. He completed the third chapter by April and translated John Millington Synge&#x27;s &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot; into Italian with the help of Nicolò Vidacovich. He even took singing lessons again. Joyce had been looking for an English publisher for &quot;Dubliners&quot; but was unable to find one, so he submitted it to a Dublin publisher, Maunsel and Company, owned by George Roberts.

====Visits to Dublin====

In July 1909, Joyce received a year&#x27;s advance payment from one of his students and returned to Ireland to introduce Giorgio to both sides of the family, his own in Dublin and Nora&#x27;s in Galway. He unsuccessfully applied for the position of Chair of Italian at his alma mater, which had become University College Dublin. He met with Roberts, who seemed positive about publishing &quot;Dubliners&quot;. He returned to Trieste in September with his sister Eva, who helped Nora run the home. Joyce only stayed in Trieste for a month, as he almost immediately came upon the idea of starting a cinema in Dublin, which unlike Trieste had none. He quickly got the backing of some Triestine businessmen and returned to Dublin in October, launching Ireland&#x27;s first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph. It was initially well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen.

From 1910 to 1912, Joyce still lacked a reliable income. This brought his conflicts with Stanislaus, who was frustrated with lending him money, to their peak. In 1912, Prezioso arranged for him to lecture on Hamlet for the Minerva Society between November 1912 and February 1913. Joyce once more lectured at the Università Popolare on various topics in English literature and applied for a teaching diploma in English at the University of Padua. He performed very well on the qualification tests, but was denied because Italy did not recognise his degree from an Irish university. In mid-1912, Joyce and his family returned to Dublin briefly. While there, his three-year-long struggle with Roberts over the publication of &quot;Dubliners&quot; came to an end as Roberts refused to publish the book due to concerns of libel. Roberts had the printed sheets destroyed, though Joyce was able to obtain a copy of the proof sheets. When Joyce returned to Trieste, he wrote an invective against Roberts, &quot;Gas from a Burner&quot;. He never went to Dublin again.

====Publication of &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;A Portrait&quot; ====
Joyce&#x27;s fortunes changed for the better in 1913 when Richards agreed to publish &quot;Dubliners&quot;. It was issued on 15 June 1914, eight and a half years since Joyce had first submitted it to him. Around the same time, he found an unexpected advocate in Ezra Pound, who was living in London. On the advice of Yeats, Pound wrote to Joyce asking if he could include a poem from &quot;Chamber Music&quot;, &quot;I Hear an Army Charging upon the Land&quot; in the journal &quot;Des Imagistes&quot;. They struck up a correspondence that lasted until the late 1930s. Pound became Joyce&#x27;s promoter, helping ensure that Joyce&#x27;s works were published and publicised.

After Pound persuaded Dora Marsden to serially publish &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; in the London literary magazine &quot;The Egoist&quot;, Joyce&#x27;s pace of writing increased. He completed &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; by 1914; resumed &quot;Exiles&quot;, completing it in 1915; started the novelette &quot;Giacomo Joyce&quot;, which he eventually abandoned; and began drafting &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

In August 1914, World War I broke out. Although Joyce and Stanislaus were subjects of the United Kingdom, which was now at war with Austria-Hungary, they remained in Trieste. Even when Stanislaus, who had publicly expressed his sympathy for the Triestine irredentists, was interned at the beginning of January 1915, Joyce chose to stay. In May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, and less than a month later Joyce took his family to Zurich in neutral Switzerland.

==1915–1920: Zurich and Trieste==
===Zurich===

Joyce arrived in Zurich as a double exile: he was an Irishman with a British passport and a Triestine on parole from Austria-Hungary. To get to Switzerland, he had to promise the Austro-Hungarian officials that he would not help the Allies during the war, and he and his family had to leave almost all of their possessions in Trieste. During the war, he was kept under surveillance by both the British and Austro-Hungarian secret services.

Joyce&#x27;s first concern was earning a living. One of Nora&#x27;s relatives sent them a small sum to cover the first few months. Pound and Yeats worked with the British government to provide a stipend from the Royal Literary Fund in 1915 and a grant from the British civil list the following year. Eventually, Joyce received large regular sums from the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver, who operated &quot;The Egoist&quot;, and the psychotherapist Edith Rockefeller McCormick, who lived in Zurich studying under Carl Jung. Weaver financially supported Joyce for the rest of his life and even paid for his funeral. Between 1917 and the beginning of 1919, Joyce was financially secure and lived quite well; the family sometimes stayed in Locarno in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland. However, health problems remained a constant issue. During their time in Zurich, both Joyce and Nora suffered illnesses that were diagnosed as &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot; and he had to undergo many eye surgeries.

====Writing &quot;Ulysses&quot;====
During the war, Zurich was the centre of a vibrant expatriate community. Joyce&#x27;s spent evenings in the Cafe Pfauen, where he got to know some of the artists living in the city, including the sculptor August Suter and the painter Frank Budgen. He often used the time spent with them as material for &quot;Ulysses&quot;. He met the writer Stefan Zweig, who organised the premiere of &quot;Exiles&quot; in Munich in August 1919. He became aware of Dada, which was coming into its own at the Cabaret Voltaire. He may have met the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary Vladimir Lenin at the Cafe Odeon, a place they both frequented.

Joyce kept up his interest in music. He met Ferruccio Busoni, staged music with Otto Luening, and learned music theory from Philipp Jarnach. Much of what Joyce learned about musical notation and counterpoint found its way into &quot;Ulysses&quot;, particularly the &quot;Sirens&quot; section.

Joyce avoided public discussion of the war and maintained strict neutrality. He made few comments about the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland; although he was sympathetic to the Irish independence movement, he disagreed with its violence. He stayed intently focused on &quot;Ulysses&quot; and the struggle to get his work published. Some of the serial instalments of &quot;The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; in &quot;The Egoist&quot; had been censored by the printers, but the entire novel was published by B. W. Huebsch in 1916. In 1918, Pound got a commitment from Margaret Caroline Anderson, the owner and editor of the New York-based literary magazine &quot;The Little Review&quot;, to publish &quot;Ulysses&quot; serially.

====The English Players====
Joyce co-founded an acting company, the English Players, and became its business manager. The company was pitched to the British government as a contribution to the war effort, and mainly staged works by Irish playwrights, such as Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and John Millington Synge. For Synge&#x27;s &quot;Riders to the Sea&quot;, Nora played a principal role and Joyce sang offstage, which he did again when Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;In a Balcony&quot; was staged. He hoped the company would eventually stage his play, &quot;Exiles&quot;, but his participation in the English Players declined in the wake of the influenza epidemic of 1918, though the company continued until 1920.

Joyce&#x27;s work with the English Players involved him in a lawsuit. Henry Wilfred Carr, a wounded war veteran and British consul, accused Joyce of underpaying him for his role in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. Carr sued for compensation; Joyce countersued for libel. The cases were resolved in 1919, with Joyce winning the compensation case but losing the one for libel. The incident ended up creating acrimony between the British consulate and Joyce for the rest of his time in Zurich.

===Third stay in Trieste===
By 1919, Joyce was in financial difficulty again. McCormick stopped paying her stipend, partly because he refused to submit to psychoanalysis from Jung, and Zurich had become expensive to live in after the war. He was also becoming isolated as the city&#x27;s emigres returned home. In October 1919, Joyce&#x27;s family moved back to Trieste, but it had changed. The Austro-Hungarian empire had ceased to exist, and Trieste was now an Italian city in post-war recovery. Eight months after his return, Joyce went to Sirmione, Italy, to meet Pound, who made arrangements for him to move to Paris. Joyce and his family packed their belongings and headed for Paris in June 1920.

==1920–1941: Paris and Zurich==
===Paris===

When Joyce and his family arrived in Paris in July 1920, their visit was intended to be a layover on their way to London. For the first four months, he stayed with and met Sylvia Beach, who ran the Rive Gauche bookshop, Shakespeare and Company. Beach quickly became an important person in Joyce&#x27;s life, providing financial support, and becoming one of his publishers. Through Beach and Pound, Joyce quickly joined the intellectual circle of Paris and was integrated into the international modernist artist community. Joyce met Valery Larbaud, who championed Joyce&#x27;s works to the French and supervised the French translation of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Paris became the Joyces&#x27; regular residence for twenty years, though they never settled into a single location for long.

====Publication of &quot;Ulysses&quot;====
Joyce finished writing &quot;Ulysses&quot; near the end of 1921, but had difficulties getting it published. With financial backing from the lawyer John Quinn, Margaret Anderson and her co-editor Jane Heap had begun serially publishing it in &quot;The Little Review&quot; in March 1918 but in January and May 1919, two instalments were suppressed as obscene and potentially subversive. In September 1920, an unsolicited instalment of the &quot;Nausicaa&quot; episode was sent to the daughter of a New York attorney associated with the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, leading to an official complaint. The trial proceedings continued until February 1921, when Anderson and Healy, defended by Quinn, were fined $50 each for publishing obscenity and ordered to cease publishing &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Huebsch, who had expressed interest in publishing the novel in the United States, decided against it after the trial.
Weaver was unable to find an English printer, and the novel was banned for obscenity in the United Kingdom in 1922, where it was blacklisted until 1936.
Almost immediately after Anderson and Healy were ordered to stop printing &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Beach agreed to publish it through her bookshop. She had books mailed to people in Paris and the United States who had subscribed to get a copy; Weaver sent books from Beach&#x27;s plates to subscribers in England. Soon, the postal officials of both countries began confiscating the books. They were then smuggled into both countries. Because the work had no copyright in the United States at this time, &quot;bootleg&quot; versions appeared, including pirate versions from publisher Samuel Roth, who only ceased his actions in 1928 when a court enjoined publication. &quot;Ulysses&quot; was not legally published in the United States until 1934 after Judge John M. Woolsey ruled in &quot;United States v. One Book Called Ulysses&quot; that the book was not obscene.

====Writing &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;====
In 1923, Joyce began his next work, an experimental novel that eventually became &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. It would take sixteen years to complete. At first, Joyce called it &quot;Work in Progress&quot;, which was the name Ford Madox Ford used in April 1924 when he published its &quot;Mamalujo&quot; episode in his magazine, &quot;The Transatlantic Review&quot;. In 1926, Eugene and Maria Jolas serialised the novel in their magazine, &quot;transition&quot;. When parts of the novel first came out, some of Joyce&#x27;s supporters—like Stanislaus, Pound, and Weaver— wrote negatively about it, and it was criticised by writers like Seán Ó Faoláin, Wyndham Lewis, and Rebecca West. In response, Joyce and the Jolases organised the publication of a collection of positive essays titled &quot;Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress&quot;, which included writings by Samuel Beckett and William Carlos Williams. An additional purpose of publishing these essays was to market &quot;Work in Progress&quot; to a larger audience. Joyce publicly revealed the novel&#x27;s title as &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; in 1939, the same year he completed it. It was published in London by Faber and Faber with the assistance of T. S. Eliot.

Joyce&#x27;s health problems afflicted him throughout his Paris years. He had over a dozen eye operations, but his vision severely declined. By 1930, he was practically blind in the left eye and his right eye functioned poorly. He had all of his teeth removed because of infection. At one point, Joyce became worried that he could not finish &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, asking the Irish author James Stephens to complete it if he became unable.

Joyce&#x27;s financial problems continued. Although he was now earning a good income from his investments and royalties, his spending habits often left him without available money. Despite these issues, he published &quot;Pomes Penyeach&quot; in 1927, a collection of thirteen poems that he wrote in Trieste, Zurich and Paris.

====Marriage in London====

In 1930, Joyce began thinking of establishing a residence in London once more, primarily to ensure that Giorgio, who had just married Helen Fleischmann, would have his inheritance secured under British law. Joyce moved to London, obtained a long-term lease on a flat, registered on the electoral roll, and became liable for jury service. After living together for twenty-seven years, Joyce and Nora got married at the Register Office in Kensington on 4 July 1931. Joyce stayed in London for at least six months to establish his residency, but abandoned his flat and returned to Paris later in the year when Lucia showed signs of mental illness. He planned to return, but never did and later became disaffected with England.

In later years, Joyce lived in Paris but frequently travelled to Switzerland for eye surgery or for treatment for Lucia, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Carl Jung, who had previously written that &quot;Ulysses&quot; was similar to schizophrenic writing. Jung suggested that she and her father were two people going into a river, except that Joyce was diving and Lucia was falling. In spite of Joyce&#x27;s attempts to help Lucia, she remained permanently institutionalised after his death.

===Final return to Zurich===
In the late 1930s, Joyce became increasingly concerned about the rise of fascism and antisemitism. In 1938, Joyce was involved in helping Jews escape Nazi persecution. After the fall of France in 1940, Joyce and his family fled from Nazi occupation, returning to Zurich a final time.

==Death==

On 11 January 1941, Joyce underwent surgery in Zurich for a perforated duodenal ulcer. He fell into a coma the following day. He awoke at 2 am on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son. They were en route when he died 15 minutes later, at age 58.

His body was buried in the Fluntern Cemetery in Zurich. Swiss tenor Max Meili sang &quot;Addio terra, addio cielo&quot; from Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; at the burial service. Joyce had been a subject of the United Kingdom all of his life, and although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, only the British consul attended the funeral. When Joseph Walshe, secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, was informed of Joyce&#x27;s death by Frank Cremins, &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; at Bern, Walshe responded, &quot;Please wire details of Joyce&#x27;s death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral.&quot; Buried originally in an ordinary grave, Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent &quot;honour grave&quot;, with a seated portrait statue by American artist Milton Hebald nearby. Nora, whom he had married in 1931, survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976.

After Joyce&#x27;s death, the Irish government declined Nora&#x27;s request to permit the repatriation of Joyce&#x27;s remains, despite being persistently lobbied by the American diplomat John J. Slocum. In October 2019, a motion was put to Dublin City Council to plan and budget for the costs of the exhumations and reburials of Joyce and his family somewhere in Dublin, subject to his family&#x27;s wishes. The proposal immediately became controversial, with the &quot;Irish Times&quot; commenting: &quot;... it is hard not to suspect that there is a calculating, even mercantile, aspect to contemporary Ireland&#x27;s relationship to its great writers, whom we are often more keen to &#x27;celebrate&#x27;, and if possible monetise, than read&quot;.

==Political views==
Throughout his life, Joyce maintained an active interest in Irish politics and the country&#x27;s relationship to the British Empire. He studied both socialism and anarchism. He attended socialist meetings and expressed an individualist anarchist view influenced by Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s philosophy and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s essay &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism&quot;. He described his opinions as &quot;those of a socialist artist&quot;. Joyce&#x27;s direct engagement in politics was strongest during his time in Trieste, when he submitted newspaper articles, gave lectures, and wrote letters advocating for Ireland&#x27;s independence from British rule. After leaving Trieste, Joyce&#x27;s direct involvement in politics waned, 
but his later works still reflect his commitment. He remained sympathetic to individualist anarchism and critical of coercive ideologies such as nationalism. His novels address socialist, anarchist, and Irish nationalist issues. &quot;Ulysses&quot; has been read as a novel critiquing the effect of British rule on the Irish people. &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; has been read as a work that investigates the divisive issues of Irish politics, the interrelationship between colonialism and race, and the coercive oppression of nationalism and fascism.

Joyce wrote negatively of British rule in Ireland and was sympathetic towards attempts to establish an independent Irish republic. In 1907, he expressed his support for the early Sinn Féin movement before the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. However, throughout his life, Joyce refused to exchange his British passport for an Irish one. When he had a choice, he renewed his British passport in 1935 instead of obtaining one from the Irish Free State, and chose to keep it in 1940 when accepting an Irish passport could have helped him to leave Vichy France more easily. His refusal to change his passport was partly due to the advantages that a British passport gave him internationally, his being out of sympathy with the violence of Irish politics, and his dismay over the Irish Free State&#x27;s political alignment with the Catholic Church.

==Religious views==

Joyce had a complex relationship with religion. Firsthand statements by him and Stanislaus attest that he did not consider himself a Catholic, though his work is deeply influenced by Catholicism. In particular, his intellectual foundations were grounded in his early Jesuitical education. Even after he left Ireland, he sometimes went to church. When living in Trieste, he woke up early to attend Catholic Mass on Holy Thursday and Good Friday or occasionally attended Eastern Orthodox services, stating that he liked the ceremonies better.

Joyce lapsed from the Church early in life, and Nora refused to allow a Catholic service when he died. His works frequently critique, ridicule, and blaspheme Catholicism, and he appropriates Catholic rituals and concepts for his own artistic purposes. As such, some critics have argued that Joyce firmly rejected the Catholic faith. However, Catholic critics have argued that Joyce never fully abandoned his faith, wrestling with it in his writings and becoming increasingly reconciled with it. They regard &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as expressions of a Catholic sensibility, insisting that the critical views of religion expressed by the characters in his novels do not represent those of Joyce the author. 

Other critics have suggested that Joyce&#x27;s apparent apostasy was less a denial of faith than a transmutation, a criticism of the Church&#x27;s adverse impact on spiritual life, politics, and personal development. His attitude toward Catholicism has been described as an enigma in which there are two Joyces: a modern one who resisted the power of Catholicism and another who maintained his allegiance to its traditions. He has been compared to the medieval (wandering bishops), who left their discipline but not their cultural heritage of thought.

Joyce&#x27;s responses to questions about his faith were often ambiguous. For example, during an interview after the completion of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Joyce was asked, &quot;When did you leave the Catholic Church?&quot; He answered, &quot;That&#x27;s for the Church to say.&quot;

==Major works==
===&quot;Dubliners&quot;===
&quot;Dubliners&quot;, first published in 1914, is a collection of 15 short stories that form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around the city in the early 20th century. The tales were written when Irish nationalism and the search for national identity was at its peak. Joyce holds up a mirror to that identity as a first step in the spiritual liberation of Ireland. The stories centre on Joyce&#x27;s idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in &quot;Dubliners&quot; later appear in minor roles in Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The initial stories are narrated by child protagonists. Later stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce&#x27;s tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence, and maturity.

===&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;===

&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, published in 1916, is a shortened rewrite of the novel &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;, which was abandoned in 1905. It is a &quot;Künstlerroman&quot;, a kind of coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. It functions both as an autobiographical fiction of the author and a biography of the fictional protagonist. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character&#x27;s psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings, are evident in this novel.

===&quot;Exiles&quot; and poetry===
Despite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, &quot;Exiles&quot;, begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to &quot;The Dead&quot; (the final story in &quot;Dubliners&quot;) and forward to &quot;Ulysses&quot;, which Joyce began around the time of the play&#x27;s composition.

He published three books of poetry. The first full-length collection was &quot;Chamber Music&quot; (1907), which consisted of 36 short lyrics. It led to his inclusion in the &quot;Imagist Anthology&quot;, edited by Ezra Pound, a champion of Joyce&#x27;s work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes &quot;Gas from a Burner&quot; (1912), &quot;Pomes Penyeach&quot; (1927), and &quot;Ecce Puer&quot; (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). These were published by the Black Sun Press in &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1936).

===&quot;Ulysses&quot;===
The action of &quot;Ulysses&quot; starts on 16 June 1904 at 8am and ends sometime after 2am the following morning. Much of it occurs inside the minds of the characters, who are portrayed through techniques such as interior monologue, dialogue, and soliloquy. The novel consists of 18 episodes, each covering roughly one hour of the day using a unique literary style. Joyce structured each chapter to refer to an individual episode in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, as well as a specific colour, a particular art or science, and a bodily organ. &quot;Ulysses&quot; sets the characters and incidents of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in 1904 Dublin, representing Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope, and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom, and Stephen Dedalus. It uses humour– including parody, satire and comedy– to contrast the novel&#x27;s characters with their Homeric models. Joyce played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles so the work could be read independently of its Homeric structure.

&quot;Ulysses&quot; can be read as a study of Dublin in 1904, exploring various aspects of the city&#x27;s life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Joyce claimed that if Dublin was destroyed in some catastrophe, it could be rebuilt using his work as a model. To achieve this sense of detail, he relied on his memory, what he heard other people remember, and his readings, to create a sense of fastidious detail. Joyce regularly used the 1904 edition of &quot;Thom&#x27;s Directory&quot;—a work that listed the owners and tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city—to ensure his descriptions were accurate. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing, reliance on a formal schema to structure the narrative, and exquisite attention to detail represents one of the book&#x27;s major contributions to the development of 20th-century modernist literature.

===&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;===
&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is an experimental novel that pushes stream of consciousness and literary allusion to their extremes. Although the work can be read from beginning to end, Joyce&#x27;s writing transforms traditional ideas of plot and character development through his wordplay, allowing the book to be read nonlinearly. Much of the wordplay stems from the work being written in peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multilevel puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, that used by Lewis Carroll in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; and draws on a wide range of languages. The associative nature of its language has led to it being interpreted as the story of a dream.

The metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola, whom Joyce had read in his youth, plays an important role in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, as it provides the framework for how the identities of the characters interplay and are transformed. Giambattista Vico&#x27;s cyclical view of history—in which civilisation rises from chaos, passes through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapses back into chaos—structures the text&#x27;s narrative, as evidenced by the opening and closing words of the book: &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; opens with the words &quot;riverrun, past Eve and Adam&#x27;s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs&quot; and ends &quot;A way a lone a last a loved a long the&quot;. In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the narrative into one great cycle.

==Legacy==

Joyce&#x27;s work still has a profound influence on contemporary culture. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a model for fiction writers, particularly its explorations into the power of language. Its emphasis on the details of everyday life has opened up new possibilities of expression for authors, painters and film-makers. It retains its prestige among readers, often ranking high on &#x27;Great Book&#x27; lists. Joyce&#x27;s innovations extend beyond English literature: his writing has been an inspiration for Latin American writers, and &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; has become one of the key texts for French post-structuralism.

The open-ended form of Joyce&#x27;s novels keeps them open to constant reinterpretation. They inspire an increasingly global community of literary critics. Joyce&#x27;s studies—based on a relatively small canon of three novels, a small short story collection, one play, and two small books of poems—have generated over 15,000 articles, monographs, theses, translations, and editions.

In popular culture, the work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June, known as Bloomsday, in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide.

===Collections, museums, and study centres===
The National Library of Ireland holds a large collection of Joycean material including manuscripts and notebooks, much of it available online. A joint venture between the library and University College Dublin, the Museum of Literature Ireland, the majority of whose exhibits are about Joyce and his work, has both a small permanent Joyce-related collection, and borrows from its parent institutions; its displays include &quot;Copy No. 1&quot; of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Dedicated centres in Dublin include the James Joyce Centre in North Great George&#x27;s Street, the James Joyce Tower and Museum in Sandycove at the Martello tower where Joyce briefly lived and where he set the opening scene in &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and the Dublin Writers Museum.University College London holds the only major research collection of Joyce&#x27;s work in the United Kingdom, including first editions of all of Joyce&#x27;s major works, many other editions and translations, as well as critical and background literature. The University at Buffalo&#x27;s James Joyce Collection has more than 10,000 pages of the author&#x27;s working papers, notebooks, manuscripts, photographs, correspondence and other materials as well as Joyce&#x27;s private library.

<doc id="15601" wikidata="Q11420" url="?curid=15601" title="Judo">
<text>is an unarmed modern Japanese martial art, combat sport, Olympic sport (since 1964), and the most prominent form of jacket wrestling competed internationally. Judo was created in 1882 by Kanō Jigorō () as an eclectic martial art, distinguishing itself from its predecessors (primarily Tenjin Shinyo-ryu jujutsu and Kitō-ryū jujutsu) due to an emphasis on &quot;randori&quot; (, lit. &#x27;free sparring&#x27;) instead of alongside its removal of striking and weapon training elements. Judo rose to prominence for its dominance over established jujutsu schools in tournaments hosted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (警視庁武術大会, &quot;Keishicho Bujutsu Taikai&quot;), resulting in its adoption as the department&#x27;s primary martial art. A judo practitioner is called a , and the judo uniform is called .

The objective of competitive judo is to throw an opponent, immobilize them with a pin, or force an opponent to submit with a joint lock or a choke. While strikes and use of weapons are included in some pre-arranged forms (kata), they are not frequently trained and are illegal in judo competition or free practice. Judo&#x27;s international governing body is the International Judo Federation, and competitors compete in the international IJF professional circuit.

Judo&#x27;s philosophy revolves around two primary principles: and . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from &quot;Ko-ryū&quot;. Judo has also spawned a number of derivative martial arts around the world, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, sambo, and ARB. Judo also influenced the formation of other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.

==History and philosophy==

===Early life of its founder===
The early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, Japanese polymath and educator , born . Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the Shinto Hiyoshi shrine in Shiga Prefecture. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the Shogunate government.

Jigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, and the under a number of tutors. When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in Shiba, Tokyo. The culture of bullying endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a at which to train.

Early attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. Jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly westernized Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kanō&#x27;s father and a former soldier, agreed to show him &quot;kata&quot;, but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku&#x27;s second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor, Imai Genshiro of &quot;Kyushin-ryū&quot; school of jujutsu, also refused. Several years passed before he finally found a willing teacher.

In 1877, as a student at the University of Tokyo, Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening . After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke (–1880), a teacher of the &quot;Tenjin Shin&#x27;yō-ryū&quot; of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat dōjō where he taught five students. Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds of Kano&#x27;s emphasis on in judo.

On Fukuda&#x27;s death in 1880, Kano, who had become his keenest and most able student in both &quot;randori&quot; and &quot;kata&quot;, was given the of the Fukuda dōjō. Kano chose to continue his studies at another &quot;Tenjin Shin&#x27;yō-ryū&quot; school, that of Iso Masatomo (–1881). Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of &quot;kata&quot;, and entrusted &quot;randori&quot; instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano. Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to study at the dōjō of Iikubo Tsunetoshi (1835–1889) of . Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on &quot;randori&quot;, with &quot;Kitō-ryū&quot; having a greater focus on .

===Founding of the Kodokan===

In February 1882, Kano founded a school and dōjō at the , a Buddhist temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of Taitō ward). Iikubo, Kano&#x27;s &quot;Kitō-ryū&quot; instructor, attended the dōjō three days a week to help teach and, although two years would pass before the temple would be called by the name , and Kano had not yet received his in &quot;Kitō-ryū&quot;, this is now regarded as the Kodokan founding.

The &quot;Eisho-ji&quot; dōjō was originally shoin. It was a relatively small affair, consisting of a 12 jo (214 sq ft) training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being Tomita Tsunejirō and Shiro Saigo. In August, the following year, the pair were granted grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.

===Judo versus jujutsu===

Central to Kano&#x27;s vision for judo were the principles of and . He illustrated the application of &quot;seiryoku zen&#x27;yō&quot; with the concept of :

Kano realised that &quot;seiryoku zen&#x27;yō&quot;, initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the Confucianist-influenced &quot;jita kyōei&quot;, the wider application shaped the development of judo from a to a . Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasized the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general. He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public&#x27;s negative perception of jujutsu:

Kano believed that &quot;&quot;jūjutsu&quot; was insufficient to describe his art: although means &quot;art&quot; or &quot;means&quot;, it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to , meaning &quot;way&quot;, &quot;road&quot; or &quot;path&quot;, which implies a more philosophical context than &quot;jutsu&quot; and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of &quot;tao&quot;. Thus Kano renamed it .

==Judo &quot;waza&quot; (techniques)==

There are three basic categories of in judo: , and . Judo is mostly known for &quot;nage-waza&quot; and &quot;katame-waza&quot;.

Judo practitioners typically devote a portion of each practice session to , in order that &quot;nage-waza&quot; can be practiced without significant risk of injury. Several distinct types of &quot;ukemi&quot; exist, including ; ; ; and 

The person who performs a &quot;Waza&quot; is known as and the person to whom it is performed is known as .

===&quot;Nage-waza&quot; (throwing techniques)===
&quot;Nage-waza&quot; include all techniques in which &quot;tori&quot; attempts to throw or trip &quot;uke&quot;, usually with the aim of placing &quot;uke&quot; on their back. Each technique has three distinct stages:

*: the opponent becoming off balanced;
*: turning in and fitting into the throw;
*: execution and completion of the throw.

&quot;Nage-waza&quot; are typically drilled by the use of , repeated turning-in, taking the throw up to the point of &quot;kake&quot;.

Traditionally, &quot;nage-waza&quot; are further categorised into , throws that are performed with &quot;tori&quot; maintaining an upright position, and , throws in which &quot;tori&quot; sacrifices his upright position in order to throw &quot;uke&quot;.

&quot;Tachi-waza&quot; are further subdivided into , in which &quot;tori&quot; predominantly uses their arms to throw &quot;uke&quot;; throws that predominantly use a lifting motion from the hips; and , throws in which &quot;tori&quot; predominantly utilises their legs.

===&quot;Katame-waza&quot; (grappling techniques)===
&quot;Katame-waza&quot; is further categorised into , in which &quot;tori&quot; traps and pins &quot;uke&quot; on their back on the floor; , in which &quot;tori&quot; attempts to force a submission by choking or strangling &quot;uke&quot;; and , in which &quot;tori&quot; attempts to submit &quot;uke&quot; by painful manipulation of their joints.

A related concept is that of , in which &quot;waza&quot; are applied from a non-standing position.

In competitive judo, &quot;Kansetsu-waza&quot; is currently limited to elbow joint manipulation. Manipulation and locking of other joints can be found in various kata, such as &quot;Katame-no-kata&quot; and &quot;Kodokan goshin jutsu&quot;.

===&quot;Atemi-waza&quot; (striking techniques)===
&quot;Atemi-waza&quot; are techniques in which &quot;tori&quot; disables &quot;uke&quot; with a strike to a vital point. &quot;Atemi-waza&quot; are not permitted outside of &quot;kata&quot;.

==Pedagogy==
===&quot;Randori&quot; (free practice)===
Judo pedagogy emphasizes . This term covers a variety of forms of practice, and the intensity at which it is carried out varies depending on intent and the level of expertise of the participants. At one extreme, is a compliant style of randori, known as , in which neither participant offers resistance to their partner&#x27;s attempts to throw. A related concept is that of , in which an experienced judoka allows himself to be thrown by his less-experienced partner. At the opposite extreme from &quot;yakusoku geiko&quot; is the hard style of randori that seeks to emulate the style of judo seen in competition. While hard randori is the cornerstone of judo, over-emphasis of the competitive aspect is seen as undesirable by traditionalists if the intent of the randori is to &quot;win&quot; rather than to learn.

===Kata (forms)===

 are pre-arranged patterns of techniques and in judo, with the exception of elements of the &quot;Seiryoku-Zen&#x27;yō Kokumin-Taiiku&quot;, they are all practised with a partner. Their purposes include illustrating the basic principles of judo, demonstrating the correct execution of a technique, teaching the philosophical tenets upon which judo is based, allowing for the practice of techniques that are not allowed in randori, and to preserve ancient techniques that are historically important but are no longer used in contemporary judo.

There are ten kata that are recognized by the Kodokan today:

* , comprising two kata:
** Fifteen throws, practiced both left- and right-handed, three each from the five categories of &quot;nage waza&quot;: &quot;te waza&quot;, &quot;koshi waza&quot;, &quot;ashi waza&quot;, &quot;ma sutemi waza&quot; and &quot;yoko sutemi waza&quot;.
** . Fifteen techniques in three sets of five, illustrating the three categories of &quot;katame waza&quot;: &quot;osaekomi waza&quot;, &quot;shime waza&quot; and &quot;kansetsu waza&quot;.
* . Twenty techniques, illustrating the principles of defence in a combat situation, performed from kneeling and standing positions. Attacks are made unarmed and armed with a dagger and a sword. This kata utilises &quot;atemi waza&quot;, striking techniques, that are forbidden in randori.
* . The most recent recognised kata, comprising twenty-one techniques of defence against attack from an unarmed assailant and one armed with a knife, stick and pistol. This kata incorporates various jujutsu techniques such as wrist locks and &quot;atemi waza&quot;.
* . Fifteen techniques, arranged in three sets of five, demonstrating the principle of &quot;Jū&quot; and its correct use in offence and defence.
* . One of the oldest kata, comprising ten forms that illustrate the efficient use of force and resistance. Now rarely practiced.
* . An advanced kata, illustrating the principle of &quot;seiryoku zen&#x27;yō&quot; and the movements of the universe. The kata predates the creation of Kodokan and originated in Tenjin Shinyō-ryū.
* . Derived from &quot;Kitō-ryū&quot; Jujutsu, this kata was originally intended to be performed wearing armour. Kano chose to preserve it as it embodied the principles of judo.
* . A series of exercises designed to develop the physique for judo.
* . An exercise completed in 1943, and of which the development was ordered by Jirō Nangō, the second Kodokan president.

In addition, there are a number of commonly practiced kata that are not recognised by the Kodokan. Some of the more common kata include:

* A &quot;kata&quot; of pre-emptive counter techniques that some claim has a heritage from Waseda University in Tokyo. The form is little more than standard counters, bookended by some protocol. Moreover, there is no universal standard nor accepted reference text. The exercise is unknown of in Japan, and was popularised in the West by Mikinosuke Kawaishi.
* A much more elegant and coherent kata of counter techniques, created by Kyuzo Mifune.
* a kata of counter-attacks to controlling techniques, attributed to 

===Tandoku-renshu (practice by oneself)===
* Personal work.

==Competitive judo==

===History===
 is a vitally important aspect of judo. In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of &quot;nage waza&quot; and &quot;katame waza&quot;, excluding &quot;atemi waza&quot;. Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by &quot;Throwing&quot;, where the opponent&#x27;s back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by &quot;Pinning&quot; them on their back for a &quot;sufficient&quot; amount of time, or by &quot;Submission&quot;, which could be achieved via &quot;Shime-waza&quot; or &quot;Kansetsu-waza&quot;, in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee&#x27;s or corner-judge&#x27;s stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited. In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for &quot;kyu&quot; grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited &quot;kansetsu-waza&quot; for &quot;dan&quot; grades. It was also stated that the ratio of &quot;tachi-waza&quot; to &quot;ne-waza&quot; should be between 70% and 80% for &quot;kyu&quot; grades and between 60% and 70% for &quot;dan&quot; grades.

In 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit &quot;kansetsu waza&quot; with the prohibition of &quot;ashi garami&quot; and neck locks, as well as &quot;do jime&quot;. These were further added to in 1925.

Jigoro Kano for a long time wished to see judo as an Olympic discipline. The first time judo was seen in the Olympic Games was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the 1932 Games. However, Kano was ambivalent about judo&#x27;s potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:
===Use of judo at the Summer Olympic Games===

At the 57th general session of the International Olympic Committee, held in Rome on 22 August 1960, the IOC members formally decided to include Judo among the events to be contested at the Olympic Games. The proposal, which was placed before the session by the Japanese delegation, was welcomed by all participants. The few who opposed had nothing against Judo itself but against increasing the number of Olympic events as a whole. There were only two dissenting votes in the final poll. For the first time in history a traditional Japanese sport has been included in the Olympic competition.

Finally, judo was first contested as an Olympic sport for men in the 1964 Games in Tokyo. The Olympic Committee initially dropped judo for the 1968 Olympics, meeting protests. Dutchman Anton Geesink won the first Olympic gold medal in the open division of judo by defeating Akio Kaminaga of Japan. The women&#x27;s event was introduced at the Olympics in 1988 as a demonstration event, and an official medal event in 1992.

===Use of judo at the Summer Paralympic Games===

Judo was introduced as a Paralympic sport at the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, with women&#x27;s events contested for the first time at 2004 Summer Paralympics.

===Use of judo at the Commonwealth Games===

Judo was an optional sport included in the three editions of the Commonwealth Games: 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. From 2022, judo will become a core sport in the 22nd edition of the Commonwealth Games, in Birmingham and also the 23rd edition of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

===Current international contest rules===

Penalties may be given for: passivity or preventing progress in the match; for safety infringements (for example by using prohibited techniques), or for behavior that is deemed to be against the spirit of judo. Fighting must be stopped if a participant is outside the designated area on the mat.

====Weight divisions====
There are currently seven weight divisions, subject to change by governing bodies, and may be modified based on the age of the competitors:

====Competition scoring====
A throw that places the opponent on their back with impetus and control scores an , winning the contest. A lesser throw, where the opponent is thrown onto his back, but with insufficient force to merit an ippon, scores a . Two scores of waza-ari equal an ippon . This rule was cancelled in 2017, but it was resumed in 2018. Formerly, a throw that places the opponent onto his side scores a .

In 2017, the International Judo Federation announced changes in evaluation of points. There will only be ippon and waza-ari scores given during a match with yuko scores now included within waza-ari.

Ippon is scored in &quot;ne-waza&quot; for pinning an opponent on his back with a recognised &quot;osaekomi-waza&quot; for 20 seconds or by forcing a submission through &quot;shime-waza&quot; or &quot;kansetsu-waza&quot;. A submission is signalled by tapping the mat or the opponent at least twice with the hand or foot, or by saying . A pin lasting for less than 20 seconds, but more than 10 seconds scores waza-ari (formerly waza-ari was awarded for holds of longer than 15 seconds and yuko for holds of longer than 10 seconds).

Formerly, there was an additional score that was lesser to yuko, that of . This has since been removed.

If the scores are identical at the end of the match, the contest is resolved by the &quot;Golden Score&quot; rule. &quot;Golden Score&quot; is a sudden death situation where the clock is reset to match-time, and the first contestant to achieve any score wins. If there is no score during this period, then the winner is decided by , the majority opinion of the referee and the two corner judges.

There have been changes to the scoring. In January 2013, the Hantei was removed and the &quot;Golden Score&quot; no longer has a time limit. The match would continue until a judoka scored through a technique or if the opponent is penalised (Hansoku-make).

====Penalties====
Two types of penalties may be awarded. A shido (指導 literally &quot;guidance&quot;) is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (反則負け literally &quot;foul-play defeat&quot;), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make. If hansoku-make is awarded for a major rule infringement, it results not just in loss of the match, but in the expulsion from the tournament of the penalized player.

==In mixed martial arts==
A number of judo practitioners have made an impact in mixed martial arts. Notable judo-trained MMA fighters include Olympic medalists Hidehiko Yoshida (Gold, 1992), Naoya Ogawa (Silver, 1992), Paweł Nastula (Gold, 1996), Makoto Takimoto (Gold, 2000), Satoshi Ishii (Gold, 2008), Ronda Rousey (Bronze, 2008), and Kayla Harrison (Gold, 2012 and 2016), former Russian national judo championship bronze medalist Fedor Emelianenko, Yoshihiro Akiyama, Don Frye, Rick Hawn, Daniel Kelly, Hector Lombard, Karo Parisyan, Ayaka Hamasaki, Antônio Silva, Oleg Taktarov, Rhadi Ferguson, Dong-Sik Yoon, and Khabib Nurmagomedov.

==Alternative styles and derivative martial arts==

Kano Jigoro&#x27;s Kodokan judo is the most popular and well-known style of judo, but is not the only one. The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano&#x27;s original style of judo, several related forms have evolved—some now widely considered to be 
===Kosen judo===
Commonly described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University. The word &quot;Kosen&quot; is an acronym of . Currently, competitions are organized between Japan&#x27;s seven former Imperial Universities and referred to as &quot;Nanatei Judo&quot; (:ja:七帝柔道, literally &quot;Seven Emperors Judo&quot;). Kosen judo&#x27;s focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
===Freestyle Judo===
Freestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the United States that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules. Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA). The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) officially sanctions Freestyle Judo in the United States of America.
===Georgian Judo===
Georgian Judo is influenced by Chidaoba (Georgian cultural jacket wrestling). Chidaoba&#x27;s major influence on the Georgian style of judo is in its unorthodox grips as well as its throws and takedowns. Georgian Judo is also known for its countering techniques through the use of power moves such as bear hugs and double underhooks into throws and takedowns. It is represented by various olympic winners and World Champions, such as Lasha Bekauri, Lukhumi Chkhvimiani, Shota Chochishvili, Tato Grigalashvili, Zaza Kedelashvili, David Khakhaleishvili, Luka Maisuradze,Lasha Shavdatuashvili and others.

===Russian Judo===
This distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Soviet martial art of Sambo. It is represented by well-known coaches such as Alexander Retuinskih and Igor Yakimov, and mixed martial arts fighters such as Fedor Emelianenko, Oleg Taktarov, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Karo Parisyan. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the flying armbar being accepted into Kodokan judo.
===Mongolian Judo===
Unlike other Far East styles of Judo, Mongolian Judo focuses much more on power rather than technique. The influence of Bokh on Mongolian Judo can be seen in its grips and body positioning. Judo grips such as the over under, double underhooks and the heavy use of grips on the belt. It is represented by various world champions, such as Khaliuny Boldbaatar, Tsendiin Damdin, Boldyn Gankhaich, Naidangiin Tüvshinbayar, Mönkhbatyn Urantsetseg, Ganbatyn Boldbaatar.
===Korean Judo===
Korean Judo is also very technical but what really separates it from other styles is the speed at which its techniques are performed. Korean Judo it is not powerful in terms of using strength but instead, the practitioners use speed, movement and technique in order to create fast and powerful snaps. This styles produced various olympic champions, like Ahn Byeong-keun, Cho Min-sun, Choi Min-ho, Ha Hyung-joo, Jeon Ki-young, Kim Jae-bum, Kim Jae-yup, Lee Kyung-keun, Lee Won-hee, Song Dae-nam and others.
===French Judo===
French Judo is based on tactical Kumi Kata and focuses on breaking the posture of the opponent as well as preventing opponents from attaining a proper grip. This style does not use a huge amount of power, it prefer to use technique, tactics and timing. Many French judo practitioners have become World and Olympic champions, like Clarisse Agbegnenou, Émilie Andéol, Marc Alexandre, Djamel Bouras, Amandine Buchard, Guillaume Chaine, Axel Clerget, Sarah-Léonie Cysique, Lucie Décosse, Romane Dicko, David Douillet, Catherine Fleury-Vachon, Alexandre Iddir and many others.

===Cuban Judo===
Cuban Judo is characterized by an explosive and high athletic style that puts an emphasis on body conditioning and calculated planning mixed with raw power.
In terms of training the athletes use a particularly methodical and intellectual approach to the sport.
===Azerbaijani Judo===
Judo in Azerbaijan has developed over the years and has become deep rooted and considered a top sport in the country.
It&#x27;s very similar to Georgian Judo, as its mostly focused on the practitioner&#x27;s strength during throws.
It&#x27;s a hybrid of the original Kodokan Judo and the traditional Azerbaijan style of wrestling called Azeri, whose techniques consist of unorthodox grips and positioning during counter-attacks.

===Israeli Judo===
Judo has become a top sport in Israel only recently.
Israeli Judo is characterized by a particular emphasis on hip throws, which are executed with a mix of technique and aggression, with the practitioner that has to adjust his sleeves before powerfully gripping and throwing the opponent away.

===Sambo===
Sambo is influenced by judo combined with wrestling techniques, and striking in case of combat sambo. Vasili Oshchepkov was one of the first European judo black belts under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and Soviet bloc wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov was executed during the political purges of 1937 and judo was banned for decades until its inclusion in the 1964 Olympics, where sambists won 4 bronze medals. In their &quot;History of Sambo&quot;, Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia &quot;judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing&quot;—albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.

===Brazilian jiu-jitsu===
An adoption of &quot;Kano jiu jitsu&quot; (a common name for judo at the time) in Brazil attributed to Mitsuyo Maeda&#x27;s students, most notably the Gracie family. 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu and other wrestling-influenced systems without the gi have also become popular.
=== Other styles ===
Judo also influenced other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.

==Safety==
Kano&#x27;s vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. Randori (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka&#x27;s understanding of judo. Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo&#x27;s development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo&#x27;s history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from Jujutsu, were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in ukemi (break falls) and practiced on tatami (rice straw mats).

===&quot;Kansetsu&quot; and &quot;shime waza&quot;===
The application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo dōjō and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.

===&quot;Nage waza&quot;===
Safety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the &quot;Gokyo&quot; , a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in are difficult to breakfall from.

==Mental training==
Mental training is an emerging modality of training in judo that aims to improve the performance of high-performance athletes in training and competition and also to promote health and well-being in the daily life of athletes and their entourage through the learning and application of psychological skills. The first publication of a judo-specific practical mental training approach based on sports training principles was in 2005 with the work of Boris Blumenstein, Ronnie Lidor and Gershon Tenenbaum. In 2022, Caio Gabriel published the first article on mental training that appeared in the scientific journal of the International Judo Federation, &quot;The Arts and Sciences of Judo&quot;.

==Judoka (practitioner)==
A practitioner of judo is known as a . The modern meaning of &quot;judoka&quot; in English is a judo practitioner of any level of expertise, but traditionally those below the rank of 4th &quot;dan&quot; were called ; and only those of 4th &quot;dan&quot; or higher were called &quot;judoka&quot;. (The suffix , when added to a noun, means a person with expertise or special knowledge on that subject).

A judo teacher is called . Traditionally, that title was reserved for instructors of 4th &quot;dan&quot; and above.

==Judogi (uniform)==

Judo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called or sometimes abbreviated in the west as &quot;gi&quot;. It comprises a heavy cotton kimono-like jacket called an , similar to traditional fastened by an , coloured to indicate rank, and cotton draw-string . Early examples of keikogi had short sleeves and trouser legs and the modern long-sleeved judogi was adopted in 1906.

The modern use of the blue judogi for high level competition was first suggested by Anton Geesink at the 1986 Maastricht IJF DC Meeting. For competition, a blue judogi is worn by one of the two competitors for ease of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue because judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi with the impure blue is an offense.

For events organized under the auspices of the International judo Federation (IJF), judogi have to bear the IJF Official Logo Mark Label. This label demonstrates that the judogi has passed a number of quality control tests to ensure it conforms to construction regulations ensuring it is not too stiff, flexible, rigid or slippery to allow the opponent to grip or to perform techniques.
==Organizations==

The international governing body for judo is the International Judo Federation (IJF), founded in 1951. Members of the IJF include the African Judo Union (AJU), the Pan-American Judo Confederation (PJC), the Judo Union of Asia (JUA), the European Judo Union (EJU) and the Oceania Judo Union (OJU), each comprising a number of national judo associations. The IJF is responsible for organising international competition and hosts the World Judo Championships and is involved in running the Olympic Judo events.

==Rank and grading==
Judo is a hierarchical art, where seniority of judoka is designated by what is known as the - ranking system. This system was developed by Jigoro Kano and was based on the ranking system in the board game Go.

Beginning students progress through kyu grades towards dan grades.

A judoka&#x27;s position within the kyu-dan ranking system is displayed by the color of their belt. Beginning students typically wear a white belt, progressing through descending kyu ranks until they are deemed to have achieved a level of competence sufficient to be a dan grade, at which point they wear the . The kyu-dan ranking system has since been widely adopted by modern martial arts.

The highest black belt ranks have no formal requirements and are decided by the president of the Kodokan. Kano Jigoro&#x27;s grandson Kano Yukimitsu served as the fourth president from 1980 until 2009. As an educator by profession, Kanō believed that there should be no end to an individual&#x27;s learning, and therefore no limit to the number of dan ranks. As of 2011, fifteen Japanese men have been promoted to by the Kodokan; the IJF and Western and Asian national federations have promoted another eleven who are not recognized at that level of rank by the Kodokan. On 28 July 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded Keiko Fukuda the rank of 10th &quot;dan&quot;, who was the first woman to be promoted to judo&#x27;s highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.

Although &quot;dan&quot; ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the &quot;kyū&quot; grades, with some countries having more &quot;kyū&quot; grades. Although initially &quot;kyū&quot; grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a dan rank in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in kimono, only white and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the judogi, that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created. Written accounts from the archives of London&#x27;s Budokwai judo club, founded in 1918, record the use of coloured judo belts at the 1926 9th annual Budokwai Display, and a list of ranked colored judokas appears in the Budokwai Committee Minutes of June 1927. Kawaishi visited London and the Budokwai in 1928, and was probably inspired to bring the coloured belt system to France.

== World Judo Day ==
On October 28 of every year, the judo community celebrates the World Judo Day in the honor of the birth of Judo&#x27;s founder, Jigoro Kano. The theme of the World Judo Day changes from year to year, but the goal is always to highlight the moral values of Judo. The first celebration was held in 2011. Past themes for the celebration have included:

* Bring a Friend (2023)
* Inclusion (2022)
* Solidarity (2021)
* Stronger Together (2020)

<doc id="15604" wikidata="Q844" url="?curid=15604" title="James Bond">
<text>The James Bond franchise focuses on the titular character, a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming&#x27;s death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is &quot;With a Mind to Kill&quot; by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2022. Additionally, Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.

The character—also known by the code number 007 (pronounced &quot;double-oh-seven&quot;)—has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strips, video games and film. The &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The films constitute one of the longest continually running film series and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total at the box office, making &quot;James Bond&quot; the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with &quot;Dr. No&quot;, starring Sean Connery as Bond. , there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent Bond film productions: &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965&#x27;s &quot;Thunderball&quot;, both starring Connery). &quot;Casino Royale&quot; has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series &quot;Climax!&quot;.

The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and three wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond&#x27;s cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond&#x27;s relationships with various women, who are popularly referred to as &quot;Bond girls&quot;.

== Publication history ==
=== Creation and inspiration ===
Ian Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division and 30 Assault Unit during the Second World War, admitting that Bond &quot;was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war&quot;. Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. Aside from Fleming&#x27;s brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond&#x27;s make up, including Conrad O&#x27;Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job, Bill &quot;Biffy&quot; Dunderdale and Duško Popov.

The name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide &quot;Birds of the West Indies&quot;. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond&#x27;s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist&#x27;s wife that &quot;It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born&quot;. He further explained that:

On another occasion, Fleming said: &quot;I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, &#x27;James Bond&#x27; was much better than something more interesting, like &#x27;Peregrine Carruthers&#x27;. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.&quot;

Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Vesper Lynd remarks, &quot;Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.&quot; Likewise, in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, Special Branch officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is &quot;certainly good-looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.&quot;

Fleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs, and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond&#x27;s tastes are also often taken from Fleming&#x27;s own as was his behaviour, with Bond&#x27;s love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming&#x27;s own. Fleming used his experiences of his career in espionage and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.

It was not until the penultimate novel, &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of &quot;Dr. No&quot; in cinemas, and Sean Connery&#x27;s depiction of Bond affected Fleming&#x27;s interpretation of the character, henceforth giving Bond both a dry sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in &quot;The Times&quot;, Bond&#x27;s parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond&#x27;s date of birth, but John Pearson&#x27;s fictional biography of Bond, &quot;James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007&quot;, gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.

=== Novels and related works ===
==== Ian Fleming novels ====
Whilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author; he had told a friend, &quot;I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.&quot; On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year. He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.

After completing the manuscript for &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Fleming showed it to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming&#x27;s older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books—&quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; and &quot;Octopussy and The Living Daylights&quot;—published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.

==== Post-Fleming novels ====
After Fleming&#x27;s death, a continuation novel, &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;, was written by Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels in his 1965 work &quot;The James Bond Dossier&quot;. Although novelisations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, &quot;James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;James Bond and Moonraker&quot;, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981, the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with &quot;Licence Renewed&quot;. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote were novelisations of Eon Productions films of the same name: &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; and &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.

In 1996, the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels. Benson had previously been the author of &quot;The James Bond Bedside Companion&quot;, first published in 1984.
By the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelisations and three short stories.

After a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming&#x27;s birth. The book—titled &quot;Devil May Care&quot;—was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US. American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;, which was published on 26 May 2011. The book turned Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013, &quot;Solo&quot; by William Boyd, set in 1969, was published. In October 2014, it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a &quot;Bond&quot; continuation novel. Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot; was released on 8 September 2015. Horowitz&#x27;s second Bond novel, &quot;Forever and a Day&quot;, tells the origin story of Bond as a 00 agent prior to the events of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. The novel, also based on unpublished material from Fleming, was released on 31 May 2018. Horowitz&#x27;s third Bond novel, &quot;With a Mind to Kill&quot;, was published on 26 May 2022. Charlie Higson&#x27;s first adult Bond novel, &quot;On His Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, was published on 4 May 2023 to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III and support the National Literacy Trust.
==== Young Bond ====
The &quot;Young Bond&quot; series of novels was started by Charlie Higson and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published. The first Young Bond novel, &quot;SilverFin&quot; was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books. In October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.

==== &quot;The Moneypenny Diaries&quot; ====
&quot;The Moneypenny Diaries&quot; are a trilogy of novels chronicling the life of Miss Moneypenny, M&#x27;s personal secretary. The novels are written by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym Kate Westbrook, who is depicted as the book&#x27;s &quot;editor&quot;. The first instalment of the trilogy, subtitled &quot;Guardian Angel&quot;, was released on 10 October 2005 in the UK. A second volume, subtitled &quot;Secret Servant&quot; was released on 2 November 2006 in the UK, published by John Murray. A third volume, subtitled &quot;Final Fling&quot; was released on 1 May 2008.

== Adaptations ==
=== Television ===
In 1954, CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($ in dollars) to adapt his novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot; into a one-hour television adventure, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, as part of its &quot;Climax!&quot; series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as &quot;Card Sense&quot; James Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for &quot;Combined Intelligence&quot;, while the character Felix Leiter—American in the novel—became British onscreen and was renamed &quot;Clarence Leiter&quot;.

In 1964 Roger Moore appeared as &quot;James Bond&quot; in an extended comedy sketch opposite Millicent Martin in her ATV TV series &quot;Mainly Millicent&quot;, which also makes reference to &quot;007&quot;. It was written by Dick Hills and Sid Green. Undiscovered for several years, it reappeared as an extra in the DVD and Blu-ray release of &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;.

In 1973, a BBC documentary &quot;Omnibus: The British Hero&quot; featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from
&quot;Goldfinger&quot;—notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel&#x27;s circular saw, rather than the film&#x27;s laser beam—and &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

In 1991, a spin-off animated series, &quot;James Bond Jr.&quot;, was produced with Corey Burton in the role of Bond&#x27;s nephew, James Bond Jr.

In 2022, a reality competition show based on the franchise, &quot;007: Road to a Million&quot;, was released on Amazon Prime Video.

=== Radio ===
In 1958, the novel &quot;Moonraker&quot; was adapted for broadcast on South African radio, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob&#x27;s cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination&quot;.

The BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011. On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of &quot;Dr. No&quot;. The actor Toby Stephens, who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, played Bond, while Dr. No was played by David Suchet. Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Goldfinger&quot; with Stephens again playing Bond. Sir Ian McKellen was Goldfinger and Stephens&#x27; &quot;Die Another Day&quot; co-star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming&#x27;s novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.
In 2012, the novel &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot; was dramatised for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond. In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, with Alfred Molina as Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley (who appeared in the 1969 film adaptation) as Irma Bunt.

=== Comics ===

In 1957, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication. After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed. To aid the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming&#x27;s 007 looked too &quot;outdated&quot; and &quot;pre-war&quot; and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. The first strip, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.

Most of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis&#x27;s &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence (except for the adaptation of &quot;Dr. No&quot; which was written by future Modesty Blaise creator Peter O&#x27;Donnell) with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966. After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Sunday Express&quot; until May 1977.

Several comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of &quot;Dr. No&quot;&#x27;s release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its &quot;Showcase&quot; anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).

With the release of the 1981 film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Marvel Comics published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film. When &quot;Octopussy&quot; was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic; Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used. New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, Eclipse Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Entertainment.

=== Films ===
==== Eon Productions films ====
Eon Productions, the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli, released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), based on the eponymous 1958 novel and featuring Sean Connery as 007. Connery starred in a further four films before leaving the role after &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), which was taken up by George Lazenby for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969). Lazenby left the role after just one appearance and Connery was brought back for his last Eon-produced film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

Roger Moore was appointed to the role of 007 for &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973). He played Bond a further six times over twelve years, before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon&#x27;s productions of the Bond films, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995); he remained in the role for a total of four films through 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), which rebooted the series. Craig appeared for a total of five films. The series has grossed well over $7 billion to date, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series.

In March 2022, Amazon purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion, and the distribution rights to its library of films including the James Bond movies. After creating the merged Amazon MGM Studios, the company became involved in developing the next theatrical iteration of the character. By February 2025, the studio paid an additional $1 billion to acquire creative control of the future of the franchise from Broccoli and Wilson; with the duo officially retiring from historical oversight career for James Bond feature films. As part of the deal, the family will receive a monetary &quot;Bond dividend&quot; for the foreseeable future. Amazon MGM commence the search for a studio executive to oversee the property (à la Marvel Studios&#x27; Kevin Feige), while also determining the next respective director and star of the franchise.



==== Non-Eon films ====
In 1967, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was adapted into a parody Bond film starring David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming&#x27;s preference for the role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot; titled &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman&#x27;s Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, was not part of the Eon series of Bond films. In 1997, the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory&#x27;s rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; from Taliafilm. , Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels.

==== Music ====


The &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot;, although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as &quot;bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes.&quot; Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to &quot;Dr. No&quot; with his arrangement of the Bond Theme.

A Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well-known popular singers. Shirley Bassey performed three Bond theme songs, with her 1964 song &quot;Goldfinger&quot; inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, Sheena Easton&#x27;s &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Adele&#x27;s &quot;Skyfall&quot;, Sam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot;, and 
Billie Eilish&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Die&quot;. Adele won the award at the 85th Academy Awards, Smith won at the 88th Academy Awards, and Eilish won at the 94th Academy Awards. For the non-Eon produced &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Burt Bacharach&#x27;s score included &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (sung by Dusty Springfield), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.

=== Video games ===
In 1983, the first Bond video game, developed and published by Parker Brothers, was released for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and ColecoVision. Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines. In 1997, the first-person shooter video game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, based on &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. The game received highly positive reviews, won the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for UK Developer of the Year in 1998, and sold over eight million copies worldwide, grossing $250 million, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.

In 1999, Electronic Arts acquired the licence and released &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; on 16 December 1999. In October 2000, they released &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; for the Nintendo 64 followed by &quot;007 Racing&quot; for the PlayStation on 21 November 2000. In 2003, the company released &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;, which included the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Judi Dench and John Cleese, amongst others. In November 2005, Electronic Arts released a video game adaptation of &quot;007: From Russia with Love&quot;, which involved Sean Connery&#x27;s image and voice-over for Bond. In 2006, Electronic Arts announced a game based on then-upcoming film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;: the game was cancelled because it would not be ready by the film&#x27;s release in November of that year. With MGM losing revenue from lost licensing fees, the franchise was moved from EA to Activision. Activision subsequently released the &quot;007: Quantum of Solace&quot; game on 31 October 2008, based on the film of the same name.

A new version of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; featuring Daniel Craig was released for the Wii and a handheld version for the Nintendo DS in November 2010. A year later a new version was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title &quot;GoldenEye 007: Reloaded&quot;. In October 2012 &quot;007 Legends&quot; was released, which featured one mission from each of the Bond actors of the Eon Productions&#x27; series. In November 2020, IO Interactive announced &quot;Project 007&quot;, an original James Bond video game, working closely with licensors MGM and Eon Productions.

=== Role-playing game ===
From 1983 to 1987, a licensed tabletop role-playing game, &quot;James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, was published by Victory Games (a branch of Avalon Hill) and designed by Gerard Christopher Klug. It was the most popular espionage role-playing game for its time. In addition to providing materials for players to create original scenarios, the game also offered players the opportunity to have adventures modelled after many of the Eon Productions film adaptations, albeit with modifications to provide challenges by preventing players from slavishly imitating Bond&#x27;s actions in the stories.

== Guns, vehicles, skills and gadgets ==
=== Guns ===
For the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising Fleming&#x27;s choice of firearm for Bond, calling it &quot;a lady&#x27;s gun—and not a very nice lady at that!&quot; Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a 7.65mm Walther PPK and this exchange of arms made it to &quot;Dr. No&quot;. Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains. In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, M, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, introduces him to Bond as &quot;the greatest small-arms expert in the world&quot;. Bond also used a variety of rifles, including the Savage Model 99 in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and a Winchester .308 target rifle in &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long-barrelled Colt .45 Army Special.

The first Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot;, saw M ordering Bond to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK, which Bond used in eighteen films. In &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; and the two subsequent films, Bond&#x27;s main weapon was the Walther P99 semi-automatic pistol.

=== Vehicles ===
In the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond&#x27;s car was written off by Hugo Drax in &quot;Moonraker&quot;, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series. During &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Bond was issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.

The Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, as well as the Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citroën 2CV to a Routemaster Bus, amongst others.

Bond&#x27;s most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5, first seen in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;; it later featured in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;. The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2.1 million to an unnamed European collector. In 2010, another DB5 used in Goldfinger was sold at auction for $4.6m million (£2.6 million).

=== Skills ===
James Bond possesses a diverse set of skills that contribute to his effectiveness as a secret agent:

* Marksmanship: Bond demonstrates exceptional proficiency with firearms, particularly handguns and rifles, showcasing remarkable accuracy and quick reflexes.
* Hand-to-hand combat: He is skilled in various forms of unarmed combat, including judo and boxing, allowing him to defeat opponents in close quarters.
* Espionage techniques: As a top MI6 agent, Bond excels in espionage methods such as infiltration, surveillance, and intelligence gathering.

=== Gadgets ===
Fleming&#x27;s novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped attaché case in &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films &quot;Dr. No&quot; and &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; had an effect on the novel &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming&#x27;s final story.

For the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series. &quot;Dr. No&quot; provided no spy-related gadgets, but a Geiger counter was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attaché case shown in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, which he described as &quot;a classic 007 product&quot;. The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. The film&#x27;s success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.

Davey noted that &quot;Bond&#x27;s gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other ... nuance in the films&quot; as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films. It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie autogyro, a jet pack and the exploding attaché case, the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices, including Scaramanga&#x27;s golden gun, Rosa Klebb&#x27;s poison-tipped shoes, Oddjob&#x27;s steel-rimmed bowler hat and Blofeld&#x27;s communication devices in his agents&#x27; vanity case.

== Cultural impact ==

Cinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise&#x27;s popularity and success. The first parody was the 1964 film &quot;Carry On Spying&quot;, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an &quot;anti-Bond&quot;, or what Christoph Lindner calls &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s Bond&quot;. The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four &quot;Matt Helm&quot; films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the &quot;Flint&quot; series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1967), while &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond&#x27;s prominence in popular culture. More recently, the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the &quot;Johnny English&quot; trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.

Following the release of the film &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, the line &quot;Bond ... James Bond&quot;, became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in &quot;Dr. No&quot; that the &quot;signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever&quot;. In 2001, it was voted as the &quot;best-loved one-liner in cinema&quot; by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. A 2024 survey by online investment advisor and digital wealth management company MoneyFarm found that 70 per cent of Brits said they associated the word &quot;bond&quot; with James Bond, rather than the savings product of the same name.

The 2005 American Film Institute&#x27;s &#x27;100 Years&#x27; series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by &quot;Empire&quot; and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by &quot;Premiere&quot;. In 1965, &quot;Time&quot; magazine observed &quot;James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade&quot;.

The 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since &quot;Dr. No&quot;, a quarter of the world&#x27;s population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors&#x27; Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they &quot;form the backbone of the industry&quot;.

Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, which was described as the &quot;first network television imitation&quot; of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include &quot;I Spy&quot;, and &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the &#x27;Milk Tray Man&#x27;, a tough James Bond–style figure who undertakes daunting &#x27;raids&#x27; to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release. 

Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. &quot;Bondmania&quot;, a term deriving from the adjacent &quot;Beatlemania&quot; and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children&#x27;s toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in Sölden at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above sea level.

The real MI6 has an ambiguous relationship with Bond. The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates. While serving as Chief of SIS, Alex Younger said that were Bond to apply for an MI6 job &quot;he would have to change his ways&quot;. Younger said, however, that the franchise had &quot;created a powerful brand for MI6 ... Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym&quot;, and that being depicted to global audiences as a &quot;ubiquitous intelligence presence&quot; was &quot;quite a force multiplier&quot;. The Russian Federal Security Service so envied Bond that it created an annual award for fictional depictions of Russian spies.

== Public reception ==
The James Bond franchise enjoys widespread popularity across the world. In 2014, it was estimated that approximately 20% of the world&#x27;s population has watched at least one Bond film.

In 2012, the polling organisation YouGov conducted a survey of American Bond fans, categorising responses by age, sex and political affiliation. All groups selected Sean Connery as their favourite Bond actor. A 2018 poll found that 47% of American adults had seen at least one Bond film, with 27% having seen every film.

Queen Elizabeth II met the first six actors to play James Bond on the screen. She met Connery at the world premiere of &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; in 1967, and, according to the royal biographer Gyles Brandreth: &quot;She really did love all the early James Bond films&quot;, preferring the earlier films, &quot;before they got so loud&quot;. Several prominent politicians have also been fans of the franchise, including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Kim Jong Il.

=== Criticisms ===
The James Bond character and related media have received a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse the Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. In September 2021, &quot;No Time to Die&quot; director Cary Fukunaga described Sean Connery&#x27;s version of Bond as &#x27;basically a rapist&#x27;. The franchise has on occasion also been a target of religious criticism. In 1962, Vatican City&#x27;s official newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; condemned the film &quot;Dr. No&quot;, referring to it as &quot;a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex&quot;. However, in 2012, the newspaper went on to give positive reviews to the film &quot;Skyfall&quot;.

Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that the Bond films reflect imperial nostalgia.

==Censorship and alterations==
===Bans and censorship by country===
Several James Bond novels, films, and video games have been banned, censored, or altered in several countries. 

===2023 changes===
In February 2023, Ian Fleming Publications (which administers all Fleming&#x27;s literary works), edited the Bond series as part of a sensitivity review. The April 2023 re-releases of the series are planned to tie into the 70th anniversary of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. The new editions remove a number of references to race, including some slurs, along with some disparagements of women and homosexuality. They include a disclaimer added at the beginning of each book, reading:

This book was written at a time when terms and attitudes which might be considered offensive by modern readers were commonplace. A number of updates have been made in this edition, while keeping as close as possible to the original text and the period in which it is set. 

The decision was met with strong criticism by media outlets and public commentators, who condemned the changes as literary censorship. &quot;The View&quot; host Whoopi Goldberg expressed her opposition, arguing that offensive historical literature should be left unaltered; while &quot;National Review&quot; contributors Charles C. W. Cooke and Douglas Murray attacked the changes as excessive political correctness. Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett also opposed the changes, writing that &quot;what an author commits to paper is sacrosanct and shouldn&#x27;t be altered...The only changes to the text should come from the author.&quot;

<doc id="15606" wikidata="Q5287" url="?curid=15606" title="Japanese language">
<text>is the principal language of the Japonic language family spoken by the Japanese people. It has around 123 million speakers, primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national language, and within the Japanese diaspora worldwide.

The Japonic family also includes the Ryukyuan languages and the variously classified Hachijō language. There have been many attempts to group the Japonic languages with other families such as Ainu, Austronesian, Koreanic, and the now discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals have gained any widespread acceptance.

Little is known of the language&#x27;s prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial Old Japanese texts did not appear until the 8th century. From the Heian period (794–1185), extensive waves of Sino-Japanese vocabulary entered the language, affecting the phonology of Early Middle Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (1185–1600) saw extensive grammatical changes and the first appearance of European loanwords. The basis of the standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo region (modern Tokyo) in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century–mid 19th century). Following the end of Japan&#x27;s self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly, and words from English roots have proliferated.

Japanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with relatively simple phonotactics, a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. Word order is normally subject–object–verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic–comment. Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or form questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. Japanese adjectives are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics, with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.

The Japanese writing system combines Chinese characters, known as , with two unique syllabaries (or moraic scripts) derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters: ( or , &#x27;simple characters&#x27;) and ( or , &#x27;partial characters&#x27;). Latin script ( ) is also used in a limited fashion (such as for imported acronyms) in Japanese writing. The numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals, but also traditional Chinese numerals.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Proto-Japonic, the common ancestor of the Japanese and Ryukyuan languages, is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from the Korean peninsula sometime in the early- to mid-4th century BC (the Yayoi period), replacing the languages of the original Jōmon inhabitants, including the ancestor of the modern Ainu language. Because writing had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period must be based on internal reconstruction from Old Japanese, or comparison with the Ryukyuan languages and Japanese dialects.

===Old Japanese===
The Chinese writing system was imported to Japan from Baekje around the start of the fifth century, alongside Buddhism. The earliest texts were written in Classical Chinese, although some of these were likely intended to be read as Japanese using the method, and show influences of Japanese grammar such as Japanese word order. The earliest text, the , dates to the early eighth century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters, which are used to represent, at different times, Chinese, &quot;kanbun&quot;, and Old Japanese. As in other texts from this period, the Old Japanese sections are written in Man&#x27;yōgana, which uses &quot;kanji&quot; for their phonetic as well as semantic values.

Based on the Man&#x27;yōgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct morae. Texts written with Man&#x27;yōgana use two different sets of &quot;kanji&quot; for each of the morae now pronounced , , , , , , , , , , , and . (The has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo1 and mo2 apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of morae shrank to 67 in Early Middle Japanese, though some were added through Chinese influence. Man&#x27;yōgana also has a symbol for , which merges with before the end of the period.

Several fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language – the genitive particle &quot;tsu&quot; (superseded by modern &quot;no&quot;) is preserved in words such as &quot;matsuge&quot; (&quot;eyelash&quot;, lit. &quot;hair of the eye&quot;); modern &quot;mieru&quot; (&quot;to be visible&quot;) and &quot;kikoeru&quot; (&quot;to be audible&quot;) retain a mediopassive suffix -&quot;yu(ru)&quot; (&quot;kikoyu&quot; → &quot;kikoyuru&quot; (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) → &quot;kikoeru&quot; (all verbs with the &quot;shimo-nidan&quot; conjugation pattern underwent this same shift in Early Modern Japanese)); and the genitive particle &quot;ga&quot; remains in intentionally archaic speech.

===Early Middle Japanese===
Early Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the Heian period, from 794 to 1185. It formed the basis for the literary standard of Classical Japanese, which remained in common use until the early 20th century.

During this time, Japanese underwent numerous phonological developments, in many cases instigated by an influx of Chinese loanwords. These included phonemic length distinction for both consonants and vowels, palatal consonants (e.g. &quot;kya&quot;) and labial consonant clusters (e.g. &quot;kwa&quot;), and closed syllables. This had the effect of changing Japanese into a mora-timed language.

===Late Middle Japanese===

Late Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the &quot;Arte da Lingoa de Iapam&quot;). Among other sound changes, the sequence merges to , in contrast with ; is reintroduced from Chinese; and merges with . Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear – the continuative ending -&quot;te&quot; begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. &quot;yonde&quot; for earlier &quot;yomite&quot;), the -k- in the final mora of adjectives drops out (&quot;shiroi&quot; for earlier &quot;shiroki&quot;); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. &quot;hayaku&quot; &gt; &quot;hayau&quot; &gt; &quot;hayɔɔ&quot;, where modern Japanese just has &quot;hayaku&quot;, though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting &quot;o-hayō gozaimasu&quot; &quot;good morning&quot;; this ending is also seen in &quot;o-medetō&quot; &quot;congratulations&quot;, from &quot;medetaku&quot;).

Late Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages – now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include &quot;pan&quot; (&quot;bread&quot;) and &quot;tabako&quot; (&quot;tobacco&quot;, now &quot;cigarette&quot;), both from Portuguese.

===Modern Japanese===

Modern Japanese is considered to begin with the Edo period (which spanned from 1603 to 1867). Since Old Japanese, the &quot;de facto&quot; standard Japanese had been the Kansai dialect, especially that of Kyoto. However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of Japan&#x27;s self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen many words borrowed from other languagessuch as German (e.g. &#x27;temporary job&#x27;, &#x27;vaccine&#x27;), Portuguese ( &#x27;sponge cake&#x27;) and English. Many English loan words especially relate to technologyfor example, &#x27;personal computer&#x27;, &#x27;internet&#x27;, and &#x27;camera&#x27;. Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between and , and and , with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords, eg. for party or for Disney.

==Geographic distribution==
Although Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has also been spoken outside of the country. Before and during World War II, through Japanese annexation of Taiwan and Korea, as well as partial occupation of China, the Philippines, and various Pacific islands, locals in those countries learned Japanese as the language of the empire. As a result, many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese.

Japanese emigrant communities (the largest of which are to be found in Brazil, with 1.4 million to 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants, according to Brazilian IBGE data, more than the 1.2 million of the United States) sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language. Approximately 12% of Hawaii residents speak Japanese, with an estimated 12.6% of the population of Japanese ancestry in 2008. Japanese emigrants can also be found in Peru, Argentina, Australia (especially in the eastern states), Canada (especially in Vancouver, where 1.4% of the population has Japanese ancestry), the United States (notably in Hawaii, where 16.7% of the population has Japanese ancestry, and California), and the Philippines (particularly in Davao Region and the Province of Laguna).

===Official status===
Japanese has no official status in Japan, but is the &quot;de facto&quot; national language of the country. There is a form of the language considered standard: , meaning &quot;standard Japanese&quot;, or , &quot;common language&quot;, or even &quot;Tokyo dialect&quot; at times. The meanings of the two terms (&quot;hyōjungo&quot; and &quot;kyōtsūgo&quot;) are almost the same. &quot;Hyōjungo&quot; or &quot;kyōtsūgo&quot; is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see Yamanote). &quot;Hyōjungo&quot; is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications. It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.

Formerly, standard was different from . The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. &quot;Bungo&quot; was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then &quot;kōgo&quot; gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. &quot;Bungo&quot; still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in &quot;bungo&quot;, although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). &quot;Kōgo&quot; is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although &quot;bungo&quot; grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.

Japanese is, along with Palauan and English, an official language of Angaur, Palau according to the 1982 state constitution. At the time it was written, many of the elders participating in the process had been educated in Japanese during the South Seas Mandate over the island, as shown by the 1958 census of the Trust Territory of the Pacific which found that 89% of Palauans born between 1914 and 1933 could speak and read Japanese. However, as of the 2005 Palau census, no residents of Angaur were reported to speak Japanese at home.

===Dialects and mutual intelligibility===

Japanese dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent, inflectional morphology, vocabulary, and particle usage. Some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories, although this is less common.

In terms of mutual intelligibility, a survey in 1967 found that the four most unintelligible dialects (excluding Ryūkyūan languages and Tōhoku dialects) to students from Greater Tokyo were the Kiso dialect (in the deep mountains of Nagano Prefecture), the Himi dialect (in Toyama Prefecture), the Kagoshima dialect and the Maniwa dialect (in Okayama Prefecture). The survey was based on 12- to 20-second-long recordings of 135 to 244 phonemes, which 42 students listened to and translated word-for-word. The listeners were all Keio University students who grew up in the Kantō region.

There are some language islands in mountain villages or isolated islands such as Hachijō-jima island, whose dialects are descended from Eastern Old Japanese. Dialects of the Kansai region are spoken or known by many Japanese, and Osaka dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see Kansai dialect). Dialects of Tōhoku and North Kantō are associated with typical farmers.

The Ryūkyūan languages, spoken in Okinawa and the Amami Islands (administratively part of Kagoshima), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the Japonic family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ryūkyūan languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ryūkyūan languages as dialects of Japanese.

The imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time, most likely the spoken form of Classical Japanese, a writing style that was prevalent during the Heian period, but began to decline during the late Meiji period. The Ryūkyūan languages are classified by UNESCO as &#x27;endangered&#x27;, as young people mostly use Japanese and cannot understand the languages. Okinawan Japanese is a variant of Standard Japanese influenced by the Ryūkyūan languages, and is the primary dialect spoken among young people in the Ryukyu Islands.

Modern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ryūkyū islands) due to education, mass media, and an increase in mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.

== Classification ==

Japanese is a member of the Japonic language family, which also includes the Ryukyuan languages spoken in the Ryukyu Islands. As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is sometimes called a language isolate.

According to Martine Robbeets, Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world. Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu, Korean, Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Uralic, Altaic (or Ural-Altaic), Austroasiatic, Austronesian and Dravidian. At the fringe, some linguists have even suggested a link to Indo-European languages, including Greek, or to Sumerian. Main modern theories try to link Japanese either to northern Asian languages, like Korean or the proposed larger Altaic family, or to various Southeast Asian languages, especially Austronesian. None of these proposals have gained wide acceptance (and the Altaic family itself is now considered controversial). As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support.

Other theories view the Japanese language as an early creole language formed through inputs from at least two distinct language groups, or as a distinct language of its own that has absorbed various aspects from neighboring languages.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===


Japanese has five vowels, and vowel length is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a macron) in rōmaji, a repeated vowel character in hiragana, or a chōonpu succeeding the vowel in katakana. is compressed rather than protruded, or simply unrounded.

===Consonants===
Some Japanese consonants have several allophones, which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence was palatalized and realized phonetically as , approximately ; however, now and are distinct, as evidenced by words like &quot;Western-style tea&quot; and &quot;social status&quot;.

The &quot;r&quot; of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an apical central tap and a lateral approximant. The &quot;g&quot; is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced , in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.

The phonotactics of Japanese are relatively simple. The syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), that is, a core vowel surrounded by an optional onset consonant, a glide and either the first part of a geminate consonant (/, represented as Q) or a moraic nasal in the coda (/, represented as N).

The nasal is sensitive to its phonetic environment and assimilates to the following phoneme, with pronunciations including . Onset-glide clusters only occur at the start of syllables but clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are the moraic nasal followed by a homorganic consonant.

Japanese also includes a pitch accent, which is not represented in moraic writing; for example (&quot;chopsticks&quot;) and (&quot;bridge&quot;) are both spelled , and are only differentiated by the tone contour.

== Writing system ==

===History===
Literacy was introduced to Japan in the form of the Chinese writing system, by way of Baekje before the 5th century AD. Using this script, the Japanese king Bu presented a petition to Emperor Shun of Song in AD 478. After the ruin of Baekje, Japan invited scholars from China to learn more of the Chinese writing system. Japanese emperors gave an official rank to Chinese scholars (/) and spread the use of Chinese characters during the 7th and 8th centuries.

At first, the Japanese wrote in Classical Chinese, with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds. Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This was the beginning of Japanese as a written language in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the Ryukyuan languages.

An example of this mixed style is the , which was written in AD 712. Japanese writers then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;, a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech mora by mora.

Over time, a writing system evolved. Chinese characters (kanji) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements; these were simplified, and eventually became two moraic scripts: hiragana and katakana which were developed based on Man&#x27;yōgana. Some scholars claim that Manyogana originated from Baekje, but this hypothesis is denied by mainstream Japanese scholars.

Hiragana and katakana were first simplified from kanji, and hiragana, emerging somewhere around the 9th century, was mainly used by women. Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas katakana and kanji were considered more formal and were typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana&#x27;s accessibility, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.

Modern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: kanji, characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese loanwords into Japanese and a number of native Japanese morphemes; and two syllabaries: hiragana and katakana. The Latin script (or &quot;rōmaji&quot; in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as &quot;ramen&quot; at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji numerals when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as .

Historically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but government did not intervene until after Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Second World War. During the post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of rōmaji were considered. The &quot;jōyō kanji&quot; (&quot;common use kanji&quot;), originally called &quot;tōyō kanji&quot; (kanji for general use) scheme arose as a compromise solution.

Japanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of &quot;kyōiku kanji&quot; (&quot;education kanji&quot;, a subset of &quot;jōyō kanji&quot;), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 &quot;jōyō kanji&quot;. The official list of &quot;jōyō kanji&quot; has been revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters has remained largely unchanged.

As for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. &quot;Jōyō kanji&quot; and &quot;jinmeiyō kanji&quot; (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of &quot;jōyō kanji&quot;, criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of &quot;jinmeiyō kanji&quot; was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.

===Hiragana===
&quot;Hiragana&quot; are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, for replacement of rare kanji that may be unfamiliar to intended readers, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are conjugated, kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing their meaning. For this reason, hiragana are appended to kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called okurigana. Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called furigana above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.

===Katakana===
&quot;Katakana&quot;, like hiragana, constitute a syllabary; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, &quot;Australia&quot; has been adapted as , and &quot;supermarket&quot; has been adapted and shortened into .

== Grammar ==


===Sentence structure===
Japanese word order is classified as subject–object–verb. Unlike many Indo-European languages, the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with particles that identify their grammatical functions.

The basic sentence structure is topic–comment. Once the topic has been stated using the particle , it is normally omitted in subsequent sentences, and the next use of &quot;wa&quot; will change the topic. For instance, someone may begin a conversation with a sentence that includes . Each person may say a number of comments regarding Tanaka as the topic, and someone could change the topic to Naoko with a sentence including . 

As these example translations illustrate, a sentence may include a topic, but the topic is not part of sentence&#x27;s core statement. Japanese is often called a topic-prominent language because of its strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and the two do not always coincide. That is, a sentence might not involve the topic directly at all. To replicate this effect in English, consider &quot;As for Naoko, people are rude.&quot; The topic, &quot;Naoko,&quot; provides context to the comment about the subject, &quot;people,&quot; and the sentence as a whole indicates that &quot;people are rude&quot; is a statement relevant to Naoko. However, the sentence&#x27;s comment does not describe Naoko directly at all, and whatever the sentence indicates about Naoko is an inference. The topic is not the core of the sentence; the core of the sentence is always the comment.

In a basic comment, the subject is marked with the particle , and the rest of the comment describes the subject. For example, in , &quot;ga&quot; indicates that &quot;elephant&quot; is the subject of the sentence. Context determines whether the speaker means a single elephant or elephants plural. The copula ends the sentence, indicating that the subject is equivalent to the rest of the comment. Here, &quot;doubutsu&quot; means &quot;animal&quot;. Therefore, the sentence means &quot;[The] elephant is [an] animal&quot; or &quot;Elephants are animals.&quot; A basic comment can end in three ways: with the copula &quot;da&quot;, with a different verb, or with an adjective ending in the kana . A sentence ending might also be decorated with particles that alter the way the sentence is meant to be interpreted, as in . This is also why &quot;da&quot; is replaced with when the speaker is talking to someone they do not know well: it makes the sentence more polite.

Often, &quot;ga&quot; implies distinction of the subject within the topic, so the previous example comment would make the most sense within a topic where not all of the relevant subjects were animals. For example, in , the particle &quot;wa&quot; indicates the topic is &quot;kono ganbutsu&quot; (&quot;this toy&quot; or &quot;these toys&quot;). In English, if there are many toys and one is an elephant, this could mean &quot;Among these toys, [the] elephant is [an] animal.&quot; That said, if the subject is clearly a subtopic, this differentiation effect may or may not be relevant, such as in . The equivalent sentence, &quot;As for the Japanese language, grammar is easy,&quot; might be a general statement that Japanese grammar is easy or a statement that grammar is an especially easy feature of the Japanese language. Context should reveal which.

Because &quot;ga&quot; marks the subject of the sentence but the sentence overall is intended to be relevant to the topic indicated by &quot;wa&quot;, translations of Japanese into English often elide the difference between these particles. For example, the phrase &quot;watashi wa zou ga suki da&quot; literally means &quot;As for myself, elephants are likeable.&quot; The sentence about myself describes elephants as having a likeable quality. From this, it is clear that I like elephants, and this sentence is often translated into English as &quot;I like elephants.&quot; However, to do so changes the subject of the sentence (from &quot;Elephant&quot; to &quot;I&quot;) and the verb (from &quot;is&quot; to &quot;like&quot;); it does not reflect Japanese grammar.

Japanese grammar tends toward brevity; the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated and pronouns may be omitted if they can be inferred from context. In the example above, &quot;zou ga doubutsu da&quot; would mean &quot;[the] elephant is [an] animal&quot;, while &quot;doubutsu da&quot; by itself would mean &quot;[they] are animals.&quot; In especially casual speech, many speakers would omit the copula, leaving the noun &quot;doubutsu&quot; to mean &quot;[they are] animals.&quot; A single verb can be a complete sentence: . In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: ).

Nevertheless, unlike the topic, the subject is always implied: all sentences which omit a &quot;ga&quot; particle must have an implied subject that could be specified with a &quot;ga&quot; particle. For example, means &quot;As for this cat, [it] is Loki.&quot; An equivalent sentence might read , meaning &quot;As for this cat, this is Loki.&quot; However, in the same way it is unusual to state the subject twice in the English sentence, it is unusual to specify that redundant subject in Japanese. Rather than replace the redundant subject with a word like &quot;it,&quot; the redundant subject is omitted from the Japanese sentence. It is obvious from the context that the first sentence refers to the cat by the name &quot;Loki,&quot; and the explicit subject of the second sentence contributes no information. 

While the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases, Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: &quot;down&quot; to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group, and &quot;up&quot; to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, means &quot;[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]&quot;. Similarly, means &quot;[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]&quot;. Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.

Japanese &quot;pronouns&quot; also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:

The amazed he ran down the street. (grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun)

But one &quot;can&quot; grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:

&lt;poem&gt;
Transliteration: (grammatically correct)&lt;/poem&gt;

This is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as &quot;you&quot; ( &quot;lord&quot;), &quot;you&quot; ( &quot;that side, yonder&quot;), and &quot;I&quot; ( &quot;servant&quot;). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese &quot;pronouns&quot; as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish (contracted from , &quot;your (majestic plural) grace&quot;) or Portuguese (from ). Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.

The choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as or (also , hyper-polite form), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word or &quot;boku&quot;. Similarly, different words such as &quot;anata&quot;, &quot;kimi&quot;, and (, more formally &quot;the one before me&quot;) may refer to a listener depending on the listener&#x27;s relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.

Japanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one&#x27;s teacher, it is appropriate to use , but inappropriate to use &quot;anata&quot;. This is because &quot;anata&quot; is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one&#x27;s teacher has higher status.

===Inflection and conjugation===
Japanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun may refer to a single book or several books; can mean &quot;person&quot; or &quot;people&quot;, and can be &quot;tree&quot; or &quot;trees&quot;. Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a counter word) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, or sometimes by duplication (e.g. , , usually written with an iteration mark as ). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus &quot;Tanaka-san&quot; usually means &quot;Mx Tanaka&quot;. Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as &quot;-tachi&quot;, but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase &quot;and company&quot;. A group described as &quot;Tanaka-san-tachi&quot; may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as &quot;hitobito&quot; &quot;people&quot; and &quot;wareware&quot; &quot;we/us&quot;, while the word &quot;tomodachi&quot; &quot;friend&quot; is considered singular, although plural in form.

Verbs are conjugated to show tenses, of which there are two: past and non-past, which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the &quot;-te iru&quot; form indicates a continuous (or progressive) aspect, similar to the suffix &quot;ing&quot; in English. For others that represent a change of state, the &quot;-te iru&quot; form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, &quot;kite iru&quot; means &quot;They have come (and are still here)&quot;, but &quot;tabete iru&quot; means &quot;They are eating&quot;.

Questions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle &quot;-ka&quot; is added. For example, becomes . In a more informal tone sometimes the particle is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: &quot;Dōshite konai-no?&quot; &quot;Why aren&#x27;t (you) coming?&quot;. Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer&#x27;s attention: &quot;Kore wa?&quot; &quot;(What about) this?&quot;; () &quot;(What&#x27;s your) name?&quot;.

Negatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, becomes . Plain negative forms are &quot;i&quot;-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. .

The so-called &quot;-te&quot; verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (&quot;Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll eat breakfast and leave at once&quot;), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (&quot;Dekakete-mo ii?&quot; &quot;May I go out?&quot;), etc.

The word &quot;da&quot; (plain), &quot;desu&quot; (polite) is the copula verb. It corresponds to the English verb &quot;is&quot; and marks tense when the verb is conjugated into its past form &quot;datta&quot; (plain), &quot;deshita&quot; (polite). This comes into use because only &quot;i&quot;-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence (&quot;there is&quot;) or, in some contexts, property: &quot;aru&quot; (negative &quot;nai&quot;) and &quot;iru&quot; (negative &quot;inai&quot;), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, &quot;Neko ga iru&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s a cat&quot;, &quot;Ii kangae-ga nai&quot; &quot;[I] haven&#x27;t got a good idea&quot;.

The verb &quot;to do&quot; (&quot;suru&quot;, polite form &quot;shimasu&quot;) is often used to make verbs from nouns (&quot;ryōri suru&quot; &quot;to cook&quot;, &quot;benkyō suru&quot; &quot;to study&quot;, etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. &quot;tobidasu&quot; &quot;to fly out, to flee&quot;, from &quot;tobu&quot; &quot;to fly, to jump&quot; + &quot;dasu&quot; &quot;to put out, to emit&quot;).

There are three types of adjectives (see Japanese adjectives):
# , or &quot;i&quot; adjectives, which have a conjugating ending . An example of this is , which can become past ( &quot;it was hot&quot;), or negative ( &quot;it is not hot&quot;). &quot;nai&quot; is also an &quot;i&quot; adjective, which can become past (i.e., &quot;it was not hot&quot;).
#: &quot;a hot day&quot;.
# , or &quot;na&quot; adjectives, which are followed by a form of the copula, usually &quot;na&quot;. For example, &quot;hen&quot; (strange)
#: &quot;a strange person&quot;.
# , also called true adjectives, such as &quot;ano&quot; &quot;that&quot;
#: &quot;that mountain&quot;.

Both &quot;keiyōshi&quot; and &quot;keiyōdōshi&quot; may predicate sentences. For example,

&lt;poem&gt; &quot;The rice is hot.&quot;
 &quot;He&#x27;s strange.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Both inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs.
The &quot;rentaishi&quot; in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include &quot;ookina&quot; &quot;big&quot;, &quot;kono&quot; &quot;this&quot;, &quot;iwayuru&quot; &quot;so-called&quot; and &quot;taishita&quot; &quot;amazing&quot;.

Both &quot;keiyōdōshi&quot; and &quot;keiyōshi&quot; form adverbs, by following with &quot;ni&quot; in the case of &quot;keiyōdōshi&quot;:

 &quot;become strange&quot;,

and by changing &quot;i&quot; to &quot;ku&quot; in the case of &quot;keiyōshi&quot;:

 &quot;become hot&quot;.

The grammatical function of nouns is indicated by postpositions, also called particles. These include for example:

* for the nominative case. 
: &quot;He did it.&quot;
* for the accusative case. 
: &quot;What will (you) eat?&quot;
* for the dative case.
: &quot;Please give it to Mx Tanaka.&quot;
: It is also used for the lative case, indicating a motion to a location.
: &quot;I want to go to Japan.&quot;
* However, is more commonly used for the lative case.
: &quot;Won&#x27;t you go to the party?&quot;
* for the genitive case, or nominalizing phrases.
: &quot;my camera&quot;
: &quot;(I) like going skiing.&quot;
* for the topic. It can co-exist with the case markers listed above, and it overrides &quot;ga&quot; and (in most cases) &quot;o&quot;.
: (literally) &quot;As for me, sushi is good.&quot; The nominative marker &quot;ga&quot; after &quot;watashi&quot; is hidden under &quot;wa&quot;.

Note: The subtle difference between wa and ga in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While &quot;wa&quot; indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by &quot;wa&quot; is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.

&quot;Ikeda-san wa yonjū-ni sai da.&quot; &quot;As for Mx Ikeda, they are forty-two years old.&quot; Others in the group may also be of that age.

Absence of &quot;wa&quot; often means the subject is the focus of the sentence.

&quot;Ikeda-san ga yonjū-ni sai da.&quot; &quot;It is Mx Ikeda who is forty-two years old.&quot; This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question, such as &quot;who in this group is forty-two years old?&quot;

===Politeness===
Japanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.

The Japanese language can express differing levels of social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children begin learning and using polite speech in basic forms from an early age, but their use of more formal and sophisticated polite speech becomes more common and expected as they enter their teenage years and start engaging in more adult-like social interactions. See &quot;uchi–soto&quot;.

Whereas is commonly an inflectional system, and often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: &quot;iku&quot; &quot;go&quot; becomes &quot;ikimasu&quot; in polite form, but is replaced by &quot;irassharu&quot; in honorific speech and &quot;ukagau&quot; or &quot;mairu&quot; in humble speech.

The difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one&#x27;s own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the &quot;-san&quot; suffix (&quot;Mr&quot;, &quot;Mrs&quot;, &quot;Miss&quot;, or &quot;Mx&quot;) is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one&#x27;s company to an external person, since the company is the speaker&#x27;s in-group. When speaking directly to one&#x27;s superior in one&#x27;s company or when speaking with other employees within one&#x27;s company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.

Most nouns in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of &quot;o-&quot; or &quot;go-&quot; as a prefix. &quot;o-&quot; is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas &quot;go-&quot; is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as &quot;gohan&quot; &#x27;cooked rice; meal.&#x27; Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item&#x27;s owner or to the object itself. For example, the word &quot;tomodachi&quot; &#x27;friend,&#x27; would become &quot;o-tomodachi&quot; when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children&#x27;s friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to &quot;mizu&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; as &quot;o-mizu&quot; to show politeness.

==Vocabulary==

There are three main sources of words in the Japanese language: the or ; ; and .

The original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called or infrequently , i.e. &quot;Yamato words&quot;), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as ( or rarely , i.e. the &quot;Wa language&quot;). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from Chinese or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as , entered the language from the 5th century onwards by contact with Chinese culture. According to the Japanese dictionary, &quot;kango&quot; comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, &quot;wago&quot; make up 33.8%, other foreign words or account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or that draw elements from more than one language.

There are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of sound symbolism, both onomatopoeia for physical sounds, and more abstract words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the Ainu language. &quot;Tonakai&quot; (reindeer), &quot;rakko&quot; (sea otter) and &quot;shishamo&quot; (smelt, a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.

Words of different origins occupy different registers in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, &quot;kango&quot; words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas an Anglo-Saxon word would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.

Incorporating vocabulary from European languages, &quot;gairaigo&quot;, began with borrowings from Portuguese in the 16th century, followed by words from Dutch during Japan&#x27;s long isolation of the Edo period. With the Meiji Restoration and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, words were borrowed from German, French, and English. Today most borrowings are from English.

In the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts; these are known as &quot;wasei-kango&quot; (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, , and are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way many Greek- and Latin-derived words – both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots – are shared among modern European languages – see classical compound.

In the past few decades, &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; (&quot;made-in-Japan English&quot;) has become a prominent phenomenon. Words such as (&lt; &quot;one&quot; + &quot;pattern&quot;, &quot;to be in a rut&quot;, &quot;to have a one-track mind&quot;) and (&lt; &quot;skin&quot; + &quot;-ship&quot;, &quot;physical contact&quot;), although coined by compounding English roots, are nonsensical in most non-Japanese contexts; exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however, which often use words such as &quot;skinship&quot; and &quot;rimokon&quot; (remote control) in the same way as in Japanese.

The popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English, including &quot;emoji, futon, haiku, judo, kamikaze, karaoke, karate, ninja, origami, rickshaw&quot; (from ), &quot;samurai, sayonara, Sudoku, sumo, sushi, tofu, tsunami, tycoon&quot;. See list of English words of Japanese origin for more.

==Gender in the Japanese language==
Depending on the speakers’ gender, different linguistic features might be used. The typical lect used by females is called and the one used by males is called . &quot;Joseigo&quot; and &quot;danseigo&quot; are different in various ways, including first-person pronouns (such as &quot;watashi&quot; or &quot;atashi&quot; for women and for men) and sentence-final particles (such as , , or for &quot;joseigo&quot;, or , , or for &quot;danseigo&quot;). In addition to these specific differences, expressions and pitch can also be different. For example, &quot;joseigo&quot; is more gentle, polite, refined, indirect, modest, and exclamatory, and often accompanied by raised pitch.

=== Kogal slang ===
In the 1990s, the traditional feminine speech patterns and stereotyped behaviors were challenged, and a popular culture of “naughty” teenage girls emerged, called , sometimes referenced in English-language materials as “kogal”. Their rebellious behaviors, deviant language usage, the particular make-up called , and the fashion became objects of focus in the mainstream media. Although kogal slang was not appreciated by older generations, the &quot;kogyaru&quot; continued to create terms and expressions. Kogal culture also changed Japanese norms of gender and the Japanese language.

==Non-native study==

Many major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is a significant increase from before World War II; in 1940, only 65 Americans not of Japanese descent were able to read, write and understand the language.

International interest in the Japanese language dates from the 19th century but has become more prevalent following Japan&#x27;s economic bubble of the 1980s and the global popularity of Japanese popular culture (such as anime and video games) since the 1990s. As of 2015, more than 3.6 million people studied the language worldwide, primarily in East and Southeast Asia. Nearly one million Chinese, 745,000 Indonesians, 556,000 South Koreans and 357,000 Australians studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. Between 2012 and 2015, considerable growth of learners originated in Australia (20.5%), Thailand (34.1%), Vietnam (38.7%) and the Philippines (54.4%).

The Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), which features five levels of exams. The JLPT is offered twice a year.

<text>Johnny Got His Gun is an anti-war novel written in 1938 by American novelist Dalton Trumbo and published in September 1939 by J. B. Lippincott. The novel won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939. A 1971 film adaptation was written and directed by Trumbo.

==Plot==
Joe Bonham, a young American soldier serving in World War I, awakens in a hospital bed after being caught in the blast of an exploding artillery shell. He gradually realizes that he has lost his arms, legs, and all of his face (including his eyes, ears, nose, teeth, and tongue), but that his mind functions perfectly, leaving him a prisoner in his own body.

Joe attempts suicide by suffocation, but finds that he has had a tracheotomy that he can neither remove nor control. He then decides that he wants to be placed in a glass coffin and toured around the country in order to demonstrate to others the true horrors of war. Joe eventually successfully communicates this with military officials after several months of banging his head on his pillow in Morse code. However, he realizes that the military will not grant his wish, nor will they put him out of his misery by euthanizing him, as it is &quot;against regulations&quot;. It is implied that he will live the rest of his natural life in his condition.

As Joe drifts between reality and fantasy, he remembers his old life with his family and girlfriend, and reflects upon the myths and realities of war.

==Characters==
; Joe Bonham
Joe Bonham is the main character. He has all of his limbs amputated, and his facial features being removed (eyes, ears, nose, teeth, tongue.) Joe is also devoid of any senses except for that of touch. He is essentially a man trapped with his own thoughts. 

; Regular day nurse
The regular day nurse is described by Joe as a heavyset woman doing her job of care taking him. As Joe could not communicate, he squirms out of anticipation to be cared for, which she misreads for stress. She treats Joe as an animal rather than a human with a conscience; not accounting for the fact that Joe was trying to communicate. The nurse becomes agitated of Joe&#x27;s tapping of his head, unaware that he was communicating through Morse Code. She tries to alleviate what she misreads as Joe being stressed, and goes to the lengths of masturbating Joe once.

; Bill Bonham (Joe&#x27;s father)
Joe&#x27;s father, Bill Bonham, courted Joe&#x27;s mother and raised a family with her in Colorado. Joe is referenced throughout the novel during Joe&#x27;s reminiscing of earlier times. In chapter one, it is said that Bill passes away. He is survived by Joe, his mother, and his younger sisters (one aged thirteen, one aged nine).

; Marcia Bonham (Joe&#x27;s mother)
Joe&#x27;s mother, Marcia Bonham, was close to Joe and Bill. She was known for her cooking skills.

;Kareen (Joe&#x27;s girlfriend before he leaves for war)
Kareen, aged 19 at Joe&#x27;s departure, is mentioned throughout the book as Joe floats between reality and fantasy. In chapter three, Kareen and Joe, with her father&#x27;s reluctant approval, have sexual intercourse for the first time on the night before he leaves.

;Diane (Joe&#x27;s first girlfriend)
Diane is only mentioned in chapter four. In which it is mentioned that she, during her and Joe&#x27;s relationship, began a relationship with a man named Glen Hogan. She also has an unfaithful relationship with Joe&#x27;s best friend, Bill Harper.

;Bill Harper (Joe&#x27;s best friend)
Bill Harper warns Joe that Diane is in an unfaithful relationship with Hogan as she also has a relationship with Joe, to which Joe hits Bill. Joe later finds out that Bill was truthful and decides that he wants to renew their friendship. However, he finds Bill and Diane at her home and is hurt by both. The end of chapter four references how Bill was killed at Belleau Wood.

;Howie
After his troubles with Diane and Glen Hogan, Joe meets Howie during chapter nine. It was found that Howie was never capable of keeping a relationship with a woman; and his girlfriend, Onie, also had an unfaithful relationship with Glen Hogan. Joe and Howie decided to not only forget about their partners, but to also forget about Glen Hogan. Joe and Howie join a group of Mexicans working on a railroad. However, once Howie receives an apologetic telegram from Onie, the boys decide to return home.

;José
José worked at a bakery with Joe. He was given the job at the bakery through the local homeless shelter. José has many stories that set him apart from the other homeless workers, including the fact that he refused marriage to a wealthy woman. José wanted to work in Hollywood. When the opportunity presented itself to work for a picture company, José purposely gets fired because he feels his own personal honor will not allow him to quit on the boss that gave him his original opportunity.

;New day nurse
The new day nurse was the first person to successfully communicate with Joe after his injuries. She moved her finger on his bare chest in the shape of the letter M until Joe signaled that he understood &quot;M&quot;. She then spelled out &quot;MERRY CHRISTMAS&quot; and Joe signaled that he understood. The new day nurse then deduced that Joe&#x27;s head-banging was in Morse Code and fetched someone who knew Morse Code.

==Title and context==
The title is a play on the phrase &quot;Johnny get your gun&quot;,
a rallying call that was commonly used to encourage young American men to enlist in the military in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. That phrase was popularized in the George M. Cohan song &quot;Over There&quot;, which was widely recorded in the first year of American involvement in World War I. &quot;Johnny Get Your Gun&quot; is also the name of a 1919 film directed by Donald Crisp.

Many of protagonist Joe Bonham&#x27;s early memories are based on Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s early life in Colorado and Los Angeles. The novel is inspired by articles about two men with severe injuries that Trumbo read about: the tearful hospital visit of Edward, Prince of Wales to Curley Christian, considered to be the first and only Canadian soldier in WWI who was a quadruple amputee, and a British major whose body was damaged so horrifically that he was reported as MIA to his family. The family discovered the truth years after his death in the hospital. &quot;Though the novel was a pacifist piece published in wartime, it was well reviewed and won an American Booksellers Award in 1940.&quot;
(It was published two days after the declaration of war in Europe, more than two years before the United States joined World War II.)

==Publication==
Serialized in the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; in March 1940, published by the Communist Party USA to which Trumbo belonged, the book became &quot;a rally point for the political left&quot; which had opposed involvement in World War II during the period of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (1939–1941) when the USSR maintained a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany. Shortly after the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Trumbo and his publishers decided to suspend reprinting the book until the end of the war, due to the Communist Party USA&#x27;s support for the war so long as the US was allied with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany.

In his introduction to a 1959 reprinting, Trumbo describes receiving letters from right-wing isolationists requesting copies of the book when it was out of print. Trumbo contacted the FBI and turned these letters over to them. Trumbo regretted this decision, which he later called &quot;foolish,&quot; after two FBI agents showed up at his home and it became clear that &quot;their interest lay not in the letters but in me.&quot;

==Adaptations==
* On March 9, 1940, a radio adaptation of &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; was produced and directed by Arch Oboler, based on his script, and presented on the NBC Radio series, &quot;Arch Oboler&#x27;s Plays&quot;. James Cagney voiced Joe Bonham on that broadcast.

<doc id="15611" wikidata="Q3365063" url="?curid=15611" title="Simon–Ehrlich wager">
<text>The Simon–Ehrlich wager was a 1980 scientific wager between business professor Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich, betting on a mutually agreed-upon measure of resource scarcity over the decade leading up to 1990. The widely followed contest originated in the pages of &quot;Social Science Quarterly&quot;, where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was. In response to Ehrlich&#x27;s published claim that &quot;If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000&quot;, Simon offered to take that bet, or, more realistically, &quot;to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run&quot;.

Simon challenged Ehrlich to choose any raw material he wanted and a date more than a year away, and he would wager on the inflation-adjusted prices decreasing as opposed to increasing. Ehrlich chose copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten. The bet was formalized on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990, as the payoff date. Ehrlich lost the bet, as all five commodities that were bet on declined in price from 1980 through 1990, the wager period.

==Background==
In 1968, Ehrlich published &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, which argued that mankind was facing a demographic catastrophe with the rate of population growth quickly outstripping growth in the supply of food and resources. Simon was highly skeptical of such claims, so he proposed a wager, telling Ehrlich to select any raw material he wanted and select &quot;any date more than a year away,&quot; and Simon would bet that the commodity&#x27;s price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.

Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the combined difference. If the prices fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.

Between 1980 and 1990, the world&#x27;s population grew by more than 800 million, the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990, the price of each of Ehrlich&#x27;s selected metals had fallen. Chromium, which had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980 (), was down to $3.70 in 1990 (). Tin, which was $8.72 a pound in 1980 (), was down to $3.88 a decade later ().

As a result, in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed Julian Simon a check for $576.07 () to settle the wager in Simon&#x27;s favor.

==Analysis==
Julian Simon won because the price of three of the five metals went down in nominal terms and all five of the metals fell in price in inflation-adjusted terms, with both tin and tungsten falling by more than half. In his book &quot;Betrayal of Science and Reason&quot;, Ehrlich wrote that Simon asserted &quot;that humanity would never run out of anything&quot;. Ehrlich added that he and fellow scientists viewed renewable resources as more important indicators of the state of planet Earth, but that he decided to go along with the bet anyway. Afterward, Simon offered to raise the wager to $20,000 and to use any resources at any time that Ehrlich preferred. Ehrlich countered with a challenge to bet that temperatures would increase in the future. The two were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a second wager before Simon died.

Some observers have argued that Ehrlich could have won if the bet had been for a different period, or if the start date had been different. Ehrlich wrote that the five metals in question had increased in price between the years 1950 and 1975. Asset manager Jeremy Grantham wrote that if the Simon-Ehrlich wager had been for a longer period (from 1980 to 2011), then Simon would have lost on four of the five metals. However, economist Mark J. Perry noted that for an even longer period of time, from 1934 to 2013, the inflation-adjusted price of the Dow Jones-AIG Commodities Index showed &quot;an overall significant downward trend&quot; and concluded that Simon was &quot;more right than lucky&quot;.

==The proposed second wager==
Understanding that Simon wanted to bet again, Ehrlich and climatologist Stephen Schneider counter-offered, challenging Simon to bet on 15 current trends, betting $1,000 that each will get worse (as in the previous wager) over a ten-year future period.

The bets were:
* The three years 2002–2004 will, on average, be warmer than 1992–1994.
* There will be more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be more nitrous oxide in the atmosphere in 2004 than 1994.
* The concentration of ozone in the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) will be greater than in 1994.
* Emissions of the air pollutant sulfur dioxide in Asia will be significantly greater in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be less fertile cropland per person in 2004 than in 1994.
* There will be less agricultural soil per person in 2004 than 1994.
* There will be on average less rice and wheat grown per person in 2002–2004 than in 1992–1994.
* In developing nations there will be less firewood available per person in 2004 than in 1994.
* The remaining area of virgin tropical moist forests will be significantly smaller in 2004 than in 1994.
* The oceanic fishery harvest per person will continue its downward trend and, thus, in 2004, will be smaller than in 1994.
* There will be fewer plant and animal species still extant in 2004 than in 1994.
* More people will die of AIDS in 2004 than in 1994.
* Between 1994 and 2004, sperm cell counts of human males will continue to decline, and reproductive disorders will continue to increase.
* The gap in wealth between the richest 10% of humanity and the poorest 10% will be greater in 2004 than in 1994.

Simon declined Ehrlich and Schneider&#x27;s offer to bet, and used the following analogy to explain why he did so:

In his 1981 book &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot;, Simon noted that not all decreases in resources or increases in unwanted effects correspond to overall decreases in human wellbeing. Hence, there can be an &quot;optimal level of pollution&quot;, which accepts some increases in certain kinds of pollution in a way that increases overall wellbeing while acknowledging that any increase in pollution is nevertheless a cost that must be considered in any such calculation. Simon&#x27;s theory of resource development actually predicts some of the aforementioned trends, which do not in and of themselves even qualify as costs (unlike pollution). E.g., he pointed out that, due to increased efficiency, the amount of cropland required and actually used to grow food for each person has decreased over time and is likely to continue to do so . The same might potentially be true of decreased reliance on firewood in developing countries and per capita use of specific food sources like rice, wheat, and fish if economic development makes a diverse range of alternative foods available. Some have also proven false, e.g., the amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere has decreased from 1994 to 2004.

If Simon had taken the bet, he would have lost on 11 out of 15 trends.

==Other wagers==
In 1996, Simon bet $1,000 with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry, that the inflation-adjusted price of timber would decrease in the following five years. Simon paid out early on the bet in 1997 (before his death in 1998) based on his expectation that prices would remain above 1996 levels (which they did).

In 1999, when &quot;The Economist&quot; headlined an article entitled, &quot;$5 a barrel oil soon?&quot; and with oil trading in the $12/barrel range, David South offered $1,000 to any economist who would bet with him that the price of oil would be greater than $12/barrel in 2010. No economist took him up on the offer. However, in October 2000, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with The University of the West Indies, bet $1,000 with David South that the inflation-adjusted price of oil would decrease to an inflation-adjusted price of $25 by 2010 (down from what was then $30/barrel). Madjd-Sadjadi paid South an inflation-adjusted $1,242 in January 2010. The price of oil at the time was $81/barrel.

<doc id="15612" wikidata="Q457881" url="?curid=15612" title="John Tenniel">
<text>Sir John Tenniel (; 28 February 182025 February 1914) was an English illustrator, graphic humourist and political cartoonist prominent in the second half of the 19th century. An alumnus of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, he was knighted for artistic achievements in 1893, the first such honour ever bestowed on an illustrator or cartoonist.

Tenniel is remembered mainly as the principal political cartoonist for &quot;Punch&quot; magazine for over 50 years and for his illustrations to Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There&quot; (1871). Tenniel&#x27;s detailed black-and-white drawings remain the definitive depiction of the &quot;Alice&quot; characters, with comic book illustrator and writer Bryan Talbot stating, &quot;Carroll never describes the Mad Hatter: our image of him is pure Tenniel.&quot;

==Early life==

Tenniel was born in Bayswater, West London, to John Baptist Tenniel, a fencing and dancing master of Huguenot descent, and Eliza Maria Tenniel. Tenniel had five siblings; two brothers and three sisters. One sister, Mary, was later to marry Thomas Goodwin Green, owner of the pottery that produced Cornishware. Tenniel was a quiet and introverted person, both as a boy and as an adult. He was content to remain firmly out of the limelight and seemed unaffected by competition or change. His biographer Rodney Engen wrote that Tenniel&#x27;s &quot;life and career was that of the supreme gentlemanly outside, living on the edge of respectability.&quot;

In 1840, Tenniel, while practising fencing, received a serious eye wound from his father&#x27;s foil, which had accidentally lost its protective tip. Over the years, Tenniel gradually lost sight in his right eye; he never told his father of the severity of the wound, as he did not wish to upset him further.

In spite of a tendency towards high art, Tenniel was already known and appreciated as a humourist. His early companionship with Charles Keene fostered his talent for scholarly caricature.

==Training==
Tenniel became a student of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1842 by probation; he was admitted because he had made enough copies of classical sculptures to fill the necessary admission portfolio. So it was here that Tenniel returned to his earlier independent education.

While Tenniel&#x27;s more formal training at the Royal Academy and other institutions was beneficial in nurturing his artistic ambitions, he disagreed with the school&#x27;s teaching methods, and so he set about educating himself. He studied classical sculptures through painting. However, he was frustrated in this because he lacked instruction in drawing. Tenniel would draw the classical statues at London&#x27;s Townley Gallery, copy illustrations from books of costumes and armour in the British Museum, and draw animals from the zoo in Regent&#x27;s Park, as well as actors from London theatres, which he drew from the pits. These studies taught Tenniel to love detail, yet he became impatient in his work and was happiest when he could draw from memory. Though he had a photographic memory, it undermined his early formal training and restricted his artistic ambitions.

Another &quot;formal&quot; means of training was Tenniel&#x27;s participation in an artists&#x27; group, free from the rules of the academy that were stifling him. In the mid-1840s he joined the Artist&#x27;s Society or Clipstone Street Life Academy, and it could be said that Tenniel first emerged there as a satirical draughtsman.

==Early career==
Tenniel&#x27;s first book illustration was for Samuel Carter Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Book of British Ballads&quot;, in 1842. While engaged with his first book illustrations, various contests were taking place in London, as a way in which the government could combat the growing Germanic Nazarenes style and promote a truly national English school of art. Tenniel planned to enter the 1845 House of Lords competition amongst artists to win the opportunity to design the mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster. Despite missing the deadline, he submitted a cartoon, &quot;An Allegory of Justice&quot;, to a competition for designs for the mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster. For this he received a £200 premium and a commission to paint a fresco in the Upper Waiting Hall (or Hall of Poets) in the House of Lords.

===&quot;Punch&quot;===

As the influential result of his position as the chief cartoon artist for &quot;Punch&quot;, Tenniel remained a witness to Britain&#x27;s sweeping changes. He furthered political and social reform through satirical, often radical, and at times vitriolic images of the world. At Christmas 1850 he was invited by Mark Lemon to fill the position of joint cartoonist (with John Leech) on &quot;Punch&quot;, having been selected on the strength of recent illustrations to Aesop&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot;. He contributed his first drawing in the initial letter appearing on p. 224, vol. xix. This was entitled &quot;Lord Jack the Giant Killer&quot; and showed Lord John Russell assailing Cardinal Wiseman.

Tenniel&#x27;s first characteristic lion appeared in 1852, as did his first obituary cartoon. Gradually he took over altogether the weekly drawing of the political &quot;big cut,&quot; which Leech was happy to cede to Tenniel in order to restrict himself to his pictures of life and character.

In 1861, Tenniel was offered Leech&#x27;s position at &quot;Punch&quot;, as political cartoonist, but Tenniel still maintained a sense of decorum and restraint in the heated social and political issues of the day. When Leech died in 1864, Tenniel continued their work alone, rarely missing a single week.

His task was to follow the wilful choices of his &quot;Punch&quot; editors, who probably took their cue from &quot;The Times&quot; and would have felt the suggestions of political tensions from Parliament as well. Tenniel&#x27;s work could be scathing in effect. The restlessness in the issues of working-class radicalism, labour, war, economy, and other national themes were the targets of &quot;Punch&quot;, which in turn settled the nature of Tenniel&#x27;s subjects. His cartoons of the 1860s popularised a portrait of the Irishman as a sub-human being, wanton in his appetites and resembling an orangutan in facial features and posture. Many of Tenniel&#x27;s political cartoons expressed strong hostility to Irish Nationalism, with Fenians and Land leagues depicted as monstrous, ape-like brutes, while &quot;Hibernia&quot; – the personification of Ireland – was depicted as a beautiful, helpless girl threatened by such &quot;monsters&quot; and turning for protection to an &quot;elder sister&quot; in the shape of a powerful, armoured Britannia.

&quot;An Unequal Match&quot;, his drawing published in &quot;Punch&quot; on 8 October 1881, depicted a police officer fighting a criminal with only a baton for protection, trying to put a point across to the public that policing methods needed to be changed.

When examined separately from the book illustrations he did over time, Tenniel&#x27;s work at &quot;Punch&quot; alone, expressing decades of editorial viewpoints, often controversial and socially sensitive, was created to echo the voices of the British public. Tenniel drew 2,165 cartoons for &quot;Punch&quot;, a liberal and politically active publication that mirrored the Victorian public&#x27;s mood for liberal social changes; thus Tenniel, in his cartoons, represented for years the conscience of the British majority.

Tenniel contributed around 2,300 cartoons, innumerable minor drawings, many double-page cartoons for &quot;Punch&#x27;s Almanac&quot; and other specials, and 250 designs for &quot;Punch&#x27;s Pocket-books&quot;. By 1866 he could &quot;command ten to fifteen guineas for the reworking of a single &quot;Punch&quot; cartoon as a pencil sketch,&quot; alongside his &quot;comfortable&quot; &quot;Punch&quot; salary &quot;of about £800 a year&quot;.

===Alice===

Despite the thousands of political cartoons and hundreds of illustrative works attributed to him, much of Tenniel&#x27;s fame stems from his illustrations for &quot;Alice&quot;. Tenniel drew 92 drawings for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (London: Macmillan, 1865) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There&quot; (London: Macmillan, 1871).

Lewis Carroll originally illustrated &quot;Wonderland&quot; himself, but his artistic abilities were limited. Engraver Orlando Jewitt, who had worked for Carroll in 1859 and reviewed Carroll&#x27;s drawings for &quot;Wonderland&quot;, suggested that he employ a professional. Carroll was a regular reader of &quot;Punch&quot; and therefore familiar with Tenniel, who in 1865 had long talks with Carroll before illustrating the first edition of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

The first print run of 2,000 was sold in the United States, rather than England, because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition was released in December 1865, carrying an 1866 date, and became an instant best-seller, increasing Tenniel&#x27;s fame. His drawings for both books have become some of the most famous literary illustrations. After 1872, when the Carroll projects were finished, Tenniel largely abandoned literary illustration. Carroll did later approach Tenniel to undertake another project for him. To this Tenniel replied:
Tenniel&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; illustrations were engraved onto blocks of deal wood by the Brothers Dalziel. These then served as masters for the electrotype copies for the actual printing of the books. The original wood blocks are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford. They are not usually on public display, but were exhibited in 2003.

The bronze Alice in Wonderland sculpture (1959) in Central Park in Manhattan, New York City, is patterned on his illustrations.

==Style==
===Influence of German Nazarenes===
The style associated with the Nazarene movement of the 19th century influenced many later artists, including Tenniel. It can be characterised as &quot;shaded outlines&quot;, where the lines on the side of figures or objects are given extra thickness or drawn double to suggest shading or volume. Furthermore, this style is extremely precise, with the artist making a hard clear outline for its figures, dignifying them and the compositions, while giving restraint in expression and paleness of tone. Though Tenniel&#x27;s early illustrations in the Nazarene style were not well received, his encounter with the style pointed him in a good direction.

===Eye for detail===
After the 1850s, Tenniel&#x27;s style was modernised to incorporate more detail in backgrounds and in figures. The inclusion of background details corrected the previously weak Germanic staging of his illustrations. Tenniel&#x27;s more precisely-designed illustrations depicted specific moments of time, locale and individual character instead of just generalised scenes.

In addition to a change in specificity of background, Tenniel developed a new interest in human types, expressions, and individualised representation, something that would carry over into his illustrations of Wonderland. Referred to by many as theatricality, this hallmark of Tenniel&#x27;s style probably stemmed from his earlier interest in caricature. In Tenniel&#x27;s first years on &quot;Punch&quot; he developed this caricaturist&#x27;s interest in the uniqueness of persons and things, almost giving a human like personality to the objects in the environment. For example, a comparison of one of John Everett Millais&#x27;s illustrations of a girl in a chair with Tenniel&#x27;s illustration of Alice in a chair shows clearly that Millais&#x27;s chair is just a prop, whereas Tenniel&#x27;s chair possesses a menacing and towering presence.

Another change in style was his shaded lines. These transformed from mechanical horizontal lines to vigorously hand-drawn hatching that greatly intensified darker areas.

===Grotesque===
Tenniel&#x27;s &quot;grotesque&quot; was one reason why Lewis Carroll wanted Tenniel as his illustrator for the &quot;Alice&quot; books, in the sense of imparting a disturbing sense that the real world may have ceased to be reliable. Tenniel&#x27;s style was characteristically grotesque through his dark, atmospheric compositions of exaggerated fantasy creatures carefully drawn in outline. Often the mechanism was to use animal heads on recognisable human bodies or vice versa, as Grandville had done in the Parisian satirical journal &quot;Charivari&quot;. In Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations, the grotesque is found also in mergers of beings and things, deformities in and violence to the human body (e. g. when Alice drinks the potion and grows huge), and a proclivity to deal with ordinary things of this world while presenting such phenomena. The most noticeably grotesque is Tenniel&#x27;s famous Jabberwock drawing in &quot;Alice&quot;.

The &quot;Alice&quot; illustrations combine fantasy and reality. Scholars such as Morris trace Tenniel&#x27;s stylistic change to the late 1850s trend towards realism. For the grotesque to operate, &quot;it is our world which has to be transformed and not some fantasy realm.&quot; The illustrations constantly but subtly remind us of the real world, as do some of Tenniel&#x27;s scenes derived from a medieval town, the portico of a Georgian town, or the checked jacket on the White Rabbit. Additionally, Tenniel closely follows Carroll&#x27;s text, so that the reader sees the similitude between the written text and the illustrations. These touches of realism help to convince readers that all these seemingly grotesque inhabitants of Wonderland are simply themselves, simply real, not just performing.

==Image and text in &quot;Alice&quot;==
One unusual aspect of the &quot;Alice&quot; books is the placing of Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations on the pages. This physical relation of illustrations to text meshes them together. Carroll and Tenniel expressed this in various ways. One was bracketing: two relevant sentences would bracket an image as a way of imparting the moment that Tenniel was trying to illustrate. This bracketing of Tenniel&#x27;s pictures with text adds to their &quot;dramatic immediacy.&quot; However, other, less frequent illustrations work with the texts as captions.

Another link between illustration and text is the use of broader and narrower illustrations. Broader ones are meant to be centred on the page, narrower to be &quot;let in&quot; or run flush to the margin, alongside a narrow column of continuing text. Still, words run in parallel with the depiction of those things. For example, when Alice says, &quot;Oh, my poor little feet!&quot;, it not only occurs at the foot of the page but is right next to her feet in the illustration. Some of these narrower illustrations are L-shaped, and of great importance as some of his most memorable work. The top or base of these illustrations runs the full width of the page, but the other end leaves room on one side for text.

==Retirement and death==

An ultimate tribute came to an elderly Tenniel as he was knighted for public service in 1893 by Queen Victoria. It was the first such honour ever bestowed on an illustrator or cartoonist. His fellows saw his knighthood as gratitude for &quot;raising what had been a fairly lowly profession to an unprecedented level of respectability.&quot; With his knighthood, Tenniel elevated the social status of the black-and-white illustrator, and sparked a new sense of recognition of his profession. When he retired in January 1901, Tenniel was honoured with a farewell banquet (on 12 June), at which Arthur Balfour, then Leader of the House of Commons, presided, and described Tenniel as &quot;a great artist and a great gentleman&quot;.

Tenniel died of natural causes on 25 February 1914, three days shy of his 94th birthday. He was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Punch&quot; historian M. H. Spielmann, who knew Tenniel, wrote that the political clout contained in his &quot;Punch&quot; cartoons was capable of &quot;swaying parties and people, too&quot;. Two days after his death, &quot;The Daily Graphic&quot; recalled how Tenniel &quot;had an influence on the political feeling of this time which is hardly measurable... While Tenniel was drawing them (his subjects), we always looked to the Punch cartoon to crystallize the national and international situation, and the popular feeling about it—and never looked in vain.&quot; This social influence resulted from the weekly publishing of his political cartoons over 50 years, whereby Tenniel&#x27;s fame allowed for a want and need for his particular illustrative work, away from the newspaper. Tenniel became not only one of Victorian Britain&#x27;s most published illustrators, but as a &quot;Punch&quot; cartoonist one of the &quot;supreme social observers&quot; of British society and an integral component of a powerful journalistic force. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; journalist George W. Smalley referred to John Tenniel in 1914 as &quot;one of the greatest intellectual forces of his time, (who) understood social laws and political energies.&quot;

Public exhibitions of Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s work were held in 1895 and 1900. Tenniel was also the author of one of the mosaics, &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot;, in the South Court in the Victoria and Albert Museum. His stippled watercolour drawings appeared from time to time in the exhibitions of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, to which he had been elected in 1874.

Tenniel Close, a Bayswater street near his former studio, is named after him.
