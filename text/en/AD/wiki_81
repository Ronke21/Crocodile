<text>Limburg (; ), also known as Dutch Limburg, is the southernmost of the twelve provinces of the Netherlands. It is bordered by Gelderland to the north and by North Brabant to its west. Its long eastern boundary forms the international border with the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. To the west is the international border with the similarly named Belgian province of Limburg, part of which is delineated by the river Meuse. To the south, Limburg is bordered by the Belgian province of Liège. The Vaalserberg is on the extreme southeastern point, marking the tripoint of the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.

Limburg had a population of about 1,128,000 as of January 2023. Its main municipalities are the provincial capital Maastricht (population 120,837 as of January 2022), Venlo (population 102,176) in the northeast, as well as Sittard-Geleen (population 91,760, bordering both Belgium and Germany) and Heerlen (population 86,874) in the south. More than half of the population, approximately 650,000 people, live in the south of Limburg, which corresponds to roughly one-third of the province&#x27;s area proper. In South Limburg, most people live in the urban agglomerations of Maastricht, Parkstad and Sittard-Geleen.

== Etymology ==
Limburg&#x27;s name derives from the Belgian fortified town of the same name, Limbourg-sur-Vesdre, now in the nearby Liège Province, immediately south of Limburg. The name of Limbourg-sur-Vesdre was important to the region because it had been the seat of the medieval Duchy of Limburg. 

There are several proposals concerning the etymology of Limbourg. The second part, &quot;bourg&quot; or &quot;burg&quot; is common in placenames, and refers to a fortified town. The first part is often suggested to refer to lime or linden trees (species of &quot;Tilia&quot;). The historian Jean-Louis Kupper has proposed that its founder Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine named it after Limburg Abbey in Germany. He favours a derivation from a Germanic word &quot;lint&quot; meaning &quot;dragon&quot;.
Ironically the area under the direct lordship of the old Duchy did not overlap at all with the modern Belgian and Dutch provinces named after it today, though the medieval Duchy was a high status title in the region. On the other hand, while the Duchy&#x27;s effective power was limited, the Duchy and what is now South Limburg (referred to as the (Lands of Overmaas) did have a long history of connection under the lordship of the Dukes of Brabant. During this long period, from the Middle Ages until the French Revolution, they were sometimes referred to collectively under one name (Overmaas or Limburg).

After 1794, it was the French Republic which unified the region, along with Belgian Limburg, and removed all ties to the old feudal society (the &quot;ancien regime&quot;). The new name, as with all the names of the &quot;départements&quot;, was based on natural features such as rivers, in this case Meuse-Inférieure or Neder-Maas (&quot;Lower Meuse&quot;). 

After the defeat of Napoleon the newly created United Kingdom of the Netherlands desired a new name for this province. It was decided that the historic connection to the duchy of Limburg was to be restored, albeit only in name.

==History==
The current province Limburg of the Netherlands only came into existence in 1839, after the finalization of the separation of Belgium from the Netherlands which had begun in 1830. The two Limburgs had been brought together under French revolutionary administration some decades earlier, but they and the surrounding region shared much of their history. For long periods of history however, the region was not united under the same rule.

For centuries, the strategic location of the current province, stretching along the Maas river route, made it a much-coveted region among Europe&#x27;s major powers. Romans, Carolingians, Habsburg Spaniards, Prussians, Habsburg Austrians and France have all ruled parts of Limburg. 

The first inhabitants of whom traces have been found were Neanderthals who camped in South Limburg. In Neolithic times, flint was mined in underground mines.

===Roman era===
Julius Caesar conquered the area in 53 BC, and wrote that he had extinguished the name of the Eburones, the inhabitants of most of the area of current Limburg, as a punishment for their revolt under Ambiorix.

The north–south route along the Maas was crossed by the Via Belgica, a road crossing South Limburg and connecting the two local capitals of Tongeren and Cologne. &quot;Mosa Trajectum&quot; (Maastricht) and &quot;Coriovallum&quot; (Heerlen) were founded by the Romans upon this route. The area became strongly Romanized. Bishop Servatius introduced Christianity in Roman Maastricht, where he died in 384. Maastricht appears to have taken over from Tongeren for some time as regional capital for the Romanized and Christian population, before the bishopric was re-established in Liège, south of Maastricht.

===Medieval era===
As Roman authority in the area weakened, Franks took over from the Romans, but the area came to flourish under their rule, with Cologne continuing to be the most important local capital. The Maas valley, especially the middle and southern part of the current province, formed an important part of the heartland of Merovingian Austrasia.

With the rise of the Carolingian dynasty, who were themselves from this region, the Maas valley became more culturally and politically one of the most important regions in Europe. In 714 Susteren Abbey was founded, as far as is known the first proprietary abbey in the current Netherlands. The main benefactor was Plectrude, the consort of Pepin of Herstal. Charles Martel was born in nearby Herstal. Charlemagne made Aachen, today a German city which has suburban sprawl stretching into South Limburg, the capital of the Frankish empire. 

After the death of Charlemagne, the Frankish dominions were again split between kings. While the Austrasian lands remained a separate &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;, sometimes now referred to as Lotharingia, in the treaties of Verdun (843), and Prüm (855), in the 870 Treaty of Meerssen, signed in South Limburg itself, Lotharingia was divided. The river Meuse became the border between the Western- and Eastern Frankish kingdoms, placing most of the current Dutch province of Limburg on the western boundary of the Eastern Frankish kingdom, with Belgian Limburg in the Western Kingdom. In the Treaty of Ribemont of 888, the Eastern Kingdom was granted control of the whole of Lotharingia, including all of the modern Netherlands and Luxembourg, and most of modern Belgium.

The region of Thorn, Netherlands was drained and about 975 a swamp nearby the Roman road between Maastricht and Nijmegen. Bishop Ansfried of Utrecht founded a Benedictine nunnery. This developed from the 12th century into a secular or convent. The principal of the was the abbess. She was assisted by a chapter of at most twenty ladies of the highest nobility. 

During the period of West Frankish control under the Treaty of Meerssen, effective Frankish power in the area of the current Netherlands more or less collapsed. For two or more years a large Viking army, operating from a place on or near the Meuse called Ascloa (or Hasloa or Haslon), wrought havoc in the neighbourhood. The damage was such that the emperor, Charles the Fat was forced to assemble a large multinational army, that in 882 unsuccessfully besieged this island.

In the 10th century, the Eastern kingdom consolidated its control of Lotharingia and became the Holy Roman Empire. In the first decades of this empire the founding imperial family had close ties to areas in what is today northern Limburg. The emperor Otto III for instance was born in 980 in Kessel, practically on the current border between Limburg and North Rhine-Westphalia, just east from Gennep. In 1080 in , just north of Gennep, Norbert of Gennep was born as a son of the count of Gennep. He was the founder of the order of the Premonstratensians.
South Limburg in the early Middle Ages was mainly made up of the lordships of , Dalhem, and Herzogenrath. All of these lands were, however, united with the Duchy of Limburg, under the rule of the Duchy of Brabant, when they were known collectively as the Lands of Overmaas.

The Duchy of Limburg and its dependencies first came under Brabantian control in 1288, as a result of the Battle of Worringen, then in the 15th century under the Duchy of Burgundy. By 1473, the Lands of Overmaas and the Duchy of Limburg formed one unified delegation to the States General of the Burgundian Netherlands. Both the terms Overmaas and Limburg came to be used loosely to refer to this sparsely populated province of the so-called Seventeen Provinces. Maastricht was never part of this polity: as a condominium, sovereignty over this city was held jointly by the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and the Duchy of Brabant. Also, the central and northern part of present-day Limburg belonged to different political entities, notably the Duchy of Jülich and the Duchy of Guelders.

By the late Middle Ages most of the present day territory of Limburg had been partitioned to the Duchy of Brabant, the Duchy of Gelderland, the Duchy of Jülich, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège or the Electorate of Cologne. These dukes, prince-bishops and prince-electors were nominal subordinates of the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, but in practice acted as independent sovereigns who were often at war with each other. These conflicts were often fought in and over Limburg, contributing to its fragmentation and a loss of economic importance.

Limburg was the scene of many bloody battles during the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648), in which the Dutch Republic threw off Habsburg Spanish rule. At the Battle of Mookerheyde (14 April 1574), two brothers of Prince William of Orange-Nassau and thousands of &quot;Dutch&quot; mercenaries died. Most Limburgians fought on the Spanish side, being Catholics and being opposed to the Calvinist Hollanders.

===Early modern era===
In the early modern era, Limburg was largely divided between the Spanish Netherlands (the Austrian Netherlands after 1714), Prussia, the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and many small independent fiefs. In 1673, Louis XIV personally commanded the siege of Maastricht by French troops. During the siege, one of his brigadiers, Charles de Batz-Castelmore d&#x27;Artagnan, perished. He subsequently became known as a major character in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père (1802–1870).

===19th century===
The modern boundaries of Dutch Limburg, along with its neighbour, Belgian Limburg, were basically set during the period after the French Revolution, which erased much of the &quot; of Europe, with all its old boundaries and titles. These two provinces were part of a new French , named (like many ) after the river running through it, &quot;, meaning simply &quot;lower Maas&quot;.

Following the Napoleonic Era, the great powers (the United Kingdom, Prussia, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and France) left the region to the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. A new province was formed which was to receive the name &quot;Maastricht&quot; after its capital. The first king, William I, who did not want the medieval name to be lost, insisted that it be changed to &quot;Province of Limburg&quot;. As such, the name of the new province was derived from the old Duchy of Limburg that had existed until 1795 on the east bank of the Meuse river.

When the Catholic and French-speaking Belgians split away from the mainly Calvinist northern Netherlands in the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the Province of Limburg was at first almost entirely under Belgian rule. However, by the 1839 Treaty of London, the province was divided in two, with the eastern part going to the Netherlands and the western part to Belgium, a division that remains today.

With the Treaty of London, what is now the Belgian Province of Luxembourg was handed over to Belgium and removed from the German Confederation. To appease Prussia, which had also lost access to the Meuse after the Congress of Vienna, the Dutch province of Limburg (excluding the cities of Maastricht and Venlo because without them Limburg&#x27;s population equalled that of the Province of Luxembourg, 150,000), was joined to the German Confederation between 5 September 1839 and 23 August 1866 as the Duchy of Limburg. On 11 May 1867, the Duchy, which from 1839 on had been &quot;de jure&quot; a separate polity in personal union with the Kingdom of the Netherlands, was reincorporated into the latter with the 1867 Treaty of London, though the term &quot;Duchy of Limburg&quot; remained in some official use until February 1907. Another idiosyncrasy survives today: the head of the province, referred to as the &quot;King&#x27;s Commissioner&quot; in other provinces, is addressed as &quot;Governor&quot; in Limburg.

===20th century===
The Second World War cost the lives of many civilians in Limburg, and a large number of towns and villages were destroyed by bombings and artillery battles. Various cemeteries, too, bear witness to this dark chapter in Limburg&#x27;s history. Almost 8,500 American soldiers, who perished during the liberation of the Netherlands, lie buried at the Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial in Margraten. Other big war cemeteries are to be found at Overloon (British soldiers) and the Ysselsteyn German war cemetery was constructed in the Municipality of Venray for the 31,000 German soldiers who died.

According to the research of Herman van Rens, the residents of Limburg were especially active in hiding local and refugee Jews during the Holocaust, to the extent that the Jewish population even increased during the war. Jews in hiding were three times as likely to survive in Limburg as in Amsterdam.

In December 1991, the European Community (now European Union) held a summit in Maastricht. At that summit, the &quot;Treaty on European Union&quot; or so-called Maastricht Treaty was signed by the European Community member states. With that treaty, the European Union came into existence.
===Anthem===
&quot;Limburg mijn Vaderland&quot; (Limburg my Fatherland) is the official anthem of both Belgian and Dutch Limburg.

==Language==

Although standard Dutch is the official language and the one most used, Limburgish is currently considered a regional language as described in the a page of the Dutch Government. It has been an official regional language since 1997 and it receives moderate protection under Chapter 2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The German and Belgian governments do not recognise it as an official language. Before the 20th century, most newspapers were in French or in German, and schools in Maastricht taught French, as the city has historic ties with the Belgian city of Liège. Other parts of the province taught German.

Limburgish is spoken by an estimated 1.6 million people in Dutch Limburg, Belgian Limburg, and Germany. There are many different dialects of Limburgish; almost every town and village has its own. A lot of isoglosses cross through Limburg. No single dialect can fully represent Limburgish as a whole. Dialects in the north, nearby Venray and Gennep, are classified as Kleverlandish and are closely connected to the dialects in the northeast of Brabant (Land van Cuijk) and the region of Nijmegen. Dialects in the southeast (near Aachen) are closer to Ripuarian and are sometimes classified as Southeast Limburgish. Dialects in the western part of Limburg, surrounding Weert, are influenced by the neighbouring dialects of southeast Brabant, which means that the tone is more Brabantic than in the rest of Limburg.

==Politics==
The provincial council (States-Provincial - &quot;Provinciale Staten&quot;) has 47 seats, and is headed by a King&#x27;s Commissioner (&quot;Commissaris van de Koning&quot;) who unofficially is called the Governor. While the provincial council is elected by the inhabitants, the King&#x27;s Commissioner is appointed by the King and the cabinet of the Netherlands. Since December 2021 Emile Roemer (SP) has been holding the office of governor.

Since the 2011 elections the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) was the largest party in the council, although the Party for Freedom (PVV) won the most votes during the election. However, two members of the PVV left the party, taking their seats with them, which lost the PVV their number one status.

Since the 2015 elections the CDA (11 seats) has again been the largest party, followed by the PVV (9 seats) and the Socialist Party (SP) (8 seats).

The province&#x27;s daily affairs are taken care of by the Provincial-Executive (&quot;Gedeputeerde Staten&quot;), which are also headed by the King&#x27;s Commissioner; its members (&quot;gedeputeerden&quot;) can be compared with ministers.

The Provincial-Executive 2023–2027 consists of the following parties: BBB, CDA, VVD, PvdA and SP.

==Geography==
Limburg is a salient of the Netherlands into Belgium.

Compared to the rest of the Netherlands the southern part of Limburg is less flat, slightly undulated. The highest point in the continental Netherlands is the Vaalserberg (meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27; of Vaals) with a height of 322.4 metres (1,058 ft) above NAP, rising approximately 110 metres above the village Vaals, where three countries (Netherlands, Belgium and Germany) border each other at the so-called &quot;Three-country-point&quot;.

Limburg&#x27;s main river is the Meuse, which passes through the province&#x27;s entire length from south to north.

Limburg&#x27;s surface is largely formed by deposits from the Meuse, consisting of river clay, fertile loessial soil and large deposits of pebblestone, currently being quarried for the construction industry. In the north of the province, further away from the riverbed, the soil primarily consists of sand and peat.

Limburg makes up one region of the International Organization for Standardization world region code system, having the code ISO 3166-2:NL-LI.

===Municipalities===
The province of Limburg has 31 municipalities.

==Economy==


The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was €44.5 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.7% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €34,700 or 115% of the EU27 average in the same year.

In the past peat and coal were mined in Limburg. In 1965–75 the coal mines were finally closed. As a result, 60,000 people lost their jobs in the two coal mining areas, Heerlen-Kerkrade-Brunssum and Sittard-Geleen. A difficult period of economic readjustment started. The Dutch government partly eased the pain by moving several government offices (including Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and CBS Statistics Netherlands) to Heerlen.

The state-owned corporation that once mined in Limburg, DSM, is now a major chemical company, still operating in Limburg. In 2002 DSM sold its petrochemical division (naphtha crackers and polyolefin plants) to SABIC of Saudi Arabia. In 2010, the agro and melamine business groups were sold to OCI Nitrogen. SABIC is located on the Chemelot campus in Sittard-Geleen, which is bounded by the Chemelot Industrial Park, one of Western Europe&#x27;s biggest industrial sites. At this moment 8000 people work at Chemelot, of which 1000 are active at the Campus. The innovation and licensing division Stamicarbon of DSM was sold in 2009 to Maire Tecnimont, the parent company of an engineering, main contracting and licensing group that operates worldwide in the oil, gas &amp; petrochemicals, power, infrastructure and civil engineering sectors. Stamicarbon is based in Sittard-Geleen.

VDL Nedcar in Born (Sittard-Geleen) is the only large-scale car manufacturer in the Netherlands, currently manufacturing MINIs and BMW X1s. Other industries include rockwool in Roermond, Océ copiers and printers manufacturers in Venlo and a paper factory in Maastricht. There are four large beer breweries in Limburg.

Southern Limburg has long been one of the country&#x27;s two main fruit-growing areas, but over the last four decades, many fruit-growing areas have been replaced by water as a result of gravel quarrying near the Meuse.

Limburg is one of the most important provinces when it comes to Dutch wine production. South Limburg has the highest concentration of vineyards in the Netherlands. Limburg&#x27;s wine regions have 3 Appellations: Maasvallei, Mergelland and Vijlen. Voerendaalse bergen is expected to be recognized somewhere in 2021. 

Tourism is an essential sector of the economy, especially in the hilly southern part of the province. The town of Valkenburg is the main centre.

In 2005, the two provincial newspapers, &quot;De Limburger&quot; and &quot;Limburgs Dagblad&quot;, merged.

==Culture==



Essential elements in Limburgian culture are

* Music;
* Religion (predominantly Roman Catholic);
* Folklore (in especially the southern part of the province);
* Carnival;
* Sports, of which especially bicycle racing and soccer are most popular;
* Art (architecture, among others).

===Music===
Choral singing is popular in Limburg. One of its best-known choruses is the Mastreechter Staar (Maastricht Star), which performs nationally and internationally.

Wind music (&quot;bloasmuzeek&quot;, blown music) is also widespread, most villages and cities have one or more amateur fanfare or wind orchestras (&quot;harmonie&quot;).

Every four years the World Music Contest, a competition for professional, amateur and military band sometimes called the Olympic Games of brass band music is held in Kerkrade.
In 2013 and 2009 the winner in the World Concert Division was the Koninklijke Harmonie Sainte Cécile, from Eijsden (Limburg).

Also held in Kerkrade (situated on the German border) is the Schlagerfestival, a nationally broadcast event presenting singers of German-language pop music called Schlagers.

Since 1969 yearly on the Pentecost weekend an international pop music festival called Pinkpop Festival takes place in the southern part of Limburg; initially at Geleen, since 1988 at Schaesberg.

More nationally or internationally known musicians from this province are mentioned hereunder in section &quot;Famous Limburgians&quot;.

The Limburg Symphony Orchestra, that resided and rehearsed in Maastricht, and was the oldest symphony orchestra of the Netherlands (founded in 1883) following elimination of government grants merged with &quot;Het Brabants Orkest&quot; to form a single ensemble with the new name of the &quot;philharmonie zuidnederland&quot;, as of April 2013.

===Folklore===
Many places in both Netherlands&#x27; and Belgian Limburg still have their own (by now folkloristic) schutterij. An annual festival is held in which all 160 of them compete for the highest honours to be gained, in the &quot;OLS&quot; (Oud Limburgs Schuttersfeest), which is held somewhere in either Belgian or Netherlands&#x27; Limburg.

===Sports===

====Football====
In Limburg there are currently four professional Football clubs; Roda JC Kerkrade, VVV-Venlo, MVV Maastricht and Fortuna Sittard. Fortuna Sittard competes in the highest Dutch division, the Eredivisie. The others compete in the second highest division.

====Cycling====
The annual bike classic Amstel Gold Race is run in the southern part of Limburg. The area has also staged the UCI Road World Championships six times, once hosted by Heerlen and five times by Valkenburg.

====Handball====
Team handball is the third-most popular sport in Limburg. The women&#x27;s team, HV Swift Roermond, has won the national championship in the highest division 19 times. The male teams, Sittardia (Sittard), Vlug en Lenig (Geleen) and BFC (Beek), which in 2008 merged as the &quot;Limburg Lions&quot;, have in total won the national championship 25 times.

==Religion==
Limburg is one of two Dutch provinces (North Brabant being the other) that has historically been dominated by the Roman Catholic faith. 

In 2015, 64.5% of the population of Limburg identified as Catholic, while 3.3% identified as Muslim, 2.2% with the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, and 2.1% with other churches or faiths. Over a quarter (27.9%) of the population reported being non-religious. 

In contrast, the Diocese of Roermond, which covers the entire province of Limburg, reports that out of a population of 1,115,895, roughly 1,071,000 or 96% of them were Catholics in 2022.

<doc id="18589" wikidata="Q193161" url="?curid=18589" title="Ligand">
<text>In coordination chemistry, a ligand is an ion or molecule with a functional group that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex. The bonding with the metal generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand&#x27;s electron pairs, often through Lewis bases. The nature of metal–ligand bonding can range from covalent to ionic. Furthermore, the metal–ligand bond order can range from one to three. Ligands are viewed as Lewis bases, although rare cases are known to involve Lewis acidic &quot;ligands&quot;.

Metals and metalloids are bound to ligands in almost all circumstances, although gaseous &quot;naked&quot; metal ions can be generated in a high vacuum. Ligands in a complex dictate the reactivity of the central atom, including ligand substitution rates, the reactivity of the ligands themselves, and redox. Ligand selection requires critical consideration in many practical areas, including bioinorganic and medicinal chemistry, homogeneous catalysis, and environmental chemistry.

Ligands are classified in many ways, including: charge, size (bulk), the identity of the coordinating atom(s), and the number of electrons donated to the metal (denticity or hapticity). The size of a ligand is indicated by its cone angle.

==History==
The composition of coordination complexes have been known since the early 1800s, such as Prussian blue and copper vitriol. The key breakthrough occurred when Alfred Werner reconciled formulas and isomers. He showed, among other things, that the formulas of many cobalt(III) and chromium(III) compounds can be understood if the metal has six ligands in an octahedral geometry. The first to use the term &quot;ligand&quot; were Alfred Werner and Carl Somiesky, in relation to silicon chemistry. The theory allows one to understand the difference between coordinated and ionic chloride in the cobalt ammine chlorides and to explain many of the previously inexplicable isomers. He resolved the first coordination complex called hexol into optical isomers, overthrowing the theory that chirality was necessarily associated with carbon compounds.

==Strong field and weak field ligands==
In general, ligands are viewed as electron donors and the metals as electron acceptors, i.e., respectively, Lewis bases and Lewis acids. This description has been semi-quantified in many ways, e.g. ECW model. Bonding is often described using the formalisms of molecular orbital theory.

Ligands and metal ions can be ordered in many ways; one ranking system focuses on ligand &#x27;hardness&#x27; (see also hard/soft acid/base theory). Metal ions preferentially bind certain ligands. In general, &#x27;hard&#x27; metal ions prefer weak field ligands, whereas &#x27;soft&#x27; metal ions prefer strong field ligands. According to the molecular orbital theory, the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) of the ligand should have an energy that overlaps with the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) of the metal preferential. Metal ions bound to strong-field ligands follow the Aufbau principle, whereas complexes bound to weak-field ligands follow Hund&#x27;s rule.

Binding of the metal with the ligands results in a set of molecular orbitals, where the metal can be identified with a new HOMO and LUMO (the orbitals defining the properties and reactivity of the resulting complex) and a certain ordering of the 5 d-orbitals (which may be filled, or partially filled with electrons). In an octahedral environment, the 5 otherwise degenerate d-orbitals split in sets of 3 and 2 orbitals (for a more in-depth explanation, see crystal field theory):

*3 orbitals of low energy: d&quot;xy&quot;, d&quot;xz&quot; and d&quot;yz&quot; and
*2 orbitals of high energy: d&quot;z&quot;2 and d&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;y&quot;2.

The energy difference between these 2 sets of d-orbitals is called the splitting parameter, Δo. The magnitude of Δo is determined by the field-strength of the ligand: strong field ligands, by definition, increase Δo more than weak field ligands. Ligands can now be sorted according to the magnitude of Δo (see the table below). This ordering of ligands is almost invariable for all metal ions and is called spectrochemical series.

For complexes with a tetrahedral surrounding, the d-orbitals again split into two sets, but this time in reverse order:
*2 orbitals of low energy: d&quot;z&quot;2 and d&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;y&quot;2 and
*3 orbitals of high energy: d&quot;xy&quot;, d&quot;xz&quot; and d&quot;yz&quot;.
The energy difference between these 2 sets of d-orbitals is now called Δt. The magnitude of Δt is smaller than for Δo, because in a tetrahedral complex only 4 ligands influence the d-orbitals, whereas in an octahedral complex the d-orbitals are influenced by 6 ligands. When the coordination number is neither octahedral nor tetrahedral, the splitting becomes correspondingly more complex. For the purposes of ranking ligands, however, the properties of the octahedral complexes and the resulting Δo has been of primary interest.

The arrangement of the d-orbitals on the central atom (as determined by the &#x27;strength&#x27; of the ligand), has a strong effect on virtually all the properties of the resulting complexes. E.g., the energy differences in the d-orbitals has a strong effect in the optical absorption spectra of metal complexes. It turns out that valence electrons occupying orbitals with significant 3 d-orbital character absorb in the 400–800 nm region of the spectrum (UV–visible range). The absorption of light (what we perceive as the color) by these electrons (that is, excitation of electrons from one orbital to another orbital under influence of light) can be correlated to the ground state of the metal complex, which reflects the bonding properties of the ligands. The relative change in (relative) energy of the d-orbitals as a function of the field-strength of the ligands is described in Tanabe–Sugano diagrams.

In cases where the ligand has low energy LUMO, such orbitals also participate in the bonding. The metal–ligand bond can be further stabilised by a formal donation of electron density back to the ligand in a process known as &quot;back-bonding.&quot; In this case a filled, central-atom-based orbital donates density into the LUMO of the (coordinated) ligand. Carbon monoxide is the preeminent example a ligand that engages metals via back-donation. Complementarily, ligands with low-energy filled orbitals of pi-symmetry can serve as pi-donor.


==Classification of ligands as L and X==

Ligands are classified according to the number of electrons that they &quot;donate&quot; to the metal. L ligands are Lewis bases. L ligands are represented by amines, phosphines, CO, N2, and alkenes. Examples of L ligands extend to include dihydrogen and hydrocarbons that interact by agostic interactions. X ligands are halides and pseudohalides. X ligands typically are derived from anionic precursors such as chloride but includes ligands where salts of anion do not really exist such as hydride and alkyl.

Especially in the area of organometallic chemistry, ligands are classified according to the &quot;CBC Method&quot; for Covalent Bond Classification, as popularized by M. L. H. Green and &quot;is based on the notion that there are three basic types [of ligands]... represented by the symbols L, X, and Z, which correspond respectively to 2-electron, 1-electron and 0-electron neutral ligands.&quot;

==Polydentate and polyhapto ligand motifs and nomenclature==
===Denticity===
Many ligands are capable of binding metal ions through multiple sites, usually because the ligands have lone pairs on more than one atom. Such ligands are polydentate. Ligands that bind via more than one atom are often termed &quot;chelating&quot;. A ligand that binds through two sites is classified as &quot;bidentate&quot;, and three sites as &quot;tridentate&quot;. The &quot;bite angle&quot; refers to the angle between the two bonds of a bidentate chelate. Chelating ligands are commonly formed by linking donor groups via organic linkers. A classic bidentate ligand is ethylenediamine, which is derived by the linking of two ammonia groups with an ethylene (−CH2CH2−) linker. A classic example of a polydentate ligand is the hexadentate chelating agent EDTA, which is able to bond through six sites, completely surrounding some metals. The number of times a polydentate ligand binds to a metal centre is symbolized by &quot;κn&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; indicates the number of sites by which a ligand attaches to a metal. EDTA4−, when it is hexidentate, binds as a &quot;κ&quot;6-ligand, the amines and the carboxylate oxygen atoms are not contiguous. In practice, the n value of a ligand is not indicated explicitly but rather assumed. The binding affinity of a chelating system depends on the chelating angle or bite angle.

Denticity (represented by &quot;κ&quot;) is nomenclature that described to the number of noncontiguous atoms of a ligand bonded to a metal. This descriptor is often omitted because the denticity of a ligand is often obvious. The complex tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) could be described as [Co(κ2-en)3]3+.

Complexes of polydentate ligands are called &quot;chelate&quot; complexes. They tend to be more stable than complexes derived from monodentate ligands. This enhanced stability, called the &quot;chelate effect&quot;, is usually attributed to effects of entropy, which favors the displacement of many ligands by one polydentate ligand.

Related to the chelate effect is the macrocyclic effect. A macrocyclic ligand is any large ligand that at least partially surrounds the central atom and bonds to it, leaving the central atom at the centre of a large ring. The more rigid and the higher its denticity, the more inert will be the macrocyclic complex. Heme is an example, in which the iron atom is at the centre of a porphyrin macrocycle, bound to four nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. The very stable dimethylglyoximate complex of nickel is a synthetic macrocycle derived from dimethylglyoxime.

=== Hapticity ===
Hapticity (represented by Greek letter &quot;η&quot;) refers to the number of &quot;contiguous&quot; atoms that comprise a donor site and attach to a metal center. The &quot;η-notation&quot; applies when multiple atoms are coordinated. For example, &quot;η&quot;2 is a ligand that coordinates through two contiguous atoms. Butadiene forms both &quot;η&quot;2 and &quot;η&quot;4 complexes depending on the number of carbon atoms that are bonded to the metal.

==Ligand motifs==
===Trans-spanning ligands===
Trans-spanning ligands are bidentate ligands that can span coordination positions on opposite sides of a coordination complex.

===Ambidentate ligand===
In contrast to polydentate ligands, ambidentate ligands can attach to the central atom in either one of two (or more) places, but not both. An example is thiocyanate, SCN−, which can attach at either the sulfur atom or the nitrogen atom. Such compounds give rise to linkage isomerism.

Polydentate and ambidentate are therefore two different types of polyfunctional ligands (ligands with more than one functional group) which can bond to a metal center through different ligand atoms to form various isomers. Polydentate ligands can bond through one atom AND another (or several others) at the same time, whereas ambidentate ligands bond through one atom OR another. Proteins are complex examples of polyfunctional ligands, usually polydentate.

===Bridging ligand===
A bridging ligand links two or more metal centers. Virtually all inorganic solids with simple formulas are coordination polymers, consisting of metal ion centres linked by bridging ligands. This group of materials includes all anhydrous binary metal ion halides and pseudohalides. Bridging ligands also persist in solution. Polyatomic ligands such as carbonate are ambidentate and thus are found to often bind to two or three metals simultaneously. Atoms that bridge metals are sometimes indicated with the prefix &quot;&quot;μ&quot;&quot;. Most inorganic solids are polymers by virtue of the presence of multiple bridging ligands. Bridging ligands, capable of coordinating multiple metal ions, have been attracting considerable interest because of their potential use as building blocks for the fabrication of functional multimetallic assemblies.

===Binucleating ligand===
Binucleating ligands bind two metal ions. Usually binucleating ligands feature bridging ligands, such as phenoxide, pyrazolate, or pyrazine, as well as other donor groups that bind to only one of the two metal ions.

===Metal–ligand multiple bond===
Some ligands can bond to a metal center through the same atom but with a different number of lone pairs. The bond order of the metal ligand bond can be in part distinguished through the metal ligand bond angle (M−X−R). This bond angle is often referred to as being linear or bent with further discussion concerning the degree to which the angle is bent. For example, an imido ligand in the ionic form has three lone pairs. One lone pair is used as a sigma X donor, the other two lone pairs are available as L-type pi donors. If both lone pairs are used in pi bonds then the M−N−R geometry is linear. However, if one or both these lone pairs is nonbonding then the M−N−R bond is bent and the extent of the bend speaks to how much pi bonding there may be. &quot;η&quot;1-Nitric oxide can coordinate to a metal center in linear or bent manner.

===Spectator ligand===
A spectator ligand is a tightly coordinating polydentate ligand that does not participate in chemical reactions but removes active sites on a metal. Spectator ligands influence the reactivity of the metal center to which they are bound.

===Bulky ligands===
Bulky ligands are used to control the steric properties of a metal center. They are used for many reasons, both practical and academic. On the practical side, they influence the selectivity of metal catalysts, e.g., in hydroformylation. Of academic interest, bulky ligands stabilize unusual coordination sites, e.g., reactive coligands or low coordination numbers. Often bulky ligands are employed to simulate the steric protection afforded by proteins to metal-containing active sites. Of course excessive steric bulk can prevent the coordination of certain ligands.
===Chiral ligands===
Chiral ligands are useful for inducing asymmetry within the coordination sphere. Often the ligand is employed as an optically pure group. In some cases, such as secondary amines, the asymmetry arises upon coordination. Chiral ligands are used in homogeneous catalysis, such as asymmetric hydrogenation.

===Hemilabile ligands===

Hemilabile ligands contain at least two electronically different coordinating groups and form complexes where one of these is easily displaced from the metal center while the other remains firmly bound, a behaviour which has been found to increase the reactivity of catalysts when compared to the use of more traditional ligands.

===Non-innocent ligand===
Non-innocent ligands bond with metals in such a manner that the distribution of electron density between the metal center and ligand is unclear. Describing the bonding of non-innocent ligands often involves writing multiple resonance forms that have partial contributions to the overall state.

==Common ligands==

Virtually every molecule and every ion can serve as a ligand for (or &quot;coordinate to&quot;) metals. Monodentate ligands include virtually all anions and all simple Lewis bases. Thus, the halides and pseudohalides are important anionic ligands whereas ammonia, carbon monoxide, and water are particularly common charge-neutral ligands. Simple organic species are also very common, be they anionic (RO− and ) or neutral (R2O, R2S, R3−&quot;x&quot;NH&quot;x&quot;, and R3P). The steric properties of some ligands are evaluated in terms of their cone angles.

Beyond the classical Lewis bases and anions, all unsaturated molecules are also ligands, utilizing their pi electrons in forming the coordinate bond. Also, metals can bind to the σ bonds in for example silanes, hydrocarbons, and dihydrogen (see also: Agostic interaction).

In complexes of non-innocent ligands, the ligand is bonded to metals via conventional bonds, but the ligand is also redox-active.

===Examples of common ligands (by field strength)===

In the following table the ligands are sorted by field strength (weak field ligands first):

The entries in the table are sorted by field strength, binding through the stated atom (i.e. as a terminal ligand). The &#x27;strength&#x27; of the ligand changes when the ligand binds in an alternative binding mode (e.g., when it bridges between metals) or when the conformation of the ligand gets distorted (e.g., a linear ligand that is forced through steric interactions to bind in a nonlinear fashion).

===Other generally encountered ligands (alphabetical)===
In this table other common ligands are listed in alphabetical order.

==Ligand exchange==
A ligand exchange (also called ligand substitution) is a chemical reaction in which a ligand in a compound is replaced by another. Two general mechanisms are recognized: associative substitution or by dissociative substitution.

Associative substitution closely resembles the SN2 mechanism in organic chemistry. A typically smaller ligand can attach to an unsaturated complex followed by loss of another ligand. Typically, the rate of the substitution is first order in entering ligand L and the unsaturated complex.
Dissociative substitution is common for octahedral complexes. This pathway closely resembles the SN1 mechanism in organic chemistry. The identity of the entering ligand does not affect the rate.

==Ligand–protein binding database==
BioLiP is a comprehensive ligand–protein interaction database, with the 3D structure of the ligand–protein interactions taken from the Protein Data Bank. MANORAA is a webserver for analyzing conserved and differential molecular interaction of the ligand in complex with protein structure homologs from the Protein Data Bank. It provides the linkage to protein targets such as its location in the biochemical pathways, SNPs and protein/RNA baseline expression in target organ.

<doc id="18591" wikidata="Q676619" url="?curid=18591" title="Lincos language">
<text>Lincos (an abbreviation of the Latin phrase &quot;lingua cosmica&quot;) is a constructed language first described in 1960 by Dr. Hans Freudenthal in his book &quot;Lincos: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse, Part 1&quot;. It is a language designed to be understandable by any possible intelligent extraterrestrial life form, for use in interstellar radio transmissions. Freudenthal considered that such a language should be easily understood by beings not acquainted with any Earthling syntax or language. Lincos was designed to be capable of encapsulating &quot;the whole bulk of our knowledge&quot;.

==Concepts and range==
The Lincos &quot;dictionary&quot; is intended to be transmitted first before any additional messages. It teaches natural numbers by a series of repeated pulses, separated by pauses. It then teaches &gt;, &lt;, =, +, -, by examples such as . . . . . &gt; . . . (an extended pause is shown around &gt; in this example so as to suggest to an alien that &gt; is a new separate symbol; otherwise, an alien might think that the whole pattern is a new symbol of unknown meaning). In introducing =, unary notation is shown for numbers: . = 1, . . = 2, and so on. This progresses to multiplication, division, variables, and constants, then propositional logic, set theory, and first-order logic. The dictionary tries to introduce questions by leaving mathematical expressions unsolved (e.g., ? x x + 101 = 11).

The next section of the Lincos dictionary introduces a word for second, &quot;Sec&quot;, by playing pulses of various lengths, followed by Sec, and the number of seconds, &quot;until the receiver may be expected to remark that the numbers... are proportional to the durations&quot;, thus teaching both that Sec is a unit of time, and exactly how long it is. It then introduces means for measuring durations, referring to moments in time, and talking about past and future events.

Freudenthal&#x27;s third section is perhaps the most complex, and attempts to convey the concepts and language necessary to describe behavior and conversation between individuals. It uses examples to introduce actors speaking to each other, asking questions, disapproving, quoting other people, knowing and wanting things, promising, and playing. The first steps (having already introduced sets of numbers and questions) are to introduce some new symbols (distinctive patterns of pulses), say that they are NOT numbers, and transmit sequences showing two of these new symbols separated by the word &quot;Inq&quot; (inquiry), followed by a question about an equation, then the symbols reversed, followed by the answer (example below). It is thus expected that, after many repetitions, the recipient will determine that these new symbols are entities asking and answering the questions, rather than some other context for the questions.

Finally, the fourth section describes the concepts and language relating to mass, space, and motion. This last section goes so far as to describe physical features of human beings and of the Solar System.

A second book by Freudenthal, planned but never written, would have added four more sections to the dictionary: &quot;Matter&quot;, &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Behavior 2&quot;. Other researchers have since extended the language somewhat on their own. One example is CosmicOS. Another is a second-generation &quot;Lingua Cosmica&quot; developed by the Dutch-Swedish astronomer and mathematician Alexander Ollongren of Leiden University, using constructive logic.

Freudenthal&#x27;s book on Lincos discusses it with many technical words from linguistic and logical theory, usually without defining them, which may have reduced its general interest, though the main chapters can be understood without these technical terms: appellatives, binding, formalization, function, lexicology, logistical, ostensive, quasi-general, semantics, syntax, variables, etc.

==Use==
For decades, no actual transmissions were made using Lincos; it remained largely a theoretical exercise, until Canadian astrophysicists Yvan Dutil and Stéphane Dumas, working at the Canadian Defense Research Establishment, created a noise-resistant coding system for messages aimed at communicating with extraterrestrial civilizations. In 1999, the astrophysicists encoded a message in Lincos and used the Yevpatoria RT-70 radio telescope in Ukraine to beam it towards close stars. This is known as Cosmic Call. The experiment was repeated (using other close stars as target) in 2003. The message was a series of pages describing some basic mathematics, physics and astronomy. The Dutil–Dumas experiment was promoted by an organization called &quot;Encounter 2001&quot;.

Some researchers have explored the similar issues in communicating with intelligent animals such as cetaceans. Lincos messages (even if sent by pulses of sound rather than radio) are complex and need to reach the most patient, logically oriented members of the target species. A far simpler approach aimed at average members of a species can cover numbers, &gt;, &lt;, =, +, -, and time.

==Examples==
An example of Lincos from section 3 of Freudenthal&#x27;s book, showing one individual asking another individual questions:
Note the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; as compared to &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;; 10/4 is a true answer to the question, so &quot;Ver&quot; (&quot;true&quot;) would be a valid response, but since it wasn&#x27;t reduced to lowest terms, it wasn&#x27;t what Ha wanted and so he responded &quot;Mal&quot; (&quot;bad&quot;) instead. The book separately teaches Ver and Fal for true and false.

<text>Lascaux ( , ; , &quot;Lascaux Cave&quot;) is a network of caves near the village of Montignac, in the department of Dordogne in southwestern France. Over 600 parietal wall paintings cover the interior walls and ceilings of the cave. The paintings represent primarily large animals, typical local contemporary fauna that correspond with the fossil record of the Upper Paleolithic in the area. They are the combined effort of many generations. With continued debate, the age of the paintings is now usually estimated at around 17,000–22,000 years (early Magdalenian). Because of the outstanding prehistoric art in the cave, Lascaux was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979, as an element of the &quot;Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley&quot;.

The original caves have been closed to the public since 1963, as their condition was quickly deteriorating, but there are now a number of replicas.

==History since rediscovery==

On 12 September 1940, the entrance to the Lascaux Cave was discovered on the La Rochefoucauld-Montbel lands by 18-year-old Marcel Ravidat when his dog, Robot, investigated a hole left by an uprooted tree (Ravidat would embellish the story in later retellings, saying Robot had fallen into the cave.) Ravidat returned to the scene with three friends, Jacques Marsal, Georges Agnel, and Simon Coencas. They entered the cave through a shaft that they believed might be a legendary secret passage to the nearby Lascaux Manor. The teenagers discovered that the cave walls were covered with depictions of animals. Galleries that suggest continuity, context or simply represent a cavern were given names. Those include the &quot;Hall of the Bulls&quot;, the &quot;Passageway&quot;, the &quot;Shaft&quot;, the &quot;Nave&quot;, the &quot;Apse&quot;, and the &quot;Chamber of Felines&quot;. They returned along with the Abbé Henri Breuil on 21 September 1940; Breuil would make many sketches of the cave, some of which are used as study material today due to the extreme degradation of many of the paintings. Breuil was accompanied by Denis Peyrony, curator of Les eyzies (Prehistory Museum) at Les Eyzies, Jean Bouyssonie and Dr Cheynier.

The cave complex was opened to the public on 14 July 1948, and initial archaeological investigations began a year later, focusing on the Shaft. By 1955, carbon dioxide, heat, humidity, and other contaminants produced by 1,200 visitors per day had visibly damaged the paintings. As air condition deteriorated, fungi and lichen increasingly infested the walls. Consequently, the cave was closed to the public in 1963, the paintings were restored to their original state, and a monitoring system on a daily basis was introduced.

===Replicas===

Conservation problems in the original cave have made the creation of replicas more important.

====Lascaux II====
&quot;Lascaux II&quot;, an exact copy of the &quot;Great Hall of the Bulls&quot; and the &quot;Painted Gallery&quot; was displayed at the Grand Palais in Paris, before being displayed from 1983 in the cave&#x27;s vicinity (about away from the original cave), a compromise and attempt to present an impression of the paintings&#x27; scale and composition for the public without harming the originals. A full range of Lascaux&#x27;s parietal art is presented a few kilometres from the site at the &quot;Centre of Prehistoric Art&quot;, Le Parc du Thot, where there are also live animals representing ice-age fauna.

The paintings for this site were duplicated with the same type of materials (such as iron oxide, charcoal, and ochre) which were believed to be used 19,000 years ago. Other facsimiles of Lascaux have also been produced over the years.

====Lascaux III====
&quot;Lascaux III&quot; is a series of five exact reproductions of the cave art (the Nave and Shaft) that, since 2012, have been exhibited in various countries, allowing knowledge of Lascaux to be shared widely, far away from the original.

====Lascaux IV====
&quot;Lascaux IV&quot; is the latest replica, in real scale, of the integrality of the cave of Lascaux. Situated on the same hill overlooking Montignac, and 400 m from the original site, it is part of the International Centre for Parietal Art (Centre International de l&#x27;Art Pariétal) that was inaugurated in December 2016. The museum, built by Snøhetta, integrates digital technology, workshops and films into adjacent display rooms.

==Geographic setting==

In its sedimentary composition, the Vézère drainage basin covers one fourth of the &quot;département&quot; of the Dordogne, the northernmost region of the Black Périgord. Before joining the Dordogne River near Limeuil, the Vézère flows in a south-westerly direction. At its centre point, the river&#x27;s course is marked by a series of meanders flanked by high limestone cliffs that determine the landscape. Upstream from this steep-sloped relief, near Montignac and in the vicinity of Lascaux, the contours of the land soften considerably; the valley floor widens, and the banks of the river lose their steepness.

The Lascaux valley is located some distance from the major concentrations of decorated caves and inhabited sites, most of which were discovered further downstream. In the environs of the village of Eyzies-de-Tayac Sireuil, there are no fewer than 37 decorated caves and shelters, as well as an even greater number of habitation sites from the Upper Paleolithic, located in the open, beneath a sheltering overhang, or at the entrance to one of the area&#x27;s karst cavities. This is the highest concentration in Europe.

==Images==

The cave contains nearly 6,000 figures, which can be grouped into three main categories: animals, human figures, and abstract signs. The paintings contain no images of the surrounding landscape or the vegetation of the time. Most of the major images have been painted onto the walls using red, yellow, and black colours from a complex multiplicity of mineral pigments including iron compounds such as iron oxide (ochre), hematite, and goethite, as well as manganese-containing pigments. Charcoal may also have been used but seemingly to a sparing extent. On some of the cave walls, the colour may have been applied as a suspension of pigment in either animal fat or calcium-rich cave groundwater or clay, making paint, that was swabbed or blotted on, rather than applied by brush. In other areas, the colour was applied by spraying the pigments by blowing the mixture through a tube. Where the rock surface is softer, some designs have been incised into the stone. Many images are too faint to discern, and others have deteriorated entirely.

Over 900 can be identified as animals, and 605 of these have been precisely identified. Out of these images, there are 364 paintings of equines as well as 90 paintings of stags. Also represented are cattle and bison, each representing 4 to 5% of the images. A smattering of other images includes seven felines, a bird, a bear, a rhinoceros. In the deepest reaches of the cave, at the bottom of a 9m-deep well, the only human figure of the cave was depicted, in a strikingly different style. There are no images of reindeer, even though that was the principal source of food for the artists, and no image of fish either. Geometric images have also been found on the walls.

The most famous section of the cave is The Hall of the Bulls where bulls, equines, aurochs, stags, and the only bear in the cave are depicted. The four black bulls, or aurochs, are the dominant figures among the 36 animals represented here. One of the bulls is long, the largest animal discovered so far in cave art. Additionally, the bulls appear to be in motion.

A painting referred to as &quot;The Crossed Bison&quot;, found in the chamber called the Nave, is often submitted as an example of the skill of the Paleolithic cave painters. The crossed hind legs create the illusion that one leg is closer to the viewer than the other. This visual depth in the scene, enhanced by the three dimensional structure of the painted rock, demonstrates a highly sophisticated form of perspective which disappeared with the Magdalenian culture and would not re-emerge until the Italian Renaissance. As famously quoted by Picasso upon encountering paleolithic art: &quot;we have learned nothing in twelve thousand years&quot;.

===Parietal representation===

The Hall of the Bulls presents the most spectacular composition of Lascaux. Its calcite walls are not suitable for engraving, so it is only decorated with paintings, often of impressive dimensions: some are up to five metres long.

Two rows of aurochs face each other, two on one side and three on the other. The two aurochs on the north side are accompanied by about ten horses and a large enigmatic animal, with two straight lines on its forehead that earned it the nickname &quot;unicorn&quot;. On the south side, three large aurochs are next to three smaller ones, painted red, as well as six small deer and the only bear in the cave, superimposed on the belly of an aurochs and difficult to read.

The Axial Diverticulum is also decorated with cattle and horses accompanied by deer and ibex. A drawing of a fleeing horse was brushed with manganese pencil 2.50 metres above the ground. Some animals are painted on the ceiling and seem to roll from one wall to the other. These representations, which required the use of scaffolding, are intertwined with many signs (sticks, dots, and rectangular signs).

The Passage has a highly degraded decoration, notably through air circulation.

The Nave has four groups of figures: the Empreinte panel, the Black Cow panel, the Deer swimming panel, and the Crossed Buffalo panel. These works are accompanied by many enigmatic geometric signs, including coloured checkers that H. Breuil called &quot;coats of arms&quot;.

The Feline Diverticulum owes its name to a group of felines, one of which seems to urinate to mark its territory. Very difficult to access, one can see there engravings of wild animals of a rather naive style. There are also other animals associated with signs, including a representation of a horse seen from the front, exceptional in Paleolithic art where animals are generally represented in profiles or from a &quot;twisted perspective&quot;.

The Apse contains more than a thousand engravings, some of which are superimposed on paintings, corresponding to animals and signs. There is the only reindeer represented in Lascaux.

The Well presents the most enigmatic scene of Lascaux: an ithyphallic man with a bird&#x27;s head seems to lie on the ground, perhaps knocked down by a buffalo gutted by a spear; at his side is represented an elongated object surmounted by a bird, on the left a rhinoceros moves away. Various interpretations of what is represented have been offered. A horse is also present on the opposite wall. Two groups of signs are to be noted in this composition:
* between man and rhinos, three pairs of digitized punctuation marks found at the bottom of the Cat Diverticulum, in the most remote part of the cave;
* under man and bison, a complex barbed sign that can be found almost identically on other walls of the cave, and also on paddle points and on the sandstone lamp found nearby.

===Interpretation===
The interpretation of Palaeolithic Art is problematic, as it can be influenced by our own prejudices and beliefs. Some anthropologists and art historians theorize the paintings could be an account of past hunting success, or could represent a mystical ritual in order to improve future hunting endeavors. The latter theory is supported by the overlapping images of one group of animals in the same cave location as another group of animals, suggesting that one area of the cave was more successful for predicting a plentiful hunting excursion.

Applying the iconographic method of analysis to the Lascaux paintings (studying position, direction and size of the figures; organization of the composition; painting technique; distribution of the color planes; research of the image center), Thérèse Guiot-Houdart attempted to comprehend the symbolic function of the animals, to identify the theme of each image and finally to reconstitute the canvas of the myth illustrated on the rock walls.

Julien d&#x27;Huy and Jean-Loïc Le Quellec showed that certain angular or barbed signs of Lascaux may be analysed as &quot;weapon&quot; or &quot;wounds&quot;. These signs affect dangerous animalsbig cats, aurochs, and bisonmore than others and may be explained by a fear of the animation of the image. Another finding supports the hypothesis of half-alive images. At Lascaux, bison, aurochs, and ibex are not represented side by side. Conversely, one can note a bison-horses-lions system and an aurochs-horses-deer-bears system, these animals being frequently associated. Such a distribution may show the relationship between the species pictured and their environmental conditions. Aurochs and bison fight one against the other, and horses and deer are very social with other animals. Bison and lions live in open plains areas; aurochs, deer and bears are associated with forests and marshes; ibex habitat is rocky areas, and horses are highly adaptive for all these areas. The Lascaux paintings&#x27; disposition may be explained by a belief in the real life of the pictured species, wherein the artists tried to respect their real environmental conditions.

Less known is the image area called the &quot;Abside&quot; (Apse), a roundish, semi-spherical chamber similar to an apse in a Romanesque basilica. It is approximately 4.5 metres in diameter (about 5 yards) and covered on every wall surface (including the ceiling) with thousands of entangled, overlapping, engraved drawings. The ceiling of the Apse, which ranges from 1.6 to 2.7 metres high (about 5.2 to 8.9 feet) as measured from the original floor height, is so completely decorated with such engravings that it indicates that the prehistoric people who executed them first constructed a scaffold to do so.
According to David Lewis-Williams and Jean Clottes who both studied presumably similar art of the San people of Southern Africa, this type of art is spiritual in nature relating to visions experienced during ritualistic trance-dancing. These trance visions are a function of the human imagination and so are independent of geographical location. Nigel Spivey, a professor of classical art and archeology at the University of Cambridge, has further postulated in his series, &quot;How Art Made the World&quot;, that dot and lattice patterns overlapping the representational images of animals are very similar to hallucinations provoked by sensory-deprivation. He further postulates that the connections between culturally important animals and these hallucinations led to the invention of image-making, or the art of drawing.

André Leroi-Gourhan studied the cave from the 1960s; his observation of the associations of animals and the distribution of species within the cave led him to develop a Structuralist theory that posited the existence of a genuine organization of the graphic space in Palaeolithic sanctuaries. This model is based on a masculine/feminine duality – which can be particularly observed in the bison/horse and aurochs/horse pairs – identifiable in both the signs and the animal representations. He also defined an ongoing evolution through four consecutive styles, from the Aurignacian to the Late Magdalenian. Leroi-Gourhan did not publish a detailed analysis of the cave&#x27;s figures. In his work Préhistoire de l&#x27;art occidental, published in 1965, he nonetheless put forward an analysis of certain signs and applied his explanatory model to the understanding of other decorated caves.

==Threats==

The opening of Lascaux Cave after World War II changed the cave environment. The exhalations of 1,200 visitors per day, presence of light, and changes in air circulation have created a number of problems. Lichens and crystals began to appear on the walls in the late 1950s, leading to closure of the caves in 1963. This led to restriction of access to the real caves to a few visitors every week, and the creation of a replica cave for visitors to Lascaux. In 2001, the authorities in charge of Lascaux changed the air conditioning system which resulted in regulation of the temperature and humidity. When the system had been established, an infestation of &quot;Fusarium solani&quot;, a white mold, began spreading rapidly across the cave ceiling and walls. The mold is considered to have been present in the cave soil and exposed by the work of tradesmen, leading to the spread of the fungus which was treated with quicklime. In 2007, a new fungus, which has created grey and black blemishes, began spreading in the real cave.

As of 2008, the cave contained black mold. In January 2008, authorities closed the cave for three months, even to scientists and preservationists. A single individual was allowed to enter the cave for twenty minutes once a week to monitor climatic conditions. Now only a few scientific experts are allowed to work inside the cave and just for a few days a month, but the efforts to remove the mold have taken a toll, leaving dark patches and damaging the pigments on the walls. In 2009 the mold problem was pronounced stable. In 2011 the fungus seemed to be in retreat after the introduction of an additional, even stricter conservation program. Two research programs have been instigated at the CIAP concerning how to best treat the problem, and the cave also now possesses a climatisation system designed to reduce the introduction of bacteria.

Organized through the initiative of the French Ministry of Culture, an international symposium titled &quot;Lascaux and Preservation Issues in Subterranean Environments&quot; was held in Paris on 26 and 27 February 2009, under the chairmanship of Jean Clottes. It brought together nearly three hundred participants from seventeen countries with the goal of confronting research and interventions conducted in Lascaux Cave since 2001 with the experiences gained in other countries in the domain of preservation in subterranean environments. The proceedings of this symposium were published in 2011. Seventy-four specialists in fields as varied as biology, biochemistry, botany, hydrology, climatology, geology, fluid mechanics, archaeology, anthropology, restoration and conservation, from numerous countries (France, United States, Portugal, Spain, Japan, and others) contributed to this publication.

In May 2018 &quot;Ochroconis lascauxensis&quot;, a species of fungus of the Ascomycota phylum, was officially described and named after the place of its first emergence and isolation, the Lascaux cave. This followed on from the discovery of another closely related species &quot;Ochroconis anomala&quot;, first observed inside the cave in 2000. The following year black spots began to appear among the cave paintings. No official announcement on the effect or progress of attempted treatments has ever been made.

The problem is ongoing, as are efforts to control the microbial and fungal growths in the cave. The fungal infection crises have led to the establishment of an International Scientific Committee for Lascaux and to rethinking how, and how much, human access should be permitted in caves containing prehistoric art.

<doc id="18595" wikidata="Q694790" url="?curid=18595" title="Lex Luthor">
<text>Alexander Joseph &quot;Lex&quot; Luthor () is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Lex Luthor originally appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #23 (cover dated: April 1940). Lex Luthor is considered to be &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Criminal Mastermind&quot;, and has since endured as the archenemy of the superhero Superman.

From the 1960s to the mid-1980s, Lex Luthor was depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist. Since the mid-late 1980s, he has more often been portrayed as the power-obsessed CEO of LexCorp. He wishes to rid the world of Superman, ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity, but in reality because he envies Superman&#x27;s popularity and influence. Given his high profile as a supervillain, however, he has often come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe. Lex Luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers, but he is a genius with a high aptitude for business, politics, science, and technology. He is typically portrayed as a mad scientist lacking a secret identity, costume, or other elements of supervillains, but he occasionally wears his warsuit, a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength, flight, advanced weaponry, and other capabilities. While Lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains, such as Metallo, Parasite and Bizarro, and frequently leading DC supervillain teams such as the Legion of Doom, he has also been portrayed as an antihero who will ally himself with Superman and other heroes against common enemies such as Brainiac and Darkseid.

The character was ranked 4th on &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time and as the 8th Greatest Villain by &quot;Wizard&quot; on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list. Luthor is one of a few genre-crossing villains whose adventures take place &quot;in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended&quot;. Scott James Wells, Sherman Howard, John Shea, Michael Rosenbaum, Jon Cryer, Titus Welliver, and Michael Cudlitz have portrayed the character in television series, while Lyle Talbot, Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, and Jesse Eisenberg have portrayed the character in films, and Nicholas Hoult is set to play him in the upcoming film &quot;Superman&quot;. Several actors have voiced Luthor in animated adaptations, including Clancy Brown, Mark Rolston, James Marsters, Giancarlo Esposito, Marc Maron, and Max Mittelman.

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
In his first story appearance, &quot;Action Comics&quot; #23 (April 1940), Luthor is depicted as a diabolical genius and is referred to only by his surname. He resides in a flying city suspended by a dirigible and plots to provoke a war between two European nations. Lois Lane and Clark Kent investigate, which results in Lois being kidnapped. Luthor battles Superman with a green ray but he is ultimately defeated, and Lois is rescued. Superman destroys Luthor&#x27;s dirigible with him still on it, implying Luthor may have died. Stories ending with Luthor&#x27;s apparent death become common in his earliest appearances, with him turning up alive later on.

Luthor returns in &quot;Superman&quot; #4 and steals a weapon from the U.S. Army capable of causing earthquakes. Superman battles and defeats Luthor, then destroys the earthquake device. The scientist who made the device commits suicide to prevent its reinvention. In a story in the same issue, Luthor creates a city on the sunken Lost continent of Pacifo and populates it with recreated prehistoric monsters he plans to unleash upon the world. Superman thwarts his plans and Luthor is seemingly killed by the dinosaurs he created. Luthor returns in &quot;Superman&quot; #5 with a plan to place hypnotic gas in the offices of influential people so he can throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier Moseley. The story ends with Superman defeating him.

In these early stories, Luthor&#x27;s schemes are centered around financial gain or megalomaniacal ambitions; unlike most later incarnations, he demonstrates no strong animosity toward Superman beyond inevitable resentment of the hero&#x27;s constant interference with his plans. Luthor&#x27;s obsessive hatred of Superman came later in the character&#x27;s development.

In Luthor&#x27;s earliest appearances, he is shown as a middle-aged man with a full head of red hair. Less than a year later however, an artistic mistake resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip. The original error is attributed to Leo Nowak, a studio artist who illustrated for the &quot;Superman&quot; dailies during this period. One hypothesis is that Nowak mistook Luthor for the Ultra-Humanite, a recurring mad scientist foe of Superman who, in his Golden Age incarnation, resembled a balding, elderly man. Other evidence suggests Luthor&#x27;s design was confused with that of a stockier, bald henchman in &quot;Superman&quot; #4 (Spring 1940); Luthor&#x27;s next appearance occurs in &quot;Superman&quot; #10 (May 1941), in which Nowak depicted him as significantly heavier, with visible jowls. The character&#x27;s abrupt hair loss has been made reference to several times over the course of his history. In 1960, writer Jerry Siegel altered Luthor&#x27;s backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin.

During World War II, the War Department asked for dailies of the &quot;Superman&quot; comic strip to be pulled. The strips in question were created in April 1945 and depicted Lex Luthor bombarding Superman with the radiation from a cyclotron. This violated wartime voluntary censorship guidelines meant to help conceal the Manhattan Project.

===Silver Age Lex Luthor===
In 1956, DC Comics reimagined the Flash with a new secret identity, costume and origin. This led to the new Silver Age of Comics and the first DC Comics reboot, with characters across the board being reimagined or having their histories and nature redefined. The earlier Golden Age stories of Superman and Batman were later said to have taken place on Earth-Two, a parallel universe that was part of the larger DC Multiverse.

The Silver Age version of Luthor was introduced in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #271 (April 1960), now given the first name &quot;Lex&quot; (later said to be short for Alexis, eventually retconned as Alexander) and an origin story. Originally hero-worshiping Superboy, teenage Lex Luthor of Smallville is determined to prove he is Earth&#x27;s greatest scientist by creating artificial life. His recklessness and inexperience causes a fire in his lab and he calls on Superboy to save him. The Boy of Steel puts out the fire but, in the process, accidentally destroys the artificial life form and the years of research notes that led to its creation, while fumes from the chemical fire cause Luthor&#x27;s hair to fall out. Unwilling to hold himself responsible for the lab fire and the destruction of his own life&#x27;s work, Luthor decides that Superboy was jealous of his intellect and caused the fire himself. Believing he&#x27;s been betrayed by his hero and friend, Lex swears revenge. His first attempts at that are grandiose scientific and engineering projects around Smallville to steal Superboy&#x27;s thunder. When these attempts, for which, unknown to Luthor, Superboy was supportive as consolation that Lex was at least being constructive in his vendetta, each go disastrously awry and force Superboy to intervene while earning the citizenry&#x27;s scorn, Lex&#x27;s hate for Superboy only grew in rationalization of his failures.

This revised origin makes Luthor&#x27;s fight with Superman a personal one and suggests that if events had unfolded differently, Luthor might have grown to be a more noble person. Luthor&#x27;s ego preventing him from personal growth and the tragedy that he and Clark could have been a force for good together are played up in various stories throughout the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in Elliot S. Maggin&#x27;s novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;Miracle Monday&quot;.

The Golden Age version of Luthor appears again as a villain still alive and well on Earth-Two. To distinguish him from the modern-day Lex Luthor, the original incarnation is shown as having kept his red hair and is retroactively given the first name Alexei. In &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; Annual #1 (1982), Alexei Luthor of Earth-Two and Lex Luthor of Earth-One team up. It is shown that Alexei is arguably colder and more villainous, perfectly willing to destroy all of Earth in order to prove his superiority, whereas Lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn&#x27;t want his sister to die.

Years later, Lex Luthor and the villain Brainiac recruit an army of super-villains during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, including Alexei Luthor from Earth-Two. When Alexei argues that the army doesn&#x27;t need two Luthors, Brainiac agrees and executes him.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; reboot===
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (1985-1986), DC rebooted its universe yet again, creating the &quot;Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;&quot; reality. In the 1986 limited series &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, John Byrne redesigned Lex Luthor from scratch, intending to make him a villain that the 1980s would recognize: an evil corporate executive. Byrne intentionally chose to base this new depiction of Luthor on the businessmen Donald Trump, Ted Turner, and Howard Hughes as well as Satan. Initially brutish and overweight, the character later evolved into a sleeker, more athletic version of his old self. Luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire; rather, his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time. Marv Wolfman, a writer on &quot;Action Comics&quot; who had one conversation with Byrne prior to Luthor&#x27;s reboot recalled:
As originally presented in the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of the DC Comics Universe, Lex Luthor is a product of child abuse and early poverty. Born in the Suicide Slum district of Metropolis, he is instilled with a desire to become a self-made man of great power and influence. As a teenager, he takes out a large life insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge, then sabotages their car&#x27;s brakes, causing their deaths. Upon graduating from MIT, Luthor founds his own business, LexCorp, which grows to dominate much of Metropolis.

Luthor does not fully appear in &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; mini-series until the fourth issue, which takes place over a year after Superman&#x27;s arrival in Metropolis. Terrorists seize Luthor&#x27;s yacht, forcing Superman to intervene. Satisfied at the hero&#x27;s performance, Luthor attempts to hire him, admitting he knew about the incoming attack and allowed it to occur so he could see how Superman responded (assuming that the Man of Steel would arrive in time). Enraged, the Mayor deputizes Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment. Although Luthor is released from jail quickly and has the charges dropped, the humiliation of being publicly arrested and processed, coupled with indignation that Superman refused to work for him, results in the villain pledging to destroy Superman simply to prove his power.

Despite general acceptance of Byrne&#x27;s characterization, which led to its influence in media adaptations, DC Comics writers began bringing back his quality of being a scientific genius in the 1990s in stories such as &quot;The Final Night&quot;. By 2000, it was said that Luthor&#x27;s genuine accomplishments in several scientific fields is what helped create LexCorp and make it so successful so quickly (in early Post-Crisis stories, Byrne suggested that Luthor was recognized as a brilliant inventor and great scientific mind, but had largely withdrawn from his laboratory in favor of the boardroom). Regarding the character being a corrupt billionaire rather than a mad scientist, author Neil Gaiman commented:
Luthor&#x27;s romantic aspirations toward Lois Lane, established early on in the series, become a focal point of the stories immediately following it. He is shown making repeated attempts to court her during &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, though Lois plainly does not return his feelings.

In the &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; comic line based on the TV series of the same name, Luthor&#x27;s backstory is identical to that of the Post-Crisis origin with slight changes. Luthor is shown originating in Suicide Slum, his intelligence outshining other children, fueling his ambition to have all of Metropolis look up to him one day. Luthor&#x27;s baldness is never explained, save for a brief depiction of him with blond hair in childhood; it is assumed the hair loss was natural. Luthor&#x27;s parents die during his teenage years, however, their deaths are indeed accidental. Lex uses the insurance to pay for his tuition to MIT and then founds LexCorp. His hatred of Superman is explained as the citizens of Metropolis have admired the Man of Steel more than him.

===Modern depictions===
&quot;&quot;, a limited series written by Mark Waid in 2004, offers an alternate look at Luthor&#x27;s history, including his youth in Smallville, and his first encounter with Superman. The story has similarities to the 2001 television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, which follows Clark Kent&#x27;s life as a teenager and into early adulthood. One plot element shared by the comic and the show is the problematic relationship between Lex and his father Lionel. Along with this, &quot;Birthright&quot; restores the Silver Age concept of Luthor befriending Clark Kent as a young man. The two find a kinship in both feeling like outsiders and sharing a wish to explore outer space and discover alien alife, despite one resenting humanity and the other hoping to understand and be accepted by it. Lex discovers kryptonite samples in Smallville and uses them as a power source for a machine he hopes will pierce space and time so he can communicate with Krypton. When Clark falls ill approaching the machine, Lex mistakes his reaction as doubt in the young scientist&#x27;s ability and sanity. Feeling betrayed, Lex continues the experiment but an explosion erupts, the radiation blast causing his hair to fall out. Luthor leaves Metropolis and years later his scientific work, largely based on his ideas about alien life, results in a fortune he uses to create LexCorp. When Superman appears, Lex is angry that the powerful alien, the kind of companion he&#x27;d often hoped for, looks on him with disapproval and openly disrespects him in front of the media. For this and his interference with Luthor&#x27;s criminal operations, the scientist businessman decides to humiliate and destroy the alien.

Waid&#x27;s original intention was to jettison the notion of Lex Luthor being an evil businessman, restoring his status as a mad scientist. He ultimately conceded, however, that the CEO Luthor would be easier for readers to recognize. In &quot;Birthright&quot;, Luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate; in contrast to Byrne&#x27;s characterization, however, LexCorp is founded upon Luthor&#x27;s study of extraterrestrial life, thereby providing a link between him and Superman. In the retrospective section of the &quot;Superman: Birthright&quot; trade paperback, Waid explains:
&quot;Birthright&quot; was initially intended to establish a new origin for Superman and Luthor. Immediately, the Superman comics and the series Superman/Batman made references to the canonicity of the new origin series. But after &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; ended in 2006, new stories discredited parts of it and it was officially replaced by the 2009–2010 series &quot;&quot;. &quot;Superman: Secret Origin&quot; revised Lex&#x27;s backstory so that he now again had a sister Lena. While he knew Clark as a teenager in Smallville, he rejected the other boy&#x27;s attempts to form a friendship. Resentful toward his alcoholic and abusive father, Lex arranges his parents to die in a car accident and uses the insurance money to leave Smallville and start a better life. After studying under the villains Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and Darkseid, he founds LexCorp and uses his PR, resources, and media control to set himself up as a near-savior in Metropolis. The &quot;Daily Planet&quot; opposes Luthor and he retaliates in ways that leave the newspaper almost bankrupt. Superman&#x27;s arrival challenges Luthor&#x27;s image and brings renewed interest to the &quot;Planet&quot; when he does exclusive interviews with their staff. Clark Kent, Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane work together to oppose Luthor&#x27;s power and Superman tells the public they should strive to achieve great things themselves and not wait for others to be their saviors. Angry at Superman&#x27;s interference and blaming him for losing the love of the public, Luthor swears vengeance.

Following changes to continuity in 2016&#x27;s DC Rebirth, the history from &quot;Superman: Secret Origin&quot; is still largely intact, though it has also been revealed that for a time Lionel Luthor worked as a scientist for Vandal Savage and that this led to a brief friendship between Lex and J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz, the Martian Manhunter, when both were children.

==Fictional character biography==
Whether he is a mad scientist, corrupt businessman, or both, Luthor&#x27;s ego is a defining trait in all his incarnations; he believes he is entitled to both popularity and power. While each incarnation initially wants the adoration of others and control over either Smallville or Metropolis, the goal eventually rises to control over Earth and possibly universal domination. Luthor&#x27;s other defining trait is his obsession to destroy Superman and humiliate the alien hero, either by displaying his own superiority by achieving victory without the benefit of superpowers or to prove the Man of Steel is motivated by selfish desire rather than altruism. Many times, Luthor has claimed he could create a better way of life for the entire human race if not for Superman&#x27;s interference with his work; he has even argued that the Man of Tomorrow&#x27;s presence not only invites danger, it actually &quot;encourages&quot; human society not to strive for greatness because a powerful alien is around to protect them and solve problems. During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover, Wonder Woman restrains Luthor with her magic lasso and under its spell of truth he confesses he secretly wants to be Superman, revealing that beneath all his blustering, Luthor covets Superman&#x27;s powers for himself. When Superman was out of sight for a year, Luthor used the time to create the &quot;Everyman&quot; project intending to create new superheroes to replace the Kryptonian, then later attacks Metropolis with a long-buried Kryptonian warship. Returning to action, Superman points out that Luthor had a year to prove his old argument that he could help others and improve Earth if Superman didn&#x27;t interfere with his life, but instead of curing disease or making technological breakthroughs, all he did was focus on increasing his power and finding &quot;a big destructive machine so [he] could break things.&quot; In the storyline &quot;The Black Ring&quot;, Luthor is endowed with cosmic powers that could enable him to bring peace and bliss to the entire universe and therefore achieve his dream of being more respected than Superman, but he ultimately chooses to renounce his new powers when he realizes that his greatest enemy would never suffer again if he used them.

At times, Lex has been shown evidence that Clark Kent is Superman and almost always he denies this possibility, unable to imagine a man of such power spending half his time pretending to be average since in his mind, such a possibility would be too humiliating to bear. In stories appearing in &quot;JLA&quot; and &quot;52&quot; by Grant Morrison, Luthor cannot bring himself to believe Superman is truly altruistic and deeply cares about a planet that is not his native world, concluding the hero&#x27;s good deeds are often actually passive-aggressive ways of flaunting his power and popularity to Lex. When the hero joins forces with others to form a new, powerful version of the Justice League of America, Lex decides this is Superman&#x27;s direct challenge to his own power, and establishes an &quot;Injustice League&quot; composed of various supervillains to rival them.

===Silver Age===
While the Golden Age Luthor (later named Alexei Luthor) is simply an amoral and brilliant man driven by a simple desire for power, the Silver Age incarnation was given a more developed personality and backstory. Teenage Lex Luthor is an aspiring scientist who resides in Smallville and greatly admires its local hero Superboy. After Lex saves him from kryptonite, Superboy builds him a private laboratory in gratitude. After thousands of experiments, Luthor creates an artificial living protoplasm. Overjoyed, he accidentally causes a chemical fire in the lab. Superboy puts out the fire, inadvertently spilling other chemicals, destroying his research. The chemical fumes also cause Lex&#x27;s hair to completely fall out. Enraged he has lost years of research but unwilling to accept responsibility for the fire, Luthor concludes Superboy intentionally sabotaged his work and swears revenge.

Luthor creates grandiose engineering projects to prove his superiority over the superhero, but each one fails and causes problems that Superboy then solves. Luthor then makes his first attempt to murder Superman and fails. Instead of bringing him to the authorities, Superboy declares they are even now and expresses hope Lex will &quot;straighten out&quot; and use his intelligence to help humanity rather than try to prove his superiority or waste time seeking power and vengeance.

&quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot; #23 (1961) reveals the Silver Age Lex Luthor parents are Jules and Arlene and that he has a younger sister Lena. When Lex becomes a criminal, the family moves away from Smallville and changes its name to Thorul (an anagram) to start a new life free of him. Lena Thorul is a toddler at the time and grows up not remembering her real last name, while her parents say her older brother died in a mountain climbing accident. Lex later watches over the adult Lena, making sure she does not discover her connection to one of Earth&#x27;s greatest villains.

As an adult, Lex Luthor&#x27;s driving ambitions are to kill Superman and rule Earth, a stepping stone to dominating the universe, believing a man of his intellect deserves such power. On several occasions he joins forces with Superman&#x27;s enemy Brainiac (though the two often betray each other as well). Lex is repeatedly imprisoned, but his genius allows him to routinely escape. He also makes it a point to be out of prison on the birthday of Albert Einstein, regarding it as a holiday. A famous non-canonical &quot;imaginary story&quot; from 1961 entitled &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; has Luthor finally succeed in killing Superman after pretending to reform and befriend him.

On a distant arid planet orbiting a red star, Luthor challenges Superman to a fight since Kryptonians lose power when exposed to red sun radiation. Befriending the planet&#x27;s inhabitants, Luthor aids them in rediscovering lost technology that restores the water supply and helps the society rebuild. As a result, Luthor becomes a hero in the eyes of the planet, whereas his enemy Superman is detested as a villain. The people rename the planet Lexor and it becomes a regular home base and retreat for Luthor in-between his efforts to fight Superman and take over Earth. He later meets a local woman named Ardora (first called &quot;Tharla&quot; but renamed &quot;Ardora&quot; in later stories as well as the reprint of her first appearance). The two eventually fall in love and marry.

===Bronze Age===
Deciding to retire permanently, Luthor returns to Lexor and learns he has fathered a son by Ardora, Lex Luthor Jr. He spends the next several weeks with his new family before discovering Lexor suffers from the same planetary instability that destroyed Krypton. While creating a &quot;Neutrarod&quot; tower to stabilize the planetary core, Luthor&#x27;s pathological hatred for Superman resurfaces and he reflects on feeling unsatisfied in life without their conflict. The villain then unearths an ancient underground laboratory of great technology, a relic from Lexor&#x27;s lost age. After one of Luthor&#x27;s still-active satellites threatens the people of Earth, he concludes Superman will soon come to Lexor to take him back to Earth authorities. With the underground lab&#x27;s resources, he spends weeks creating a &quot;warsuit&quot; — highly destructive, flight-capable power armor — to finally match the Kryptonian in physical combat and counter his powers. To test the suit, Luthor performs several acts of destruction on Lexor, feigning ignorance when he hears about the &quot;mystery marauder&quot; and telling Ardora he has no knowledge of the armored man.

When Superman arrives, Luthor dons his warsuit and attacks, now obsessed with the need to best the hero in combat and prove his superiority. The people of Lexor are shocked to realize he is the mystery marauder and does not care about the harm he has caused them. During the battle, Luthor releases an energy salvo that accidentally overloads the Neutrarod, resulting in the complete destruction of the planet Lexor and all its inhabitants, including Ardora and Lex Jr.. Similar to how he reacted after the destruction of his lab in Smallville, Lex is unable to process his grief and accept his responsibility for Lexor&#x27;s destruction. He psychologically blocks part of his own memory to convince himself Superman is at fault, renewing his need for vengeance. In his subsequent stories, he regularly uses the Lexorian warsuit. The warsuit was designed by George Pérez as part of the Super Powers toyline in the early 1980s before being introduced into the comics in 1983. The suit vanished in 1986 after &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; rebooted DC Comics continuity, but was reintroduced in 2004, now said to be built with a combination of Earth and alien technology (including tech from the other-dimensional world Apokolips) and armed with different forms of kryptonite in the gauntlet.

Lex Luthor of Earth-One teams up with Alexei Luthor of Earth-Two. It is shown that Alexei is arguably colder and more villainous, perfectly willing to destroy all of Earth in order to prove his superiority, whereas Lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn&#x27;t want his sister to die. They even extend their alliance to Ultraman when Earth-Three&#x27;s Lex Luthor is a good guy. All three villains were defeated by Superman of Earth-One, Superman of Earth-Two, and Lex Luthor of Earth-Three.

During the 12-issue limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Luthor allies himself with fellow Superman foe Brainiac to recruit an army of supervillains spanning the DC Multiverse. Alexei Luthor is present and complains this army does not need two Luthors; Brainiac kills Alexei in response. At the conclusion of the series, reality is altered so that each of the different universes converge into one. Luthor is subsequently returned to prison with all his memories of the Crisis forgotten.

This incarnation of Lex Luthor met his end in the non-canonical two-part story &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot; that closed out the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superman continuity of the Silver and Bronze Age. Luthor finds Brainiac&#x27;s head, hoping to revive the villain for a new team-up. Instead, Brainiac takes control of Luthor&#x27;s body, forcing him to be a host as he attempts to destroy Superman. Luthor later begs a superpowered Lana Lang to kill him, who does so. Brainiac retains control of the body for a short period of time before rigor mortis sets in, then abandons it, running out of power shortly afterward.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
As part of the continuity changes which followed &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Superman: Secret Origin&quot;, Alexander &quot;Lex&quot; Joseph Luthor is a corrupt businessman profiting from many hidden criminal operations. This Luthor grew up a poor child alongside Perry White, later causing his parents&#x27; death via a car accident so he can inherit their life insurance and create a better life for himself, creating LexCorp. He marries and divorces several times and desires a romance with Lois Lane. When Superman appears, Luthor takes advantage of a terrorist attack to see the hero in action and then attempts to make him an employee. But the Man of Steel, acting as a special deputy of Metropolis, arrests him for endangering people by not warning authorities of the impending terrorist attack. Humiliated, Luthor swears revenge, repeatedly letting Superman know about his criminal schemes but never leaving him enough evidence to bring the man to justice again. Luthor becomes obsessed with Superman and gathers all information on him and his associates, leading a computer analysis to conclude Clark Kent and Superman are the same person. Unable to believe someone as powerful as Superman regularly hides his powers and pretends to be average, as that is something he would never do himself, Luthor dismisses the computer&#x27;s findings and concludes both the machine and its programmer are at fault.

As a nod to the previous continuity, Luthor has his lab create high-tech armor that resembles the Lexorian warsuit. Rather than act directly, he has an employee don the armor and attack Superman for him. The man is defeated and cannot testify against Luthor because the armor&#x27;s neural control unit destroys his mind. Along with this, Luthor participates in the creation of two &quot;Superman&quot; villains, Parasite (indirectly) and Bizarro (a failed attempt by Luthor&#x27;s scientists to clone Superman).
When Superman fights the cyborg Metallo, Luthor intervenes. In &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #2, discovering Metallo is powered by a &#x27;heart&#x27; of kryptonite that can hurt and potentially kill Superman, Luthor steals it and a creates a kryptonite ring for himself. He wears the radioactive ore around his finger as a symbol that he is untouchable, causing the Man of Tomorrow pain and weakness whenever he approaches. Not realizing humans can be affected by severe or long-term meteoric radiation exposure, Luthor eventually suffers from Kryptonite poisoning. He had his right hand amputated to prevent the cancer&#x27;s spread, and not long afterwards, said kryptonite ring (which he kept in cold storage prior to the surgery) would be stolen. Eventually coming into the possession of Superman, who in turn entrusts it to Batman, tasking the Dark Knight to use it if the Man of Steel ever becomes corrupt or falls under the control of another. But removing the tainted limb was a mere half measure, as his affliction had already metastasized rendering Lex&#x27;s condition terminal.

Luthor fakes his death in a plane crash in the Andes and secretly has his brain transferred to a cloned body, one younger, taller, with full hair, and more physically fit. With aid from trusted assistants, the now physically 21-year-old Luthor presents himself to the world as his own hitherto unknown, illegitimate son and heir from Australia, Lex Luthor II, who only wishes to do good and can&#x27;t be judged by the actions of his father. He quickly manipulates and recruits the new Supergirl (a protoplasmic being), who falls in love with him due to his resemblance to her lost love and creator, the Luthor of a parallel Earth. When Superman is seemingly killed by the living weapon Doomsday, the genetic research facility Project Cadmus creates a seeming clone of the hero called Superboy (Kon-El). As Earth science cannot perfectly replicate Kryptonian DNA, Superboy is a purely human clone with genetic modifications that mimick Superman&#x27;s powers.

Luthor&#x27;s clone body eventually begins to deteriorate, causing him to lose his hair and age at an accelerated rate, a side-effect of a disease affecting all clones. Lois Lane discovers proof of Luthor&#x27;s clone harvesting and false identity and exposes him with help from Superman. Desperate to evade arrest, Luthor activates technology left on Earth by Brainiac, destroying large sections of Metropolis in the process. In the end, Luthor becomes a prisoner in his own body, unable to move or even blink, internally swearing vengeance on Superman. During the crossover &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot;, the demon-lord Neron offers Luthor full health and vitality in exchange for services and his soul. Not believing in the existence of souls, Lex agrees and is restored, regaining the physical fitness of his Lex II body but again lacking head and facial hair, and is physically approximately in his true age. His soul is later restored after Neron is defeated by Captain Marvel and the Trickster. Returning to Metropolis, Luthor submits to a trial. He claims all his crimes were committed by a violent clone created by renegade scientists from Cadmus Labs who secretly held the true Luthor hostage. Luthor is acquitted of all charges. He later arranges to reacquire his old kryptonite ring.

When Superman and others form a new, powerful version of the Justice League of America, Lex decides this is Superman&#x27;s direct challenge to his own power, so he creates a new Injustice Gang in response. Along with his new teammates, Lex acquires a powerful artifact known as the Worlogog, which can warp space and time. The Injustice Gang kills several people while attacking the League then lures the heroes into a trap, but then is defeated. The Joker gains control of the Worlogog, but is then telepathically attacked, becoming temporarily sane and remorseful. Before the killer&#x27;s mind reverts, Luthor has Joker use the Worlogog to revise history so that those killed no longer died. With the deaths removed and little physical evidence linking him to any wrongdoing, Luthor is free to go. While Batman concludes Luthor simply used Joker to avoid murder charges, Superman believes it is a sign Luthor does not truly desire the deaths of innocents and still has the potential to be a good man.

Luthor marries Contessa Erica Alexanda Del Portenza, a near-immortal and formidable woman with her own agenda. After the birth of their daughter Lena, Luthor attempts to raise the girl without her interference. After several clashes, Luthor has Contessa seemingly killed by a missile barrage. Later on, the time-traveling villain Brainiac 13 infuses Metropolis with technology from the future while his ancestor Brainiac, in need of a new physical vessel, mentally inhabits young Lena&#x27;s body. Brainiac 13 offers Luthor control of the technology if Luthor turns over Brainiac and hands over his daughter. He later tells Superman that he has a &quot;kingdom&quot; now as a result of his deal, adding &quot;As for my princess... I can always make another.&quot;

====President of the United States====
Deciding to turn to politics, Luthor becomes President of the United States, winning the election on a platform of promoting technological progress. His first action as president is to take a proposed moratorium on fossil-based fuels to the U.S. Congress. On the night of the election, Batman threatens that Luthor can keep the kryptonite ring or the White House but not both. Later on, Superman, Batman and Lois Lane seemingly try to steal the ring only to be thwarted. In actuality, they manipulated Luthor into retrieving a fake while Batman keeps the actual ring. Superman, upon learning that Lex Luthor was about to be elected president, flew off in a fit of rage and split one of Saturn&#x27;s small moons in half with one fly through.

Before he takes office in the White House, Luthor cuts ties with his company LexCorp, turning over leadership to Talia al Ghul. Luthor&#x27;s popularity is assisted by the extreme unpopularity of the previous administration&#x27;s mishandling of the Gotham City earthquake crisis (as depicted in the &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline in the Batman titles), and his own seemingly heroic efforts to rebuild Gotham before it rejoins the United States. Batman learns Luthor attempted to take control of Gotham by forging deeds for its lands in his own name. This results in Bruce Wayne severing all commercial ties between the U.S. government and his company, Wayne Enterprises. In response to Wayne Enterprises severing ties with his government, Luthor arranges the murder of Wayne&#x27;s lover, Vesper Fairchild, and frames Wayne for the murder (as seen in &quot;Bruce Wayne: Fugitive&quot;), the plan being more successful than Luthor anticipated when his chosen assassin of David Cain realizes Wayne&#x27;s identity as Batman and sets up a complex frame.

Soon after Luthor discovers evidence that leads him to conclude Clark Kent is Superman, Imperiex destroys Topeka, Kansas. Luthor is warned of the impending attack beforehand but alerts no one so Earth can enter a great war and he can prove his leadership to the world. Luthor coordinates the U.S. Army, Earth&#x27;s superheroes, and a number of untrustworthy alien forces to battle the main villain of the story arc. Although Lex Luthor is able to devise a plan to destroy Imperiex&#x27;s body, the plan is subsequently hijacked by Brainiac 13, requiring Superman to propose a new plan where Darkseid and Luthor coordinate their efforts to defeat Imperiex by sending him back in time. Following the battle, Superman retrieves Lena and returns her to Lex, advising Luthor to stop trying to be a god and just be a man. Soon afterward, Superman confronts Manchester Black. Realizing Superman is a true hero and therefore true heroism is possible, Black repents for his actions against Superman by removing Luthor knowledge of Superman&#x27;s secret identity.

====Revised backstory and removal from office====
Following the publication of &quot;&quot; in 2003–2004, Luthor&#x27;s history is altered (and the new canon is quickly referenced in both Superman comics and the series &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; that begins in 2004). In the new history, Luthor is only a few years older than Clark Kent and his family moves to Smallville when he is a teenager. Possibly abused by his father Lionel, and alienated from others by his intelligence and his ignorance of certain social cues and behaviors (he does not understand why gifts are given on birthdays without a promise of payment of some kind), Lex only finds friendship with Clark, impressed by the young man&#x27;s knowledge though also finding him naive. Luthor discovers kryptonite meteors in Smallville and uses the radioactive mineral as a power source for his experiments. When Clark sees the machine and feels ill from proximity to kryptonite, Luthor mistakes his reaction to mean the young man doesn&#x27;t believe in the experiment, that he also thinks Lex is lying or &quot;crazy&quot; as others do. The machine then explodes and Luthor survives but loses his hair as a result of radiation. Years later, his scientific research, largely based on his ideas about alien life, results in a small fortune that he uses to create LexCorp. When Superman appears in Metropolis, Lex is angered the man won&#x27;t bow to his control and takes it personally that a powerful alien, the kind of companion Luthor had often hoped for and believed would see him as a peer, instead looks on him with disapproval and moral judgment. This, along with Superman interfering with his criminal agenda and openly disrespecting Luthor in front of the media, motivates Lex to humiliate and destroy the alien hero.

The initial story arc of the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; ongoing series depicts the fall of Luthor&#x27;s reign as U.S. president before he finishes his first term of office. In &quot;The World&#x27;s Finest&quot; (more commonly referred to as &quot;Public Enemies&quot;), a kryptonite asteroid threatens Earth. Luthor has been secretly injecting himself with a new version of the &quot;super-steroid&quot; Venom (a chemical associated with the Batman villain Bane) mixed with liquified synthetic kryptonite. While increasing his physical strength and speed, it starts making him irrational and more prone to aggression. Seeing an opportunity with the appearance of the asteroid, Luthor decides to finally end Superman and tells the media that he has evidence the Man of Steel himself is drawing the meteorite towards Earth. He offers a billion-dollar reward for Superman&#x27;s capture. As these efforts fail and the meteorite is destroyed, an enraged Luthor decides to fight Superman directly, injecting himself with more Venom and donning a high-tech warsuit.

Maddened by the Venom, Luthor admits during the battle that he has no real proof Superman is the cause of the deadly asteroid heading to Earth and reveals he traded Doomsday to Darkseid in return for technology. After Superman damages his warsuit, Luthor retreats to LexCorp HQ only to discover that Talia has sold the entire company to the Wayne Foundation. Without resources and realizing his confession to criminal acts and conspiring with a hostile power was recorded and broadcast, Luthor flees, now a wanted fugitive. Vice President Pete Ross briefly assumes his place as president. While on the run, Luthor takes a renewed interest in his &quot;son&quot; Superboy, hoping to corrupt him into being his soldier.

In 2009, the &quot;Public Enemies&quot; story arc was adapted as a direct-to-video animated film entitled &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot;.

====&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;====
Alexander Luthor Jr. (the son of Earth-Three&#x27;s version of Luthor) returns to the DC Universe along with other survivors from &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; as part of a scheme to replace it with a perfect Earth. He masquerades as the mainstream Lex Luthor and creates a new Secret Society of Super Villains. In response, the real Luthor takes on the identity of Mockingbird and forms the third incarnation of the Secret Six to counter the Society. The two have a confrontation during the main &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; story and the mainstream Lex Luthor helps Earth&#x27;s heroes locate young Alexander Jr. After &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; ends, Luthor oversees Alexander&#x27;s execution at the hands of the Joker in Crime Alley.

====&quot;52&quot;====
In the 2006 – 2007 series &quot;52&quot;, Lex takes advantage of the presence of Alexander Jr.&#x27;s body. He convinces the public that it was not him who committed crimes and fled the White House but rather this man, a Luthor from a parallel Earth who masqueraded as him. While some in the public don&#x27;t believe this, it is enough to provide reasonable doubt and clear Lex of all charges again. With Superman now missing (due to losing his powers at the end of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;), Luthor pursues a new agenda. He creates the Luthoran Church and becomes spokesman for the Everyman Project, which offers superpowers to ordinary citizens through artificial metagene treatment. With several Everyman volunteers (including Natasha Irons, niece of John Henry Irons), Luthor forms his own team of superheroes, the new Infinity Inc. When the team battles the villain Blockbuster (whom Luthor empowered as well), Lex demonstrates he can &#x27;shut off&#x27; the powers of any of his Everyman agents; this results in the death of his speedster, Trajectory.

At the stroke of midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve, Luthor sets in motion a calculated plot to discredit Supernova, a new hero defending Metropolis in Superman&#x27;s absence. Luthor triggers a mass-shutdown of the powers of everyone who has undertaken the Everyman program, except for the members of Infinity Inc, causing widespread death, injury, and millions of dollars worth of damage. Luthor&#x27;s plot ultimately fails when Supernova is able to minimize the disaster with a spectacular rescue.

While investigating Luthor, Natasha Irons discovers he has experimented on himself with artificial metagene treatment. After developing nearly all of Superman&#x27;s powers himself, Luthor considers conquering Earth and renaming it Lexor. However, Natasha triggers an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down the synthetic metagene and her uncle Steel knocks Lex out. Publicly disgraced, Lex faces indictment for over 120 criminal counts relating to what is now called &quot;the New Year&#x27;s Eve massacre&quot;, ranging from malfeasance to first-degree murder. The full nature of his crimes are brought to public attention through various articles written by Clark Kent.

====&quot;One Year Later&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot;====
One year after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, weeks after the New Year&#x27;s Eve Massacre, Luthor is cleared of all criminal charges in the &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline. Despite this, his public image is ruined and, thanks to the machinations of the villain Doctor Sivana, he has lost most of his wealth and had no control over the newly reformed LexCorp, now being run by Lana Lang. He blames Clark Kent for swaying public opinion and pledges vengeance on Metropolis after an angry mob jeers him. Amassing large quantities of kryptonite and kidnapping the super-villains Metallo and the Kryptonite Man, Lex uses them to power a Kryptonian warship controlled through a &quot;sunstone&quot; crystal. Having recently regained his powers, Superman destroys the kryptonite-powered ship and confronts Lex with the fact that, despite his claims that Superman is what prevents him from helping humanity, the only thing he accomplished during the Man of Steel&#x27;s absence was to cause pain and acquire a machine that could cause more destruction. Enraged, Lex manages to escape custody yet again.

Lex Luthor continues his open campaigns against Superman and Earth&#x27;s heroes, working with Bizarro, a new Revenge Squad, and the Kryptonian General Zod. Alongside Joker and Cheetah III, Luthor (once again wearing his warsuit) organizes a new Injustice League to help destroy the reformed Justice League. During this period, he creates the third Shaggy Man and the third Blockbuster.

Luthor plays a large role in the &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; tie-in series &quot;Salvation Run&quot;. Exiled to a distant planet along with many of Earth&#x27;s villains, Lex quickly assumes command and convinces many to follow him as he finds a way home. He is opposed by those who join forces with Joker and Gorilla Grodd. Eventually, the villains are attacked by Parademons. Luthor manages to get the villains off the planet with a makeshift teleporter, using the villains Neutron, Heatmonger, Plasmus, Warp, and Thunder and Lightning as unwilling power sources. When called a &quot;monster&quot; by Thunder, Luthor claims the ones who exiled them are the real monsters and he is the hero. He sets the teleporter to self-destruct after he uses it, killing the Parademons as well as his living batteries.

====&quot;Final Crisis&quot;====

In the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; crossover, Luthor joins the Inner Circle of Libra&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains. After learning Libra is a prophet of Darkseid, Lex Luthor opposes him, unwilling to be a mindless slave while Earth is largely destroyed. Working with Doctor Sivana, Luthor seemingly destroys Libra and overrides the Anti-Life Equation being broadcast into the helmets of the Justifiers, humans forced to obey Darkseid. Luthor subsequently assists Superman in leading the assault against Darkseid&#x27;s forces, noting that Superman can consider this a legendary first team-up between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot; Luthor joins those assisting Superman and his remaining allies in constructing the Miracle Machine, which is later used to reset the universe without Darkseid&#x27;s presence.

====&quot;New Krypton&quot;====

Luthor is finally found guilty for his crimes. Rather than spend life in prison, he is recruited by General Sam Lane to serve out his sentence by working for the secretive Project 7734, accessing the knowledge stored within the captured Brainiac. Luthor successfully accesses Brainiac&#x27;s brain, using it to activate the villain&#x27;s ship and robotic drones. Luthor is then tasked with studying the genetic potential of the seemingly dead body of Doomsday.

Luthor later manages to use Brainiac&#x27;s ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac frees himself from Luthor&#x27;s control and the two make their escape. Forming an alliance, Brainiac promises Luthor can have Earth when he is done with it. Lex returns to Smallville, where it is revealed his sister Lena is alive, physically and mentally handicapped, and living with her daughter Lori. In an effort to prove his abilities to Superboy, Lex manages to counter Lena&#x27;s disabilities, allowing her to walk and regain greater mental awareness, then quickly reverses the process, leaving her completely catatonic. Luthor then informs Superboy that so long as Superman is alive, he will never reveal how he helped Lena. Seeing Superboy now as a failed experiment due to having 50% &quot;wrong alien DNA&quot;, Luthor and Brainiac create another binary clone with their own genetics.

====&quot;Last Stand of New Krypton&quot; and &quot;War of the Supermen&quot;====

As part of his participation in Project 7734, Luthor sends a robot double of himself with Brainiac on a mission to attack New Krypton. While there, the Luthor robot tampers with the body chemistry of the previously captured villain Reactron. Reactron then kills himself, initiating a chain reaction which destroys New Krypton and all but a handful of its 100,000 Kryptonian inhabitants. Supergirl&#x27;s mother Alura is among the casualties. Since Earth is at war with New Krypton at the time, Luthor is praised for this action and receives a presidential pardon for all his past crimes.

====&quot;Blackest Night&quot;====
During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, when the public learned that everyone who has died are rising as undead Black Lanterns, Luthor isolates himself in his safehouse in fear that &quot;all&quot; the people he has murdered over the years will reanimate and seek revenge. Several victims, including his deceased father, arrive but he escapes after receiving a power ring fueled by the orange light of avarice, becoming an Orange Lantern deputy. Luthor arrives at Coast City and joins the battle against the Black Lantern Corps, fighting Black Lantern versions of Superman and Superboy. Luthor is quickly overwhelmed by his greed and sets out to steal the rings of his fellow inducted Lanterns, taking Scarecrow&#x27;s yellow fear-powered ring before being held back. Wonder Woman restrains Luthor with her magic lasso and under its spell of truth he confesses he secretly wants to be Superman. When Nekron is defeated, Larfleeze the Orange Lantern takes Luthor&#x27;s ring, as there can only be one avarice-powered ring.

Still craving the power of the orange light, Luthor recovers and operates on the remains of Black Lanterns. He is visited by Larfleeze, who demands to know what is important to the people of Earth. Luthor responds with &quot;power&quot; (which Larfleeze already possesses) and &quot;land&quot; (which intrigues the alien).

====&quot;Superman: Secret Origin&quot; Revision====
The 2009-2010 mini-series &quot;&quot; alters Lex&#x27;s history again. He now grows up in Smallville with his younger sister Lena and abusive, alcoholic father. He meets Clark Kent on a few occasions but is defensive and insulted when he realizes Clark desires a friendship. While in high school, Lex arranges for his parents to die in a car accident, after which he uses the money to travel the world. &quot;Action Comics&quot; Annual #13 in 2011 reveals that after leaving Smallville, Lex spent some time studying under Ra&#x27;s al Ghul and later spent time working as a weapons maker for Darkseid, learning the technology of Apokolips.

Lex&#x27;s scientific work and other factors lead him to create a fortune and found LexCorp. Luthor&#x27;s public relations paints him as a savior to Metropolis, which suffers greatly from crime, and he makes a display of regularly granting good fortune to a random citizen. When Superman appears, Luthor&#x27;s secret criminal operations are threatened and Luthor is no longer considered a great savior or power in the city, particularly after the hero tells the public that they should look to themselves to be heroes and not look to others to be their saviors. Luthor begins a quest for vengeance, aiding (indirectly and directly) in the origins of Parasite and Metallo.

====&quot;The Black Ring&quot;====
After the conclusion of the &quot;New Krypton&quot; event, Luthor became the lead character in &quot;Action Comics&quot; until issue No. 900. Written by Paul Cornell, the first storyline &quot;The Black Ring&quot; explores Luthor&#x27;s new desire to locate the energy of the Black Lantern Corps. Aiding him in this quest is a robot duplicate of Lois Lane. To distract Superman and his closest allies from interrupting him, Luthor releases several Doomsday duplicates.

Luthor&#x27;s quest involves a conversation with Death herself and finally leads him to face a powerful and deadly entity released from the Phantom Zone. Luthor infuses himself with Kryptonian technology and grapples with the creature. The two fuse and Luthor learns it evolved in the Phantom Zone and now seeks to escape, driven mad by sensing the grief and anger of the Zone prisoners. With the creature&#x27;s power at his command, Luthor draws out Superman to him and attempts to drive the hero mad by forcing him to experience real human emotions, believing that Superman only fakes humanity to be trusted. The ploy fails and Luthor&#x27;s new abilities reveal that Superman is really Clark Kent, a well-meaning man raised by Earth people who loved him and who still mourns the loss of Jonathan Kent. Luthor is enraged by how this upbringing and emotional nature clashes with his own motivations, unhappy childhood and anger towards his own father.

It becomes clear that the Phantom Zone entity has the power to create a feeling of peace and bliss throughout the entire universe, at the cost of never allowing him to cause any harm to another being. Superman appeals to Luthor to make this a reality, thus giving the universe a gift and achieving something beyond the Man of Steel&#x27;s abilities. Unwilling to create a universe of bliss when it would mean Superman would also be rewarded instead of suffering, Luthor loses his connection to the entity and its power, as well as his memory of everything he learned merged with it. The entity departs for another reality and Lex falls into a Phantom Zone portal. Shortly afterward, the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; timeline is created and the DC Universe rebooted.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In 2011, DC Comics implemented &quot;The New 52&quot;, a relaunch of its titles and a reboot of its fictional continuity. In the new reality, Lex Luthor has no childhood association with Smallville or Clark Kent. As an adult in Metropolis with the resources of LexCorp, he sets up himself as a scientific troubleshooter for the military, working with government scientist John Henry Irons to create high-tech armor called &quot;Metal-Zero&quot; (which is later used to create the villain Metallo). When Superman appears in Metropolis and clashes with local authorities, Luthor works with the military to bring in the superhuman being, arguing that alien vigilante is an inherent threat since history has shown that introducing new life forms into other environments often causes the local environment to destabilize and suffer. Luthor tortures Superman to test his power, justifying his actions by looking at the hero as an alien rather than a human being whose well being should be considered. Superman laughs at Lex, infuriating the scientist, then escapes. Insulted by Superman&#x27;s mocking laughter and his failure to contain the alien, and determined to learn more secrets from the Kryptonian&#x27;s biology and technology, Luthor becomes determined to best the Man of Steel.

Unknown to the U.S. military, Lex Luthor has been in contact with the &quot;Collector of Worlds&quot; (a version of Brainiac) and makes a deal with the alien, who wishes to collect specimens from Earth for his collection of inhabitants and artifacts from different planets. Luthor intends to increases his power in Metropolis and to aid this he also supplies social justice blogger and journalist Clark Kent with information regarding the corrupt activities of powerful media mogul Glen Glennmorgan of Galaxy Inc. Clark is unaware his informant is Luthor, knowing him only as &quot;Icarus&quot;.

After the Collector attacks Metropolis and Luthor&#x27;s deal with the villain is exposed, Luthor is fired as a consultant to the U.S. military by General Sam Lane himself. He is later instrumental in the creation of the &quot;New 52&quot; version of the Kryptonite Man, known in this world primarily as K-Man. A few years later, Luthor&#x27;s schemes against Superman and some of his crimes are exposed. He is arrested and imprisoned in a special U.S. government prison.

In the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Luthor plays a major role in opposing the Crime Syndicate, an evil version of the Justice League from a parallel Earth. He founds the New 52 incarnation of the Injustice League, helping Batman to free their world from the Syndicate&#x27;s control and saving Superman&#x27;s life from a kryptonite attack by Syndicate member Atomica. Public opinion of Lex Luthor becomes favorable. After learning an entity destroyed the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s Earth, Luthor wants to prepare for the possibility that his Earth could be threatened next. To aid him in this and continue his new role as a hero, he requests Justice League membership. The Justice League are not sure about his altruism but decides his membership would make it easier to monitor him. While a Leaguer, Luthor helps against several threats, wearing a high-tech warsuit created by reverse-engineering Kryptonian technology, and builds a new Watchtower for the team.

When the New God Darkseid is seemingly killed, his &quot;Omega Effect&quot; is contained in Lex Luthor, temporarily turning him into a God of Apokolips.

The &quot;New 52&quot; Superman&#x27;s identity is revealed to the world and the hero subsequently loses most of his powers. Superman consults Luthor for help, but the villain cannot believe that someone as powerful as Superman would pretend to be someone as ordinary as Clark Kent. He decides that Superman&#x27;s loss of power is a convenient lie to hide the fact that Clark Kent is not really the Man of Steel, that he is only dressing like him and has found a way to acquire limited powers of his own. Luthor asks Clark to tell him the truth of why he and Superman are lying to the world, but the Man of Steel has no answers for him.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
Following the death of the &quot;New 52&quot; Superman, Luthor creates a new warsuit decorated by Superman&#x27;s S-shield, deciding he is the new protector of Metropolis. He is confronted by the Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; version of Superman, who refuses to believe Luthor&#x27;s intentions are noble. In DC&#x27;s 2016 line-wide relaunch &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, large parts of the New 52 canon are removed (later said to have occurred in a different timeline) while large parts of the Post-Crisis canon are restored to the DC Universe. Eventually, this affects the Superman comics as well, in the wake of the 2017 storyline &quot;Superman Reborn&quot; Luthor&#x27;s backstory from &quot;Superman: Secret Origin&quot; and large parts of his Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity are restored, while the &quot;New 52&quot; events are largely removed. The canon says that Luthor still served in the Justice League for a time.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Luthor is approached by Adrian Veidt, who attempts to enlist his aid in finding Doctor Manhattan. He is then attacked by a seemingly-revived Comedian. After recovering from surgery, he reveals he has been investigating claims that many heroes and villains gained their powers from government experiments rather than accidents. He later provides Lois Lane with footage of the Justice Society of America, who in the new canon were not the publicly known superheroes of World War II, but were clandestine heroes whose existence was largely denied. &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; ends with Luthor considering utilizing and improving Veidt&#x27;s methods for his own personal use. It is also revealed the New 52 Luthor and history still exist in a parallel universe.

====&quot;Year of the Villain&quot;====
Lex Luthor&#x27;s childhood is fleshed out further in the pages of &quot;Justice League&quot;. Before he ever met Clark Kent, it is said his father Lionel Luthor was a scientist working with the Legionnaires Club, an organization created by the immortal villain Vandal Savage to unlock the secrets of the universe. At one point, Lionel is able to reach through space and time to bring a Martian child named J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz to Earth. Lex and J&#x27;onn form a brief friendship. When the heroic Blackhawks attacks the operations of the Legionnaires&#x27; Club, Lex sends J&#x27;onn back home to Mars to protect him. Many years later, he will meet J&#x27;onn again when the alien operates on Earth as the Martian Manhunter. To protect his secrets, Vandal Savage has Lionel&#x27;s memories altered. As a result of this psychological trauma, Lionel becomes a &quot;broken man&quot; and an alcoholic. Lex comes to hate his father and only feels family love for his sister Lena, who is increasingly ill and whom he wishes to help.

After the universal barrier known as the Source Wall is broken during the events of &quot;No Justice,&quot; Luthor forms a new Legion Of Doom to track down the secrets that were once pursued by the Legionnaires&#x27; Club, discovering they are connected to the god-like Perpetua, Mother of Forgers. In the &quot;Year of the Villain&quot; special, Luthor commits suicide to gain favor with Perpetua, who resurrects him as her acolyte/child, becoming a powerful Martian/human hybrid called Apex Lex. He then offers power to many DC Universe villains.

==Relationships and family==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity===
In pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Luthor is shown as having few personal attachments. Shamed by his crimes, his parents Jules and Arlene disown him, move away, cut off all ties to Smallville, and change their name to the anagram &quot;Thorul&quot;. Jules and Arlene take their younger child Lena with them, who is only a toddler at the time and later does not remember her real last name. Lena Thorul is told her older brother died in a mountain climbing accident. Not long after their departure from Smallville, Jules and Arlene die in a car accident, leaving Lena to grow up alone. Like her brother, she attends Regis High School and then later becomes a librarian. Lena meets Lois Lane, who plans to mention the young woman in a story but is then warned not to by Lex Luthor. Superman and Lois discover the truth but agree to Lex&#x27;s request that Lena not learn about their connection. Later on, Lena moves to Midvale and befriends Superman&#x27;s cousin Supergirl, who also winds up helping to make sure Lena doesn&#x27;t learn the truth about her brother.

Exposure to one of Luthor&#x27;s inventions later grants Lena ESP, making her an empath. Lena Thorul marries FBI agent Jeff Colby (who had once arrested Lex) and they have a son, Val Colby. Jeff Colby dies some time later. After Lena has brain surgery, the decision is made to reveal the truth about Luthor to her. Luthor then discovers he was an unwitting party to a conspiracy against Lena masterminded by his own cellmate &quot;Sam&quot;, who wanted revenge against Colby. Deeply remorseful about this, he apologizes to Lena and the two attempt to make amends with each other.

The pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Luthor also has a niece named Nasthalthia Luthor, the child of an older unnamed sister of Lex&#x27;s who had run away and eloped in Europe when she was a teenager. Nasthalthia is an occasional thorn in Supergirl&#x27;s side, at one point forming a gang called Nasty&#x27;s Nasties. Nasthalthia is removed from canon following the reboot of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, but does appear in the critically acclaimed &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;.

Lex Luthor himself later marries Ardora of the planet Lexor and, in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #544 (June 1983), learns he has an infant son by Ardora, Lex Luthor, Jr.. Almost two months later, Luthor accidentally causes the destruction of Lexor, and Ardora and Lex, Jr. die as a direct result.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity===
In the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, Lena is the name of Lex&#x27;s adopted sister when he was living in a foster home. She is accidentally killed by their foster father when she refuses to try to trick Lex out of his inheritance. Lex later names his baby daughter after her.

Following the events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Luthor&#x27;s history was again altered, re-introducing Lena as his blood sister. Unlike the pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version, Lena is well aware of her history with Lex, having grown up alongside him, with only an abusive father. Lex and Lena&#x27;s mother is named Letitia and is presumed deceased. She has no empathic abilities, and is a paraplegic with a teenaged daughter, Lori, both of whom still live in Smallville. Unlike his Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; version, Lex has little love for his sister, having abandoned her with an unnamed aunt after their father dies of a heart attack. Lex even goes so far as to cure Lena&#x27;s illness, and then immediately undoes the process, leaving her completely catatonic, solely to make a mocking point to Superboy and Superman. Lena is currently under the care of the best doctors from Wayne Enterprises, hired by Red Robin.

In the post-&quot;The Man of Steel&quot; continuity, Luthor is childhood friends with Perry White and it is revealed Luthor is the biological father of Perry&#x27;s son Jerry White, conceived during a period when Perry was believed dead. Luthor, Perry and Alice only learned the truth shortly before Jerry was killed by a gang war that Luthor had triggered. Post-Crisis Lex Luthor has been married eight times, though the first seven marriages occurred off-panel in Luthor&#x27;s past. His eighth marriage to Contessa Erica Alexandra Del Portenza (a.k.a. the &quot;Contessa&quot;) is based on mutual greed; Contessa buys controlling interest in LexCorp after Luthor is indicted, compelling him to marry her in order to regain control of his company. Contessa becomes pregnant and starts using the unborn child to dominate Lex into doing her bidding. Luthor&#x27;s response is to imprison her while she is drugged during childbirth, keeping her in a permanently unconscious state. Contessa later escapes to an island mansion, but upon being elected president, Luthor targets her home with a barrage of missiles and destroys it. Luthor&#x27;s daughter Lena was the avatar of The Tech, the remnant cyberware of Metropolis after Brainiac 13&#x27;s advancing the city to a futuristic state was undone.

James D. Hudnall&#x27;s &quot;Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography&quot; further expands on Luthor&#x27;s origin. The story details how Luthor was sent to live with a foster family following the sabotage of his parents&#x27; car. His foster parents, Casey and Emily Griggs, conspire to embezzle his insurance and coerce their daughter, Lena, into seducing Lex to learn the location of the money. Due to her genuine romantic feelings toward Lex, Lena refuses and is beaten to death by her father. Lex is absent from the home at the time of the murder, having been talked into going to a football game by his schoolmate Perry White. Once he has established his preeminence in Metropolis, Luthor takes vengeance on Griggs, secretly hiring him to assassinate Frank Berkowitz, the city&#x27;s popular four-term mayor, who refuses to knuckle under to Luthor&#x27;s dominance, then personally killing him once the deed is done.

As an adult, Perry&#x27;s unwitting &#x27;role&#x27; in Lena&#x27;s death motivates Luthor to have an affair with Perry&#x27;s wife Alice during a period when Perry is missing and assumed dead. Alice becomes pregnant shortly afterward, though the timing of the conception means an equal possibility of either Luthor or White being the father. The child, Jerry White, later learns his true parentage during his late teens, shortly before being killed by a local street gang he is associated with. The loss of a potential heir weighs heavily on Luthor&#x27;s mind, particularly when he is dying of cancer; while mulling over his fate, Luthor visits Jerry&#x27;s gravesite.

Luthor has shown an unusual level of compassion for Conner Kent, a hybrid clone created from the DNA of Superman and Luthor himself. After Conner&#x27;s death at the conclusion of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Luthor is shown visiting a memorial statue of Conner in Metropolis and placing flowers there. More than once Luthor addresses Conner as his son. Following Conner&#x27;s resurrection, Luthor is shocked and decides to locate him. When Brainiac accuses him of showing paternal feelings for Conner though, Luthor denies it, saying that he only wants his property back, and has no fatherly feelings towards Superboy. After Superboy and Luthor visit Lena, Luthor makes it clear he now sees Kon-El as an inherently &quot;failed experiment&quot; due to having 50% &quot;wrong alien DNA.&quot; Luthor then works with Brainiac to create a binary clone with their own genetics, a possible threat to Superboy.

Lena Luthor was revealed to have mothered a daughter named Lori Luthor, making her Lex Luthor&#x27;s niece.

In the alternate future timeline of &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot;, Conner becomes an uncompromising and dictatorial successor to Superman, while Luthor acts as a caring, father figure to him.

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Lex Luthor&#x27;s father Lionel Luthor is revealed to have died of an allergic reaction to his medicine during Clark Kent&#x27;s days as Superboy. He is temporarily reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps and attacks Lex. Following &quot;Blackest Night&#x27;&quot;, Luthor creates a gynoid version of Lois Lane using Brainiac technology. His primary purpose for creating her was to have a companion who would voice honest opinions and provide an extra voice of reason to counsel him on his obsessive quest for the Black Lantern energy. Luthor also had a pseudo-romantic relationship with the &quot;Loisbot&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Lex Luthor has the physical capabilities of a normal adult human with no metahuman abilities. However, for virtually his entire publication history, he has been depicted as the most intelligent human in the DC Universe, and one of the most intelligent beings of any planet. He possesses an eidetic memory and has mastered seemingly every known form of science, including space travel, extra-dimensional travel, biochemistry, robotics, nanotechnology, computer engineering, synthetic polymers, communication technologies, genetic mutation, holography, energy generation, spectral analysis, and time travel. With the exception of the extraterrestrial entity known as Brainiac (and occasionally Batman), Luthor does not view any other being as an intellectual peer. His exceptional intellectual gifts act as his &quot;superpowers&quot;, allowing him to craft advanced weapons and equipment, outthink opponents much stronger and more powerful than himself, and manipulate others into doing his bidding.

His genius also extends to business (he is one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people) and politics (he was elected U.S. president, and he is often the leader of super-villain groups he has belonged to). When posing as Lex Luthor II, Luthor is granted a peaked physical condition and has been trained in hand-to-hand combat, specifically Karate, which he continued even after he reverted to his true age. He has also been occasionally trained by rogue Amazons of Themyscira.

===Weaponry===
Over the years, Luthor has created (either on his own, using alien technology he acquires, or with the resources of LexCorp and the military) many highly advanced weapons, machines, and robots to carry out his plans or destroy his enemies. He has made liberal use of kryptonite weapons capable of injuring Superman and other Kryptonians, and he has often created synthetic kryptonite (not as lethal as real green kryptonite but still capable of weakening a Kryptonian). Since the Bronze Age, he has also utilized various high-tech &quot;war-suits&quot; in many stories. The first warsuit, introduced in 1983, was a product of lost science from an earlier age in the planet Lexor&#x27;s history when technology was highly advanced. Its Lexorian materials can withstand several attacks by Superman before sustaining damage and its force field offers further protection still. Wearing it grants Lex great superhuman strength, not equal to Superman but still enough to overpower many of Earth&#x27;s heroes. The suit can deliver powerful energy blasts and a molecular sheath capable of blocking Superman&#x27;s body from absorbing energy from solar radiation, meaning his powers will weaken over time. Powered by red solar radiation, the suit can also deliver red solar beams to directly weaken Superman. The suit has other features including advanced sensor systems, a hypnotism weapon, and illusion casting technology.

The warsuit introduced in 2004 is built with technology from Apokolips, granting greater superhuman strength and resistance to injury, a powerful force field, flight, electrical weapons, and a variety of kryptonite-based weaponry such as energy cannons, axes, and a collapsible sword. Its power is great enough that Luthor could fly for several days without interruption. The gauntlets hold different forms of kryptonite stones. After reality is altered by &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, Luthor uses a new warsuit similar to the 2004 one but slimmer and built by reverse-engineering Kryptonian technology. When he temporarily attempts to act as a hero and works alongside the Justice League, Luthor uses a similar warsuit with non-lethal weaponry and no kryptonite-based features.

Luthor often wore a kryptonite ring on his right hand in Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; stories, but abandoned this tactic after prolonged exposure to its radiation resulted in cancer, requiring him to transplant his brain into a cloned body to survive. While masquerading as his own son Lex Luthor II, Lex occasionally wore high-tech &quot;LX-20 body armor.&quot;

During the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; crossover, he wore an orange power ring of avarice created by Ganthet, a former member of the Guardians of the Universe.

== LexCorp / LuthorCorp ==
LexCorp is the fictional organized crime company owned by Luthor. The company is based in Metropolis and is headquartered in LexCorp Tower.

The establishment of LexCorp by Lex Luthor is a stark departure from earlier portrayals of the company&#x27;s founder, transitioning the character from a warlord and would-be dictator into a power-mad business magnate. LexCorp was founded primarily to serve as a front to Lex Luthor&#x27;s criminal enterprise while simultaneously being a symbol of Luthor&#x27;s victory over Superman, as Luthor values defeating Superman over financial gain (illustrated by abandoning a hollow victory after plundering Fort Knox). Luthor intends to convert LexCorp into a legitimate operation after his retirement from crime, and in the future it is shown being a highly successful non-criminal enterprise, to Superman&#x27;s pleasure.

LexCorp was originally organized as an aerospace engineering firm started in the top floor offices of the Daily Planet building in Metropolis, and has since become one of the world&#x27;s largest, most diversified multinational conglomerates.

The company grew by acquisition, starting with struggling airlines &quot;Inter-Continental Airlines&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Coast Air Systems&quot;, renaming them to &quot;LexAir&quot;. When rising profits were threatened by fuel shortages, LexCorp bought out Southwestern Petroleum and renamed it &quot;LexOil&quot;. This pattern of acquisition continued to include the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and several Metropolis businesses before LexCorp sold the unprofitable &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and its building to TransNational Enterprises, establishing an L-shaped 96-story high-rise as its new headquarters.

LexCorp grew rapidly into a diverse international conglomerate with interests in utilities, waste management, industrial manufacturing, computer hardware and software, chemicals, retail, bio-engineering, weapons, pharmaceuticals, oil, communications, airlines, real estate, hotels, restaurants, technology, media, financial services, robotics, security, transportation, satellites, stock brokerage houses, cash businesses, and food. By the timeframe of the Alliance invasion it was estimated that LexCorp either directly or indirectly employed nearly two-thirds of Metropolis&#x27; population of 11 million people, dominating commerce around much of the world. Among those many subsidiaries are such diverse businesses as Advanced Research Laboratories, Secur-Corp Armored Car Service, North American Robotics, Hell&#x27;s Gate Disposal Services, and the Good Foods Group, owners of Ralli&#x27;s Family Restaurants, Big Belly Burger and the Koul-Brau Breweries. LexCorp&#x27;s major subsidiary companies include LexComp, LexChemical, LexEl Investments, LexMart, LexComm, FedLex, LexOil, LexAir, and TelLex.

When Luthor became President of the United States, he divested from LexCorp to avoid a conflict of interest and appointed Talia al Ghul as the company&#x27;s CEO. Talia donated a large portion of its profits to the Wayne Foundation during Superman and Batman&#x27;s year-long absences. Following his dismissal as president he fired her and took back his place, though she secretly kept a portion of stock.

Competitors include Wayne Enterprises, Kord Enterprises, Queen Industries and S.T.A.R. Labs. LexCorp provides sponsorship to the superhero team The Conglomerate along with American Steel, Dante Foods, Dupree Chemical, Ferris Aircraft, S.T.A.R. Labs, Ovel Oil, Pax Entertainment, and Stagg Enterprises.

Following Luthor&#x27;s public acquittal from criminal charges Lana Lang became LexCorp&#x27;s new CEO and LexCorp began its decline. Lana Lang was dismissed from her post due to a contractual clause in all LexCorp employment charters forbidding aiding Superman in any way, after she attempted to use a LexCorp security unit to aid Superman in a battle against Atlas.

A year after the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Lex Luthor had been stripped of his wealth and assets; LexCorp was dissolved and sold off to several competitors, most notably to Wayne Enterprises.

Lex Luthor secretly owns the powerful and legitimate Thunder Corporation which he controls through a false identity, maintaining the illusion of the chairman/principal stockholder &quot;Lucius D. Tommytown&quot; through fake magazine articles and actors because he thought himself too honest to be anything but a criminal. The Thunder Corporation headquarters &quot;Zephrymore Building&quot; fronts Lex Luthor&#x27;s criminal operations and penthouse.

<text>A lute ( or ) is any plucked string instrument with a neck and a deep round back enclosing a hollow cavity, usually with a sound hole or opening in the body. It may be either fretted or unfretted.

More specifically, the term &quot;lute&quot; commonly refers to an instrument from the family of European lutes which were themselves influenced by Indian short-necked lutes in Gandhara which became the predecessor of the Islamic, the Sino-Japanese and the European lute families. The term also refers generally to any necked string instrument having the strings running in a plane parallel to the sound table (in the Hornbostel–Sachs system).

The strings are attached to pegs or posts at the end of the neck, which have some type of turning mechanism to enable the player to tighten the tension on the string or loosen the tension before playing (which respectively raise or lower the pitch of a string), so that each string is tuned to a specific pitch (or note). The lute is plucked or strummed with one hand while the other hand &quot;frets&quot; (presses down) the strings on the neck&#x27;s fingerboard. By pressing the strings on different places of the fingerboard, the player can shorten or lengthen the part of the string that is vibrating, thus producing higher or lower pitches (notes).

The European lute and the modern Near-Eastern &quot;oud&quot; descend from a common ancestor via diverging evolutionary paths. The lute is used in a great variety of instrumental music from the Medieval to the late Baroque eras and was the most important instrument for secular music in the Renaissance. During the Baroque music era, the lute was used as one of the instruments that played the &quot;basso continuo&quot; accompaniment parts. It is also an accompanying instrument in vocal works. The lute player either improvises (&quot;realizes&quot;) a chordal accompaniment based on the figured bass part, or plays a written-out accompaniment (both music notation and tablature (&quot;tab&quot;) are used for lute). As a small instrument, the lute produces a relatively quiet sound. The player of a lute is called a &quot;lutenist&quot;, &quot;lutanist&quot; or &quot;lutist&quot;, and a maker of lutes (or any similar string instrument, or violin family instruments) is referred to as a &quot;luthier&quot;.

== History and evolution of the lute ==
===First lutes===


Curt Sachs defined &quot;lute&quot; in the terminology section of &quot;The History of Musical Instruments&quot; as &quot;composed of a body, and of a neck which serves both as a handle and as a means of stretching the strings beyond the body&quot;. His definition focused on body and neck characteristics and not on the way the strings were sounded, so the fiddle counted as a &quot;bowed lute&quot;. Sachs also distinguished between the &quot;long-necked lute&quot; and the short-necked variety. The short-necked variety contained most of our modern instruments, &quot;lutes, guitars, hurdy-gurdies and the entire family of viols and violins&quot;.

The long lutes were the more ancient lutes; the &quot;Arabic tanbūr... faithfully preserved the outer appearance of the ancient lutes of Babylonia and Egypt&quot;. He further categorized long lutes with a &quot;pierced lute&quot; and &quot;long neck lute&quot;. The &quot;pierced lute&quot; had a neck made from a stick that pierced the body (as in the ancient Egyptian long-neck lutes, and the modern African gunbrī).

The &quot;long lute&quot; had an attached neck, and included the sitar, tanbur and tar: the dutār had two strings, setār three strings, čārtār four strings, pančtār five strings.

Sachs&#x27;s book is from 1941, and the archaeological evidence available to him placed the early lutes at about 2000 BC. Discoveries since then have pushed the existence of the lute back to .

Musicologist Richard Dumbrill today uses the word lute more categorically to discuss instruments that existed millennia before the term &quot;lute&quot; was coined. Dumbrill documented more than 3,000 years of iconographic evidence of the lutes in Mesopotamia, in his book &quot;The Archaeomusicology of the Ancient Near East&quot;. According to Dumbrill, the lute family included instruments in Mesopotamia before 3000 BC. He points to a cylinder seal as evidence; dating from about 3100 BC or earlier and now in the possession of the British Museum, the seal depicts on one side what is thought to be a woman playing a stick &quot;lute&quot;. Like Sachs, Dumbrill saw length as distinguishing lutes, dividing the Mesopotamian lutes into a long variety and a short. His book does not cover the shorter instruments that became the European lute, beyond showing examples of shorter lutes in the ancient world. He focuses on the longer lutes of Mesopotamia, various types of necked chordophones that developed throughout the ancient world: Indian (Gandhara and others), Greek, Egyptian (in the Middle Kingdom), Iranian (Elamite and others), Jewish/Israelite, Hittite, Roman, Bulgar, Turkic, Chinese, Armenian/Cilician cultures. He names among the long lutes, the pandura and the tanbur

The line of short-necked lutes was further developed to the east of Mesopotamia, in Bactria and Gandhara, into a short, almond-shaped lute. Curt Sachs talked about the depictions of Gandharan lutes in art, where they are presented in a mix of &quot;Northwest Indian art&quot; under &quot;strong Greek influences&quot;. The short-necked lutes in these Gandhara artworks were &quot;the venerable ancestor of the Islamic, the Sino-Japanese and the European lute families&quot;. He described the Gandhara lutes as having a &quot;pear-shaped body tapering towards the short neck, a frontal stringholder, lateral pegs, and either four or five strings&quot;.

===Persian barbat===

Bactria and Gandhara became part of the Sasanian Empire (224–651). Under the Sasanians, a short almond-shaped lute from Bactria came to be called the barbat or barbud, which was developed into the later Islamic world&#x27;s &quot;oud&quot; or &quot;ud&quot;. When the Moors conquered Andalusia in 711, they brought their ud or quitra along, into a country that had already known a lute tradition under the Romans, the pandura.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, many musicians and artists from across the Islamic world flocked to Iberia. Among them was Abu l-Hasan &#x27;Ali Ibn Nafi&#x27; (789–857), a prominent musician, who had trained under Ishaq al-Mawsili (d. 850) in Baghdad and was exiled to Andalusia before 833. He taught and has been credited with adding a fifth string to his oud and with establishing one of the first schools of music in Córdoba.

By the 11th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to Provence, influencing French troubadours and trouvères and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. While Europe developed the lute, the &quot;oud&quot; remained a central part of Arab music, and broader Ottoman music, undergoing a range of transformations.

Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain (Andalusia) by the Moors, another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians. There were singer-lutenists at the court in Palermo after the Norman conquest of the island from the Muslims, and the lute is depicted extensively in the ceiling paintings in the Palermo&#x27;s royal Cappella Palatina, dedicated by the Norman King Roger II of Sicily in 1140. His Hohenstaufen grandson Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (1194–1250) continued integrating Muslims into his court, including Moorish musicians. Frederick II made visits to the Lech valley and Bavaria between 1218 and 1237 with a &quot;Moorish Sicilian retinue&quot;. By the 14th century, lutes had spread throughout Italy and, probably because of the cultural influence of the Hohenstaufen kings and emperor, based in Palermo, the lute had also made significant inroads into the German-speaking lands. By 1500, the valley and Füssen had several lute-making families, and in the next two centuries the area hosted &quot;famous names of 16th and 17th century lutemaking&quot;.

Although the major entry of the short lute was in Western Europe, leading to a variety of lute styles, the short lute entered Europe in the East as well; as early as the sixth century, the Bulgars brought the short-necked variety of the instrument called komuz to the Balkans.

=== From Middle Ages to Baroque ===

Medieval lutes were four- and five-course instruments, plucked with a quill as a plectrum. There were several sizes and, by the end of the Renaissance, seven sizes (up to the great octave bass) are documented. Song accompaniment was probably the lute&#x27;s primary function in the Middle Ages, but very little music securely attributable to the lute survives from before 1500. Medieval and early-Renaissance song accompaniments were probably mostly improvised, hence the lack of written records.

In the last few decades of the fifteenth century, to play Renaissance polyphony on a single instrument, lutenists gradually abandoned the quill in favor of plucking the instrument with the fingers. The number of courses grew to six and beyond. The lute was the premier solo instrument of the sixteenth century, but continued to accompany singers as well.

About 1500, many Iberian lutenists adopted vihuela de mano, a viol-shaped instrument tuned like the lute; both instruments continued in coexistence. This instrument also found its way to parts of Italy that were under Spanish domination (especially Sicily and the papal states under the Borgia pope Alexander VI who brought many Catalan musicians to Italy), where it was known as the viola da mano.

By the end of the Renaissance, the number of courses had grown to ten, and during the Baroque era the number continued to grow until it reached 14 (and occasionally as many as 19). These instruments, with up to 35 strings, required innovations in the structure of the lute. At the end of the lute&#x27;s evolution the archlute, theorbo and torban had long extensions attached to the main tuning head to provide a greater resonating length for the bass strings, and since human fingers are not long enough to stop strings across a neck wide enough to hold 14 courses, the bass strings were placed outside the fretboard, and were played &quot;open&quot;, i.e., without pressing them against the fingerboard with the left hand. &quot;The lute is a very fragile instrument and so, although there are many surviving old lutes, very few with their original soundboards are in playable condition,&quot; which makes the Rauwolf Lute so notable.

Over the course of the Baroque era, the lute was increasingly relegated to the continuo accompaniment, and was eventually superseded in that role by keyboard instruments. The lute almost fell out of use after 1800. Some sorts of lute were still used for some time in Germany, Sweden, and Ukraine.

== Etymology ==
The words &quot;lute&quot; and &quot;oud&quot; possibly derive from Arabic &quot;al-ʿoud&quot; (- literally means &quot;the wood&quot;). It may refer to the wooden plectrum traditionally used for playing the oud, to the thin strips of wood used for the back, or to the wooden soundboard that distinguished it from similar instruments with skin-faced bodies.

Many theories have been proposed for the origin of the Arabic name. Music scholar Eckhard Neubauer suggested that &quot;oud&quot; may be an Arabic borrowing from the Persian word &quot;rōd&quot; or &quot;rūd&quot;, which meant string. Another researcher, archaeomusicologist Richard J. Dumbrill, suggests that &quot;rud&quot; came from the Sanskrit &quot;rudrī&quot; (रुद्री, meaning &quot;string instrument&quot;) and transferred to Arabic and European languages by way of a Semitic language. However another theory, according to Semitic language scholars, is that the Arabic &quot;ʿoud&quot; is derived from Syriac &quot;ʿoud-a&quot;, meaning &quot;wooden stick&quot; and &quot;burning wood&quot;—cognate to Biblical Hebrew &quot;&#x27;ūḏ&quot;, referring to a stick used to stir logs in a fire. Henry George Farmer notes the similarity between &quot; &quot;and &quot;al-ʿawda&quot; (&quot;the return&quot; – of bliss).

== Construction ==
=== Soundboard ===

Lutes are made almost entirely of wood. The soundboard is a teardrop-shaped thin flat plate of resonant wood (typically spruce). In all lutes the soundboard has a single (sometimes triple) decorated sound hole under the strings called the &quot;rose&quot;. The sound hole is not open, but rather covered with a grille in the form of an intertwining vine or a decorative knot, carved directly out of the wood of the soundboard.

The geometry of the lute soundboard is relatively complex, involving a system of barring that places braces perpendicular to the strings at specific lengths along the overall length of the belly, the ends of which are angled to abut the ribs on either side for structural reasons. Robert Lundberg, in his book &quot;Historical Lute Construction&quot;, suggests ancient builders placed bars according to whole-number ratios of the scale length and belly length. He further suggests the inward bend of the soundboard (the &quot;belly scoop&quot;) is a deliberate adaptation by ancient builders to afford the lutenist&#x27;s right hand more space between the strings and soundboard.

Soundboard thickness varies, but generally hovers between . Some luthiers tune the belly as they build, removing mass and adapting bracing to produce desirable sonic results. The lute belly is almost never finished, but in some cases the luthier may size the top with a very thin coat of shellac or glair to help keep it clean. The belly joins directly to the rib, without a lining glued to the sides, and a cap and counter cap are glued to the inside and outside of the bottom end of the bowl to provide rigidity and increased gluing surface.

After joining the top to the sides, a half-binding is usually installed around the edge of the soundboard. The half-binding is approximately half the thickness of the soundboard and is usually made of a contrasting color wood. The rebate for the half-binding must be extremely precise to avoid compromising structural integrity.

===Back===

The &quot;back&quot; or the shell is assembled from thin strips of hardwood (maple, cherry, ebony, rosewood, gran, wood and/or other tonewoods) called &quot;ribs&quot;, joined (with glue) edge to edge to form a deep rounded body for the instrument. There are braces inside on the soundboard to give it strength.

===Neck===
The &quot;neck&quot; is made of light wood, with a veneer of hardwood (usually ebony) to provide durability for the &quot;fretboard&quot; beneath the strings. Unlike most modern stringed instruments, the lute&#x27;s fretboard is mounted flush with the top. The &quot;pegbox&quot; for lutes before the Baroque era was angled back from the neck at almost 90° (see image), presumably to help hold the low-tension strings firmly against the &quot;nut&quot; which, traditionally, is not glued in place but is held in place by string pressure only. The &quot;tuning pegs&quot; are simple pegs of hardwood, somewhat tapered, that are held in place by friction in holes drilled through the pegbox.

As with other instruments that use friction pegs, the wood for the pegs is crucial. As the wood suffers dimensional changes through age and loss of humidity, it must retain a reasonably circular cross-section to function properly—as there are no gears or other mechanical aids for tuning the instrument. Often pegs were made from suitable fruitwoods such as European pearwood, or equally dimensionally stable analogues. Matheson, 1720, said, &quot;If a lute-player has lived eighty years, he has surely spent sixty years tuning.&quot;

===Bridge===
The bridge, sometimes made of a fruitwood, is attached to the soundboard typically between a fifth and a seventh of the belly length. It does not have a separate saddle but has holes bored into it to which the strings attach directly. The bridge is made so that it tapers in height and length, with the small end holding the trebles and the higher and wider end carrying the basses. Bridges are often colored black with carbon black in a binder, often shellac and often have inscribed decoration. The scrolls or other decoration on the ends of lute bridges are integral to the bridge, and are not added afterwards as on some Renaissance guitars (cf Joachim Tielke&#x27;s guitars).

===Frets===
The frets are made of loops of gut tied around the neck. They fray with use, and must be replaced from time to time. A few additional partial frets of wood are usually glued to the body of the instrument, to allow stopping the highest-pitched courses up to a full octave higher than the open string, though these are considered anachronistic by some (though John Dowland and Thomas Robinson describe the practice of gluing wooden frets onto the soundboard). Given the choice between nylon and gut, many luthiers prefer to use gut, as it conforms more readily to the sharp angle at the edge of the fingerboard.

===Strings===
Strings were historically made of animal gut, usually from the small intestine of sheep (sometimes in combination with metal) and are still made of gut or a synthetic substitute, with metal windings on the lower-pitched strings. Modern manufacturers make both gut and nylon strings, and both are in common use. Gut is more authentic for playing period pieces, though unfortunately it is also more susceptible to irregularity and pitch instability owing to changes in humidity. Nylon offers greater tuning stability, but is seen as anachronistic by purists, as its timbre differs from the sound of earlier gut strings. Such concerns are moot when more recent compositions for the lute are performed.

Of note are the &quot;catlines&quot; used as basses on historical instruments. Catlines are several gut strings wound together and soaked in heavy metal solutions to increase the string mass. Catlines can be quite large in diameter compared to wound nylon strings of the same pitch. They produce a bass that differs somewhat in timbre from nylon basses.

The lute&#x27;s strings are arranged in &quot;courses&quot;, of two strings each, though the highest-pitched course usually consists of only a single string, called the &quot;chanterelle&quot;. In later Baroque lutes, two upper courses are single. The courses are numbered sequentially, counting from the highest pitched, so that the &quot;chanterelle&quot; is the &quot;first course&quot;, the next pair of strings is the &quot;second course&quot;, etc. Thus an 8-course Renaissance lute usually has 15 strings, and a 13-course Baroque lute has 24.

The courses are tuned in unison for high and intermediate pitches, but for lower pitches one of the two strings is tuned an octave higher (the course where this split starts changed over the history of the lute). The two strings of a course are virtually always stopped and plucked together, as if a single string—but in rare cases, a piece requires that the two strings of a course be stopped or plucked separately. The tuning of a lute is a complicated issue, described in a section of its own below. The lute&#x27;s design makes it extremely light for its size.

== Lute in the modern world ==
The lute enjoyed a revival with the awakening of interest in historical music around 1900 and throughout the century. That revival was further boosted by the early music movement in the twentieth century. Important pioneers in lute revival were Julian Bream, Hans Neemann, Walter Gerwig, Suzanne Bloch and Diana Poulton. Lute performances are now not uncommon; there are many professional lutenists, especially in Europe where the most employment is found, and new compositions for the instrument are being produced by composers.
During the early days of the early music movement, many lutes were constructed by available luthiers, whose specialty was often classical guitars. Such lutes were heavily built with construction similar to that of classical guitars, with fan bracing, heavy tops, fixed frets, and lined sides, all of which are anachronistic to historical lutes. As lutherie scholarship increased, makers began constructing instruments based on historical models, which have proven lighter and more responsive instruments.

Lutes built at present are invariably replicas or near copies of those surviving historical instruments that are in museums or private collections. Many are custom-built, but there is a growing number of luthiers who build lutes for general sale, and there is a fairly strong, if small, second-hand market. Because of this fairly limited market, lutes are generally more expensive than mass-produced modern instruments. Factory-made guitars and violins, for example, can be purchased more cheaply than low-end lutes, while at the highest level of modern instruments, guitars and violins tend to command the higher prices.

Unlike in the past, there are many types of lutes encountered today: 5-course medieval lutes, renaissance lutes of 6 to 10 courses in many pitches for solo and ensemble performance of Renaissance works, the archlute of Baroque works, 11-course lutes in d-minor tuning for 17th-century French, German and Czech music, 13/14-course d-minor tuned German Baroque Lutes for later High Baroque and Classical music, theorbo for basso continuo parts in Baroque ensembles, gallichons/mandoras, bandoras, orpharions and others.

Lutenistic practice has reached considerable heights in recent years, thanks to a growing number of world-class lutenists: Rolf Lislevand, Hopkinson Smith, Paul O&#x27;Dette, Christopher Wilke, Andreas Martin, Robert Barto, Eduardo Egüez, Edin Karamazov, Nigel North, Christopher Wilson, Luca Pianca, Yasunori Imamura, Anthony Bailes, Peter Croton, Xavier Diaz-Latorre, Evangelina Mascardi and Jakob Lindberg. Singer-songwriter Sting has also played lute and archlute, in and out of his collaborations with Edin Karamazov, and Jan Akkerman released two albums of lute music in the 1970s while he was a guitarist in the Dutch rock band Focus. Lutenist/Composer Jozef van Wissem composed the soundtrack to the Jim Jarmusch film &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot;.

== Repertoire ==

Lutes were in widespread use in Europe at least since the 13th century, and documents mention numerous early performers and composers. However, the earliest surviving lute music dates from the late 15th century. Lute music flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries: numerous composers published collections of their music, and modern scholars have uncovered a vast number of manuscripts from the era—however, much of the music is still lost. In the second half of the 17th century lutes, vihuelas and similar instruments started losing popularity, and little music was written for the instrument after 1750. The interest in lute music was revived only in the second half of the 20th century.

Improvisation (making up music on the spot) was, apparently, an important aspect of lute performance, so much of the repertoire was probably never written down. Furthermore, it was only around 1500 that lute players began to transition from plectrum to plucking. That change facilitated complex polyphony, which required that they develop notation. In the next hundred years, three schools of tablature notation gradually developed: Italian (also used in Spain), German, and French. Only the last survived into the late 17th century. The earliest known tablatures are for a six-stringed instrument, though evidence of earlier four- and five-stringed lutes exists. Tablature notation depends on the actual instrument the music is written for. To read it, a musician must know the instrument&#x27;s tuning, number of strings, etc.

Renaissance and Baroque forms of lute music are similar to keyboard music of the periods. Intabulations of vocal works were very common, as well as various dances, some of which disappeared during the 17th century, such as the piva and the saltarello. The advent of polyphony brought about &quot;fantasias&quot;: complex, intricate pieces with much use of imitative counterpoint. The improvisatory element, present to some degree in most lute pieces, is particularly evident in the early ricercares (not imitative as their later namesakes, but completely free), as well as in numerous preludial forms: preludes, tastar de corde (&quot;testing the strings&quot;), etc. During the 17th century keyboard and lute music went hand in hand, and by 1700 lutenists were writing suites of dances quite akin to those of keyboard composers. The lute was also used throughout its history as an ensemble instrument—most frequently in songs for voice and lute, which were particularly popular in Italy (see frottola) and England.

The earliest surviving lute music is Italian, from a late 15th-century manuscript. The early 16th century saw Petrucci&#x27;s publications of lute music by Francesco Spinacino ( 1507) and Joan Ambrosio Dalza ( 1508); together with the so-called Capirola Lutebook, these represent the earliest stage of written lute music in Italy. The leader of the next generation of Italian lutenists, Francesco Canova da Milano (1497–1543), is now acknowledged as one of the most famous lute composers in history. The bigger part of his output consists of pieces called fantasias or ricercares, in which he makes extensive use of imitation and sequence, expanding the scope of lute polyphony. In the early 17th century Johannes Hieronymus Kapsberger ( 1580–1651) and Alessandro Piccinini (1566–1638) revolutionized the instrument&#x27;s technique and Kapsberger, possibly, influenced the keyboard music of Girolamo Frescobaldi.

French written lute music began, as far as we know, with Pierre Attaingnant&#x27;s ( 1494 – 1551) prints, which comprised preludes, dances and intabulations. Particularly important was the Italian composer Albert de Rippe (1500–1551), who worked in France and composed polyphonic fantasias of considerable complexity. His work was published posthumously by his pupil, Guillaume de Morlaye (born 1510), who, however, did not pick up the complex polyphony of de Rippe. French lute music declined during the second part of the 16th century; however, various changes to the instrument (the increase of diapason strings, new tunings, etc.) prompted an important change in style that led, during the early Baroque, to the celebrated style brisé: broken, arpeggiated textures that influenced Johann Jakob Froberger&#x27;s suites. The French Baroque school is exemplified by composers such as Ennemond Gaultier (1575–1651), Denis Gaultier (1597/1603–1672), François Dufaut (before 1604 – before 1672) and many others. The last stage of French lute music is exemplified by Robert de Visée ( 1655–1732/3), whose suites exploit the instrument&#x27;s possibilities to the fullest.

The history of German written lute music started with Arnolt Schlick ( 1460–after 1521), who, in 1513, published a collection of pieces that included 14 voice and lute songs, and three solo lute pieces, alongside organ works. He was not the first important German lutenist, because contemporaries credited Conrad Paumann ( 1410–1473) with the invention of German lute tablature, though this claim remains unproven, and no lute works by Paumann survive. After Schlick, a string of composers developed German lute music: Hans Judenkünig ( 1445/50 – 1526), the Neusidler family (particularly Hans Neusidler ( 1508/09 – 1563)) and others. During the second half of the 16th century, German tablature and German repertoire were gradually replaced by Italian and French tablature and international repertoire, respectively, and the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) effectively stopped publications for half a century. German lute music was revived much later by composers such as Esaias Reusner ( 1670), however, a distinctly German style came only after 1700 in the works of Silvius Leopold Weiss (1686–1750), one of the greatest lute composers, some of whose works were transcribed for keyboard by none other than Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), who composed a few pieces for the lute himself (though it is unclear whether they were really intended for the lute, rather than another plucked string instrument or the lautenwerk).

Of other European countries, particularly important are England and Spain. English-written lute music began only around 1540; however, the country produced numerous lutenists, of which John Dowland (1563–1626) is perhaps the most famous. His influence spread very far: variations on his themes were written by keyboard composers in Germany decades after his death. Dowland&#x27;s predecessors and colleagues, such as Anthony Holborne ( 1545–1602) and Daniel Bacheler (1572–1619), were less known. Spanish composers wrote mostly for the vihuela; their main genres were polyphonic fantasias and (variations). Luys Milan (c. 1500 – after 1560) and Luys de Narváez ( 1526–1549) were particularly important for their contributions to the development of lute polyphony in Spain.

Finally, perhaps the most influential European lute composer was the Hungarian Bálint Bakfark ( 1526/30–1576), whose contrapuntal fantasias were much more difficult and tighter than those of his Western European contemporaries.

Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s famous orchestral suites called &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot; are drawn from various books and articles on 16th- and 17th-century lute music transcribed by the musicologist Oscar Chilesotti, including eight pieces from a German manuscript &quot;Da un Codice Lauten-Buch&quot;, now in a private library in northern Italy.

== 20th century revival and composers ==
The revival of lute-playing in the 20th century has its roots in the pioneering work of Arnold Dolmetsch (1858–1940); whose research into early music and instruments started the movement for authenticity. The revival of the lute gave composers an opportunity to create new works for it.

One of the first such composers was Johann Nepomuk David in Germany. Composer Vladimir Vavilov was a pioneer of the lute revival in the USSR, he was also the author of numerous musical hoaxes. Sandor Kallos and Toyohiko Satoh applied modernist idiom to the lute, Elena Kats-Chernin, Jozef van Wissem and Alexandre Danilevsky minimalist and post-minimalist idiom, Roman Turovsky-Savchuk, Paulo Galvão, Robert MacKillop historicist idiom, and Ronn McFarlane New Age. This active movement by early music specialists has inspired composers in different fields; for example, in 1980, Akira Ifukube, a classical and film composer best known for the Godzilla&#x27;s theme, wrote the Fantasia for Baroque Lute with the historical tablature notation, rather than the modern staff one.

== Tuning conventions ==

Lutes were made in a large variety of sizes, with varying numbers of strings/courses, and with no permanent standard for tuning. However, the following seems to have been &quot;generally&quot; true of the Renaissance lute.

A 6-course Renaissance tenor lute would be tuned to the same intervals as a tenor viol, with intervals of a &quot;perfect fourth&quot; between all the courses except the third and fourth, which differed only by a &quot;major third&quot;. The tenor lute was usually tuned nominally &quot;in G&quot; (there was no pitch standard before the 20th century), named after the pitch of the highest course, yielding the pattern from the lowest course to the highest. (Much renaissance lute music can be played on a guitar by tuning the guitar&#x27;s third string down by a half tone.)
For lutes with more than six courses, the extra courses would be added on the low end. Because of the large number of strings, lutes have very wide necks, and it is difficult to stop strings beyond the sixth course, so additional courses were usually tuned to pitches useful as bass notes rather than continuing the regular pattern of fourths, and these lower courses are most often played without stopping. Thus an 8-course tenor Renaissance lute would be tuned to , and a 10-course to .

However, none of these patterns were &quot;de rigueur&quot;, and a modern lutenist occasionally retunes one or more courses between pieces. Manuscripts bear instructions for the player, e.g., &quot;7e chœur en fa&quot; = &quot;seventh course in &quot;fa&quot;&quot; (= F in the standard C scale).

The early 17th century was a period of considerable development for the lute, particularly with new tuning schemes developed in France. At this time French lutenists began to explore the expressive capabilities of the lute through experimentation in tuning schemes on the instrument. Today these tunings are often labeled as transitional tunings or Accords nouveaux (French: “new tunings”). Transitional tunings document the transition from the established Renaissance lute tuning, to the later established Baroque d-minor tuning scheme. 

This development in tuning is credited to French lutenists of the early 17th century, who began increasing the number of major or minor thirds on the adjacent open strings of the 10-course lute. As a result the French lutenist found a more sonorous sound and increased sympathetic vibration on the instrument. This led to new compositional styles and playing techniques on the instrument, most notably the Style brisé (French: &quot;broken style&quot;). Manuscript sources from the first half of the 17th century provide evidence that French transitional tunings gained popularity and were adopted across much of continental Europe. 

The most used transitional tunings during this time were known as the &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;flat&quot; tunings. Read from the tenth to the first course on a 10-course lute, the sharp tuning reads: C, D, E, F, G, C, F, A, C, E. The flat tuning reads, C, Db, Eb, F, G, C, F, Ab, C, Eb.
However, by around 1670 the scheme known today as the &quot;Baroque&quot; or &quot;D minor&quot; tuning became the norm, at least in France and in northern and central Europe. In this case, the first six courses outline a d-minor triad, and an additional five to seven courses are tuned generally scalewise below them. Thus the 13-course lute played by composer Sylvius Leopold Weiss would have been tuned or with sharps or flats on the lower 7 courses appropriate to the key of the piece.

Modern lutenists tune to a variety of pitch standards, ranging from A = 392 to 470 Hz, depending on the type of instrument they are playing, the repertory, the pitch of other instruments in an ensemble and other performing expediencies. No attempt at a universal pitch standard existed during the period of the lute&#x27;s historical popularity. The standards varied over time and from place to place.

<text>Little Boy was a type of atomic bomb created by the United States as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II. The name is also often used to describe the specific bomb (L-11) used in the bombing of the Japanese city of Hiroshima by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress &quot;Enola Gay&quot; on 6 August 1945, making it the first nuclear weapon used in warfare, and the second nuclear explosion in history, after the Trinity nuclear test. It exploded with an energy of approximately and had an explosion radius of approximately which caused widespread death across the city. It was a gun-type fission weapon which used uranium that had been enriched in the isotope uranium-235 to power its explosive reaction. 

Little Boy was developed by Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch&#x27;s group at the Los Alamos Laboratory. It was the successor to a plutonium-fueled gun-type fission design, Thin Man, which was abandoned in 1944 after technical difficulties were discovered. Little Boy used a charge of nitrocellulose to fire a hollow cylinder (the &quot;bullet&quot;) of highly enriched uranium through an artillery gun barrel into a solid cylinder (the &quot;target&quot;) of the same material. The design was highly inefficient: the weapon used on Hiroshima contained of uranium, but less than a kilogram underwent nuclear fission. Unlike the implosion design developed for the Trinity test and the Fat Man bomb design that was used against Nagasaki, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the simpler but inefficient gun-type design was considered almost certain to work, and was never tested prior to its use at Hiroshima.

After the war, numerous components for additional Little Boy bombs were built. By 1950, at least five weapons were completed; all were retired by November 1950.

==Naming the bomb==
There are two primary accounts of how the first atomic bombs got their names. Los Alamos Laboratory and Project Alberta physicist Robert Serber stated, many decades after the fact, that he had named the first two atomic bomb designs during World War II based on their shapes: Thin Man and Fat Man. The &quot;Thin Man&quot; was a long, thin device, and its name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel and series of movies about &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. The &quot;Fat Man&quot; was round and fat so it was named after Kasper Gutman, a rotund character in Hammett&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, played by Sydney Greenstreet in the 1941 film version. Little Boy was named by others as an allusion to Thin Man since it was based on its design. It was also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mark I&quot; nuclear bomb design, with &quot;Mark II&quot; referring to the abandoned Thin Man, and &quot;Mark III&quot; to the &quot;Fat Man.&quot;

In September 1945, another Project Alberta physicist, Norman F. Ramsey, stated in his brief &quot;History of Project A,&quot; that the early bomb ballistic test shapes designs were referred to as &quot;Thin Man&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot; by (unspecified) &quot;Air Force representatives&quot; for &quot;security reasons,&quot; so that their communications over telephones sounded &quot;as if they were modifying a plane to carry Roosevelt (the Thin Man) and Churchill (the Fat Man),&quot; as opposed to modifying the B-29s to carry the two atomic bomb shapes as part of Project Silverplate in late 1943.

Another explanation of the names, from a classified United States Air Force history of Project Silverplate from the 1950s, implies a possible reconciliation of the two versions: that the terms &quot;Thin Man&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot; were first developed by someone at or from Los Alamos (i.e., Serber), but were consciously adopted by the officers in Silverplate when they were adopting their own codenames for their own project (including &quot;Silverplate&quot;). As Silverplate involved modifying B-29s for a secret purpose, deliberately using codenames that would align with modifying vehicles for Roosevelt and Churchill would serve their needs well.

==Development==
===Early gun-type design work===
Because of its perceived simplicity, the gun-type nuclear weapon design was the first approach pursued by the scientists working on bomb design during the Manhattan Project. In 1942, it was not yet known which of the two fissile materials pathways being simultaneously pursued—uranium-235 or plutonium-239—would be successful, or if there were significant differences between the two fuels that would impact the design work. Coordination with British scientists in May 1942 convinced the American scientists, led by J. Robert Oppenheimer, that the atomic bomb would not be difficult to design and that the difficulty would lie only in the production of fuel. Calculations in mid-1942 by theoretical physicists working on the project reinforced the idea that an ordinary artillery gun barrel would be able to impart sufficient velocity to the fissile material projectile.

Several different weapon designs, including autocatalytic assembly, a nascent version of implosion, and alternative gun designs (e.g., using high explosives as a propellent, or creating a &quot;double gun&quot; with two projectiles) were pursued in the early years of the project, while the facilities to manufacture fissile material were being constructed. The belief that the gun design would be an easy engineering task once fuel was available led to a sense of optimism at Los Alamos, although Oppenheimer established a small research group to study implosion as a fallback in early 1943. A full ordnance program for gun-design development was established by March 1943, with expertise provided by E.L. Rose, an experienced gun designer and engineer. Work was begun to study the properties of barrels, internal and external ballistics, and tampers of gun weapons. Oppenheimer led aspects of the effort, telling Rose that &quot;at the present time [May 1945] our estimates are so ill founded that I think it better for me to take responsibility for putting them forward.&quot; He soon delegated the work to Naval Captain William Sterling Parsons, who, along with Ed McMillan, Charles Critchfield, and Joseph Hirschfelder would be responsible for rendering the theory into practice.

Concern that impurities in reactor-bred plutonium would make predetonation more likely meant that much of the gun-design work was focused on the plutonium gun. To achieve high projectile velocities, the plutonium gun was long with a narrow diameter (suggesting its codename as the Thin Man) which created considerable difficulty in its ballistics dropping from aircraft and fitting it into the bomb bay of a B-29.

In early 1944, Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos received the first samples of plutonium produced from a nuclear reactor, the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Analyzing it, they discovered that the presence of the isotope plutonium-240 (Pu-240) raised the rate of spontaneous fission of the plutonium to an unacceptable amount. Previous analyses of plutonium had been made from samples created by cyclotrons and did not have as much of the contaminating isotope. If reactor-bred plutonium was used in a gun-type design, they concluded, it would predetonate, causing the weapon to destroy itself before achieving the conditions for a large-scale explosion.

=== From Thin Man to Little Boy ===
As a consequence of the discovery of the Pu-240 contamination problem, in July 1944 almost all research at Los Alamos was redirected to the implosion-type plutonium weapon, and the laboratory was entirely reorganized around the implosion problem. Work on the gun-type weapon continued under Person&#x27;s Ordnance (O) Division, for use exclusively with highly enriched uranium as a fuel. All the design, development, and technical work at Los Alamos was consolidated under Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch&#x27;s group.

In contrast to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was much simpler to design. As a high-velocity gun was no longer required, the overall length of the gun barrel could be dramatically decreased, and this allowed the weapon to fit into a B-29 bomb bay without difficulty. Though not an optimal use of fissile material compared to the implosion design, it was seen as a nearly guaranteed weapon.

The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. Manhattan District Engineer Kenneth Nichols expected on 1 May 1945 to have enriched uranium &quot;for one weapon before August 1 and a second one sometime in December&quot;, assuming the second weapon would be a gun type; designing an implosion bomb for enriched uranium was considered, and this would increase the production rate. The enriched uranium projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target was completed on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.

Although all of its components had been individually tested, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, which took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was the issue of fissile material availability. K-25 at Clinton Engineer Works was designed to produce around 30 kilograms of enriched uranium per month, and the Little Boy design used over 60 kilograms per bomb. So testing the weapon would incur a considerable delay in use of the weapon. (By comparison, B Reactor at the Hanford Site was designed to produce around 20 kilograms of plutonium per month, and each Fat Man bomb used around 6 kilograms of material.) Because of the simplicity of the gun-type design, laboratory testing could establish that its parts worked correctly on their own: for example, dummy projectiles could be shot down the gun barrel to make sure they were &quot;seated&quot; correctly onto a dummy target. Absence of a full-scale test in the implosion-type design made it much more difficult to establish whether the necessary simultaneity of compression had been achieved. While there was at least one prominent scientist (Ernest O. Lawrence) who advocated for a full-scale test, by early 1945 Little Boy was regarded as nearly a sure thing and was expected to have a higher yield than the first-generation implosion bombs.

Though Little Boy incorporated various safety mechanisms, an accidental detonation of a fully-assembled weapon was very possible. Should the bomber carrying the device crash, the hollow &quot;bullet&quot; could be driven into the &quot;target&quot; cylinder, possibly detonating the bomb from gravity alone (though tests suggested this was unlikely), but easily creating a critical mass that would release dangerous amounts of radiation. A crash of the B-29 and subsequent fire could trigger the explosives, causing the weapon to detonate. If immersed in water, the uranium components were subject to a neutron moderator effect, which would not cause an explosion but would release radioactive contamination. For this reason, pilots were advised to crash on land rather than at sea. Ultimately, Parsons opted to keep the explosives out of the Little Boy bomb until after the B-29 had taken off, to avoid the risk of a crash that could destroy or damage the military base from which the weapon was launched.

==Design==
The Little Boy was in length, in diameter and weighed approximately . The design used the gun method to explosively force a hollow sub-critical mass of enriched uranium and a solid target cylinder together into a super-critical mass, initiating a nuclear chain reaction. This was accomplished by shooting one piece of the uranium onto the other by means of four cylindrical silk bags of cordite powder. This was a widely used smokeless propellant consisting of a mixture of 65 percent nitrocellulose, 30 percent nitroglycerine, 3 percent petroleum jelly, and 2 percent carbamite that was extruded into tubular granules. This gave it a high surface area and a rapid burning area, and could attain pressures of up to . Cordite for the wartime Little Boy was sourced from Canada; propellant for post-war Little Boys was obtained from the Picatinny Arsenal. The bomb contained of enriched uranium. Most was enriched to 89% but some was only 50% uranium-235, for an average enrichment of 80%. Less than a kilogram of uranium underwent nuclear fission, and of this mass only was transformed into several forms of energy, mostly kinetic energy, but also heat and radiation.

===Assembly details===
Inside the weapon, the uranium-235 material was divided into two parts, following the gun principle: the &quot;projectile&quot; and the &quot;target&quot;. The projectile was a hollow cylinder with 60% of the total mass (). It consisted of a stack of nine uranium rings, each in diameter with a bore in the center, and a total length of , pressed together into the front end of a thin-walled projectile long. Filling in the remainder of the space behind these rings in the projectile was a tungsten carbide disc with a steel back. At ignition, the projectile slug was pushed along the , smooth-bore gun barrel. The slug &quot;insert&quot; was a 4-inch cylinder, 7 inches in length with a axial hole. The slug comprised 40% of the total fissile mass (). The insert was a stack of six washer-like uranium discs somewhat thicker than the projectile rings that were slid over a 1-inch rod. This rod then extended forward through the tungsten carbide plug, impact-absorbing anvil, and nose plug backstop, eventually protruding out of the front of the bomb casing. This entire target assembly was secured at both ends with locknuts.

When the hollow-front projectile reached the target and slid over the target insert, the assembled super-critical mass of uranium would be completely surrounded by a tamper and neutron reflector of tungsten carbide and steel, both materials having a combined mass of . Neutron initiators inside the assembly were activated by the impact of the projectile into the target.

===Counter-intuitive design===
The material was split almost in half, with at one end a group of rings of highly enriched uranium with 40% of the supercritical mass, and at the other end another group of slightly larger rings with 60% of the supercritical mass, which was fired onto the smaller group, with four polonium-beryllium neutron initiators to make the supercritical mass explode.

A hole in the center of the larger piece dispersed the mass and increased the surface area, allowing more fission neutrons to escape, thus preventing a premature chain reaction. But, for this larger, hollow piece to have minimal contact with the tungsten carbide tamper, it must be the projectile, since only the projectile&#x27;s back end was in contact with the tamper prior to detonation. The rest of the tungsten carbide tamper surrounded the sub-critical mass target cylinder (called the &quot;insert&quot; by the designers) with air space between it and the insert. This arrangement packs the maximum amount of fissile material into a gun-assembly design.

For the first fifty years after 1945, every published description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired into the center of a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the more extensive, hollow piece would be the projectile. Hollow cylinders have higher critical masses than solid pieces of fissile material, because any neutrons encountered by or generated by the material are more likely to get scattered in the air than to continue a chain reaction. The larger piece would also avoid the effects of neutron reflection from the tungsten carbide tamper until it was fully joined with the rest of the fuel. Once joined and with its neutrons reflected, the assembled fissile core would comprise more than two critical masses of uranium-235. In 2004, John Coster-Mullen, a truck driver and model maker from Illinois who had studied every photograph and document on the Hiroshima bomb to make an accurate model, corrected earlier published accounts.

===Fuze system===
The fuzing system was designed to trigger at the most destructive altitude, which calculations suggested was . It employed a three-stage interlock system:
* A timer ensured that the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the predicted fall time, to ensure the safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to the airplane pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to its internal 24-volt battery and starting the timer. At the end of the 15 seconds, the bomb would be from the aircraft, and the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.
* The purpose of the barometric stage was to delay activating the radar altimeter firing command circuit until near detonation altitude. A thin metallic membrane enclosing a vacuum chamber (a similar design is still used today in old-fashioned wall barometers) gradually deformed as ambient air pressure increased during descent. The barometric fuze was not considered accurate enough to detonate the bomb at the precise ignition height, because air pressure varies with local conditions. When the bomb reached the design height for this stage (reportedly ), the membrane closed a circuit, activating the radar altimeters. The barometric stage was added because of a worry that external radar signals might detonate the bomb too early.
* Two or more redundant radar altimeters were used to reliably detect final altitude. When the altimeters sensed the correct height, the firing switch closed, igniting the three BuOrd Mk15, Mod 1 Navy gun primers in the breech plug, which set off the charge consisting of four silk powder bags each containing of WM slotted-tube cordite. This launched the uranium projectile towards the opposite end of the gun barrel at an eventual muzzle velocity of . Approximately 10 milliseconds later the chain reaction occurred, lasting less than 1 microsecond. The radar altimeters used were modified U.S. Army Air Corps APS-13 tail warning radars, nicknamed &quot;Archie&quot;, normally used to warn a fighter pilot of another plane approaching from behind.

==Rehearsals==
The Little Boy pre-assemblies were designated L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, L-6, L-7, and L-11. Of these, L-1, L-2, L-5, and L-6 were expended in test drops. The first drop test was conducted with L-1 on 23 July 1945. It was dropped over the sea near Tinian in order to test the radar altimeter by the B-29 later known as &quot;Big Stink&quot;, piloted by Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, the commander of the 509th Composite Group. Two more drop tests over the sea were made on 24 and 25 July, using the L-2 and L-5 units in order to test all components. Tibbets was the pilot for both missions, but this time the bomber used was the one subsequently known as &quot;Jabit&quot;. L-6 was used as a dress rehearsal on 29 July. The B-29 &quot;Next Objective&quot;, piloted by Major Charles W. Sweeney, flew to Iwo Jima, where emergency procedures for loading the bomb onto a standby aircraft were practiced. This rehearsal was repeated on 31 July, but this time L-6 was reloaded onto a different B-29, &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, piloted by Tibbets, and the bomb was test dropped near Tinian. L-11 was the assembly used for the Hiroshima bomb, and was fully assembled with its nuclear fuel by 31 July.

==Bombing of Hiroshima==
Parsons, the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;″s weaponeer, was concerned about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. After takeoff, Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb&#x27;s circuits.
The bomb was dropped at approximately 08:15 (JST) on 6 August 1945. After falling for 44.4 seconds, the time and barometric triggers started the firing mechanism. The detonation happened at an altitude of . It was less powerful than the Fat Man, which was dropped on Nagasaki, but the damage and the number of victims at Hiroshima were much higher, as Hiroshima was on flat terrain, while the hypocenter of Nagasaki lay in a small valley. According to figures published in 1945, 66,000 people were killed as a direct result of the Hiroshima blast, and 69,000 were injured to varying degrees. Later estimates put the deaths as high as 140,000 people. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that out of 24,158 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, 6,789 were killed or missing as a result of the bombing.

The exact measurement of the explosive yield of the bomb was problematic since the weapon had never been tested. President Harry S. Truman officially announced that the yield was . This was based on Parsons&#x27;s visual assessment that the blast was greater than what he had seen at the Trinity nuclear test. Since that had been estimated at , speech writers rounded up to 20 kilotons. Further discussion was then suppressed, for fear of lessening the impact of the bomb on the Japanese. Data had been collected by Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, and Lawrence H. Johnston on the instrument plane, &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, but this was not used to calculate the yield at the time. More rigorous estimates of the bomb yield and conventional bomb equivalent were made when more data was acquired following the end of the war. A 1985 study estimated the bomb&#x27;s yield was around . 

==Physical effects==
After being selected in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing to serve as a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.

Comparing this yield to the observed damage produced a rule of thumb called the lethal area rule. Approximately all the people inside the area where the shock wave carried such an overpressure or greater would be killed. At Hiroshima, that area was in diameter.

The damage came from three main effects: blast, fire, and radiation.

===Blast===
The blast from a nuclear bomb is the result of X-ray-heated air (the fireball) sending a shock wave or pressure wave in all directions, initially at a velocity greater than the speed of sound, analogous to thunder generated by lightning. Knowledge about urban blast destruction is based largely on studies of Little Boy at Hiroshima. Nagasaki buildings suffered similar damage at similar distances, but the Nagasaki bomb detonated from the city center over hilly terrain that was partially bare of buildings.

In Hiroshima, almost everything within of the point directly under the explosion was completely destroyed, except for about 50 heavily reinforced, earthquake-resistant concrete buildings, only the shells of which remained standing. Most were completely gutted, with their windows, doors, sashes, and frames ripped out. The perimeter of severe blast damage approximately followed the contour at .

Later test explosions of nuclear weapons with houses and other test structures nearby confirmed the 5 psi overpressure threshold. Ordinary urban buildings experiencing it were crushed, toppled, or gutted by the force of air pressure. The picture at right shows the effects of a nuclear bomb-generated 5 psi pressure wave on a test structure in Nevada in 1953.

A major effect of this kind of structural damage was that it created fuel for fires that were started simultaneously throughout the severe destruction region.

===Fire===

The first effect of the explosion was blinding light, accompanied by radiant heat from the fireball. The Hiroshima fireball was in diameter, with a surface temperature of , about the same temperature as at the surface of the sun. Near ground zero, everything flammable burst into flame. One famous, anonymous Hiroshima victim, sitting on stone steps from the hypocenter, left a permanent shadow, having absorbed the fireball heat that permanently bleached the surrounding stone. Simultaneous fires were started throughout the blast-damaged area by fireball heat and by overturned stoves and furnaces, electrical shorts, etc. Twenty minutes after the detonation, these fires had merged into a firestorm, pulling in surface air from all directions to feed an inferno which consumed everything flammable.

The Hiroshima firestorm was roughly in diameter, corresponding closely to the severe blast-damage zone. (See the USSBS map, right.) Blast-damaged buildings provided fuel for the fire. Structural lumber and furniture were splintered and scattered about. Debris-choked roads obstructed firefighters. Broken gas pipes fueled the fire, and broken water pipes rendered hydrants useless. At Nagasaki, the fires failed to merge into a single firestorm, and the fire-damaged area was only one-quarter as great as at Hiroshima, due in part to a southwest wind that pushed the fires away from the city.

As the map shows, the Hiroshima firestorm jumped natural firebreaks (river channels), as well as prepared firebreaks. The spread of fire stopped only when it reached the edge of the blast-damaged area, encountering less available fuel. The Manhattan Project report on Hiroshima estimated that 60% of immediate deaths were caused by fire, but with the caveat that &quot;many persons near the center of explosion suffered fatal injuries from more than one of the bomb effects.&quot;

===Radiation===
Local fallout is dust and ash from a bomb crater, contaminated with radioactive fission products. It falls to earth downwind of the crater and can produce, with radiation alone, a lethal area much larger than that from blast and fire. With an air burst, the fission products rise into the stratosphere, where they dissipate and become part of the global environment. Because Little Boy was an air burst above the ground, there was no bomb crater and no local radioactive fallout.

However, a burst of intense neutron and gamma radiation came directly from the fission of the uranium. Its lethal radius was approximately , covering about half of the firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their radiation injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of radiation injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had radiation injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors&#x27; children.

After the surrender of Japan was finalized, Manhattan Project scientists began to immediately survey the city of Hiroshima to better understand the damage, and to communicate with Japanese physicians about radiation effects in particular. The collaboration became the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in 1946, a joint U.S.–Japanese project to track radiation injuries among survivors. In 1975 its work was superseded by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation.

In 1962, scientists at Los Alamos created a mockup of Little Boy known as &quot;Project Ichiban&quot; in order to answer some of the unanswered questions about the exact radiation output of the bomb, which would be useful for setting benchmarks for interpreting the relationship between radiation exposure and later health outcomes. But it failed to clear up all the issues. In 1982, Los Alamos created a replica Little Boy from the original drawings and specifications. This was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion. A hydraulic lift was used to move the projectile, and experiments were run to assess neutron emission.

===Conventional weapon equivalent===

After hostilities ended, a survey team from the Manhattan Project that included William Penney, Robert Serber, and George T. Reynolds was sent to Hiroshima to evaluate the effects of the blast. From evaluating the effects on objects and structures, Penney concluded that the yield was 12 ± 1 kilotons. Later calculations based on charring pointed to a yield of 13 to 14 kilotons. In 1953, Frederick Reines calculated the yield as . Based on the Project Ichiban data, and the pressure-wave data from &quot;The Great Artiste&quot;, the yield was estimated in the 1960s at 16.6 ± 0.3 kilotons. A review conducted by a scientist at Los Alamos in 1985 concluded, on the basis of existing blast, thermal, and radiological data, and then-current models of weapons effects, that the best estimate of the yield was with an uncertainty of 20% (±3 kt). By comparison, the best value for the Nagasaki bomb was evaluated as with an uncertainty of 10% (±2 kt), the difference in uncertainty owing to having better data on the latter.

To put these numerical differences into context, it is necessary to know that the acute effects of nuclear detonations, especially the blast and thermal effects, do not scale linearly, but generally as a cubic root. Specifically, the distance of these effects scale as a function of the yield raised to an exponential power of . So the range of the overpressure damage expected from a detonated 12 kiloton weapon with a height of burst at would be expected to be , whereas a 20 kiloton weapon would have the same range extend to , a difference of only . The areas affected for each would be and , respectively. As such, the practical differences in effects at these yield ranges are smaller than may at first appear, if one assumes that there is a linear relationship between yield and damage.

Although Little Boy exploded with the energy equivalent of around 15 kilotons of TNT, in 1946 the Strategic Bombing Survey estimated that the same blast and fire effect could have been caused by 2.1 kilotons of conventional bombs distributed evenly over the same target area: &quot;220 B-29s carrying 1.2 kilotons of incendiary bombs, 400 tons of high-explosive bombs, and 500 tons of anti-personnel fragmentation bombs.&quot; Since the target was spread across a two-dimensional plane, the vertical component of a single spherical nuclear explosion was largely wasted. A cluster bomb pattern of smaller explosions would have been a more energy-efficient match to the target.

==Post-WWII==


When the war ended, it was not expected that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced with the prospect of no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, the Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, ordered that some Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a solution could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.

At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin attempted to re-create the Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory&#x27;s Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect was on its way to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.

The Navy Bureau of Ordnance began in 1947 to produce 25 &quot;revised&quot; Little Boy mechanical assemblies for use by the nuclear-capable Lockheed P2V Neptune aircraft carrier aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the &quot;Midway&quot;-class aircraft carriers). Components were produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators for six. However, no actual fissionable components were produced by the end of 1948, and only two outer casings were available. By the end of 1950, only five complete Little Boy assemblies had been built. All were retired by November 1950.

The Smithsonian Institution displayed a Little Boy (complete, except for enriched uranium), until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon from the museum to remove its inner components, so the bomb could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material. The government returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993. Three other disarmed bombs are on display in the United States; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Leslie Conway &quot;Lester&quot; Bangs (December 14, 1948 – April 30, 1982) was an American music journalist and critic. He wrote for &quot;Creem&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazines and was also a performing musician. The music critic Jim DeRogatis called him &quot;America&#x27;s greatest rock critic&quot;. 

==Early life==
Bangs was born in Escondido, California. He was the son of Norma Belle (&quot;née&quot; Clifton) and Conway Leslie Bangs, a truck driver. Both of his parents were from Texas: his father from Enloe and his mother from Pecos County. Norma Belle was a devout Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. Conway died in a fire when his son was young. When Bangs was 11, he moved with his mother to El Cajon, also in San Diego County. 

His early interests and influences ranged from the Beat Generation (particularly William S. Burroughs) and jazz musicians John Coltrane and Miles Davis, to comic books and science fiction. He met Cameron Crowe while they were both contributing music pieces to &quot;The San Diego Door&quot;, an underground newspaper of the late 1960s.

==Career==
===&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine===
Bangs became a freelance writer in 1969, after reading an ad in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; soliciting readers&#x27; reviews. His first accepted piece was a negative review of the MC5 album &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot;, which he sent to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; with a note requesting, if the magazine were to decline to publish the review, that he be given a reason for the decision; no reply was forthcoming, as the magazine did indeed publish the review.

His 1970 review of Black Sabbath&#x27;s first album in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was scathing, rating them as imitators of the band Cream:

Bangs wrote about the death of Janis Joplin in 1970 from a drug overdose: &quot;It&#x27;s not just that this kind of early death has become a fact of life that has become disturbing, but that it&#x27;s been accepted as a given so quickly.&quot;

In 1973, Jann Wenner fired Bangs from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; for &quot;disrespecting musicians&quot; after a particularly harsh review of the group Canned Heat.

=== &quot;Creem&quot; magazine ===
Bangs began freelancing for Detroit-based &quot;Creem&quot; in 1970. In 1971, he wrote a feature for &quot;Creem&quot; on Alice Cooper, and soon afterward he moved to Detroit. Named &quot;Creem&quot;&#x27;s editor in 1971, Bangs fell in love with Detroit, calling it &quot;rock&#x27;s only hope&quot;, and remained there for five years.

During the early 1970s, Bangs and some other writers at &quot;Creem&quot; began using the term &quot;punk rock&quot; to designate the genre of 1960s garage bands and more contemporary acts, such as MC5 and Iggy and the Stooges. Their writings provided some of the conceptual framework for the later punk and new wave movements that emerged in New York, London, and elsewhere later in the decade. They were quick to pick up on these new movements and provide extensive coverage of the phenomenon. Bangs was enamored of the noise music of Lou Reed, and &quot;Creem&quot; gave exposure to artists such as Reed, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Captain Beefheart, Blondie, Brian Eno, and the New York Dolls years earlier than the mainstream press. Bangs wrote the essay/interview &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves&quot; about Reed in 1975. &quot;Creem&quot; was also among the earliest publications to give sizable coverage to hard rock and metal artists such as Motörhead, Kiss, Judas Priest, and Van Halen.

=== Subsequent career ===
After leaving &quot;Creem&quot; in 1976, he wrote for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, and many other publications. He won a 1984 Grammy Award for his liner notes on &quot;The Fugs Greatest Hits, Volume 1&quot;.

==Death==
Bangs died in New York City on April 30, 1982, at the age of 33; he was self-medicating a bad case of the flu and accidentally overdosed on dextropropoxyphene (an opioid analgesic), diazepam (a benzodiazepine), and NyQuil.

Bangs appeared to be listening to music when he died. Earlier that day, he had bought a copy of &quot;Dare&quot; by English synth-pop band the Human League. Later that night, a friend found him lying on a couch in his apartment, unresponsive. &quot;&quot;Dare&quot; was spinning on the turntable, and the needle was stuck on the end groove,&quot; Jim DeRogatis wrote in &quot;Let It Blurt&quot;, his biography of Bangs.

== Writing style and cultural commentary==
Bangs&#x27;s criticism was filled with cultural references, not only to rock music but also to literature and philosophy. His radical and confrontational style influenced others in the punk rock and related social and political movements. In a 1982 interview, he said:

A performer with his own band, he also appeared on stage with others at times. On one occasion, while the J. Geils Band were playing in concert, Bangs climbed onto the stage, typewriter in hand, and proceeded to type a supposed review of the event, in full view of the audience, banging the keys in rhythm with the music.

In 1979, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Bangs wrote a piece about racism in the punk music scene, called &quot;The White Noise Supremacists&quot;, wherein he re-examined his own actions and words, and those of his peers, in light of some bands using Nazi symbolism, and other racist speech and imagery, &quot;for shock value&quot;. He came to the conclusion that generating outrage for attention was not worth the harm it was causing fellow members of the community, and expressed his personal shame and embarrassment about having engaged in these racist behaviors himself. He praised the efforts of activist groups like Rock Against Racism and Rock Against Sexism as &quot;an attempt at simple decency by a lot of people whom one would think too young and naive to begin to appreciate the contradictions.&quot;

==Music==
Bangs was also a musician. In 1976, he and Peter Laughner recorded an acoustic improvisation in the &quot;Creem&quot; office. The recording included covers/parodies of songs like &quot;Sister Ray&quot; and &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot;, both by the Velvet Underground.

In 1977, Bangs recorded, as a solo artist, a 7&quot; vinyl single named &quot;Let It Blurt/Live&quot;, mixed by John Cale and released in 1979.

In 1977, at the New York City nightclub CBGB, Bangs and guitarist Mickey Leigh, Joey Ramone&#x27;s brother, decided to form a band named &quot;Birdland&quot;. Although they both had their roots in jazz, the two wanted to create an old-school rock-and-roll group. Leigh brought in his post-punk band, The Rattlers (David Merrill on bass; Matty Quick on drums). On April Fool&#x27;s Day 1979, the band snuck into Electric Lady Studios for an impromptu late-night recording session; the studio was under renovation but Merrill was helping and had the key. Birdland broke up within two months of the recording. The cassette tape from the session became the master, mixed by Ed Stasium and released by Leigh in 1986 as &quot;&quot;Birdland&quot; with Lester Bangs&quot;. In a review of the album, Robert Christgau gave it a B-plus and said, &quot;musically he always had the instincts, and words were no problem.&quot;

In 1980, Bangs traveled to Austin, Texas, where he met a surf/punk rock group, The Delinquents. In early December of the same year, they recorded an album as &quot;Lester Bangs and the Delinquents&quot;, titled &quot;Jook Savages on the Brazos&quot;, released the following year.

In 1990, the Mekons released the EP &quot;F.U.N. 90&quot; with Bangs&#x27;s declamation in the song &quot;One Horse Town&quot;.

<text>Lydia Evgenevna Kavina (; born 8 September 1967) is a British-Russian theremin player, based in Oxfordshire, UK. 

The granddaughter of Léon Theremin&#x27;s first cousin, Soviet anthropologist and primatologist Mikhail Nesturkh, Kavina was born in Moscow and began studying the instrument under the direction of Léon Theremin when she was nine years old. Five years later, she gave her first theremin concert, which marked the beginning of a musical career that has led to numerous concert, theatre, radio and television performances around the world.

Kavina has appeared as a solo performer at such prestigious venues as the &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; in London, &quot;Elbphilharmonie&quot; in Hamburg, &quot;Royal Concertgebouw&quot; in Amsterdam, &quot;Bolshoi Zal&quot; (Great Hall) of the Moscow Conservatory, Moscow International Art Centre with National Philharmonic of Russia under Vladimir Spivakov and Bellevue Palace in Berlin, the residence of the German President. She has also performed at leading festivals, including Caramoor with the Orchestra St. Luke&#x27;s, New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center Festival, Holland Music Festival, Martinu Festival, Electronic Music Festival in Burge and Moscow “Avantgarde”.

Kavina performs most of the classical theremin repertoire, including popular works for theremin by Bohuslav Martinů, Joseph Schillinger, and &quot;Spellbound&quot; by Miklos Rozsa, as well as &quot;Equatorial&quot; by Edgard Varèse and the lesser known &quot;Testament&quot; by Nicolas Obouchov.

In addition to giving concerts, Kavina is a composer of music for theremin and teaches the instrument in Western Europe, Russia and the United States. Carolina Eyck was one of her students. Together with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, she played theremin for Howard Shore&#x27;s soundtrack of the Oscar-winning film &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, as well as for &quot;eXistenZ&quot; (also by Shore), &quot;The Machinist&quot; and &quot;The Electrical Life of Louis Wain&quot;. She played the role of theremin performer in the film &quot;Me and Kaminski&quot; (2015) Additionally, Kavina has recorded several compact discs and is the subject of an instructional video from the theremin manufacturer Moog Music. She was also featured in stage productions such as &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;The Black Rider&quot; (both conceived and directed by Robert Wilson, with music by Tom Waits) at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, and in collaboration with the Russian experimental surf band Messer Chups.

Lydia Kavina is an active promoter of new experimental music for the theremin. Her recent project &quot;Nicht zu fassen&quot; for theremin and accordion, together with Roman Yusipey, includes works by S.Gubaidulina, J.Cage, V.Poleva, as well as Kavina&#x27;s compositions, it was performed in Germany and Ukraine. In collaboration with Barbara Buchholz and Kamerensemble Neue Musik Berlin, Kavina performed a number of concerts of contemporary works for theremin in Germany in 2005–2007 as part of the &quot;Touch! Don&#x27;t Touch! – Music for Theremin&quot; project.

The most notable project of her recent career is her theremin solo in 4th Symphony by Ch. Ives, under Kent Nagano (Hamburg and Zurich, 2018–2019), &quot;Bählamms Fest&quot;, an opera by Olga Neuwirth (Vienna, Hamburg, Luzern, Bochum, 1999–2021) &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, a ballet by Lera Auerbach, choreographed by John Neumeier in Copenhagen New Opera Haus (2005), Hamburg State Opera (2007–2015) and The National Ballet of China in Beijing (2012). Kavina also played the solo in Danny Elfman&#x27;s UK concert tour with BBC concert orchestra and London Concert orchestra (2013–2014).

Kavina has completed a number of her own compositions for theremin including a Concerto for Theremin and Symphony Orchestra, first performed by the Boston Modern Orchestra under the direction of Gil Rose.

Kavina holds a degree in composition from The Moscow Conservatory, where she also completed a postgraduate assistantship program.

<doc id="18606" wikidata="Q80312" url="?curid=18606" title="Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam">
<text>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE; , ; also known as the Tamil Tigers) was a Tamil militant organization, that was based in the northern and eastern Sri Lanka. The LTTE fought to create an independent Tamil state called Tamil Eelam in the northeast of the island in response to violent persecution and discriminatory policies against Sri Lankan Tamils by the Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lankan Government.

The leader of the LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran, cited the 1958 anti-Tamil pogrom as one of the factors that led him to militancy. In 1975, he assassinated the Mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah, in revenge for the 1974 Tamil conference incident. The LTTE was subsequently founded in 1976 as a reaction to the Sri Lankan Constitution of 1972 which prescribed Buddhism as the primary religion of the country, and Sinhala as its national language. The LTTE was involved in attacks on government targets, policemen and local politicians and moved onto armed clashes against the armed forces. Oppression against Sri Lankan Tamils continued by Sinhalese mobs, notably during the 1977 anti-Tamil pogrom and the 1981 burning of the Jaffna Public Library. Following the week-long July 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom carried out by Sinhalese mobs that came to be known as Black July, the LTTE&#x27;s escalation of intermittent conflict into a full-scale nationalist insurgency began, which started the Sri Lankan civil war. By this time, the LTTE was widely regarded as the most dominant Tamil militant group in Sri Lanka. It also emerged as among the most feared guerrilla forces in the world. 

Initially starting out as a guerrilla force, the LTTE increasingly came to resemble conventional armed forces with a well-developed military wing that included a navy, an airborne unit, an intelligence wing, and a specialised suicide attack unit. The LTTE popularised and perfected the use of a suicide vest as a weapon, a tactic now used by many current militant organisations. The LTTE was notable for using women and children in combat and carrying out a number of high-profile assassinations, including former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993. Consequently, the LTTE was designated as a terrorist organisation by 33 countries, including the European Union, Canada, the United States, and India.

Over the course of the conflict, the LTTE frequently exchanged control of territory in the north-east with the Sri Lankan military, with the two sides engaging in intense military confrontations. It was involved in four unsuccessful rounds of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government and at its peak in 2000, the LTTE was in control of 76% of the landmass in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. Prabhakaran headed the organisation from its inception until his death in 2009. Between 1983 and 2009, at least 100,000 were killed in the civil war, of which many were Sri Lankan Tamils. 800,000 Sri Lankan Tamils also left Sri Lanka for various destinations, including Europe, North America, and Asia.

==History==
===Background===

Emergence of Tamil militancy has its roots in the political developments and ethnic tensions in post-independent Sri Lanka. Sinhalese-led governments attempted to reduce the increased presence of the Tamil minority in government jobs, which led to ethnic discrimination, seeded hatred and divisive policies including the &quot;Sinhala Only Act&quot; and anti-Tamil riots, which gave rise to separatist ideologies among many Tamil leaders. By the late 1970s, initial non-violent political struggle for an independent Tamil state was used as justification for a secessionist insurgency led by the LTTE.

In the early 1970s, the United Front government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike introduced the policy of standardisation to curtail the number of Tamil students selected for certain faculties in the universities. In 1972, the government added a district quota as a parameter within each language. A student named Satiyaseelan formed &quot;Tamil Manavar Peravai&quot; (Tamil Students League) to counter this. This group comprised Tamil youth who advocated the rights of students to have fair enrolment. Inspired by the failed 1971 insurrection of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, it was the first Tamil militant group of its kind. It consisted of around 40 Tamil youth, including Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran (later, the leader of the Sivakumaran group), K. Pathmanaba (one of the founder members of EROS) and Velupillai Prabhakaran, an 18-year-old youth from Valvettithurai (VVT).

In 1972, Prabhakaran teamed up with Chetti Thanabalasingam in Jaffna to form the Tamil New Tigers (TNT), with Thanabalasingham as its leader. After he was killed, Prabhakaran took over. At the same time, Nadarajah Thangathurai and Selvarajah Yogachandran (better known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Kuttimani) were also involved in discussions about an insurgency. They would later (in 1979) create a separate organisation named Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) to campaign for the establishment of an independent Tamil Eelam. These groups, along with another prominent figure of the armed struggle, Ponnuthurai Sivakumaran, were involved in several hit-and-run operations against pro-government Tamil politicians, Sri Lanka Police and civil administration during the early 1970s. These attacks included throwing bombs at the residence and the car of SLFP Jaffna Mayor, Alfred Duraiyappah, placing a bomb at a carnival held in the stadium of Jaffna city (now &quot;Duraiyappah stadium&quot;) and Neervely bank robbery. The 1974 Tamil conference incident during which intervention by Sri Lankan police resulted in 11 dead also sparked the anger of these militant groups. Both Sivakumaran and Prabhakaran attempted to assassinate Duraiyappah in revenge for the incident. Sivakumaran committed suicide on 5 June 1974, to evade capture by Police. On 27 July 1975, Prabhakaran assassinated Duraiyappah, who was branded as a &quot;traitor&quot; by TULF and the insurgents alike. Prabhakaran shot and killed the Mayor when he was visiting the Krishnan temple at Ponnalai.

===Founding and rise to power===
The LTTE was founded on 5 May 1976 as the successor to the Tamil New Tigers. Uma Maheswaran became its leader, and Prabhakaran its military commander. A five-member committee was also appointed. It has been stated that Prabhakaran sought to &quot;refashion the old TNT/new LTTE into an elite, ruthlessly efficient, and highly professional fighting force&quot;, by the terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna. Prabhakaran kept the numbers of the group small and maintained a high standard of training. The LTTE carried out low-key attacks against various government targets, including policemen and local politicians.

====TULF support====
Tamil United Liberation Front leader Appapillai Amirthalingam, who was in 1977 elected as the Opposition leader of Sri Lanka Parliament, clandestinely supported the LTTE. Amirthalingam believed that if he could exercise control over the Tamil insurgent groups, it would enhance his political position and pressure the government to agree to grant political autonomy to the Tamils. Thus, he provided letters of reference to the LTTE and to other Tamil insurgent groups to raise funds. Both Uma Maheswaran (a former surveyor) and Urmila Kandiah, the first female member of the LTTE, were prominent members of the TULF youth wing. Maheswaran was the secretary of TULF Tamil Youth Forum, Colombo branch. Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N. S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, who later became the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of LTTE, which split for the first time in 1979. Uma Maheswaran was found to be having a love affair with Urmila Kandiah, which was against the code of conduct of LTTE. Prabhakaran expelled him and Maheswaran formed People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) in 1980.

In 1980, Junius Richard Jayewardene&#x27;s government agreed to devolve power by the means of District Development Councils upon the request of TULF. By this time, LTTE and other insurgent groups wanted a separate state. They had no faith in any sort of political solution. Thus the TULF and other Tamil political parties were steadily marginalized and insurgent groups emerged as the major force in the north. During this period of time, several other insurgent groups came into the arena, such as Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (1975), Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (1979), PLOTE (1980), Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front (1980) and Tamil Eelam Liberation Army (1982). LTTE ordered civilians to boycott the local government elections of 1983 which TULF contested. Voter turnout became as low as 10%. Thereafter, Tamil political parties were largely unable to represent the Tamil people as insurgent groups took over their position.

====Thirunelveli attack, 1983====

Following a Sri Lankan Army ambush in Meesalai in which two LTTE members were killed including its military commander Seelan, the LTTE sought revenge by launching its first attack on the Army. On 23 July 1983, the LTTE ambushed the Army patrol Four Four Bravo in Thirunelveli, Jaffna and killed thirteen soldiers. The ambush provided the pretext for the pre-planned Black July pogrom to be unleashed against the Tamil community in which 3,500-4,000 Tamils were killed. Before the pogrom the LTTE had only 30 full-time members. Subsequently, thousands of outraged Tamil youths joined Tamil militant groups to fight the Sri Lankan government, in what is considered a major catalyst to the insurgency in Sri Lanka.

====Indian support====

In reaction to various geopolitical and economic factors, from August 1983 to May 1987, India, through its intelligence agency the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), provided arms, training and monetary support to six Sri Lankan Tamil insurgent groups including the LTTE. During that period, 32 camps were set up in India to train these 495 LTTE insurgents, including 90 women who were trained in 10 batches. The first batch of Tigers were trained in Establishment 22 based in Chakrata, Uttarakhand. The second batch, including LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Amman, trained in Himachal Pradesh. Prabakaran visited the first and the second batch of Tamil Tigers to see them training. Eight other batches of LTTE were trained in Tamil Nadu. Thenmozhi Rajaratnam &quot;alias&quot; Dhanu, who carried out the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and Sivarasan, the key conspirator, were among the militants trained by RAW in Nainital, India.

In April 1984, the LTTE formally joined a common militant front, the Eelam National Liberation Front (ENLF), a union between LTTE, TELO, EROS, PLOTE and EPRLF.

====Clashes with other insurgent groups====
TELO usually held the Indian view of problems and pushed for India&#x27;s view during peace talks with Sri Lanka and other groups. LTTE denounced the TELO view and claimed that India was only acting on its own interest. As a result, the LTTE broke from the ENLF in 1986. Soon fighting broke out between the TELO and the LTTE and clashes occurred over the next few months. As a result, almost the entire TELO leadership and at least 400 TELO militants were killed by the LTTE. The LTTE attacked training camps of the EPRLF a few months later, forcing it to withdraw from the Jaffna peninsula. Notices were issued to the effect that all remaining Tamil insurgents join the LTTE in Jaffna and in Madras, where the Tamil groups were headquartered. With the major groups including the TELO and EPRLF eliminated, the remaining 20 or so Tamil insurgent groups were then absorbed into the LTTE, making Jaffna an LTTE-dominated city.

Another practice that increased support by Tamil people was LTTE&#x27;s members taking an oath of loyalty which stated LTTE&#x27;s goal of establishing a state for the Sri Lankan Tamils. LTTE members were prohibited from smoking cigarettes and consuming alcohol in any form. LTTE members were required to avoid their family members and avoid communication with them. Initially, LTTE members were prohibited from having love affairs or sexual relationships as it could deter their prime motive, but this policy changed after Prabhakaran married Mathivathani Erambu in October 1984.

===IPKF period===
In July 1987, faced with growing anger among its own Tamils and a flood of refugees, India intervened directly in the conflict for the first time by initially airdropping food parcels into Jaffna. After negotiations, India and Sri Lanka entered into the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. Though the conflict was between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, India and Sri Lanka signed the peace accord instead of India influencing both parties to sign a peace accord among themselves. The peace accord assigned a certain degree of regional autonomy in the Tamil areas, with Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) controlling the regional council and called for the Tamil militant groups to surrender. India was to send a peacekeeping force, named the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), part of the Indian Army, to Sri Lanka to enforce the disarmament and to watch over the regional council.

====War against IPKF====
Although the Tamil militant organizations did not have a role in the Indo-Lanka agreement, most groups, including EPRLF, TELO, EROS, and PLOTE, accepted it. LTTE rejected the accord because they opposed EPRLF&#x27;s Varadaraja Perumal as the chief ministerial candidate for the merged North Eastern Province. The LTTE named three alternate candidates for the position, which India rejected. The LTTE subsequently refused to hand over their weapons to the IPKF. The LTTE&#x27;s political leader for Jaffna peninsula Thileepan died during a hunger strike directed at the Indian government after it had failed to meet his demands; and on 5 October 12 LTTE cadres detained by the Sri Lankan Navy committed suicide when the Sri Lankan Army attempted to take them to Colombo for interrogation after the IPKF refused to intervene and secure their release under the accord. Major General Harkirat Singh J.N.Dixit and Depinder Singh were against handing over the LTTE cadres to the Sri Lankan Army but due to orders from New Delhi they agreed. The LTTE walked out of the accord after the mass suicide. Harkirat Singh blamed the diplomats and the Army headquarters for the turn of events leading to the conflict.

Thus LTTE engaged in military conflict with the Indian Army, and launched its first attack on an Indian army rations truck on 8 October, killing five Indian para-commandos who were on board by strapping burning tires around their necks. The government of India stated that the IPKF should disarm the LTTE by force. The Indian Army launched assaults on the LTTE, including a month-long campaign, &quot;Operation Pawan&quot; to win control of the Jaffna Peninsula. The ruthlessness of this campaign, and the Indian army&#x27;s subsequent anti-LTTE operations, which included civilian massacres and rapes made it extremely unpopular among many Tamils in Sri Lanka.

====Premadasa government support====
The Indian intervention was also unpopular among the Sinhalese majority. Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa pledged to withdraw IPKF as soon as he was elected president during his presidential election campaign in 1988. After being elected, in April 1989, he started negotiations with LTTE. President Premadasa ordered the Sri Lanka Army to clandestinely hand over arms consignments to the LTTE to fight the IPKF and its proxy, the Tamil National Army (TNA). These consignments included RPGs, mortars, self-loading rifles, Type 81 assault rifle, T56 automatic rifles, pistols, hand grenades, ammunition, and communications sets. Moreover, millions of dollars were also passed on to the LTTE.

===After IPKF===
The last members of the IPKF, which was estimated to have had a strength of well over 100,000 at its peak, left the country in March 1990 upon the request of President Premadasa. Unstable peace initially held between the government and the LTTE, and peace talks progressed towards providing devolution for Tamils in the north and east of the country. A ceasefire held between LTTE and the government from June 1989 to June 1990, but broke down as LTTE massacred 600 police officers in the Eastern Province.

Fighting continued throughout the 1990s, and was marked by two key assassinations carried out by the LTTE: those of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993, using suicide bombers on both occasions. The fighting briefly halted in 1994 following the election of Chandrika Kumaratunga as President of Sri Lanka and the onset of peace talks, but fighting resumed after LTTE sacked two SLN gunboats on 19 April 1995. In a series of military operations that followed, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces recaptured the Jaffna Peninsula. Further offensives followed over the next three years, and the military captured large areas in the north of the country from the LTTE, including areas in the Vanni region, the town of Kilinochchi, and many smaller towns. From 1998 onward, the LTTE regained control of these areas, which culminated in the capture in April 2000 of the strategically important Elephant Pass base complex, located at the entrance of the Jaffna Peninsula, after prolonged fighting against the Sri Lanka Army.

Mahattaya, a one-time deputy leader of LTTE, was accused of treason by the LTTE and killed in 1994. He is said to have collaborated with the Indian Research and Analysis Wing to remove Prabhakaran from the LTTE leadership.

===2002 ceasefire===
In 2002, the LTTE dropped its demand for a separate state, instead demanding a form of regional autonomy. Following the landslide election defeat of Kumaratunga and Ranil Wickramasinghe coming to power in December 2001, the LTTE declared a unilateral ceasefire. The Sri Lankan Government agreed to the ceasefire, and in March 2002 the Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) was signed. As part of the agreement, Norway and other Nordic countries agreed to jointly monitor the ceasefire through the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission.

Six rounds of peace talks between the Government of Sri Lanka and LTTE were held, but they were temporarily suspended after the LTTE pulled out of the talks in 2003 claiming &quot;certain critical issues relating to the ongoing peace process&quot;. In 2003 the LTTE proposed an Interim Self-Governing Authority (ISGA). This move was approved of by the international community but rejected by the Sri Lankan President. The LTTE boycotted the presidential election in December 2005. While LTTE claimed that the people under its control were free to vote, it is alleged that they used threats to prevent the population from voting. The United States condemned this.

The new government of Sri Lanka came into power in 2006 and demanded to abrogate the ceasefire agreement, stating that the ethnic conflict could only have a military solution, and that the only way to achieve this was by eliminating the LTTE. Further peace talks were scheduled in Oslo, Norway, on 8 and 9 June 2006, but cancelled when the LTTE refused to meet directly with the government delegation, stating its fighters were not being allowed safe passage to travel to the talks. Norwegian mediator Erik Solheim told journalists that the LTTE should take direct responsibility for the collapse of the talks. Rifts grew between the government and LTTE, and resulted in a number of ceasefire agreement violations by both sides during 2006. Suicide attacks, military skirmishes, and air raids took place during the latter part of 2006. Between February 2002 to May 2007, the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission documented 3,830 ceasefire violations by the LTTE, with respect to 351 by the security forces. Military confrontation continued into 2007 and 2008. In January 2008 the government officially pulled out of the Cease Fire Agreement.

===Dissension===

In the most significant show of dissent from within the organisation, a senior LTTE commander named Colonel Karuna (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan) broke away from the LTTE in March 2004 and formed the TamilEela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (later Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal), amid allegations that the northern commanders were overlooking the needs of the eastern Tamils. The LTTE leadership accused him of mishandling funds and questioned him about his recent personal behaviour. He tried to take control of the eastern province from the LTTE, which caused clashes between the LTTE and TMVP. The LTTE suggested that TMVP was backed by the government, and the Nordic SLMM monitors corroborated this. It was later revealed that UNP Member of Parliament Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana had played an important role in the defection of Colonel Karuna from the LTTE to the Government.

===Military defeat===
Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected as the president of Sri Lanka in 2005. After a brief period of negotiations, LTTE pulled out of peace talks indefinitely. Sporadic violence had continued and on 25 April 2006, LTTE tried to assassinate Sri Lankan Army Commander Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka. Following the attack, the European Union proscribed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. A new crisis leading to the first large-scale fighting since signing of the ceasefire occurred when the LTTE closed the sluice gates of the Mavil Oya (Mavil Aru) reservoir on 21 July 2006, and cut the water supply to 15,000 villages in government controlled areas. This dispute developed into a full-scale war by August 2006.

After the breakdown of the peace process in 2006, the Sri Lankan military launched a major offensive against the Tigers, defeating the LTTE militarily and bringing the entire country under its control. Human rights groups criticised the nature of the victory which included the internment of Tamil civilians in concentration camps with little or no access to outside agencies. Victory over the Tigers was declared by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa on 16 May 2009, and the LTTE admitted defeat on 17 May 2009. Prabhakaran was killed by government forces on 19 May 2009. Selvarasa Pathmanathan succeeded Prabhakaran as leader of the LTTE, but he was later arrested in Malaysia and handed over to the Sri Lankan government in August 2009.

====Defeat in the East====

Eelam War IV had commenced in the East. Mavil Aru came under the control of the Sri Lanka Army by 15 August 2006. Systematically, Sampoor, Vakarai, Kanjikudichchi Aru and Batticaloa also came under military control. The military then captured Thoppigala, the Tiger stronghold in Eastern Province on 11 July 2007. IPKF had failed to capture it from LTTE during its offensive in 1988.

====Defeat in the North====

Sporadic fighting had been happening in the North for months, but the intensity of the clashes increased after September 2007. Gradually, the defence lines of the LTTE began to fall. The advancing military confined the LTTE into rapidly diminishing areas in the North. Earlier, on 2 November 2007, S. P. Thamilselvan, who was the head of the rebels&#x27; political wing, was killed during another government air raid. On 2 January 2008, the Sri Lankan government officially abandoned the ceasefire agreement. By 2 August 2008, LTTE lost the Mannar District following the fall of Vellankulam town. Troops captured Pooneryn and Mankulam during the final months of 2008.

On 2 January 2009, the President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, announced that the Sri Lankan troops had captured Kilinochchi, the city which the LTTE had used for over a decade as its de facto administrative capital. On the same day, President Rajapaksa called upon LTTE to surrender. It was stated that the loss of Kilinochchi had caused substantial damage to the LTTE&#x27;s public image, and that the LTTE was likely to collapse under military pressure on multiple fronts. As of 8 January 2009, the LTTE abandoned its positions on the Jaffna peninsula to make a last stand in the jungles of Mullaitivu, their last main base.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-01/08/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaffna Peninsula was captured by the Sri Lankan Army by 14 January. On 25 January 2009, SLA troops &quot;completely captured&quot; Mullaitivu town, the last major LTTE stronghold.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod-bbc-01/25/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared military victory over the Tamil Tigers on 16 May 2009, after 26 years of conflict. The rebels offered to lay down their weapons in return for a guarantee of safety. On 17 May 2009, LTTE&#x27;s head of the Department of International Relations, Selvarasa Pathmanathan conceded defeat, saying in an email statement, &quot;this battle has reached its bitter end&quot;.

====Aftermath====
With the end of the hostilities, 11,664 LTTE members, including 595 child soldiers surrendered to the Sri Lankan military. Approximately 150 hardcore LTTE cadres and 1,000 mid-level cadres escaped to India. The government took action to rehabilitate the surrendered cadres under a National Action Plan for the Re-integration of Ex-combatants while allegations of torture, rape, and murder were reported by international human rights bodies. They were divided into three categories; hardcore, non-combatants, and those who were forcibly recruited (including child soldiers). Twenty-four rehabilitation centres were set up in Jaffna, Batticaloa, and Vavuniya. Among the apprehended cadres, there had been about 700 hardcore members. Some of these cadres were integrated into the State Intelligence Service to tackle the internal and external networks of LTTE. By August 2011, the government had released more than 8,000 cadres, and 2,879 remained.

===Continued operations===
After the death of LTTE leader Prabhakaran and the most powerful members of the organisation, Selvarasa Pathmanathan (alias &quot;KP&quot;) was its sole first generation leader left alive. He assumed duty as the new leader of LTTE on 21 July 2009. A statement was issued, allegedly from the executive committee of the LTTE, stating that Pathmanathan had been appointed leader of the LTTE. 15 days after the announcement, on 5 August 2009, a Sri Lankan military intelligence unit, with the collaboration of local authorities, captured Pathmanathan in the Tune Hotel, in downtown Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Sri Lanka Ministry of Defence alleges that Perinpanayagam Sivaparan &quot;alias&quot; Nediyavan of the Tamil Eelam People&#x27;s Alliance (TEPA) in Norway, Suren Surendiran of British Tamils Forum (BTF), Father S. J. Emmanuel of Global Tamil Forum (GTF), Visvanathan Rudrakumaran of Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) and Sekarapillai Vinayagamoorthy &quot;alias&quot; Kathirgamathamby Arivazhagan &quot;alias&quot; Vinayagam, a former senior intelligence leader are trying to revive the organisation among the Tamil diaspora. Subsequently, in May 2011, Nediyavan, who advocates an armed struggle against the Sri Lankan state, was arrested and released on bail in Norway, pending further investigation.

==Divisions==

The LTTE was viewed as a disciplined and militarised group with a leader of a significant military and organisational skills. Three major divisions of the LTTE were the military, intelligence, and political wings.

The military wing consisted of at least 11 separate divisions including the conventional fighting forces, Charles Anthony Regiment and Jeyanthan Regiment; the suicide wing called the Black Tigers; naval wing Sea Tigers, air-wing Air Tigers, LTTE leader Prabhakaran&#x27;s personal security divisions, Imran Pandian regiment and Ratha regiment; auxiliary military units such as Kittu artillery brigade, Kutti Sri mortar brigade, Ponnamman mining unit and hit-and-run squads like Pistol gang. Charles Anthony brigade was the first conventional fighting formation created by LTTE. Sea Tiger division was founded in 1984, under the leadership of Thillaiyampalam Sivanesan &quot;alias&quot; Soosai. LTTE acquired its first light aircraft in the late 1990s. Vaithilingam Sornalingam &quot;alias&quot; Shankar was instrumental in creating the Air Tigers. It carried out nine air attacks since 2007, including a suicide air raid targeting Sri Lanka Air Force headquarters, Colombo in February 2009. LTTE was the only rebel organisation to have an air force. LTTE intelligence wing consisted of Tiger Organisation Security Intelligence Service &quot;aka&quot; TOSIS, run by Pottu Amman, and a separate military intelligence division. The LTTE cadres were required to follow a strict code of conduct which included prohibition on smoking and consumption of alcohol, with sexual relationships also being regulated. Each member carried a cyanide capsule to commit suicide in case of capture.

The LTTE operated a systematic and powerful political wing, which functioned like a separate state in the LTTE controlled area. In 1989, it established a political party named People&#x27;s Front of Liberation Tigers, under Gopalaswamy Mahendraraja &quot;alias&quot; Mahattaya. It was abandoned soon after. Later, S. P. Thamilselvan was appointed the head of the political wing. He was also a member of the LTTE delegation for Norwegian brokered peace talks. After the death of Thamilselvan in November 2007, Balasingham Nadesan was appointed as its leader. Major sections within the political wing include International peace secretariat, led by Pulidevan, LTTE Police, LTTE court, Bank of Tamil Eelam, Sports division and the &quot;Voice of Tigers&quot; radio broadcasting station of LTTE.

LTTE used female cadres for military engagements. Its women&#x27;s wing consisted of Malathi and Sothiya Brigades.

The LTTE also controlled a powerful international wing called the &quot;KP branch&quot;, controlled by Selvarasa Pathmanathan, &quot;Castro branch&quot;, controlled by Veerakathy Manivannam &quot;alias&quot; Castro, and &quot;Aiyannah group&quot; led by Ponniah Anandaraja &quot;alias&quot; Aiyannah.

==Governance==

During its active years, the LTTE had established and administered a de facto state under its control, named Tamil Eelam with Kilinochchi as its administrative capital, and had managed a government in its territory, providing state functions such as courts, a police force, a human rights organisation, and a humanitarian assistance board, a health board, and an education board. However, the court system, composed of young judges with little or no legal training had operated without codified or defined legal authority, and essentially operated as agents of the LTTE rather than as an independent judiciary. It ran a bank (Bank of Tamil Eelam), a radio station (Voice of Tigers) and a television station (National Television of Tamil Eelam). In the LTTE-controlled areas, women reported lower levels of domestic violence because &quot;the Tigers had a de facto justice system to deal with domestic violence.&quot; The United States Department of State Human Rights Reports have described LTTE&#x27;s governance as an authoritarian military rule, denying the people under its authority the right to change their government, infringing on their privacy rights, routinely violating their civil liberties, operating an unfair court system, restricting freedom of movement and severely discriminating against ethnic and religious minorities.

In 2003, the LTTE issued a proposal to establish an Interim Self-Governing Authority in the eight districts of the North and East which it controlled. The ISGA was to be entrusted with powers such as the right to impose law, collect taxes and oversee the rehabilitation process until a favourable solution was reached after which elections would be held. The ISGA would consist of members representing the LTTE, GoSL and the Muslim community. According to the proposal, this LTTE administration intended to be a secular one with principal emphasis on prohibition of discrimination and protection of all communities.

===Local perception and support===
Due to its military victories, policies, call for national self-determination and constructive Tamil nationalist platform, the LTTE was supported by major sections of the Tamil community. Based on the survey of the Jaffna population by the BBC and Reuters journalists, a U.S. diplomatic cable from 1994 stated that support for the LTTE was fairly strong among the Jaffna population who admired the discipline of the LTTE&#x27;s administrative service, and that majority of Jaffna residents would choose the LTTE over the Sri Lankan Army given the choice. According to the assessments by independent observers, the LTTE administration of justice gained &quot;significant social acceptance&quot;, and its courts were broadly seen as &quot;more efficient, less expensive, and less vulnerable to corruption than their Sri Lankan counterparts.&quot; The LTTE police force also had &quot;a high degree of legitimacy&quot; among Tamil civilians who viewed it as &quot;an uncorrupt and important stabilizing factor in the region.&quot; A survey carried out by the Centre for Policy Alternatives in 2002 from a sample of 89 Sri Lankan Tamils found that 89% regarded the LTTE as their sole representatives. 

However, University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna), a local human rights NGO that has been accused of anti-LTTE bias by some critics, claimed that &quot;by combination of internal terror and narrow nationalist ideology the LTTE succeeded in atomising the community. It took away not only the right to oppose but even the right to evaluate, as a community, the course they were taking. This gives a semblance of illusion that the whole society is behind the LTTE.&quot; After meeting with the Tamil civil society in Jaffna in 2001, Jehan Perera, the executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, observed that fear was not the only factor that impelled civic groups in Jaffna to speak in favour of the LTTE but that the Jaffna people had recognized the LTTE&#x27;s military strength and pragmatically accepted it as the main player in achieving a negotiated settlement.

==Ideology==
The LTTE was a self-styled national liberation organisation with the primary goal of establishing an independent Tamil state. Tamil nationalism was the primary basis of its ideology. LTTE claimed to strive for a democratic, secular state that is based on socialism. Its leader Velupillai Prabhakaran was influenced by Indian freedom fighters such as Subhas Chandra Bose. The organisation denied being a separatist movement and saw itself as fighting for self-determination and restoration of sovereignty in what it recognised as Tamil homeland. Although most Tigers were Hindus, the LTTE was an avowedly secular organisation; religion did not play any significant part in its ideology. Prabhakaran criticised what he saw as the oppressive features of traditional Hindu Tamil society, such as the caste system and gender inequality. The LTTE presented itself as a revolutionary movement seeking widespread change within Tamil society, not just independence from the Sri Lankan state. Therefore, its ideology called for the removal of caste discrimination and support for women&#x27;s liberation. Prabhakaran described his political philosophy as &quot;revolutionary socialism&quot;, with the goal of creating an &quot;egalitarian society&quot;. However, by 2002 with the shift in geopolitical climate, Prabhakaran endorsed &quot;open market economy&quot;, but he pointed out that the question about the proper economic system can be considered only after the ethnic problem had been solved.

==Global network==

LTTE had developed a large international network since the days of N. S. Krishnan, who served as its first international representative. In the late 1970s, TULF parliamentarian and opposition leader A. Amirthalingam provided letters of reference for fundraising, and V. N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), introduced many influential and wealthy Tamils living overseas to Tamil insurgent leaders. Navaratnam also introduced LTTE members to the members of Polisario Front, a national liberation movement in Morocco, at a meeting held in Oslo, Norway. In 1978, during the world tour of Amirthalingam (with London-based Eelam activist S. K. Vaikundavasan), he formed the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which was later found to be an LTTE front organisation. The global contacts of LTTE grew steadily since then. At the height of its power, LTTE had 42 offices worldwide. The international network of LTTE engages in propaganda, fundraising, arms procurement, and shipping.

There were three types of organisations that engage in propaganda and fund raising—Front, Cover, and Sympathetic. Prior to the ethnic riots of 1983, attempts to raise funds for a sustaining military campaign were not realised. It was the mass exodus of Tamil civilians to India and western countries following the Black July ethnic riots, which made this possible. As the armed conflict evolved and voluntary donations lessened, LTTE used force and threats to collect money. LTTE was worth US$200–300 million at its peak. The group&#x27;s global network owned numerous business ventures in various countries. These include investment in real estate, shipping, grocery stores, gold and jewellery stores, gas stations, restaurants, production of films, mass media organisations (TV, radio, print), and industries. It was also in control of numerous charitable organisations including Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation, which was banned and had its funds frozen by the United States Treasury in 2007 for covertly financing terrorism.

Arms Procurement and shipping activities of LTTE were largely clandestine. Prior to 1983, it procured weapons mainly from Afghanistan via the Indo-Pakistani border. Explosives were purchased from commercial markets in India. From 1983 to 1987, LTTE acquired a substantial amount of weapons from RAW and from Lebanon, Cyprus, Singapore, and Malaysia-based arms dealers. LTTE received its first consignment of arms from Singapore in 1984 on board the MV &quot;Cholan&quot;, the first ship owned by the organisation. Funds were received and cargo cleared at Chennai Port with the assistance of M. G. Ramachandran, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. In November 1994, the LTTE was able to purchase 60 tonnes of explosives (50 tonnes of TNT and 10 tonnes of RDX) from Rubezone Chemical plant in Ukraine, providing a forged Bangladeshi Ministry of Defence end-user certificate. Payments for the explosives were made from a Citibank account in Singapore held by Selvarasa Pathmanathan. Consignment was transported on board MV Sewne. The same explosives were used for the Central Bank bombing in 1996. Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia remained the most trusted outposts of LTTE, after India alienated it following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.
According to Rohan Gunaratna, since late 1997, North Korea became the principal country to provide arms, ammunition, and explosives to the LTTE. The deal with North Korean government was carried out by Ponniah Anandaraja &quot;alias&quot; Aiyannah, a member of World Tamil Coordinating Committee of the United States and later, the accountant of LTTE. He worked at the North Korean embassy in Bangkok since late 1997. LTTE had nearly 20-second-hand ships, which were purchased in Japan, and registered in Panama and other Latin American countries. These ships mostly transported general cargo, including paddy, sugar, timber, glass, and fertilizer. But when an arms deal was finalized, they travelled to North Korea, loaded the cargo and brought it to the equator, where the ships were based. Then on board merchant tankers, weapons were transferred to the sea of Alampil, just outside the territorial waters in Sri Lanka&#x27;s exclusive economic zone. After that, small teams of Sea Tigers brought the cargo ashore. The Sri Lanka Navy, during 2005–08 destroyed at least 11 of these cargo ships belonged to LTTE in the international waters.

LTTE&#x27;s last shipment of weapons was in March 2009, towards the end of the war. The merchant vessel &quot;Princess Iswari&quot; went from Indonesia to North Korea under captain Kamalraj Kandasamy &quot;alias&quot; Vinod, loaded the weapons and came back to international waters beyond Sri Lanka. But due to the heavy naval blockades set up by the Sri Lankan Navy, it could not deliver the arms consignment. Thus it dumped the weapons in the sea. The same ship, after changing its name to MV &quot;Ocean Lady&quot;, arrived in Vancouver with 76 migrants, in October 2009. In December 2009, The Sri Lankan Navy apprehended a merchant vessel belonging to LTTE, &quot;Princess Chrisanta&quot; in Indonesia and brought it back to Sri Lanka.

The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (USSFRC) and Ethiopian based Jimma Times claimed that the Eritrean government had provided direct military assistance, including light aircraft to LTTE, during the 2002–03 period when the LTTE was negotiating with the Sri Lankan government via the Norwegian mediators. It was also alleged that Erik Solheim, the chief Norwegian facilitator, helped LTTE to establish this relationship. These allegations and a suspicion from within the Sri Lankan armed forces, that LTTE had considerable connections and assets in Eritrea and that its leader Prabhakaran might try to flee to Eritrea in the final stages of war, prompted the Sri Lankan government to establish diplomatic relations with Eritrea in 2009.

In 2013, Thiruthanikan Thanigasalam and Sahilal Sabaratnam were sentenced to 25 years in prison in Brooklyn in connection of attempting to purchase high-powered weaponry for the LTTE. They were caught in a FBI undercover sting operation while attempting to purchase surface-to-air missiles, missile launchers, and assault rifles.

==Proscription as a terrorist group==
Thirty-three countries currently list the LTTE as a terrorist organization. As of October 2019, these include:

* (since 1992)
* (designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the Department of State since 8 October 1997. Named as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) since 2 November 2001)
* (designated a Proscribed Terrorist Group under the Terrorism Act 2000 since 29 March 2001)
* (since 2006; 27 countries)
* (since 2006) 
* (from January 1998 to 4 September 2002, and again from 7 January 2009)
* (since 2014)

The framing of &quot;terrorism&quot;, despite having no universally accepted definition, carries a connotation of moral illegitimacy and, as proscription, is used by states to criminalize their opponents and justify &quot;extreme&quot; measures against them. In the Sri Lankan context, proscription is also used to delegitimize the LTTE&#x27;s political objective of establishing an independent state. There is resistance in the international community to the alteration of state boundaries by force and no state recognized Tamil claim of self-determination. The proscriptions by Western states reflected their opposition to LTTE&#x27;s political objective than concern about its threat to their own national security. Moreover, despite its human rights abuses, Western states regarded Sri Lanka as a democratic ally in their promotion of a global liberal order and were committed to upholding its sovereignty. Hence, proscription was also used by these states to shape the conduct of the LTTE and Tamil diaspora to align with their foreign policy aims.

The first country to ban the LTTE was its brief ally, India, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. The Indian change of policy came gradually, starting with the IPKF-LTTE conflict and culminating with the assassination. India opposes the proposed Tamil Eelam that LTTE wanted to establish, fearing that it would lead to Tamil Nadu&#x27;s separation from India despite its integration into the national mainstream. In 2012 after the LTTE&#x27;s defeat, the Indian Government extended the ban on the LTTE on the grounds of its alleged &quot;strong anti-India posture and threat to the security of Indian nationals&quot;. 

Sri Lanka first banned the LTTE in 1998, lifted the ban before signing the ceasefire agreement in 2002 and reintroduced the ban in 2009.

The United States proscribed the LTTE as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997. A U.S. ambassador later explained that the main rationale behind the ban was to prevent LTTE&#x27;s fundraising and for it to negotiate with the Sri Lankan government. The Pentagon had launched a military programme in March 1996 to train the Sri Lankan military after a series of LTTE attacks which affected U.S. commercial interests on the island but it failed to weaken the LTTE due to its procurement of conventional weapons with funds raised overseas. In 2003, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, urged the LTTE to renounce its armed struggle for separate state and to accept the Sri Lankan government&#x27;s sovereignty in order for the proscription to be lifted.

The European Union (EU) banned LTTE as a terrorist organization on 17 May 2006. In a statement, the European Parliament said that the LTTE did not represent all Tamils and called on it to &quot;allow for political pluralism and alternate democratic voices in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka&quot;. Pressure from the United States, which assisted Sri Lanka&#x27;s war efforts, played a critical role in getting Canada and the EU to ban the LTTE. The then Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera later recounted that there was a difficulty in adopting the ban as a unanimous decision due to the opposition from seven countries in the 25-member EU and that consensus was finally achieved only after he had met with the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice several times. Swedish Major General Ulf Henricsson, the head of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) whom the EU had consulted before the ban, opposed the ban, warning it gave the Sri Lankan government &quot;carte blanche&quot; to seek a military solution. He warned the EU in a memo that a ban would lead to an increase in attacks and violence. He later described the ban as a decision made in the &quot;coffee shops in Brussels&quot; where EU members had failed to read the memo carefully. He further stated that as part of the global war on terror the EU listened to only the Sri Lankan government&#x27;s version of events and that the government should have also been listed as it &quot;used the same methods&quot;. 

In October 2014, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) annulled the anti-terrorism sanctions and several other restrictions placed on the LTTE in 2006. The court noted that the basis of proscribing the LTTE had been based on &quot;imputations derived from the press and the Internet&quot; rather than on direct investigation of the group&#x27;s actions, as required by law. Later, in March 2015, the EU reimposed the sanctions and restrictions. In July 2017, the LTTE was removed from the terrorism blacklist of the EU&#x27;s top court, stating that there was no evidence to show of LTTE carrying out attacks after its military defeat in 2009. However, despite the ECJ ruling, the EU stated the LTTE remains listed as a terrorist organization by the EU.

On 12 November 2014, the Malaysian government listed the by-then defunct LTTE as a terrorist group amid allegations of its revival attempts in the country. Referring to a letter he purportedly wrote on 12 February 2020 as the Prime Minister to the Ministry of Home Affairs requesting the LTTE&#x27;s removal from its list of terrorist groups, former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad later explained that the LTTE had not harmed Malaysia and that a group should not be labelled as terrorists simply because other countries do so, since he had met with the leader of the Hamas despite the U.S. having banned it as a terrorist organization. However, responding to the suggestion of the Attorney General (AG) to review the list of gazetted terrorist organizations after the AG dropped charges against 12 alleged LTTE sympathizers, then Minister of Home Affairs Muhyiddin Yassin stated on 22 February 2020 that the LTTE would remain listed as a terrorist organization, claiming its &quot;ideology&quot; posed threat to Malaysia&#x27;s public order and security. Yassin, a Malay nationalist, has been accused of using the ban to mastermind the &quot;politically motivated&quot; arrests of Indian Tamil members of the Democratic Action Party over alleged LTTE links.

The LTTE leader Prabhakaran contested the terrorist designation of his organization, asserting that the international community had been influenced by the &quot;false propaganda&quot; of the Sri Lankan state and said that there was no coherent definition of the concept of terrorism. He also maintained that the LTTE was a national liberation organization fighting against &quot;state terrorism&quot; and &quot;racist oppression&quot;. He urged Western powers engaged in the war on terror to provide &quot;a clear and comprehensive definition of the concept of terrorism that would distinguish between freedom struggles based on the right to self-determination and blind terrorist acts based on fanaticism.&quot; He also complained that human rights violators such as Sri Lanka joining the alliance in the war on terror posed threat to &quot;the legitimate political struggles of the oppressed humanity&quot;.

==Suicide attacks==

One of the main divisions of LTTE included the Black Tigers, an elite fighting wing of the movement, whose mission included carrying out suicide attacks against enemy targets. The LTTE conducted its first suicide attack on 5 July 1987 when Captain Miller rammed a truck filled with explosives into a Sri Lankan Army base in Jaffna killing scores of soldiers. Black Tigers as a division would be established years later. Its two strategic purposes were to compensate for the LTTE&#x27;s lack of heavy weaponry and to serve as a commando unit to access difficult targets. Its members were carefully selected and underwent intense training.

According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, LTTE was the first insurgent organization to use concealed explosive belts and vests. According to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence, the LTTE stated that out of the deceased Black Tigers, 274 were male and 104 were female. Experts estimated that the Black Tigers had carried out most of the suicide attacks recorded around the world by the time the Sri Lankan civil war ended in 2009. The LTTE is credited with popularizing the tactic globally. However, most of the LTTE suicide attacks were carried out against military targets in the north and east of the country; and unlike other groups the LTTE primarily used such attacks as part of its insurgency strategy than to terrorize civilians. Sometimes civilians were also killed. In 1998 the Black Tigers attacked Dalada Maligawa, holiest Buddhist shrine in the country, killing eight civilians.

The Black Tiger wing also carried out attacks on several high-profile political figures. Three notable attacks includes the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India, on 21 May 1991, the assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa, the President of Sri Lanka, on 1 May 1993, and the failed assassination attempt of Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Sri Lankan President, on 18 December 1999, which resulted in the loss of her right eye.

Black Tiger cadres killed in action were highly glorified and their families were given the &quot;Maaveerar family&quot; status, just like normal LTTE cadres. Also, these families were honoured with the &quot;Thamizheezha Maravar pathakkam&quot; (Warrior medal of Tamil Eelam), one of the higher honours of Tamil Eelam. Black Tiger members were given a chance to have his/her last supper with the LTTE leader Prabhakaran, which was a rare honour, motivating LTTE cadres to join the Black Tiger wing.

==Assassinations==

The LTTE has been condemned by various groups for assassinating political and military opponents. The victims include Tamil dissenters who coordinated with the Sri Lanka Government and Tamil paramilitary groups assisting the Sri Lankan Army. The assassination of the Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa is attributed to LTTE. The seventh Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated by an LTTE suicide bomber Thenmozhi Rajaratnam on 21 May 1991. On 24 October 1994, LTTE detonated a bomb during a political rally in Thotalanga-Grandpass, which killed most of the prominent politicians of the United National Party, including presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake MP, Cabinet ministers Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi and G. M. Premachandra, Ossie Abeygunasekara MP and Gamini Wijesekara MP.

LTTE sympathisers justify some of the assassinations by arguing that the people attacked were combatants or persons closely associated with Sri Lankan military intelligence. Specifically in relation to the TELO, the LTTE has said that it had to perform preemptive self-defence because the TELO was in effect functioning as a proxy for India.

==Human rights violations==
Numerous countries and international organizations have accused the LTTE of attacking civilians and recruiting children.

===Attacks on civilians===
The LTTE carried out attacks on civilian targets several times. Attacks were often alleged to be carried out in revenge for attacks committed by the Sri Lankan Army, such as the Anuradhapura massacre which immediately followed the Valvettithurai massacre. Notable attacks include the Aranthalawa massacre, Anuradhapura massacre, Kattankudy mosque massacre, the Kebithigollewa massacre, and the Dehiwala train bombing. Civilians have also been killed in attacks on economic targets, such as the Central Bank bombing. According to Udalagama and de Silva, between 3,700 and 4,100 civilians were killed in &quot;terrorist acts&quot; attributed to the LTTE, a &quot;somewhat modest&quot; proportion of the overall civilian death toll during the war. 

The LTTE leader Prabhakaran denied allegations of killing innocent Sinhalese civilians, claiming to condemn such acts of violence. In the case of Sinhalese in colonized areas, he claimed that LTTE had instead attacked armed Home Guards who were &quot;death-squads let loose on Tamil civilians&quot; and Sinhalese settlers who were &quot;brought to the Tamil areas to forcibly occupy the land.&quot; The continuous inflow of Sinhalese settlers into Tamil areas since the 1950s, encouraged by the government to undermine claims of a Tamil homeland, had become a source of inter-ethnic violence and had been one of the major grievances expressed by the LTTE. The LTTE also denied massacring Muslims, stating that they were allies against the Sinhalese state. LTTE sympathizers often claim that Karuna, while he was a commander, was solely responsible for many attacks, especially in the Eastern Province.

===Child soldiers===

The LTTE has been accused of recruiting and using child soldiers to fight against Sri Lankan government forces. The LTTE was accused of having up to 5,794 child soldiers in its ranks since 2001. Amid international pressure, the LTTE announced in July 2003 that it would stop conscripting child soldiers, but UNICEF and Human Rights Watch have accused it of reneging on its promises, and of conscripting Tamil children orphaned by the tsunami. N. Malathy, the former secretary of NESOHR, accused the UNICEF of sensationalizing this issue to fundraise and falsely listing disabled and orphaned children in the LTTE orphanages as child soldiers. On 18 June 2007, the LTTE released 135 children under 18 years of age. UNICEF, along with the United States, stated that there had been a significant drop in LTTE recruitment of children, but claimed in 2007 that 506 child recruits remain under the LTTE. A report released by the LTTE&#x27;s Child Protection Authority (CPA) in 2008 stated that less than 40 soldiers under age 18 remained in its forces. In 2009 a Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations said the Tamil Tigers &quot;continue to recruit children to fight on the frontlines&quot;, and &quot;use force to keep many civilians, including children, in harm&#x27;s way&quot;. During the violent parts of the war, though some children were forcefully recruited, many voluntarily joined the LTTE after witnessing or experiencing abuses by Sri Lankan security forces, seeking to &quot;protect their families or to avenge real or perceived abuses.&quot; However, the Sri Lankan government&#x27;s National Child Protection Authority alleged that since the ceasefire children were more likely to be forcibly recruited. Many children have been used in human rights violations such as the torture of political prisoners and massacres in Muslim and Sinhalese villages.

The LTTE argued that instances of child recruitment occurred mostly in the eastern province, under the purview of former LTTE regional commander Colonel Karuna. After leaving the LTTE and forming the TMVP, it is alleged that Karuna continued to forcibly kidnap and induct child soldiers. Soon after Karuna&#x27;s defection, the LTTE began an intensive campaign to re-recruit Karuna&#x27;s former cadres, including child soldiers. Many of the former child soldiers were re-recruited by the LTTE, often by force.

===Accusations of ethnic cleansing===

In October 1987, the LTTE took advantage of communal violence in the Eastern Province, particularly in the Trincomalee District, where Tamils had previously been driven out by security forces and Sinhalese mobs in 1985. LTTE gunmen led Tamil rioters and ordered Sinhalese to leave, threatening their lives. By 4 October, 5,000 Sinhalese were made homeless. Following the suicide of 12 LTTE detainees under the Sri Lankan Army custody, LTTE massacred Sinhalese civilians throughout the Eastern Province. By the end of the week, about 200 Sinhalese were dead and 20,000 had fled the Eastern Province.

The LTTE is responsible for forcibly removing Sinhalese and Muslim inhabitants from areas under its control. Some observers described the expulsion of Muslims from the Northern Province in 1990 as &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, and the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry accused the LTTE of having carried out &quot;ethnic cleansing raids&quot; against both groups. Human Rights Watch has noted that LTTE had &quot;engaged in &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; of Sinhalese and Muslim villagers&quot;.

The eviction of Muslim residents happened in the north in 1990, and the east in 1992. Yogi, the LTTE&#x27;s political spokesman, stated that this expulsion was carried out in retaliation for the atrocities committed against Tamils in the Eastern Province by Muslims, who were seen by the LTTE as collaborators with the Sri Lankan Army.

During the peace talks in 2002, the LTTE formally apologised to the Muslims for the expulsion and invited them back, stating that the north-east also belonged to them. In 2003, the LTTE formally recognised the rights of the Muslim and Sinhalese communities to be present in the north-east in their ISGA proposals.

===Mistreatment of prisoners===
==== Executions====

The LTTE executed prisoners of war on a number of occasions despite its declaration in 1988 that it would abide by the Geneva Conventions. One such incident was the mass murder of 600 unarmed Sri Lankan Police officers in 1990, in Eastern Province, after they surrendered to the LTTE on the request of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. In 1993, LTTE killed 200 Sri Lanka Army soldiers, captured in the naval base at Pooneryn, during the Battle of Pooneryn. Few months earlier they had executed an officer and several soldiers captured during the Battle of Janakapura. In 1996, LTTE executed 207 military officers and soldiers who had surrendered to the LTTE during Battle of Mullaitivu (1996). The LTTE has also been accused of executing civilian Tamils accused of dissent. Rajan Hoole of UTHR(J) claims that various dissident sources allege that the number of Tamil dissenters and prisoners from rival armed groups clandestinely killed by the LTTE in detention or otherwise ranges from 8,000 - 20,000, although he later stated that western agencies dismissed his figures as exaggeration.

==== Torture====
The LTTE has also tortured its prisoners. The LTTE tortured suspects based on the victim&#x27;s refusal to co-operate and for giving information to the Sri Lankan army or IPKF. Torture was also practised on child soldiers who attempted to flee military service such as by being left out in the sun. Sri Lankan soldiers and police officers taken as prisoners were also tortured by the LTTE during interrogations. LTTE prison conditions were often poor and many prisoners died due to infections from their wounds. Among the methods of torture included burning with heated metal, hanging the victim upside down and beating them, slashing with razors and electroshocking. 

===War crimes===
There are allegations that war crimes were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE during the last stages of the Sri Lankan civil war. The alleged war crimes include attacks on civilians and civilian buildings by both sides; executions of combatants and prisoners by both sides; forced disappearances by the Sri Lankan military and paramilitary groups backed by them; the systematic denial of food and medicine by the government to civilians trapped in the war zone; keeping civilians as hostages by the LTTE; and recruitment of child soldiers by both the LTTE, and the TMVP, a Sri Lankan Army paramilitary group.

A panel of experts appointed by UN Secretary-General (UNSG) Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the issue of accountability with regard to any alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the final stages of the civil war found &quot;credible allegations&quot; which, if proven, indicated that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE. The panel has called on the UNSG to conduct an independent international inquiry into the alleged violations of international law.

<doc id="18610" wikidata="Q199691" url="?curid=18610" title="Laplace transform">
<text>In mathematics, the Laplace transform, named after Pierre-Simon Laplace (), is an integral transform that converts a function of a real variable (usually formula_1, in the &quot;time domain&quot;) to a function of a complex variable formula_2 (in the complex-valued frequency domain, also known as s&quot;-domain, or s&quot;-plane).

The transform is useful for converting differentiation and integration in the time domain into much easier multiplication and division in the Laplace domain (analogous to how logarithms are useful for simplifying multiplication and division into addition and subtraction). This gives the transform many applications in science and engineering, mostly as a tool for solving linear differential equations and dynamical systems by simplifying ordinary differential equations and integral equations into algebraic polynomial equations, and by simplifying convolution into multiplication. Once solved, the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.

The Laplace transform is defined (for suitable functions formula_3) by the integral
formula_4
where &quot;s&quot; is a complex number. It is related to many other transforms, most notably the Fourier transform and the Mellin transform. Formally, the Laplace transform is converted into a Fourier transform by the substitution formula_5 where formula_6 is real. However, unlike the Fourier transform, which gives the decomposition of a function into its components in each frequency, the Laplace transform of a function with suitable decay is an analytic function, and so has a convergent power series, the coefficients of which give the decomposition of a function into its moments. Also unlike the Fourier transform, when regarded in this way as an analytic function, the techniques of complex analysis, and especially contour integrals, can be used for calculations.

== History ==

The Laplace transform is named after mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace, who used a similar transform in his work on probability theory. Laplace wrote extensively about the use of generating functions (1814), and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.

Laplace&#x27;s use of generating functions was similar to what is now known as the z-transform, and he gave little attention to the continuous variable case which was discussed by Niels Henrik Abel. 

From 1744, Leonhard Euler investigated integrals of the form
formula_7
as solutions of differential equations, introducing in particular the gamma function. Joseph-Louis Lagrange was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating probability density functions, investigated expressions of the form
formula_8
which resembles a Laplace transform.

These types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace&#x27;s attention in 1782, where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations. However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than simply looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form
formula_9
akin to a Mellin transform, to transform the whole of a difference equation, in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.

Laplace also recognised that Joseph Fourier&#x27;s method of Fourier series for solving the diffusion equation could only apply to a limited region of space, because those solutions were periodic. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space. In 1821, Cauchy developed an operational calculus for the Laplace transform that could be used to study linear differential equations in much the same way the transform is now used in basic engineering. This method was popularized, and perhaps rediscovered, by Oliver Heaviside around the turn of the century.

Bernhard Riemann used the Laplace transform in his 1859 paper &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;, in which he also developed the inversion theorem. Riemann used the Laplace transform to develop the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function, and this method is still used to related the modular transformation law of the Jacobi theta function, which is simple to prove via Poisson summation, to the functional equation. 

Hjalmar Mellin was among the first to study the Laplace transform, rigorously in the Karl Weierstrass school of analysis, and apply it to the study of differential equations and special functions, at the turn of the 20th century. At around the same time, Heaviside was busy with his operational calculus. Thomas Joannes Stieltjes considered a generalization of the Laplace transform connected to his work on moments. Other contributors in this time period included Mathias Lerch, Oliver Heaviside, and Thomas Bromwich.

In 1934, Raymond Paley and Norbert Wiener published the important work &quot;Fourier transforms in the complex domain&quot;, about what is now called the Laplace transform (see below). Also during the 30s, the Laplace transform was instrumental in G H Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood&#x27;s study of tauberian theorems, and this application was later expounded on by Widder (1941), who developed other aspects of the theory such as a new method for inversion. Edward Charles Titchmarsh wrote the influential &quot;Introduction to the theory of the Fourier integral&quot; (1937).

The current widespread use of the transform (mainly in engineering) came about during and soon after World War II, replacing the earlier Heaviside operational calculus. The advantages of the Laplace transform had been emphasized by Gustav Doetsch, to whom the name Laplace transform is apparently due.

== Formal definition ==
The Laplace transform of a function , defined for all real numbers , is the function , which is a unilateral transform defined by

where &quot;s&quot; is a complex frequency-domain parameter
formula_10
with real numbers and .

An alternate notation for the Laplace transform is formula_11 instead of , often written as formula_12 in an abuse of notation.

The meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest. A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that must be locally integrable on . For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of exponential type (formula_13), the integral can be understood to be a (proper) Lebesgue integral. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a conditionally convergent improper integral at . Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a weak sense, and this is dealt with below.

One can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure by the Lebesgue integral
formula_14

An important special case is where is a probability measure, for example, the Dirac delta function. In operational calculus, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function . In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes
formula_15
where the lower limit of is shorthand notation for
formula_16

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform.

=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===
When one says &quot;the Laplace transform&quot; without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is usually intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the &quot;bilateral Laplace transform&quot;, or two-sided Laplace transform, by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis. If that is done, the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform, where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the Heaviside step function.

The bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:

An alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is formula_17, instead of .

=== Inverse Laplace transform ===

Two integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of Lebesgue measure zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a one-to-one mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range.

Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space , or more generally tempered distributions on . The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.

In these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of analytic functions in the region of convergence. The inverse Laplace transform is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the Bromwich integral, the Fourier–Mellin integral, and Mellin&#x27;s inverse formula):

where is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of . In most applications, the contour can be closed, allowing the use of the residue theorem. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by Post&#x27;s inversion formula. The limit here is interpreted in the weak-* topology.

In practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table and construct the inverse by inspection.

=== Probability theory ===
In pure and applied probability, the Laplace transform is defined as an expected value. If is a random variable with probability density function , then the Laplace transform of is given by the expectation
formula_18
where formula_19 is the expectation of random variable formula_20.

By convention, this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable itself. Here, replacing by gives the moment generating function of . The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including first passage times of stochastic processes such as Markov chains, and renewal theory.

Of particular use is the ability to recover the cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable by means of the Laplace transform as follows:
formula_21

=== Algebraic construction ===

The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined in a purely algebraic manner by applying a field of fractions construction to the convolution ring of functions on the positive half-line. The resulting space of abstract operators is exactly equivalent to Laplace space, but in this construction the forward and reverse transforms never need to be explicitly defined (avoiding the related difficulties with proving convergence).

== Region of convergence ==

If is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform of converges provided that the limit
formula_22
exists.

The Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral
formula_23
exists as a proper Lebesgue integral. The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former but not in the latter sense.

The set of values for which converges absolutely is either of the form or , where is an extended real constant with (a consequence of the dominated convergence theorem). The constant is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of . Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form , and possibly including the lines or . The subset of values of for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence, or the domain of absolute convergence. In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of Fubini&#x27;s theorem and Morera&#x27;s theorem.

Similarly, the set of values for which converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the region of convergence (ROC). If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at , then it automatically converges for all with . Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form , possibly including some points of the boundary line .

In the region of convergence , the Laplace transform of can be expressed by integrating by parts as the integral
formula_24

That is, can effectively be expressed, in the region of convergence, as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function. In particular, it is analytic.

There are several Paley–Wiener theorems concerning the relationship between the decay properties of , and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.

In engineering applications, a function corresponding to a linear time-invariant (LTI) system is &quot;stable&quot; if every bounded input produces a bounded output. This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region . As a result, LTI systems are stable, provided that the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.

This ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.

== Properties and theorems ==
The Laplace transform&#x27;s key property is that it converts differentiation and integration in the time domain into multiplication and division by in the Laplace domain. Thus, the Laplace variable is also known as an &quot;operator variable&quot; in the Laplace domain: either the &quot;derivative operator&quot; or (for the &quot;integration operator&quot;.

Given the functions and , and their respective Laplace transforms and ,
formula_25

the following table is a list of properties of unilateral Laplace transform:

; Initial value theorem
:formula_26
; Final value theorem
:formula_27, if all poles of formula_28 are in the left half-plane.
:The final value theorem is useful because it gives the long-term behaviour without having to perform partial fraction decompositions (or other difficult algebra). If has a pole in the right-hand plane or poles on the imaginary axis (e.g., if formula_29 or formula_30), then the behaviour of this formula is undefined.

=== Relation to power series ===
The Laplace transform can be viewed as a continuous analogue of a power series. If is a discrete function of a positive integer , then the power series associated to is the series
formula_31
where is a real variable (see &quot;Z-transform&quot;). Replacing summation over with integration over , a continuous version of the power series becomes
formula_32
where the discrete function is replaced by the continuous one .

Changing the base of the power from to gives
formula_33

For this to converge for, say, all bounded functions , it is necessary to require that . Making the substitution gives just the Laplace transform:
formula_34

In other words, the Laplace transform is a continuous analog of a power series, in which the discrete parameter is replaced by the continuous parameter , and is replaced by .

=== Relation to moments ===

The quantities
formula_35

are the &quot;moments&quot; of the function . If the first moments of converge absolutely, then by repeated differentiation under the integral, 
formula_36
This is of special significance in probability theory, where the moments of a random variable are given by the expectation values formula_37. Then, the relation holds
formula_38

=== Transform of a function&#x27;s derivative ===
It is often convenient to use the differentiation property of the Laplace transform to find the transform of a function&#x27;s derivative. This can be derived from the basic expression for a Laplace transform as follows:
formula_39
yielding
formula_40
and in the bilateral case,
formula_41

The general result
formula_42
where formula_43 denotes the th derivative of , can then be established with an inductive argument.

=== Evaluating integrals over the positive real axis ===
A useful property of the Laplace transform is the following:
formula_44
under suitable assumptions on the behaviour of formula_45 in a right neighbourhood of formula_46 and on the decay rate of formula_45 in a left neighbourhood of formula_48. The above formula is a variation of integration by parts, with the operators 
formula_49 and formula_50 being replaced by formula_51 and formula_52. Let us prove the equivalent formulation:
formula_53

By plugging in formula_54 the left-hand side turns into:
formula_55
but assuming Fubini&#x27;s theorem holds, by reversing the order of integration we get the wanted right-hand side.

This method can be used to compute integrals that would otherwise be difficult to compute using elementary methods of real calculus. For example,
formula_56

== Relationship to other transforms ==

=== Laplace–Stieltjes transform ===
The (unilateral) Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a function is defined by the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral

formula_57

The function is assumed to be of bounded variation. If is the antiderivative of :

formula_58

then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of and the Laplace transform of coincide. In general, the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the Stieltjes measure associated to . So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its cumulative distribution function.

=== Fourier transform ===
Let formula_3 be a complex-valued Lebesgue integrable function supported on formula_60, and let formula_61 be its Laplace transform. Then, within the region of convergence, we have
:formula_62
which is the Fourier transform of the function formula_63.

Indeed, the Fourier transform is a special case (under certain conditions) of the bilateral Laplace transform. The main difference is that the Fourier transform of a function is a complex function of a &quot;real&quot; variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a &quot;complex&quot; variable. The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of with . A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a holomorphic function of the variable . Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a distribution is generally a well-behaved function. Techniques of complex variables can also be used to directly study Laplace transforms. As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a power series representation. This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of moments of the function. This perspective has applications in probability theory.

Formally, the Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument when the condition explained below is fulfilled,

formula_64

This convention of the Fourier transform (formula_65 in ) requires a factor of on the inverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the frequency spectrum of a signal or dynamical system.

The above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of contains the imaginary axis, .

For example, the function has a Laplace transform whose ROC is . As is a pole of , substituting in does not yield the Fourier transform of , which contains terms proportional to the Dirac delta functions .

However, a relation of the form
formula_66
holds under much weaker conditions. For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a weak limit of measures (see vague topology). General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of Paley–Wiener theorems.

=== Mellin transform ===

The Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.

If in the Mellin transform
formula_67
we set we get a two-sided Laplace transform.

=== Z-transform ===
The unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of
formula_68
where is the sampling interval (in units of time e.g., seconds) and is the sampling rate (in samples per second or hertz).

Let
formula_69
be a sampling impulse train (also called a Dirac comb) and
formula_70
be the sampled representation of the continuous-time 
formula_71

The Laplace transform of the sampled signal is
formula_72

This is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function 

formula_73
with the substitution of .

Comparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,
formula_74

The similarity between the Z- and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of time scale calculus.

=== Borel transform ===
The integral form of the Borel transform
formula_75
is a special case of the Laplace transform for an entire function of exponential type, meaning that
formula_76
for some constants and . The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. Nachbin&#x27;s theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.

=== Fundamental relationships ===
Since an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.

== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==
The following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable. For definitions and explanations, see the &quot;Explanatory Notes&quot; at the end of the table.

Because the Laplace transform is a linear operator,
* The Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of Laplace transforms of each term.formula_77
* The Laplace transform of a multiple of a function is that multiple times the Laplace transformation of that function.formula_78

Using this linearity, and various trigonometric, hyperbolic, and complex number (etc.) properties and/or identities, some Laplace transforms can be obtained from others more quickly than by using the definition directly.

The unilateral Laplace transform takes as input a function whose time domain is the non-negative reals, which is why all of the time domain functions in the table below are multiples of the Heaviside step function, .

The entries of the table that involve a time delay are required to be causal (meaning that ). A causal system is a system where the impulse response is zero for all time prior to . In general, the region of convergence for causal systems is not the same as that of anticausal systems.

== &quot;s&quot;-domain equivalent circuits and impedances ==
The Laplace transform is often used in circuit analysis, and simple conversions to the -domain of circuit elements can be made. Circuit elements can be transformed into impedances, very similar to phasor impedances.

Here is a summary of equivalents:

Note that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the -domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the -domain account for that.

The equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.

== Examples and applications ==
The Laplace transform is used frequently in engineering and physics; the output of a linear time-invariant system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see control theory. The Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a system, the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.

The Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra. The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform. English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.

=== Evaluating improper integrals ===
Let formula_111. Then (see the table above)

formula_112

From which one gets:

formula_113

In the limit formula_114, one gets
formula_115
provided that the interchange of limits can be justified. This is often possible as a consequence of the final value theorem. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with , proceeding formally one has
formula_116

The validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a Frullani integral.

Another example is Dirichlet integral.

=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===
In the theory of electrical circuits, the current flow in a capacitor is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (with equations as for the SI unit system). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation
formula_117
where is the capacitance of the capacitor, is the electric current through the capacitor as a function of time, and is the voltage across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.

Taking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain
formula_118
where
formula_119
and
formula_120

Solving for we have
formula_121

The definition of the complex impedance (in ohms) is the ratio of the complex voltage divided by the complex current while holding the initial state at zero:
formula_122

Using this definition and the previous equation, we find:
formula_123
which is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. In addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.

=== Impulse response ===
Consider a linear time-invariant system with transfer function
formula_124

The impulse response is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:
formula_125

;Partial fraction expansion

To evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding using the method of partial fraction expansion,
formula_126

The unknown constants and are the residues located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that singularity to the transfer function&#x27;s overall shape.

By the residue theorem, the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue , we multiply both sides of the equation by to get
formula_127

Then by letting , the contribution from vanishes and all that is left is
formula_128

Similarly, the residue is given by
formula_129

Note that
formula_130
and so the substitution of and into the expanded expression for gives
formula_131

Finally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see &quot;Item&quot; #&quot;3&quot; in the &quot;Table of Laplace Transforms&quot;, above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of to obtain
formula_132
which is the impulse response of the system.

;Convolution
The same result can be achieved using the convolution property as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions and . That is, the inverse of
formula_133
is
formula_134

=== Phase delay ===
Starting with the Laplace transform,
formula_135
we find the inverse by first rearranging terms in the fraction:
formula_136

We are now able to take the inverse Laplace transform of our terms:
formula_137

This is just the sine of the sum of the arguments, yielding:
formula_138

We can apply similar logic to find that
formula_139

=== Statistical mechanics ===
In statistical mechanics, the Laplace transform of the density of states formula_140 defines the partition function. That is, the canonical partition function formula_141 is given by
formula_142
and the inverse is given by
formula_143

===Spatial (not time) structure from astronomical spectrum===
The wide and general applicability of the Laplace transform and its inverse is illustrated by an application in astronomy which provides some information on the &quot;spatial distribution&quot; of matter of an astronomical source of radiofrequency thermal radiation too distant to resolve as more than a point, given its flux density spectrum, rather than relating the &quot;time&quot; domain with the spectrum (frequency domain).

Assuming certain properties of the object, e.g. spherical shape and constant temperature, calculations based on carrying out an inverse Laplace transformation on the spectrum of the object can produce the only possible model of the distribution of matter in it (density as a function of distance from the center) consistent with the spectrum. When independent information on the structure of an object is available, the inverse Laplace transform method has been found to be in good agreement.

===Birth and death processes===
Consider a random walk, with steps formula_144 occurring with probabilities formula_145. Suppose also that the time step is an Poisson process, with parameter formula_146. Then the probability of the walk being at the lattice point formula_147 at time formula_1 is
:formula_149
This leads to a system of integral equations (or equivalently a system of differential equations). However, because it is a system of convolution equations, the Laplace transform converts it into a system of linear equations for
:formula_150
namely:
:formula_151
which may now be solved by standard methods.

===Tauberian theory===
The Laplace transform of the measure formula_152 on formula_60 is given by
:formula_154
It is intuitively clear that, for small formula_155, the exponentially decaying integrand will become more sensitive to the concentration of the measure formula_152 on larger subsets of the domain. To make this more precise, introduce the distribution function:
:formula_157
Formally, we expect a limit of the following kind:
:formula_158
Tauberian theorems are theorems relating the asymptotics of the Laplace transform, as formula_159, to those of the distribution of formula_152 as formula_161. They are thus of importance in asymptotic formulae of probability and statistics, where often the spectral side has asymptotics that are simpler to infer.

Two tauberian theorems of note are the Hardy–Littlewood tauberian theorem and the Wiener tauberian theorem. The Wiener theorem generalizes the Ikehara tauberian theorem, which is the following statement:

Let &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) be a non-negative, monotonic nondecreasing function of &quot;x&quot;, defined for 0 ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; ∞. Suppose that

:formula_162

converges for ℜ(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 1 to the function &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) and that, for some non-negative number &quot;c&quot;,

:formula_163

has an extension as a continuous function for ℜ(&quot;s&quot;) ≥ 1.
Then the limit as &quot;x&quot; goes to infinity of &quot;e&quot;−&quot;x&quot; &quot;A&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is equal to c.

This statement can be applied in particular to the logarithmic derivative of Riemann zeta function, and thus provides an extremely short way to prove the prime number theorem.

<text>A liberal arts college or liberal arts institution of higher education is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts of humanities and science. Such colleges aim to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional or vocational curriculum. Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including general sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model.

There is no formal definition of a liberal arts college, but one American authority defines them as schools that &quot;emphasize undergraduate education and award at least half of their degrees in the liberal arts fields of study&quot;. Other researchers have adopted similar definitions.

Although many liberal arts colleges are exclusively undergraduate, some also offer graduate programs that lead to a master&#x27;s degree or doctoral degree in subjects such as English, general biology, fine arts, and law. Similarly, the term &quot;liberal arts college&quot; most commonly refers to an independent institution with a specialty in non-vocational coursework. It may also sometimes refer to a university college within or affiliated with a larger university. Most liberal arts colleges outside the United States follow this model.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

Liberal arts colleges are distinguished from other types of higher education chiefly by their generalist curricula and small size. These attributes have various secondary effects in terms of administration as well as student experience. For example, class size is usually much lower at liberal arts colleges than at universities, and faculty at liberal arts colleges typically focus on teaching more than research.

From a student perspective, a liberal arts college typically differs from other forms of higher education in the following areas: higher overall student satisfaction, a general feeling that professors take a personal interest in the student&#x27;s education, and perception of encouragement to participate in discussion. Many students select liberal arts colleges with precisely this sense of personal connection in mind.

From an administrative standpoint, the small size of liberal arts colleges contributes to their cohesion and ability to survive through difficult times. Job satisfaction is also typically higher in liberal arts colleges, for both faculty and staff. The smaller size also makes it feasible for liberal arts colleges to adopt relatively experimental or divergent approaches, such as the Great Books curriculum at St. John&#x27;s or Shimer, or the radically interdisciplinary curriculum of Marlboro.

In addition, most liberal arts colleges are primarily residential, which means students live and learn away from home, often for the first time.

The distinctiveness of these attributes is somewhat eroded by the tendency of universities to adopt aspects of the liberal arts college, and vice versa. For example, several American universities, including the University of California campuses in Santa Cruz and San Diego, developed a cluster colleges model in which small liberal-arts-college-like units within a larger university form a &quot;honeycomb of residential colleges&quot;. In addition, some universities have maintained a sub-unit that preserves many aspects of the liberal arts college, such as Columbia College within Columbia University.

Liberal arts colleges themselves sometimes cluster to offer greater curricular breadth or share other resources (for instance Colgate University and Hamilton College in New York allow cross enrollment).

== Liberal arts and liberal arts college ==
In academia, liberal arts generally refer to subjects or skills that aim to provide general knowledge and comprise the arts, humanities, general sciences, and social sciences (rather than professional or technical skills). Most liberal arts colleges, however, also offer courses in subjects that are not traditionally considered part of the liberal arts, such as computer science.

==Globally==

Liberal arts colleges are found in all parts of the world. Notwithstanding the European origins of the concept of liberal arts education, today the term is largely associated with the United States, and most self-identified liberal arts colleges worldwide are built on the American model. The Global Liberal Arts Alliance, which incorporates institutions on five continents, refers to itself as &quot;an international, multilateral partnership of American style liberal arts institutions&quot;.

In 2009, liberal arts colleges from around the world formed the Global Liberal Arts Alliance, an international consortium and &quot;matching service&quot; to help liberal arts colleges in different countries deal with their shared problems.

Keep in mind, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; no longer provides rankings for liberal arts colleges at &quot;global&quot; universities. These colleges are members of the top 2,000 universities &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks around the world.

===In North America===

The liberal arts college model took root in the United States in the 19th century, as institutions spread that followed the model of early schools like Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth, although none of these early American schools are regarded as liberal arts colleges today. These colleges served as a means of spreading a basically European cultural model across the new country. The model proliferated in the 19th century; some 212 small liberal arts colleges were established between 1850 and 1899. As of 1987, there were about 540 liberal arts colleges in the United States.

The oldest liberal arts college in America is considered to be Washington College, the first college chartered after American independence. Other prominent examples in the United States include the so-called Little Ivy colleges in New England, the surviving predominantly female Seven Sisters colleges along the northeastern seaboard, the Claremont Colleges in Southern California, and the Ohio Five, but similar institutions are found all over the country. The Maple League in Canada is a consortium of four universities – Acadia, Bishop&#x27;s, Mount Allison and St. Francis Xavier – who together form an alliance of small, rural, undergraduate liberal arts education institutions with Francophone heritage and a commitment to truth and reconciliation with indigenous communities.

Most liberal arts colleges are private institutions, but a handful of public liberal arts schools exist (such as the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia).

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the top ten ranked Liberal Arts Colleges in America for 2022 were: Williams College, Amherst College, Swarthmore College, Pomona College, Wellesley College, Bowdoin College, United States Naval Academy, Claremont McKenna College, Carleton College, and Middlebury College, based on institutional stats and proprietary questionnaires .

Liberal arts colleges in Canada include Acadia University, Bishop&#x27;s University, Glendon College of York University, Mount Allison University, St. Francis Xavier University, St. Thomas University, Trent University, University of Lethbridge, and the University of King&#x27;s College.

===In South America===

The leading organization is the National Institute of Educators of Liberal Arts and Artistic Education &quot;Instituto Nacional Superior del Profesorado en Artes&quot; located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, initially created in 1923 by Ernesto de la Cárcova, under the name &quot;Escuela Nacional Superior de Bellas Artes&quot;, the original school of Liberal Arts building became the Ernesto de la Cárcova Museum. From 1983 to 2013 the institute was part of the IUNA National University Institute for the Arts, and since 2014, the Ruanova Institute of Performing Arts and Higher Education, named after Maria Ruanova, became part of the UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes, (UNA) National University of the Arts

===In Europe===
With the exception of pioneering institutions such as Franklin University Switzerland, established as a Europe-based, US-style liberal arts college in 1969, Saint Louis University Madrid Campus, established in 1967, and Richmond, The American International University in London, established in 1972 only recently have efforts been made to import the American liberal arts college model to Europe.

In the Netherlands, universities have opened constituent liberal arts colleges under the terminology &quot;university college&quot; since the late 1990s. This trend was spearheaded by Dutch sociologist Hans Adriaansens, who was &quot;frustrated with the large-scale climate of university education in the Netherlands&quot;. Dutch university colleges of this kind include Leiden University College The Hague, University College Utrecht, University College Maastricht, Amsterdam University College, University College Roosevelt, Erasmus University College, University College Groningen and University College Tilburg.

Other liberal arts colleges in continental Europe include The American University of Paris, Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts in Slovakia, Jacobs University Bremen, Bard College Berlin, the Leuphana University of Lüneburg with their Bachelor program Studium Individuale and the University College Freiburg in Germany. Bard College Berlin was founded in Berlin in 1999 as the European College of Liberal Arts, and in 2009 it introduced a 4-year Bachelor of Arts program in Value Studies taught in English and leading to an interdisciplinary degree in the humanities. In the Czech Republic, the Faculty of Humanities, Charles University, a part of Charles University started providing liberal arts education in 1994 as the Institute for Liberal Education and gained full academic autonomy in 2000.

Although liberal arts colleges as such remain rare, liberal arts degree programs are beginning to establish themselves in Europe. For example, University College Dublin offers the degree, as does St. Marys University College Belfast, both institutions coincidentally on the island of Ireland. In 2010 the University of Winchester introduced its Modern Liberal Arts undergraduate program, the first of its kind in the UK. In 2012, University College London began its interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences BASc degree (which has kinship with the liberal arts model) with 80 students. King&#x27;s College London launched the BA Liberal Arts, which has a slant towards arts, humanities and social sciences subjects. The New College of the Humanities also launched a new liberal education programme. The four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at University College Freiburg is the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012 with 78 students. The first Liberal Arts degree program in Sweden was established at Gothenburg University in 2011, followed by a Liberal Arts Bachelor Programme at Uppsala University&#x27;s Campus Gotland in the autumn of 2013. Liberal arts colleges in Italy include John Cabot University and The American University of Rome in Rome. The University College of North Staffordshire, founded in 1950 in the United Kingdom, was frequently referred to as the &quot;Keele Experiment&quot; because of its innovative curriculum and emphasis on a scholarly community resident together on campus. The college became Keele University in 1962 and continues to reflect many features of the liberal arts college model. It has been described as the closest example of a liberal arts college in the UK. This distinctiveness was reinforced with the opening of the new Keele Institute of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2016.

In September 2016 Chavagnes Studium, a Liberal Arts centre in France, began offering a 2-year intensive BA in the Liberal Arts with a Catholic perspective.

===In Asia===
Lingnan University in Hong Kong was established as a liberal arts college in the early 20th century, although it subsequently became a full-fledged university. Ginling College in Nanjing similarly followed the model of an American liberal arts college from its founding in 1915 until forced to conform with the Nationalist educational system in the 1930s. In Zhuhai City, Hong Kong Baptist University and Beijing Normal University opened United International College, which adopted the liberal arts college education system.

International Christian University in Tokyo, which opened in 1953, defines itself as &quot;Japan&#x27;s first liberal arts college&quot;. Other Japanese liberal arts programs include the other four members of the Global Five which includes School of International Liberal Studies at Waseda University, Akita International University, Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University and Sophia University&#x27;s Faculty of Liberal Arts.

Yale-NUS College was started in 2011 as Singapore&#x27;s first liberal arts college as a collaboration between Yale University in the United States and the National University of Singapore. It attracted controversy over concerns that Yale was compromising on its liberal values by opening a college in a country where there are strong curbs on freedom of speech and assembly, with Yale faculty members expressing their &quot;concern regarding the history of lack of respect for civil and political rights in the state of Singapore&quot;. In response, many existing faculty and students have noted that there has been little repression of freedom of expression at the college and that it provides a great opportunity to promote the liberal arts in Asia. In August 2021, NUS announced the closure of Yale-NUS College, with the Class of 2025 being the last cohort to receive an NUS degree. It will be replaced by NUS College, a merger between Yale-NUS College and the NUS University Scholars Programme.

Kalayaan College in the Philippines is one of the best examples of a liberal arts college in the country. Located in the New Manila district of Quezon City, it was founded in 2000 by former educators from the University of the Philippines led by José Abueva, President of the University from 1987 to 1993 and current Chairman of the KC Board of Trustees. It offers the same kind of education provided by UP to qualified students who are unable to enter the country&#x27;s premier state university because of its limited college quotas. The curriculum and grading system is patterned after the academic programs and the grade structure offered by the University of the Philippines and is composed of administrators and faculty members who graduated from UP, and/or are also members of the UP academic community.

Sogang University was founded as South Korea&#x27;s first liberal arts college. In 1960, Jesuits founded Sogang College. Although, it became Sogang University in 1970, it is still following model of American liberal arts college in many aspects. Seoul National University in South Korea established the College of Liberal Studies in 2007, initially as an educational project. However, after being established as a proper college in the SNU, it has become the only college that allows students to create their own major.

Liberal arts colleges in India include undergraduate UG or bachelor&#x27;s degree/diploma and postgraduate PG or master&#x27;s degree/diploma as well as doctoral PhD and postdoctoral studies and research, in this academic discipline. The highly ranked IIT Guwahati offers a There are also programs such as Ajeenkya DY Patil University in Pune, India, Forman Christian College in Lahore, Pakistan, Aga Khan University and Habib University in Karachi, Pakistan and FLAME University in Pune, Maharashtra, India, referred to as India&#x27;s &#x27;first college of Liberal Education&#x27;. The University is a member of the Global Liberal Arts Alliance has also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

Also, Ahmedabad University, a private, non-profit university offers its students a liberal education which is focused on research and interdisciplinary learning&quot;.&quot;

Baghdad College has offered a liberal arts curriculum since the early 20th century, but despite its name it has never offered more than a high school education. Effat University in Saudi Arabia, a women&#x27;s institution, is a member of the Global Liberal Arts Alliance. Israel&#x27;s first liberal arts college, Shalem College, was established in 2013.

===In Africa===

Three institutions in Africa are members of the Global Liberal Arts Alliance: Al Akhawayn University in Morocco, American University of Cairo in Egypt, and American University of Nigeria. The Egyptian and Nigerian schools are universities with a liberal arts component, but Al Akhawayn was founded on the model of an American liberal arts college.

Ashesi University is a liberal arts college located in Berekuso, Ghana, established in 2002. The school&#x27;s president, Patrick Awuah, described the school&#x27;s mission as &quot;educating a new generation of leaders in Africa who think ethically and who are problem solvers and have the ability and the desire to confront problems on the continent&quot;.

===In Australia===

<text>Language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language. In other words, it is how human beings gain the ability to be aware of language, to understand it, and to produce and use words and sentences to communicate.

Language acquisition involves structures, rules, and representation. The capacity to successfully use language requires human beings to acquire a range of tools, including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and an extensive vocabulary. Language can be vocalized as in speech, or manual as in sign. Human language capacity is represented in the brain. Even though human language capacity is finite, one can say and understand an infinite number of sentences, which is based on a syntactic principle called recursion. Evidence suggests that every individual has three recursive mechanisms that allow sentences to go indeterminately. These three mechanisms are: &quot;relativization&quot;, &quot;complementation&quot; and &quot;coordination&quot;.

There are two main guiding principles in first-language acquisition: speech perception always precedes speech production, and the gradually evolving system by which a child learns a language is built up one step at a time, beginning with the distinction between individual phonemes.

For many years, linguists interested in child language acquisition have questioned how language is acquired. Lidz et al. state, &quot;The question of how these structures are acquired, then, is more properly understood as the question of how a learner takes the surface forms in the input and converts them into abstract linguistic rules and representations.&quot;

Language acquisition usually refers to first-language acquisition. It studies infants&#x27; acquisition of their native language, whether that is a spoken language or a sign language, though it can also refer to [[Simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual first language acquisition]] (BFLA), referring to an infant&#x27;s simultaneous acquisition of two native languages. This is distinguished from &quot;second-language acquisition&quot;, which deals with the acquisition (in both children and adults) of additional languages. On top of speech, reading and writing a language with an entirely different script increases the complexities of true foreign language literacy. Language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits.

==History==
Some early observation-based ideas about language acquisition were proposed by Plato, who felt that word-meaning mapping in some form was innate. Additionally, Sanskrit grammarians debated for over twelve centuries whether humans&#x27; ability to recognize the meaning of words was god-given (possibly innate) or passed down by previous generations and learned from already established conventions: a child learning the word for &quot;cow&quot; by listening to trusted speakers talking about cows.

Philosophers in ancient societies were interested in how humans acquired the ability to understand and produce language well before empirical methods for testing those theories were developed, but for the most part they seemed to regard language acquisition as a subset of man&#x27;s ability to acquire knowledge and learn concepts.

Empiricists, like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, argued that knowledge (and, for Locke, language) emerge ultimately from abstracted sense impressions. These arguments lean towards the &quot;nurture&quot; side of the argument: that language is acquired through sensory experience, which led to Rudolf Carnap&#x27;s Aufbau, an attempt to learn all knowledge from sense datum, using the notion of &quot;remembered as similar&quot; to bind them into clusters, which would eventually map into language.

Proponents of behaviorism argued that language may be learned through a form of operant conditioning. In B. F. Skinner&#x27;s &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; (1957), he suggested that the successful use of a sign, such as a word or lexical unit, given a certain stimulus, reinforces its &quot;momentary&quot; or contextual probability. Since operant conditioning is contingent on reinforcement by rewards, a child would learn that a specific combination of sounds stands for a specific thing through repeated successful associations made between the two. A &quot;successful&quot; use of a sign would be one in which the child is understood (for example, a child saying &quot;up&quot; when they want to be picked up) and rewarded with the desired response from another person, thereby reinforcing the child&#x27;s understanding of the meaning of that word and making it more likely that they will use that word in a similar situation in the future. Some empiricist theories of language acquisition include the statistical learning theory. Charles F. Hockett of language acquisition, relational frame theory, functionalist linguistics, social interactionist theory, and usage-based language acquisition.

Skinner&#x27;s behaviorist idea was strongly attacked by Noam Chomsky in a review article in 1959, calling it &quot;largely mythology&quot; and a &quot;serious delusion.&quot; Arguments against Skinner&#x27;s idea of language acquisition through operant conditioning include the fact that children often ignore language corrections from adults. Instead, children typically follow a pattern of using an irregular form of a word correctly, making errors later on, and eventually returning to the proper use of the word. For example, a child may correctly learn the word &quot;gave&quot; (past tense of &quot;give&quot;), and later on use the word &quot;gived&quot;. Eventually, the child will typically go back to using the correct word, &quot;gave&quot;. Chomsky claimed the pattern is difficult to attribute to Skinner&#x27;s idea of operant conditioning as the primary way that children acquire language. Chomsky argued that if language were solely acquired through behavioral conditioning, children would not likely learn the proper use of a word and suddenly use the word incorrectly. Chomsky believed that Skinner failed to account for the central role of syntactic knowledge in language competence. Chomsky also rejected the term &quot;learning&quot;, which Skinner used to claim that children &quot;learn&quot; language through operant conditioning. Instead, Chomsky argued for a mathematical approach to language acquisition, based on a study of syntax.

==As a typically human phenomenon==
The capacity to acquire and use language is a key aspect that distinguishes humans from other beings. Although it is difficult to pin down what aspects of language are uniquely human, there are a few design features that can be found in all known forms of human language, but that are missing from forms of animal communication. For example, many animals are able to communicate with each other by signaling to the things around them, but this kind of communication lacks the arbitrariness of human vernaculars (in that there is nothing about the sound of the word &quot;dog&quot; that would hint at its meaning). Other forms of animal communication may utilize arbitrary sounds, but are unable to combine those sounds in different ways to create completely novel messages that can then be automatically understood by another. Hockett called this design feature of human language &quot;productivity&quot;. It is crucial to the understanding of human language acquisition that humans are not limited to a finite set of words, but, rather, must be able to understand and utilize a complex system that allows for an infinite number of possible messages. So, while many forms of animal communication exist, they differ from human language in that they have a limited range of vocabulary tokens, and the vocabulary items are not combined syntactically to create phrases.

Herbert S. Terrace conducted a study on a chimpanzee known as Nim Chimpsky in an attempt to teach him American Sign Language. This study was an attempt to further research done with a chimpanzee named Washoe, who was reportedly able to acquire American Sign Language. However, upon further inspection, Terrace concluded that both experiments were failures. While Nim was able to acquire signs, he never acquired a knowledge of grammar, and was unable to combine signs in a meaningful way. Researchers noticed that &quot;signs that seemed spontaneous were, in fact, cued by teachers&quot;, and not actually productive. When Terrace reviewed Project Washoe, he found similar results. He postulated that there is a fundamental difference between animals and humans in their motivation to learn language; animals, such as in Nim&#x27;s case, are motivated only by physical reward, while humans learn language in order to &quot;create a new type of communication&quot;.

In another language acquisition study, Jean-Marc-Gaspard Itard attempted to teach Victor of Aveyron, a feral child, how to speak. Victor was able to learn a few words, but ultimately never fully acquired language. Slightly more successful was a study done on Genie, another child never introduced to society. She had been entirely isolated for the first thirteen years of her life by her father. Caretakers and researchers attempted to measure her ability to learn a language. She was able to acquire a large vocabulary, but never acquired grammatical knowledge. Researchers concluded that the theory of a critical period was Genie was too old to learn how to speak productively, although she was still able to comprehend language.

==General approaches==

A major debate in understanding language acquisition is how these capacities are picked up by infants from the linguistic input. Input in the linguistic context is defined as &quot;All words, contexts, and other forms of language to which a learner is exposed, relative to acquired proficiency in first or second languages&quot;. Nativists such as Chomsky have focused on the hugely complex nature of human grammars, the finiteness and ambiguity of the input that children receive, and the relatively limited cognitive abilities of an infant. From these characteristics, they conclude that the process of language acquisition in infants must be tightly constrained and guided by the biologically given characteristics of the human brain. Otherwise, they argue, it is extremely difficult to explain how children, within the first five years of life, routinely master the complex, largely tacit grammatical rules of their native language. Additionally, the evidence of such rules in their native language is all indirect—adult speech to children cannot encompass all of what children know by the time they have acquired their native language.

Other scholars, however, have resisted the possibility that infants&#x27; routine success at acquiring the grammar of their native language requires anything more than the forms of learning seen with other cognitive skills, including such mundane motor skills as learning to ride a bike. In particular, there has been resistance to the possibility that human biology includes any form of specialization for language. This conflict is often referred to as the &quot;nature and nurture&quot; debate. Of course, most scholars acknowledge that certain aspects of language acquisition must result from the specific ways in which the human brain is &quot;wired&quot; (a &quot;nature&quot; component, which accounts for the failure of non-human species to acquire human languages) and that certain others are shaped by the particular language environment in which a person is raised (a &quot;nurture&quot; component, which accounts for the fact that humans raised in different societies acquire different languages). The as-yet unresolved question is the extent to which the specific cognitive capacities in the &quot;nature&quot; component are also used outside of language.

=== Emergentism ===
Emergentist theories, such as Brian MacWhinney&#x27;s competition model, posit that language acquisition is a cognitive process that emerges from the interaction of biological pressures and the environment. According to these theories, neither nature nor nurture alone is sufficient to trigger language learning; both of these influences must work together in order to allow children to acquire a language. The proponents of these theories argue that general cognitive processes subserve language acquisition and that the result of these processes is language-specific phenomena, such as word learning and grammar acquisition. The findings of many empirical studies support the predictions of these theories, suggesting that language acquisition is a more complex process than many have proposed.

===Empiricism===

Although Chomsky&#x27;s theory of a generative grammar has been enormously influential in the field of linguistics since the 1950s, many criticisms of the basic assumptions of generative theory have been put forth by cognitive-functional linguists, who argue that language structure is created through language use. These linguists argue that the concept of a language acquisition device (LAD) is unsupported by evolutionary anthropology, which tends to show a gradual adaptation of the human brain and vocal cords to the use of language, rather than a sudden appearance of a complete set of binary parameters delineating the whole spectrum of possible grammars ever to have existed and ever to exist. On the other hand, cognitive-functional theorists use this anthropological data to show how human beings have evolved the capacity for grammar and syntax to meet our demand for linguistic symbols. (Binary parameters are common to digital computers, but may not be applicable to neurological systems such as the human brain.)

Further, the generative theory has several constructs (such as movement, empty categories, complex underlying structures, and strict binary branching) that cannot possibly be acquired from any amount of linguistic input. It is unclear that human language is actually &quot;anything like&quot; the generative conception of it. Since language, as imagined by nativists, is unlearnably complex, subscribers to this theory argue that it must, therefore, be innate. Nativists hypothesize that some features of syntactic categories exist even before a child is exposed to any experience—categories on which children map words of their language as they learn their native language. A different theory of language, however, may yield different conclusions. While all theories of language acquisition posit some degree of innateness, they vary in how much value they place on this innate capacity to acquire language. Empiricism places less value on the innate knowledge, arguing instead that the input, combined with both general and language-specific learning capacities, is sufficient for acquisition.

Since 1980, linguists studying children, such as Melissa Bowerman and Asifa Majid, and psychologists following Jean Piaget, like Elizabeth Bates and Jean Mandler, came to suspect that there may indeed be many learning processes involved in the acquisition process, and that ignoring the role of learning may have been a mistake.

In recent years, the debate surrounding the nativist position has centered on whether the inborn capabilities are language-specific or domain-general, such as those that enable the infant to visually make sense of the world in terms of objects and actions. The anti-nativist view has many strands, but a frequent theme is that language emerges from usage in social contexts, using learning mechanisms that are a part of an innate general cognitive learning apparatus. This position has been championed by David M. W. Powers, Elizabeth Bates, Catherine Snow, Anat Ninio, Brian MacWhinney, Michael Tomasello, Michael Ramscar, William O&#x27;Grady, and others. Philosophers, such as Fiona Cowie and Barbara Scholz with Geoffrey Pullum have also argued against certain nativist claims in support of empiricism.

The new field of cognitive linguistics has emerged as a specific counter to Chomsky&#x27;s Generative Grammar and to Nativism.

====Statistical learning====

Some language acquisition researchers, such as Elissa Newport, Richard Aslin, and Jenny Saffran, emphasize the possible roles of general learning mechanisms, especially statistical learning, in language acquisition. The development of connectionist models that when implemented are able to successfully learn words and syntactical conventions supports the predictions of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, as do empirical studies of children&#x27;s detection of word boundaries. In a series of connectionist model simulations, Franklin Chang has demonstrated that such a domain general statistical learning mechanism could explain a wide range of language structure acquisition phenomena.

Statistical learning theory suggests that, when learning language, a learner would use the natural statistical properties of language to deduce its structure, including sound patterns, words, and the beginnings of grammar. That is, language learners are sensitive to how often syllable combinations or words occur in relation to other syllables. Infants between 21 and 23 months old are also able to use statistical learning to develop &quot;lexical categories&quot;, such as an animal category, which infants might later map to newly learned words in the same category. These findings suggest that early experience listening to language is critical to vocabulary acquisition.

The statistical abilities are effective, but also limited by what qualifies as input, what is done with that input, and by the structure of the resulting output. Statistical learning (and more broadly, distributional learning) can be accepted as a component of language acquisition by researchers on either side of the &quot;nature and nurture&quot; debate. From the perspective of that debate, an important question is whether statistical learning can, by itself, serve as an alternative to nativist explanations for the grammatical constraints of human language.

==== Chunking ====

The central idea of these theories is that language development occurs through the incremental acquisition of meaningful chunks of elementary constituents, which can be words, phonemes, or syllables. Recently, this approach has been highly successful in simulating several phenomena in the acquisition of syntactic categories and the acquisition of phonological knowledge.

Chunking theories of language acquisition constitute a group of theories related to statistical learning theories, in that they assume that the input from the environment plays an essential role; however, they postulate different learning mechanisms.

Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking, with &#x27;slots&#x27; into which they put certain kinds of words. A significant outcome of this research is that rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.

This approach has several features that make it unique: the models are implemented as computer programs, which enables clear-cut and quantitative predictions to be made; they learn from naturalistic input—actual child-directed utterances; and attempt to create their own utterances, the model was tested in languages including English, Spanish, and German. Chunking for this model was shown to be most effective in learning a first language but was able to create utterances learning a second language.

===Relational frame theory===

The relational frame theory (RFT) (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, 2001), provides a wholly selectionist/learning account of the origin and development of language competence and complexity. Based upon the principles of Skinnerian behaviorism, RFT posits that children acquire language purely through interacting with the environment. RFT theorists introduced the concept of functional contextualism in language learning, which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events, such as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, by focusing on manipulable variables in their own context. RFT distinguishes itself from Skinner&#x27;s work by identifying and defining a particular type of operant conditioning known as derived relational responding, a learning process that, to date, appears to occur only in humans possessing a capacity for language. Empirical studies supporting the predictions of RFT suggest that children learn language through a system of inherent reinforcements, challenging the view that language acquisition is based upon innate, language-specific cognitive capacities.

=== Social interactionism ===

Social interactionist theory is an explanation of language development emphasizing the role of social interaction between the developing child and linguistically knowledgeable adults. It is based largely on the socio-cultural theories of Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky, and was made prominent in the Western world by Jerome Bruner.

Unlike other approaches, it emphasizes the role of feedback and reinforcement in language acquisition. Specifically, it asserts that much of a child&#x27;s linguistic growth stems from modeling of and interaction with parents and other adults, who very frequently provide instructive correction. It is thus somewhat similar to behaviorist accounts of language learning. It differs substantially, though, in that it posits the existence of a social-cognitive model and other mental structures within children (a sharp contrast to the &quot;black box&quot; approach of classical behaviorism).

Another key idea within the theory of social interactionism is that of the zone of proximal development. This is a theoretical construct denoting the set of tasks a child is capable of performing with guidance but not alone. As applied to language, it describes the set of linguistic tasks (for example, proper syntax, suitable vocabulary usage) that a child cannot carry out on its own at a given time, but can learn to carry out if assisted by an able adult.

=== Syntax, morphology, and generative grammar ===
As syntax began to be studied more closely in the early 20th century in relation to language learning, it became apparent to linguists, psychologists, and philosophers that knowing a language was not merely a matter of associating words with concepts, but that a critical aspect of language involves knowledge of how to put words together; sentences are usually needed in order to communicate successfully, not just isolated words. A child will use short expressions such as &quot;Bye-bye Mummy&quot; or &quot;All-gone milk&quot;, which actually are combinations of individual nouns and an operator, before they begin to produce gradually more complex sentences. In the 1990s, within the principles and parameters framework, this hypothesis was extended into a maturation-based structure building model of child language regarding the acquisition of functional categories. In this model, children are seen as gradually building up more and more complex structures, with lexical categories (like noun and verb) being acquired before functional-syntactic categories (like determiner and complementizer). It is also often found that in acquiring a language, the most frequently used verbs are irregular verbs. In learning English, for example, young children first begin to learn the past tense of verbs individually. However, when they acquire a &quot;rule&quot;, such as adding &quot;-ed&quot; to form the past tense, they begin to exhibit occasional overgeneralization errors (e.g. &quot;runned&quot;, &quot;hitted&quot;) alongside correct past tense forms. One influential proposal regarding the origin of this type of error suggests that the adult state of grammar stores each irregular verb form in memory and also includes a &quot;block&quot; on the use of the regular rule for forming that type of verb. In the developing child&#x27;s mind, retrieval of that &quot;block&quot; may fail, causing the child to erroneously apply the regular rule instead of retrieving the irregular.

=== Merge (linguistics)-based theory ===
In bare-phrase structure (minimalist program), theory-internal considerations define the specifier position of an internal-merge projection (phases vP and CP) as the only type of host which could serve as potential landing-sites for move-based elements displaced from lower down within the base-generated VP structure—e.g. A-movement such as passives ([&quot;The apple was eaten by [John (ate the apple)&quot;]]), or raising [&quot;Some work does seem to remain [(There) does seem to remain (some work)&quot;]]). As a consequence, any strong version of a structure building model of child language which calls for an exclusive &quot;external-merge/argument structure stage&quot; prior to an &quot;internal-merge/scope-discourse related stage&quot; would claim that young children&#x27;s stage-1 utterances lack the ability to generate and host elements derived via movement operations. In terms of a merge-based theory of language acquisition, complements and specifiers are simply notations for first-merge (= &quot;complement-of&quot; [head-complement]), and later second-merge (= &quot;specifier-of&quot; [specifier-head], with merge always forming to a head. First-merge establishes only a set {a, b} and is not an ordered pair—e.g., an {N, N}-compound of &#x27;boat-house&#x27; would allow the ambiguous readings of either &#x27;a kind of house&#x27; and/or &#x27;a kind of boat&#x27;. It is only with second-merge that order is derived out of a set {a {a, b}} which yields the recursive properties of syntax—e.g., a &#x27;house-boat&#x27; {house {house, boat}} now reads unambiguously only as a &#x27;kind of boat&#x27;. It is this property of recursion that allows for projection and labeling of a phrase to take place; in this case, that the Noun &#x27;boat&#x27; is the Head of the compound, and &#x27;house&#x27; acting as a kind of specifier/modifier. External-merge (first-merge) establishes substantive &#x27;base structure&#x27; inherent to the VP, yielding theta/argument structure, and may go beyond the lexical-category VP to involve the functional-category light verb vP. Internal-merge (second-merge) establishes more formal aspects related to edge-properties of scope and discourse-related material pegged to CP. In a Phase-based theory, this twin vP/CP distinction follows the &quot;duality of semantics&quot; discussed within the Minimalist Program, and is further developed into a dual distinction regarding a probe-goal relation. As a consequence, at the &quot;external/first-merge-only&quot; stage, young children would show an inability to interpret readings from a given ordered pair, since they would only have access to the mental parsing of a non-recursive set. (See Roeper for a full discussion of recursion in child language acquisition). In addition to word-order violations, other more ubiquitous results of a first-merge stage would show that children&#x27;s initial utterances lack the recursive properties of inflectional morphology, yielding a strict Non-inflectional stage-1, consistent with an incremental Structure-building model of child language.

Generative grammar, associated especially with the work of Noam Chomsky, is currently one of the approaches to explaining children&#x27;s acquisition of syntax. Its leading idea is that human biology imposes narrow constraints on the child&#x27;s &quot;hypothesis space&quot; during language acquisition. In the principles and parameters framework, which has dominated generative syntax since Chomsky&#x27;s (1980) &quot;Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures&quot;, the acquisition of syntax resembles ordering from a menu: the human brain comes equipped with a limited set of choices from which the child selects the correct options by imitating the parents&#x27; speech while making use of the context.

An important argument which favors the generative approach, is the poverty of the stimulus argument. The child&#x27;s input (a finite number of sentences encountered by the child, together with information about the context in which they were uttered) is, in principle, compatible with an infinite number of conceivable grammars. Moreover, rarely can children rely on corrective feedback from adults when they make a grammatical error; adults generally respond and provide feedback regardless of whether a child&#x27;s utterance was grammatical or not, and children have no way of discerning if a feedback response was intended to be a correction. Additionally, when children do understand that they are being corrected, they don&#x27;t always reproduce accurate restatements. Yet, barring situations of medical abnormality or extreme privation, all children in a given speech-community converge on very much the same grammar by the age of about five years. An especially dramatic example is provided by children who, for medical reasons, are unable to produce speech and, therefore, can never be corrected for a grammatical error but nonetheless, converge on the same grammar as their typically developing peers, according to comprehension-based tests of grammar.

Considerations such as those have led Chomsky, Jerry Fodor, Eric Lenneberg and others to argue that the types of grammar the child needs to consider must be narrowly constrained by human biology (the nativist position). These innate constraints are sometimes referred to as universal grammar, the human &quot;language faculty&quot;, or the &quot;language instinct&quot;.

===Comparative method of crosslinguistic research===
The comparative method of crosslinguistic research applies the comparative method used in historical linguistics to psycholinguistic research. In historical linguistics the comparative method uses comparisons between historically related languages to reconstruct a proto-language and trace the history of each daughter language. The comparative method can be repurposed for research on language acquisition by comparing historically related child languages. The historical ties within each language family provide a roadmap for research. For Indo-European languages, the comparative method would first compare language acquisition within the Slavic, Celtic, Germanic, Romance and Indo-Iranian branches of the family before attempting broader comparisons between the branches. For Otomanguean languages, the comparative method would first compare language acquisition within the Oto-pamean, Chinantecan, Tlapanecan, Popolocan, Zapotecan, Amuzgan and Mixtecan branches before attempting broader comparisons between the branches. The comparative method imposes an evaluation standard for assessing the languages used in language acquisition research.

The comparative method derives its power by assembling comprehensive datasets for each language. Descriptions of the prosody and phonology for each language inform analyses of morphology and the lexicon, which in turn inform analyses of syntax and conversational styles. Information on prosodic structure in one language informs research on the prosody of the related languages and vice versa. The comparative method produces a cumulative research program in which each description contributes to a comprehensive description of language acquisition for each language within a family as well as across the languages within each branch of the language family.

Comparative studies of language acquisition control the number of extraneous factors that impact language development. Speakers of historically related languages typically share a common culture that may include similar lifestyles and child-rearing practices. Historically related languages have similar phonologies and morphologies that impact early lexical and syntactic development in similar ways. The comparative method predicts that children acquiring historically related languages will exhibit similar patterns of language development, and that these common patterns may not hold in historically unrelated languages. The acquisition of Dutch will resemble the acquisition of German, but not the acquisition of Totonac or Mixtec. A claim about any universal of language acquisition must control for the shared grammatical structures that languages inherit from a common ancestor.

Several language acquisition studies have accidentally employed features of the comparative method due to the availability of datasets from historically related languages. Research on the acquisition of the Romance and Scandinavian languages used aspects of the comparative method, but did not produce detailed comparisons across different levels of grammar. The most advanced use of the comparative method to date appears in research on the acquisition of the Mayan languages. This research has yielded detailed comparative studies on the acquisition of phonological, lexical, morphological and syntactic features in eight Mayan languages as well as comparisons of language input and language socialization.

==Representation in the brain==
Recent advances in functional neuroimaging technology have allowed for a better understanding of how language acquisition is manifested physically in the brain. Language acquisition almost always occurs in children during a period of rapid increase in brain volume. At this point in development, a child has many more neural connections than he or she will have as an adult, allowing for the child to be more able to learn new things than he or she would be as an adult.

===Sensitive period===

Language acquisition has been studied from the perspective of developmental psychology and neuroscience, which looks at learning to use and understand language parallel to a child&#x27;s brain development. It has been determined, through empirical research on developmentally normal children, as well as through some extreme cases of language deprivation, that there is a &quot;sensitive period&quot; of language acquisition in which human infants have the ability to learn any language. Several researchers have found that from birth until the age of six months, infants can discriminate the phonetic contrasts of all languages. Researchers believe that this gives infants the ability to acquire the language spoken around them. After this age, the child is able to perceive only the phonemes specific to the language being learned. The reduced phonemic sensitivity enables children to build phonemic categories and recognize stress patterns and sound combinations specific to the language they are acquiring. As Wilder Penfield noted, &quot;Before the child begins to speak and to perceive, the uncommitted cortex is a blank slate on which nothing has been written. In the ensuing years much is written, and the writing is normally never erased. After the age of ten or twelve, the general functional connections have been established and fixed for the speech cortex.&quot; According to the sensitive or critical period models, the age at which a child acquires the ability to use language is a predictor of how well he or she is ultimately able to use language. However, there may be an age at which becoming a fluent and natural user of a language is no longer possible; Penfield and Roberts (1959) cap their sensitive period at nine years old. The human brain very well be automatically wired to learn languages, but this ability does not last into adulthood in the same way that it exists during childhood. By around age 12, language acquisition has typically been solidified, and it becomes more difficult to learn a language in the same way a native speaker would. Just like children who speak, deaf children go through a critical period for learning language. Deaf children who acquire their first language later in life show lower performance in complex aspects of grammar. At that point, it is usually a second language that a person is trying to acquire and not a first.

Assuming that children are exposed to language during the critical period, acquiring language is almost never missed by cognitively normal children. Humans are so well-prepared to learn language that it becomes almost impossible not to. Researchers are unable to experimentally test the effects of the sensitive period of development on language acquisition, because it would be unethical to deprive children of language until this period is over. However, case studies on abused, language-deprived children show that they exhibit extreme limitations in language skills, even after instruction.

At a very young age, children can distinguish different sounds but cannot yet produce them. During infancy, children begin to babble. Deaf babies babble in the same patterns as hearing babies do, showing that babbling is not a result of babies simply imitating certain sounds, but is actually a natural part of the process of language development. Deaf babies do, however, often babble less than hearing babies, and they begin to babble later on in infancy—at approximately 11 months as compared to approximately 6 months for hearing babies.

Prelinguistic language abilities that are crucial for language acquisition have been seen even earlier than infancy. There have been many different studies examining different modes of language acquisition prior to birth. The study of language acquisition in fetuses began in the late 1980s when several researchers independently discovered that very young infants could discriminate their native language from other languages. In &quot;Mehler et al. (1988)&quot;, infants underwent discrimination tests, and it was shown that infants as young as 4 days old could discriminate utterances in their native language from those in an unfamiliar language, but could not discriminate between two languages when neither was native to them. These results suggest that there are mechanisms for fetal auditory learning, and other researchers have found further behavioral evidence to support this notion. Fetus auditory learning through environmental habituation has been seen in a variety of different modes, such as fetus learning of familiar melodies, story fragments (DeCasper &amp; Spence, 1986), recognition of mother&#x27;s voice, and other studies showing evidence of fetal adaptation to native linguistic environments.

Prosody is the property of speech that conveys an emotional state of the utterance, as well as the intended form of speech, for example, question, statement or command. Some researchers in the field of developmental neuroscience argue that fetal auditory learning mechanisms result solely from discrimination of prosodic elements. Although this would hold merit in an evolutionary psychology perspective (i.e. recognition of mother&#x27;s voice/familiar group language from emotionally valent stimuli), some theorists argue that there is more than prosodic recognition in elements of fetal learning. Newer evidence shows that fetuses not only react to the native language differently from non-native languages, but that fetuses react differently and can accurately discriminate between native and non-native vowel sounds (Moon, Lagercrantz, &amp; Kuhl, 2013). Furthermore, a 2016 study showed that newborn infants encode the edges of multisyllabic sequences better than the internal components of the sequence (Ferry et al., 2016). Together, these results suggest that newborn infants have learned important properties of syntactic processing in utero, as demonstrated by infant knowledge of native language vowels and the sequencing of heard multisyllabic phrases. This ability to sequence specific vowels gives newborn infants some of the fundamental mechanisms needed in order to learn the complex organization of a language. 
From a neuroscientific perspective, neural correlates have been found that demonstrate human fetal learning of speech-like auditory stimuli that most other studies have been analyzing (Partanen et al., 2013). In a study conducted by Partanen et al. (2013), researchers presented fetuses with certain word variants and observed that these fetuses exhibited higher brain activity in response to certain word variants as compared to controls. In this same study, &quot;a significant correlation existed between the amount of prenatal exposure and brain activity, with greater activity being associated with a higher amount of prenatal speech exposure,&quot; pointing to the important learning mechanisms present before birth that are fine-tuned to features in speech (Partanen et al., 2013).

==Vocabulary acquisition==

Learning a new word, that is, learning to speak this word and speak it on the appropriate occasions, depends upon many factors. First, the learner needs to be able to hear what they are attempting to pronounce. Also required is the capacity to engage in speech repetition. Children with reduced ability to repeat non-words (a marker of speech repetition abilities) show a slower rate of vocabulary expansion than children with normal ability. Several computational models of vocabulary acquisition have been proposed. Various studies have shown that the size of a child&#x27;s vocabulary by the age of 24 months correlates with the child&#x27;s future development and language skills. If a child knows fifty or fewer words by the age of 24 months, he or she is classified as a late-talker, and future language development, like vocabulary expansion and the organization of grammar, is likely to be slower and stunted.

Two more crucial elements of vocabulary acquisition are word segmentation and statistical learning (described above). Word segmentation, or the ability to break down words into syllables from fluent speech can be accomplished by eight-month-old infants. By the time infants are 17 months old, they are able to link meaning to segmented words.

Recent evidence also suggests that motor skills and experiences may influence vocabulary acquisition during infancy. Specifically, learning to sit independently between 3 and 5 months of age has been found to predict receptive vocabulary at both 10 and 14 months of age, and independent walking skills have been found to correlate with language skills at around 10 to 14 months of age. These findings show that language acquisition is an embodied process that is influenced by a child&#x27;s overall motor abilities and development. Studies have also shown a correlation between socioeconomic status and vocabulary acquisition.

==Meaning==

Children learn, on average, ten to fifteen new word meanings each day, but only one of these can be accounted for by direct instruction. The other nine to fourteen word meanings must have been acquired in some other way. It has been proposed that children acquire these meanings through processes modeled by latent semantic analysis; that is, when they encounter an unfamiliar word, children use contextual information to guess its rough meaning correctly. A child may expand the meaning and use of certain words that are already part of its mental lexicon in order to denominate anything that is somehow related but for which it does not know the specific word. For instance, a child may broaden the use of &quot;mummy&quot; and &quot;dada&quot; in order to indicate anything that belongs to its mother or father, or perhaps every person who resembles its own parents; another example might be to say &quot;rain&quot; while meaning &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go out&quot;.

There is also reason to believe that children use various heuristics to infer the meaning of words properly. Markman and others have proposed that children assume words to refer to objects with similar properties (&quot;cow&quot; and &quot;pig&quot; might both be &quot;animals&quot;) rather than to objects that are thematically related (&quot;cow&quot; and &quot;milk&quot; are probably not both &quot;animals&quot;). Children also seem to adhere to the &quot;whole object assumption&quot; and think that a novel label refers to an entire entity rather than to one of its parts. This assumption along with other resources, such as grammar and morphological cues or lexical constraints, may help aid the child in acquiring word meaning, but conclusions based on such resources may sometimes conflict.

==Genetic and neurocognitive research==

According to several linguists, neurocognitive research has confirmed many standards of language learning, such as: &quot;learning engages the entire person (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains), the human brain seeks patterns in its searching for meaning, emotions affect all aspects of learning, retention and recall, past experience always affects new learning, the brain&#x27;s working memory has a limited capacity, lecture usually results in the lowest degree of retention, rehearsal is essential for retention, practice [alone] does not make perfect, and each brain is unique&quot; (Sousa, 2006, p. 274). In terms of genetics, the gene ROBO1 has been associated with phonological buffer integrity or length.

Genetic research has found two major factors predicting successful language acquisition and maintenance. These include inherited intelligence, and the lack of genetic anomalies that may cause speech pathologies, such as mutations in the FOXP2 gene which cause verbal dyspraxia. The role of inherited intelligence increases with age, accounting for 20% of IQ variation in infants, and for 60% in adults. It affects a vast variety of language-related abilities, from spatio-motor skills to writing fluency. There have been debates in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and genetics, with some scholars arguing that language is fully or mostly innate, but the research evidence points to genetic factors only working in interaction with environmental ones.

Although it is difficult to determine without invasive measures which exact parts of the brain become most active and important for language acquisition, fMRI and PET technology has allowed for some conclusions to be made about where language may be centered. Kuniyoshi Sakai has proposed, based on several neuroimaging studies, that there may be a &quot;grammar center&quot; in the brain, whereby language is primarily processed in the left lateral premotor cortex (located near the pre central sulcus and the inferior frontal sulcus). Additionally, these studies have suggested that first language and second language acquisition may be represented differently in the cortex. In a study conducted by Newman et al., the relationship between cognitive neuroscience and language acquisition was compared through a standardized procedure involving native speakers of English and native Spanish speakers who all had a similar length of exposure to the English language (averaging about 26 years). It was concluded that the brain does in fact process languages differently, but rather than being related to proficiency levels, language processing relates more to the function of the brain itself.

During early infancy, language processing seems to occur over many areas in the brain. However, over time, it gradually becomes concentrated into two areas—Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area. Broca&#x27;s area is in the left frontal cortex and is primarily involved in the production of the patterns in vocal and sign language. Wernicke&#x27;s area is in the left temporal cortex and is primarily involved in language comprehension. The specialization of these language centers is so extensive that damage to them can result in aphasia.

==Language diversity==
Kelly et al. (2015: 286) comment that “There is a dawning realization that the field of child language needs data from the broadest typological array of languages and language-learning environments.” This realization is part of a broader recognition in psycholinguistics for the need to document diversity. Children&#x27;s linguistic accomplishments are all the more impressive with recognition of the diversity that exists at every level of the language system. Different levels of grammar interact in language-specific ways so that differences in morphosyntax build on differences in prosody, which in turn reflect differences in conversational style. The diversity of adult languages results in diverse child language phenomena that challenge every acquisition theory.

One such challenge is to explain how children acquire complex vowels in Otomanguean and other languages. The complex vowels in these languages combine oral and laryngeal gestures produced with laryngeal constriction [ʔ] or laryngeal spreading [h]. The production of the laryngealized vowels is complicated by the production of tonal contrasts, which rely upon contrasts in vocal fold vibration. Otomanguean languages manage the conflict between tone and laryngeal gesture by timing the gesture at the start, middle or end of the vowel, e.g. ʔV, VʔV and Vʔ. The phonetic realization of laryngealized vowels gives rise to the question of whether children acquire laryngealized vowels as single phonemes or sequences of phonemes. The unit analysis enlarges the vowel inventory but simplifies the syllable inventory, while the sequence analysis simplifies the vowel inventory but complicates the syllable inventory. The Otomanguean languages exhibit language-specific differences in the types and timing of the laryngeal gestures, and thus children must learn the specific laryngeal gestures that contribute to the phonological contrasts in the adult language.

An acquisition challenge in morphosyntax is to explain how children acquire ergative grammatical structures. Ergative languages treat the subject of intransitive verbs like the object of transitive verbs at the level of morphology, syntax or both. At the level of morphology, ergative languages assign an ergative marker to the subject of transitive verbs. The ergative marking may be realized by case markers on nouns or agreement markers on verbs. At the level of syntax, ergative languages have syntactic operations that treat the subject of transitive verbs differently from the subject of intransitive verbs. Languages with ergative syntax like K&#x27;iche&#x27; may restrict the use of subject questions for transitive verbs but not intransitive verbs. The acquisition challenge that ergativity creates is to explain how children acquire the language-specific manifestations of morphological and syntactic ergativity in the adult languages. The Mayan language Mam has ergative agreement making on its transitive verbs but extends the ergative marking to both the subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs yielding transitive verbs with two ergative agreement markers. The contexts for extended ergative marking differ in type and frequency between Mayan languages, but two-year-old children produce extended ergative marking equally proficiently despite vast differences in the frequency of extended ergative marking in the adult languages.

Children acquire language through exposure to a diverse variety of cultural practices. Local groups vary in size and mobility depending on their means of subsistence. Some cultures require men to marry women who speak another language. Their children may be exposed to their mother&#x27;s language for several years before moving in with their father and learning his language. Language groups have diverse beliefs about when children say their first words and what words they say. Such beliefs shape the time when parents perceive that children understand language. In many cultures, children hear more speech directed to others than to themselves, yet children acquire language in all cultures.

Documenting the diversity of child languages is made more urgent by the rapid loss of languages around the world. It may not be possible to document child language in half of the world&#x27;s languages by the end of this century. Documenting child language should be a part of every language documentation project, and has an important role to play in revitalizing local languages. Documenting child language preserves cultural modes of language transmission and can emphasize their significance throughout the language community.

== Artificial intelligence ==

Some algorithms for language acquisition are based on statistical machine translation. Language acquisition can be modeled as a machine learning process, which may be based on learning semantic parsers or grammar induction algorithms.

==Prelingual deafness==
Prelingual deafness is defined as hearing loss that occurred at birth or before an individual has learned to speak. In the United States, 2 to 3 out of every 1000 children are born deaf or hard of hearing. Even though it might be presumed that deaf children acquire language in different ways since they are not receiving the same auditory input as hearing children, many research findings indicate that deaf children acquire language in the same way that hearing children do and when given the proper language input, understand and express language just as well as their hearing peers. Babies who learn sign language produce signs or gestures that are more regular and more frequent than hearing babies acquiring spoken language. Just as hearing babies babble, deaf babies acquiring sign language will babble with their hands, otherwise known as manual babbling. Therefore, as many studies have shown, language acquisition by deaf children parallels the language acquisition of a spoken language by hearing children because humans are biologically equipped for language regardless of the modality.

=== Signed language acquisition ===
Deaf children&#x27;s visual-manual language acquisition not only parallel spoken language acquisition but by the age of 30 months, most deaf children that were exposed to a visual language had a more advanced grasp with subject-pronoun copy rules than hearing children. Their vocabulary bank at the ages of 12–17 months exceed that of a hearing child&#x27;s, though it does even out when they reach the two-word stage. The use of space for absent referents and the more complex handshapes in some signs prove to be difficult for children between 5 and 9 years of age because of motor development and the complexity of remembering the spatial use.

=== Cochlear implants ===
Other options besides sign language for kids with prelingual deafness include the use of hearing aids to strengthen remaining sensory cells or cochlear implants to stimulate the hearing nerve directly. Cochlear implants (often known simply as CIs) are hearing devices that are placed behind the ear and contain a receiver and electrodes which are placed under the skin and inside the cochlea. Despite these developments, there is still a risk that prelingually deaf children may not develop good speech and speech reception skills. Although cochlear implants produce sounds, they are unlike typical hearing and deaf and hard of hearing people must undergo intensive therapy in order to learn how to interpret these sounds. They must also learn how to speak given the range of hearing they may or may not have. However, deaf children of deaf parents tend to do better with language, even though they are isolated from sound and speech because their language uses a different mode of communication that is accessible to them: the visual modality of language.

Although cochlear implants were initially approved for adults, now there is pressure to implant children early in order to maximize auditory skills for mainstream learning which in turn has created controversy around the topic. Due to recent advances in technology, cochlear implants allow some deaf people to acquire some sense of hearing. There are interior and exposed exterior components that are surgically implanted. Those who receive cochlear implants earlier on in life show more improvement on speech comprehension and language. Spoken language development does vary widely for those with cochlear implants though due to a number of different factors including: age at implantation, frequency, quality and type of speech training. Some evidence suggests that speech processing occurs at a more rapid pace in some prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants than those with traditional hearing aids. However, cochlear implants may not always work.

Research shows that people develop better language with a cochlear implant when they have a solid first language to rely on to understand the second language they would be learning. In the case of prelingually deaf children with cochlear implants, a signed language, like American Sign Language would be an accessible language for them to learn to help support the use of the cochlear implant as they learn a spoken language as their L2. Without a solid, accessible first language, these children run the risk of language deprivation, especially in the case that a cochlear implant fails to work. They would have no access to sound, meaning no access to the spoken language they are supposed to be learning. If a signed language was not a strong language for them to use and neither was a spoken language, they now have no access to any language and run the risk of missing their critical period.

In June 2024, a cross-sectional study that the notable academic journal &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; published cautioned that &quot;children with CIs exhibit significant variability in speech and language development&quot;: both &quot;with too many recipients demonstrating suboptimal outcomes&quot; and also with the investigations of those individuals broadly being &quot;not well defined for prelingually deafened children with CIs, for whom language development is ongoing.&quot; The authors found that &quot;the relationships between spectral resolution, temporal resolution, and speech recognition are well defined in adults with cochlear implants (CIs)&quot; in contrast to the situation with children, and they concluded from their research that &quot;[f]urther investigation is warranted to better understand the relationships between spectral resolution, temporal resolution, and speech recognition so that&quot; medical experts methodologically &quot;can identify the underlying mechanisms driving auditory-based speech perception in children with CIs.&quot;

<text>Left Behind is a multimedia franchise of apocalyptic fiction written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, released by Tyndale House Publishers from 1995 to 2007.

The bestselling premillennial novels are Christian eschatological narratives inspired by the New Testament&#x27;s Book of Revelation. The storyline focuses on a seven-year conflict, the post-rapture Great Tribulation, between an underground network of Christian converts and an oppressive new world order led by the Antichrist. The series expounds a Christian dispensationalist view of the End Times, specifically LaHaye&#x27;s pretribulation and premillennial eschatology.

The series has been adapted into five films. The original series of three films are &quot;Left Behind: The Movie&quot; (2000), &quot;Left Behind II: Tribulation Force&quot; (2002), and &quot;Left Behind: World at War&quot; (2005). A reboot starring Nicolas Cage, entitled &quot;Left Behind&quot;, was released in 2014 through Cloud Ten Pictures. A sequel, &quot;Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist&quot;, directed by and starring Kevin Sorbo, was released in 2023. The series inspired an audio drama as well as the PC game &quot;Left Behind: Eternal Forces&quot; (2006) and its several sequels.

===Main series===
&quot;Left Behind&quot; tells an apocalyptic story about the ending of Earth (set in the contemporary era) over a period of seven years. The true believers in Jesus Christ have been raptured (taken instantly to heaven), leaving non-believers behind on Earth, now a shattered and chaotic world. As people scramble for answers, an obscure Romanian politician named Nicolae Jetty Carpathia rises to become secretary-general of the United Nations, promising to restore peace and stability to all nations. What most of the world does not realize is that Carpathia is actually the Antichrist foretold in the Bible. Coming to grips with the truth and becoming born-again Christians, airline pilot Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe, their pastor Bruce Barnes, and young journalist Cameron &quot;Buck&quot; Williams begin their quest as the Tribulation Force to help save the lost and prepare for the coming Tribulation, in which God will rain down judgment on the world for seven years.

According to James Bielo, it is based on a dispensationalist interpretation of prophecies in the Biblical books of Revelation, Daniel, Isaiah and Ezekiel.

====Characters====
====Influences on the authors====
LaHaye and Jenkins cite the influence of Russell Doughten, an Iowa-based filmmaker who directed the &quot;Thief in the Night&quot; series, a series of four low-budget but popular feature-length films in the 1970s and 1980s about the Rapture and Second Coming, starting with 1972&#x27;s &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot;. Indeed, the title &quot;Left Behind&quot; echoes the refrain of &quot;Thief&quot; early Christian rock theme song by Larry Norman, &quot;I Wish We&#x27;d All Been Ready,&quot; in which he sings, &quot;There&#x27;s no time to change your mind, the Son has come and you&#x27;ve been left behind.&quot;

The success of Frank Peretti&#x27;s pioneering Christian spiritual warfare thrillers in the 1980s and 1990s was a significant influence on the authors as well.

== Reception ==
Multiple books in the series have been on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List. Starting in 2000, Books 7 and 8 reached number one on the list followed by book 10, which debuted at number one.

In 2016, several books in the series were bestsellers and 65 million copies were sold in various languages.

=== Critical response ===
One reason often cited for the books&#x27; popularity is the quick pacing and action, and that they reflect the public&#x27;s overall concern and fascination with the Apocalypse as portrayed in the biblical book of Revelation. Michelle Goldberg has written that, &quot;On one level, the attraction of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books isn&#x27;t that much different from that of, say, Tom Clancy or Stephen King. The plotting is brisk and the characterizations Manichaean. People disappear and things blow up.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; also compared the series to Clancy&#x27;s works. However, those views are not universally shared. Other reviewers have called the series &quot;almost laughably tedious&quot; and &quot;fatuous and boring.&quot;

Jerry Falwell said about the first book in the series: &quot;In terms of its impact on Christianity, it&#x27;s probably greater than that of any other book in modern times, outside the Bible.&quot;

Laurie Goodstein, writing in 1998 for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, placed what she called the &quot;&quot;Left Behind&quot; phenomenon&quot; in the calendrical context of the approaching year 2000. Goodstein noted a &#x27;proliferation&#x27; of similarly apocalyptic texts appearing at that time, by authors such as Jim Bakker and John Hagee. Goodstein cited the opinion of University of Wisconsin historian Paul Boyer, who described such authors as &quot;cashing in on the public preoccupation with the year 2000&quot;.

Marisa Ronan places the series in the context of the American Century and American exceptionalism, &quot;proving at the fin-de-siècle that not only was the twentieth century American, it was Christian&quot;. Ronan notes that American evangelicals are portrayed as taking center stage in the apocalypse, fighting a spiritual battle against the UN&#x27;s successor – headed by the Antichrist – which in part seeks to usurp the superpower status of the United States.

While writing that the series fulfills the norms of mass-market fiction, magazine writer Michelle Goldberg also characterized the books as an attack on Judaism and liberal secularism, and suggested that the near-future &quot;end times&quot; in which the books are set seem to reflect the actual worldview of millions of Americans, including many prominent conservative leaders.

Several scholars comment on the series&#x27; setting in time: religious studies scholar Mark Juergensmeyer argues that the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books are seen as fictional representations of future events, drawing a connection between the future violence portrayed in the books and &quot;the violence in imagined worlds in the here-and now&quot;. Similarly, Andrew Strombeck additionally links the books to Derrida&#x27;s &quot;spectral time&quot;: &quot;neither the future nor the present but a kind of ghostly future that haunts the present&quot;. Glenn Shuck also contends that &quot;Left Behind&quot; &quot;does not...describe an other-worldly dystopia: it provides the shock-value of uncanny recognition of the present in a different form.&quot;

Strombeck focuses on the series&#x27; neoliberalism: &quot;in the midst of the apocalypse, good is privatized and evil state-run&quot;; he notes the characters&#x27; depictions as &quot;rational market actors first, Christians second&quot;.

==== Apocalypticism, conspiracies, and militias ====
The series&#x27; focus on apocalypticism, totalitarian conspiracies, and militias has been noted by writers including Gershom Gorenberg, Michael Joseph Gross, and Andrew Strombeck. They note themes such as fear of one-world government (in the form of the United Nations led by the Antichrist), global religion, and global currency – fought against by militias &quot;structurally equivalent to Christians&quot;. University of Notre Dame religion scholar Jason Springs regards the series&#x27; apocalypticism as one aspect that would later feed into the evangelical adoption of QAnon.

==== Violence and war ====
Some practicing Christians, evangelical and otherwise, along with non-Christians have shown concern that the social perspectives promoted in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series unduly sensationalize the death and destruction of masses of people. Harvey Cox, a professor of divinity at Harvard, says part of the appeal of the books lies in the &quot;lip-licking anticipation of all the blood&quot;, and Lutheran theologian Barbara Rossing, author of &quot;The Rapture Exposed: The Message of Hope in the Book of Revelation&quot;, said the books glorify violence. Additionally, Paul Nuechterlein accused the authors of re-sacralizing violence, adding that &quot;we human beings are the ones who put our faith in superior firepower. But in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels, the darkness of that human, satanic violence is once again attributed to God&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; said &quot;the nuclear frights of, say, Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; wouldn&#x27;t fill a chapter in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. (Large chunks of several U.S. cities have been bombed to smithereens by page 110 of Book 3.)&quot;

David Carlson, a Professor of Religious Studies and a member of the Greek Orthodox Church, wrote that the theology underpinning the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series promotes a &quot;skewed view of the Christian faith that welcomes war and disaster, while dismissing peace efforts in the Middle East and elsewhere—all in the name of Christ&quot;.

B. D. Forbes &quot;locates the series in the context of a well-established tradition of American popular culture...that presents the good-evil struggle as &#x27;evil [coming] from the outside&#x27; with &#x27;the solution [as] the destruction of the evil-doers&quot;.

==== Anti-Catholicism ====
The books are written from a Protestant viewpoint. Some believe the books are anti-Catholic, noting that many Catholics were not raptured, concluding that no religion is free of false converts and that the new pope establishes a false religion. While the fictional Pope, John XXIV, was raptured, he is described as &quot;promoting Lutheran reform&quot;, and it is implied that he was raptured for this reason. His successor, Pope Peter II, becomes Pontifex Maximus of Enigma Babylon One World Faith, an amalgam of all remaining world faiths and religions. &quot;Catholic Answers&quot; describes the series as anti-Catholic.

The co-author of the book, Jerry B. Jenkins, as well as LaHaye, stated that their books are not anti-Catholic and that they have many faithful Catholic readers and friends. According to LaHaye, &quot;the books don&#x27;t suggest any particular theology, but try to introduce people to a more personal relationship with Jesus&quot;.

==== End-times theology ====
Along with some other rapture fiction novels, the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series demonstrates a specific interpretation of the Gospel and the Christian life, one with which many have taken issue theologically. The books have not sold particularly well outside of the United States. Dispensationalism remains a minority view among theologians. For instance, amillennial and postmillennial Christians do not believe in the same timeline of the Second Coming as premillennialists, while preterist Christians interpret the Book of Revelation as events that have already been fulfilled in the 1st century. Brian McLaren of the Emergent Church compares the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series to &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, and states, &quot;What the &quot;Left Behind&quot; novels do, the way they twist scripture toward a certain theological and political end, I think [Dan] Brown is twisting scripture, just to other political ends.&quot; John Dart, writing in &quot;Christian Century&quot;, characterized the works as &quot;beam me up theology.&quot; Jason Springs argues that evangelical beliefs on the role of the modern state of Israel have been shaped by the books.

=== &quot;Left Behind: The Kids&quot; series ===
&quot;Left Behind: The Kids&quot; is a series of forty novellas written for teenagers. It has the same plot as the adult series, but the main protagonists are teenagers.

===Spinoff books===
Williams professor Glenn Shuck has written the book &quot;Marks of the Beast: The Left Behind Novels and the Struggle for Evangelical Identity,&quot; published by NYU Press in 2005. He followed this with a collection of original essays co-edited with Jeffrey J. Kripal of Rice University on the Esalen Institute in California, published by Indiana University Press in 2005.

Starting in 2003, the series was expanded upon by Mel Odom with his &quot;Apocalypse&quot; military series and Neesa Hart with her political thriller series, both taking place concurrently with the main series.

===Graphic novels===
In 2002, a series of graphic novels published by Tyndale House was launched that comprised the first two books in the series, &quot;Left Behind&quot; and &quot;Tribulation Force&quot;. The original idea was to release sets of three to five novels (each about 45–50 pages) for each book in the original series. However, after the fifth and final novel for &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; was released, the graphic novel series was discontinued, and the novels that were released are as of December 2006 out of print. A compilation of the graphic novels for the first book was later released as one novel.

==Film adaptations==

The success of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books has led to the release of five motion pictures based on the series so far. All four have been produced by brothers Paul and Peter LaLonde, and have been released through Cloud Ten Pictures, an independent Canadian-based Christian film studio.

The first, &quot;Left Behind: The Movie&quot;, was based on the first book of the series and was released in 2000. In a very unusual marketing scheme, the studio released the film on home video, and then theatrically. It fared poorly in theaters. The film starred former &quot;Growing Pains&quot; star Kirk Cameron as Buck Williams. Cameron, who praised the book series as &quot;inspiring&quot;, became a practicing evangelist (and co-host with Ray Comfort on the TV show &quot;The Way of the Master&quot;).

The sequel, &quot;Left Behind II: Tribulation Force&quot;, based on the second book, &quot;Tribulation Force&quot;, was released in 2002. The film debuted at #2 on Nielson&#x27;s video scan reports, behind &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, and was #1 in terms of overall sales for two days on Amazon.com.

The second sequel, &quot;World at War&quot;, was released first to churches on October 21, 2005, for church theatrical viewings and was released via home media on October 25. Much of the main cast from the previous two films, excluding Clarence Gilyard, reprised their respective roles for &quot;World at War&quot;. Gilyard, who played Bruce Barnes, was unable to return due to a scheduling conflict with a play in New York. It is based very loosely on the final 50 pages of &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; and features Louis Gossett Jr. as the President of the United States, Gerald Fitzhugh. The third installment was the least identifiable with events in any of the books. Recognizable events were the marriages of Buck with Chloe Steele, and of Rayford Steele with Amanda White; the death of Bruce Barnes; and President Fitzhugh&#x27;s heading an attack, resulting in World War III, with Great Britain and Egypt fighting against the Global Community. Major parts, however, were taken from subsequent books; these events include the poisoning of Barnes by GC forces, instead of Nicolae Carpathia himself, and an attempt by Fitzhugh to assassinate Carpathia. Buck&#x27;s meeting with the President in the books takes a different form in the film.

The film series have been criticized for, among other things, low production values. A &quot;Slate&quot; reviewer commented that in 2004, Cloud Ten Pictures made a deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to release all of its pictures under their banner and has been doing so ever since.

In 2010, Cloud Ten announced that a remake of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series was in development, with production set to begin in late 2012 for an October 2014 release date. The reboot, starring Nicolas Cage as Steele and Chad Michael Murray as Buck Williams, was released to theaters October 3, 2014. It focused mainly on the very beginnings of the first book and added much to the plot. The remake focuses on the experiences of the passengers on the plane and partially on Chloe Steele as she comes to terms with her missing family. It earned overwhelmingly negative reviews and flopped at the box office.

&quot;Vanished – Left Behind: Next Generation&quot;, a spin-off film based on the spin-off series &quot;Left Behind: The Kids&quot; released on September 28, 2016. The film was developed by Tim LaHaye&#x27;s grandson, Randy LaHaye and was well received by the book author.

In November 2021, LaLonde announced the beginning of production on &quot;Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist&quot;, with Kevin Sorbo directing and replacing Nicolas Cage as Rayford Steele. The film is set six months after the events of the 2014 film and is an adaptation of the rest of book one in the series. The film makes a few small changes to be more relevant for modern times.

==Video game==
A video game, &quot;Left Behind: Eternal Forces&quot;, (2006) and its three sequels, &quot;Left Behind: Tribulation Forces&quot;, &quot;Left Behind 3: Rise of the Antichrist&quot; and &quot;Left Behind 4: World at War&quot;, were developed by a publicly traded company, Left Behind Games. The games are real-time strategy games wherein the player controls a &quot;Tribulation Forces&quot; team and allows the player to &quot;use the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world.&quot; The original game was released in the United States on November 14, 2006, and received mixed reviews. Distribution was initially planned to work through churches and megachurches.

Although the original game was accused of encouraging religious violence, not all reviewers of the game or critics of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series shared that view. Representatives of the company have responded that the game&#x27;s message is pacifist, because shooting nonbelievers instead of converting them costs the player &quot;spirit points&quot;, which can be recovered by pausing to pray. The company also responded to these criticisms in an online newsletter, stating, &quot;There is no violence, only conflict,&quot; and, &quot;The most successful way to fight, is through the means of spiritual warfare; PRAYER and WORSHIP. Soldiers and military weaponry are available, but once anyone plays the game, they&#x27;ll see how difficult it is to succeed by using these less effective means of warfare.&quot;

<doc id="18616" wikidata="Q731652" url="?curid=18616" title="Lollardy">
<text>Lollardy was a proto-Protestant Christian religious movement that was active in England from the mid-14th century until the 16th-century English Reformation. It was initially led by John Wycliffe, a Catholic theologian who was dismissed from the University of Oxford in 1381 for heresy. The Lollards&#x27; demands were primarily for reform of Western Christianity. They formulated their beliefs in the Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards. Early it became associated with regime change uprisings and assassinations of high government officials, and was suppressed.

==Etymology==

&quot;Lollard&quot;, &quot;Lollardi&quot;, or &quot;Loller&quot; was the popular derogatory nickname given to those without an academic background, educated, if at all, mainly in English, who were reputed to follow the teachings of John Wycliffe in particular. By the mid-15th century, &quot;lollard&quot; had come to mean a heretic in general. The alternative term &quot;Wycliffite&quot; is generally accepted to be a more neutral term covering those of similar opinions, but having an academic background.

The term is said to have been coined by the Anglo-Irish cleric Henry Crumpe, but its origin is uncertain. The earliest official use of the name in England occurs in 1387 in a mandate of the Bishop of Worcester against five &quot;poor preachers&quot;, &quot;nomine seu ritu Lollardorum confoederatos&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, it most likely derives from Middle Dutch &quot;&quot; (&quot;mumbler, mutterer&quot;), from a verb &quot;lollen&quot; (&quot;to mutter, mumble&quot;). The word is much older than its English use; there were Lollards in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 14th century who were akin to the Fraticelli, Beghards, and other sectaries similar to the recusant Franciscans.

Originally the Dutch word was a colloquial name for a group of buriers of the dead during the Black Death, in the 14th century, known as Alexians, Alexian Brothers or Cellites. These were known colloquially as &#x27; (Middle Dutch for &quot;mumbling brothers&quot;), or &#x27;, from (&quot;to sing softly&quot;), from their chants for the dead. Middle English &quot;&quot; (akin to the verb &quot;&quot;, &quot;lull&quot;, the English cognate of Dutch &quot;lollen&quot; &quot;to mutter, mumble&quot;) is recorded as an alternative spelling of &quot;Lollard&quot;, while its generic meaning &quot;a lazy vagabond, an idler, a fraudulent beggar&quot; is not recorded before 1582.

Two other possibilities for the derivation of &quot;Lollard&quot; are mentioned by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;:
* Latin &quot;&quot;, a weedy vetch (tares), supposedly a reference to the biblical Parable of the Tares (Matthew 13:24–30);
* the surname &quot;Lolhard&quot; of an eminent Franciscan preacher in Guyenne, who converted to the Waldensian way. The region of Guyenne was at that time under English dominion, and his preaching influenced pious lay English. He was burned at Cologne in the 1370s. Earlier, another Waldensian teacher, also named &quot;Lolhard&quot;, was tried for heresy in Austria in 1315.

==Beliefs==
According to scholar Margaret Aston, as Wycliffe&#x27;s academic theology percolated to the masses, it changed measureably, some parts strengthening and others weakening. Historian John Thomson is paraphrased &quot;Rather than a specific creed of well thought out theological doctrine, Lollard beliefs are more aptly described as a set of consistent attitudes.&quot;

=== Eucharist ===
With regard to the Eucharist, Lollards such as John Wycliffe, William Thorpe and John Oldcastle taught a view of the mystical real presence of Christ in Holy Communion known as &quot;consubstantiation&quot; but did not accept the formulation of transubstantiation, which the Roman Catholic Church required the faithful not to deny. Wycliffite teachings on the Eucharist were declared heresy at the Blackfriars Council of 1382, and later by the Pope and the Council of Constance.

&quot;The Plowman&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a 16th-century Lollard poem, argues that theological debate about orthodox doctrine is less important than the Real Presence:

William Sawtry, a priest, was reportedly burned in 1401 for his preaching that &quot;bread remains in the same nature as before&quot; after consecration by a priest. A suspect in 1517 summed up the Lollards&#x27; position: &quot;Summe folys cummyn to churche thynckyng to see the good Lorde – what shulde they see there but bredde and wyne?&quot;

In the mid 15th century a priest named Richard Wyche was accused of false doctrine that corrupted the faith of Northumbrians, and left a letter detailing his version of the inquisitional proceedings, where a succession of theologians and others attempted to convince him of the Catholic position or to find some compromise wording that involved him not denying transubstantiation. When asked about transubstantiation during his questioning, he repeated only his belief in the Real Presence. When asked if the host was still bread even after consecration, he answered only: &quot;I believe that the host is the real body of Christ in the form of bread&quot;. Throughout his questioning he insisted that he was &quot;not bound to believe otherwise than Holy Scripture says&quot; and resorted to various loopholes. Following the questioning, he claimed he had been allowed to swear an oath on his heart; later his inquisitors denied this, saying he had sworn a different oath, which would have actually freed him; his denial of having taken that oath was taken as a re-canting by the bishop, preventing his attempted appeal to the Pope, so he was excommunicated, defrocked, imprisoned and eventually executed.

Lollard teachings on the Eucharist are attested to in numerous primary source documents. It is the fourth of the &quot;Twelve Conclusions&quot; and the first of the &quot;Sixteen Points on which the Bishops accuse Lollards&quot;. It is discussed in &quot;The Testimony of William Thorpe&quot;, the &quot;Apology for Lollard Doctrines&quot;, &quot;Jack Upland&quot;, and &quot;Opus Arduum&quot;.

=== Denial of sacraments and sacramentals ===

The Lollards did not believe that the church practices of baptism and confession were necessary for salvation.

Believing in a universal priesthood, the Lollards challenged the Church&#x27;s authority to invest or to deny the divine authority to make a man a priest. Denying any special status to the priesthood, Lollards thought confession to a priest was unnecessary since according to them priests did not have the ability to forgive sins. However, while it is beneficial to confess to a good priest, it is perilous to confess to a bad one. Lollards challenged the practice of clerical celibacy and believed priests should not hold government positions as such temporal matters would likely interfere with their spiritual mission.

They considered praying to saints and honouring of their images to be a form of idolatry. Oaths, fasting and prayers for the dead were thought to have no scriptural basis. They had a poor opinion of the trappings of the Catholic Church, including holy water, bells, organs, and church buildings. They rejected the value of papal pardons.

=== The Twelve Conclusions ===
One group of Lollards petitioned Parliament with the Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards by posting them on the doors of Westminster Hall in February 1395. While by no means a central statement of belief of the Lollards, the Twelve Conclusions reveal certain basic Lollard ideas.

* The first Conclusion rejects the acquisition of temporal wealth by Church leaders, as accumulating wealth leads them away from religious concerns and towards greed.
*The fourth Conclusion deals with the Lollard view that the Sacrament of the Eucharist is a debatable doctrine that is not clearly defined in the Bible. Whether the bread remains bread or becomes the literal body of Christ is not specified uniformly in the gospels.
* The sixth Conclusion states that officials of the Church should not concern themselves with secular matters when they hold a position of power within the Church, since this constitutes a conflict of interest between matters of the spirit and matters of the State.
* The eighth Conclusion points out the ludicrousness, in the minds of Lollards, of the reverence that is directed toward images of Christ&#x27;s suffering. &quot;If the cross of Christ, the nails, spear, and crown of thorns are to be honoured, then why not honour Judas&#x27;s lips, if only they could be found?&quot;
* The eleventh Conclusion was that female religious vows were unsafe, given that unmarried females could not contain their lust and would fall pregnant and commit abortion.
* Expensive church artwork was seen as an excess. They believed effort should be placed on helping the needy and preaching rather than working on expensive decorations. Icons were also seen as dangerous since many seemed to be worshipping the icons more fervently than they worshipped God.

Later, an expanded version the &quot;Thirty Seven Conclusions&quot; or &quot;Remonstrances&quot; was submitted in the late 1390s; the author is not known.

===Vernacular scripture===
Lollardy was a religion of vernacular scripture. Lollards opposed many practices of the Catholic church. Anne Hudson has written that a form of &quot;sola scriptura&quot; underpinned Wycliffe&#x27;s beliefs, but distinguished it from the more radical ideology that anything not permitted by scripture is forbidden. Instead, Hudson notes that Wycliffe&#x27;s &quot;sola scriptura&quot; held the Bible to be &quot;the only valid source of doctrine and the only pertinent measure of legitimacy.&quot;

Later Lollards believed that people deserved access to a copy of their own Bible. Many attempted to distribute English copies. Due to the lack of a printing press and low literacy levels, it was difficult to accomplish this goal.

However, a notable feature of some Lollard inquisitions was the common claim of illiteracy, or vision impairment, as a defence against the suspicion of Lollardy raised by possession of vernacular texts.

=== Catholic practices ===
Lollards did not observe fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church. In heresy proceedings against Margery Baxter it was presented as evidence that a servant girl found bacon in a pot of oatmeal on the first Saturday of Lent. Non-observance of dietary restrictions was used as evidence of heresy in another Norfolk case against Thomas Mone, where it was alleged that a piglet was eaten for Easter dinner when eating meat was forbidden.

Special vows were considered to be in conflict with the divine order established by Christ and were regarded as anathema.

Lollards had a tendency toward iconoclasm.

Some Lollards believed work was permissible on Sundays.

=== Foxe ===
Sixteenth-century martyrologist John Foxe reduced the main beliefs of Lollardy to four, to an extent eliding the Wycliffite doctrine of &quot;dominium&quot;, claiming they were:

* opposition to pilgrimages and saint worship, 
* denial of the doctrine of transubstantiation, and
* a demand for English translation of the Scriptures.

==History==

Although Lollardy was denounced as a heresy by the Catholic Church, initially Wycliffe and the Lollards were sheltered by politically-influential nobleman John of Gaunt and other anti-clerical nobility, who may have wanted to use Lollard-advocated clerical reform to acquire new sources of revenue from England&#x27;s monasteries. The University of Oxford also protected Wycliffe and similar academics on the grounds of academic freedom and, initially, allowed such persons to retain their positions despite their controversial views.

Two primary religious opponents of the Wycliffites were Archbishop of Canterbury William Courtenay and his successor Thomas Arundel, assisted by bishops like Henry le Despenser of Norwich, whom the chronicler Thomas Walsingham praised for his zeal.

Historian T. Waugh suggests the Lollard movement was small with little appeal to the upper classes, who liked the anti-clerical politics but not the religious doctrines. &quot;Notices of Lollardy after the death of Wycliffe are scattered and meagre. Sixteenth century Protestantism invested the Lollards with a posthumous renown, but there can be little doubt that, when their first energy had spent itself, they speedily became an obscure sect, destitute of living leaders, and vaguely re-echoing the teaching of a deceased founder whom they only half understood.&quot;

=== Oxford Lollards===
The initial Lollards were a small group of scholars, particularly at Merton College, Oxford University, some with important positions, who came under the influence of Wycliffe in the 1360s and 1370s. After Wycliffe&#x27;s natural death, all of them eventually submitted to Archbishop of Canterbury William Courtenay to renounce Wycliffe&#x27;s contentious doctrines, and none suffered long-term consequences. These notably included Nicholas Hereford, who is usually named as the translator of most of the Old Testament of the Wycliffean Middle English Bible.

=== Peasants&#x27; Revolt===

Lollards first faced serious persecution after the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381. While Wycliffe and other Lollards opposed the revolt, one of the peasants&#x27; leaders, John Ball, preached Lollardy. Prior to 1382, Wycliffite beliefs were tolerated in government as they endorsed in royal superiority to bishops. However, the government and royals were hesitant, as they did not want to encourage subjects to criticize religious powers.

After 1382, royalty and nobility found Lollardy to be a threat not only to the Church, but to English society in general. The Lollards&#x27; small measure of protection evaporated. This change in status was also affected by the departure of John of Gaunt (Duke of Lancaster, patron of Chaucer and protector of John Wycliffe) who left England in 1386 to pursue the Crown of Castile.

Paul Strohm has asked: &quot;Was the Lollard a genuine threat or a political pawn, agent of destabilising challenge, or a hapless threat of self-legitimizing Lancastrian discourse?&quot;

=== Lollard Knights ===
A group of gentry active during the reign of Richard II (1377–99) were known as &quot;Lollard Knights&quot; either during or after their lives due to their acceptance of Wycliffe&#x27;s claims. Henry Knighton, in his Chronicle, identifies the principal Lollard Knights as Thomas Latimer, John Trussell, Lewis Clifford, Sir John Peche (son of John Peche of Wormleighton), Richard Storey, and Reginald Hilton. Thomas Walsingham&#x27;s Chronicle adds William Nevil and John Clanvowe to the list, and other potential members of this circle have been identified by their wills, which contain Lollard-inspired language about how their bodies are to be plainly buried and permitted to return to the soil whence they came.

There is little indication that the Lollard Knights were specifically known as such during their lifetimes. They were men of discretion, and unlike Sir John Oldcastle years later, rarely gave any hint of open rebellion. However, they displayed a remarkable ability to retain important positions, without falling victim to the prosecutions of Wycliffe&#x27;s followers during their lifetimes.

=== Legal response ===

Religious and secular authorities strongly opposed Lollardy. In eventual response to the revolting Lollards, the law &quot;De heretico comburendo&quot; was enacted in 1401 during the reign of Henry IV; traditionally heresy had been defined as an error in theological belief, but this statute equated theological heresy with sedition against political rulers.

By the early 15th century, stern measures were undertaken by Church and state which drove Lollardy underground. One such measure was the 1410 burning at the stake of John Badby, a layman and craftsman who refused to renounce his Lollardy. He was the first layman to suffer capital punishment in England for the crime of heresy.

===Oldcastle Revolt===

John Oldcastle, a close friend of Henry V of England and the basis for Falstaff in the Shakespearean history &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, was brought to trial in 1413 after evidence of his Lollard beliefs was uncovered. Oldcastle escaped from the Tower of London and organized an insurrection, which included an attempted kidnapping of the king. The rebellion failed, and Oldcastle was executed. Oldcastle&#x27;s revolt made Lollardy seem even more threatening to the state, and persecution of Lollards became more severe.

=== 1428 Kentish Insurrection ===
An insurrection was nipped in the bud in 1428, feared to involve several thousand Lollards, intent on &quot;destroying the English church.&quot; It was associated with Lollard missionary William White.

=== Late Lollardy in the 1500s ===
Lollards were effectively absorbed into Protestantism during the English Reformation, in which Lollardy played a role. Since Lollards had been underground for more than a hundred years, the extent of Lollardy and its ideas at the time of the Reformation is uncertain and a point of debate. Ancestors of Blanche Parry, the closest person to Elizabeth I for 56 years, and of Blanche Milborne, who raised Edward VI and Elizabeth I, had Lollard associations.

Many critics of the Reformation, including Thomas More, equated Protestants with Lollards. Leaders of the English Reformation, including Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, referred to Lollardy as well, and Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall of London called Lutheranism the &quot;foster-child&quot; of the Wycliffite heresy. Scholars debate whether Protestants actually drew influence from Lollardy, or whether they referred to it to create a sense of tradition. Late Lollards had little direct connection to Wycliffe&#x27;s ideas. 

Other martyrs for the Lollard cause were executed during the next century, including the Amersham Martyrs in the early 1500s and Thomas Harding in 1532, one of the last Lollards to be persecuted. A gruesome reminder of this persecution is the &#x27;Lollards Pit&#x27; in Thorpe Wood, now Thorpe Hamlet, Norwich, Norfolk, &quot;where men are customablie burnt&quot;, including Thomas Bilney.

Despite the debate about the extent of Lollard influence there are ample records of the persecution of Lollards from this period. In the Diocese of London, there are records of about 310 Lollards being prosecuted or forced to abjure from 1510 to 1532. In Lincoln diocese, 45 cases against Lollardy were heard in 1506–1507. In 1521, there were 50 abjurations and 5 burnings of Lollards. In 1511, Archbishop Warham presided over the abjuration of 41 Lollards from Kent and the burning of 5.

In 1529, Simon Fish wrote an incendiary pamphlet &quot;Supplication for the Beggars&quot;, including his denial of purgatory and teachings that priestly celibacy was an invention of the Antichrist. He argued that earthly rulers have the right to strip Church properties, and that tithing was against the Gospel, Protestant views that echo the Wycliffite/Lollard teaching. He advocated closing of all monasteries, and notably provided economic estimates of the revenues of various monastic and church institutions.

The extent of Lollardy in the general populace at this time is unknown. The prevalence of Protestant iconoclasm in England suggests Lollard ideas may still have had some popular influence if Huldrych Zwingli was not the source, as Lutheranism did not advocate iconoclasm. Lollards were persecuted again between 1554 and 1559 during the Revival of the Heresy Acts under the Catholic Mary I, which specifically suppressed heresy and Lollardy.

The similarity between Lollards and later English Protestant groups, such as the Baptists, Puritans, and Quakers, also suggests some continuation of Lollard ideas through the Reformation.

==Representations in art and literature==
The Roman Catholic Church used art as an anti-Lollard weapon. Lollards were represented on misericords as foxes dressed as monks or priests preaching to a flock of geese. These representations alluded to the story of the preaching fox found in popular medieval literature such as &quot;The History of Reynard the Fox&quot; and &quot;The Shifts of Raynardine&quot;. The fox lured the geese closer and closer with its eloquent words, until it was able to snatch a victim to devour. The moral of the story being that foolish people are seduced by false teachers.

<doc id="18623" wikidata="Q807" url="?curid=18623" title="Lausanne">
<text>Lausanne ( , ; ; ) is the capital and largest city of the Swiss French-speaking canton of Vaud, in Switzerland. It is a hilly city situated on the shores of Lake Geneva, about halfway between the Jura Mountains and the Alps, and facing the French town of Évian-les-Bains across the lake. Lausanne is located (as the crow flies) northeast of Geneva, the nearest major city. The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland convenes in Lausanne, although it is not the &quot;de jure&quot; capital of the nation.

The municipality of Lausanne has a population of about 140,000, making it the fourth largest city in Switzerland after Basel, Geneva, and Zurich, with the entire agglomeration area having about 420,000 inhabitants (as of January 2019). The metropolitan area of Lausanne-Geneva (including Vevey-Montreux, Yverdon-les-Bains, Valais and foreign parts), commonly designated as &quot;Arc lémanique&quot; was over 1.3 million inhabitants in 2017 and is the fastest growing in Switzerland.

Initially a Celtic and Roman settlement on the shores of the lake, Lausanne became a town at the foot of Notre Dame, a cathedral built in the 12th century. In the 20th century, Lausanne became a focus of international sport, hosting the International Olympic Committee (which has recognized the city as the &quot;Olympic Capital&quot; since 1994), the Court of Arbitration for Sport and some 55 international sport associations. It lies in a noted wine-growing region. With its 28-station metro system, Lausanne is the smallest city in the world to have a rapid transit system. Lausanne hosted the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics.

==History==

The Romans built a military camp, which they called , at the site of a Celtic settlement, near the lake where Vidy and Ouchy are situated; on the hill above was a fort called or (The &quot;-y&quot; suffix is common to many place names of Roman origin in the region (e.g.) Prilly, Pully, Lutry, etc.). By the 2nd century AD, it was known as and in 280 as . By 400, it was , and in 990 it was mentioned as . 
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, insecurity forced the residents of Lausanne to move to its current centre, a hilly site that was easier to defend. The city which emerged from the camp was ruled by the Counts of Savoy and the Bishop of Lausanne.

From 888 to 1032, the initially relatively small town belonged to the kingdom of Upper Burgundy. During the 11th century, Lausanne developed into a political, economic and religious center. The city became the center of the secular rule of the bishops. In the period that followed, especially in the 12th and 13th centuries, Lausanne flourished. Finally, in 1275, the Lausanne Cathedral was consecrated in the presence of Pope Gregory X and King Rudolf I of Germany.

It was invaded by forces from the canton of Bern and remained under their domination from 1536 to 1798. The iconoclastic Bernese stripped the Lausanne cathedral of its Roman Catholic trappings, and a number of its cultural treasures, including the hanging tapestries in the cathedral, were permanently removed. Lausanne has made repeated requests to recover them, but they never were returned.

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Lausanne became (along with Geneva) a place of refuge for French Huguenots. In 1729, a seminary was opened by Antoine Court and Benjamin Duplan. By 1750, 90 pastors had been sent back to France to work clandestinely; this number would rise to 400. Official persecution ended in 1787; a faculty of Protestant theology was established at Montauban in 1808, and the Lausanne seminary was finally closed on 18 April 1812. During the Napoleonic Wars, the city&#x27;s status changed. In 1803, it became the capital of a newly formed Swiss canton of Vaud under which it joined the Swiss Federation.

===Modern history and heritage===
In 1923, the city was the venue for the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, which established the modern Turkish Republic. In 1964, the city played host to the Swiss National Exhibition, displaying its newly found confidence to play host to major international events.

From the 1950s to 1970s, a large number of Italians, Spaniards and Portuguese immigrated to Lausanne, settling mostly in the industrial suburb of Renens.

The city has served as a refuge for European artists. While under the care of a psychiatrist at Lausanne, T. S. Eliot composed most of his 1922 poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (&quot;by the waters of Leman I sat down and wept&quot;). Ernest Hemingway also visited from Paris with his wife during the 1920s, to holiday. In fact, many creative people – such as historian Edward Gibbon and Romantic era poets Shelley and Byron – have sojourned, lived, and worked in Lausanne or nearby.

The city has been traditionally quiet, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a series of demonstrations took place that exposed tensions between young people and the police. In the early 1980s, the Lôzane Bouge protests demanded the city &quot;open an autonomous centre, lower cinema ticket prices, liberalise cannabis and end the process of keeping records on homosexuals, all accompanied by leaflets, chants, and songs in the street&quot;. Protests occurred in 2003, against the G8 meetings.

In June 2022, Lausanne launched Plateforme 10, an art district comprising three museums. The trio of museums included Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts (MCBA), Photo Elysée, and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts (MUDAC).

===Topography===
The most important geographical feature of the area surrounding Lausanne is Lake Geneva (&quot;Le Léman&quot; in French).

Lausanne boasts a dramatic panorama over the lake and the Swiss and Savoyan Alps.

In addition to its generally southward-sloping layout, the centre of the city is the site of an ancient river, the Flon, which has been covered since the 19th century. The former river forms a gorge running through the middle of the city south of the old city centre, generally following the course of the present &quot;Rue Centrale&quot;, with several bridges crossing the depression to connect the adjacent neighbourhoods. Due to the considerable differences in elevation, tourists should make a note as to which plane of elevation they are on and where they want to go, otherwise they will find themselves tens of metres below or above the street in which they are trying to go. The name &quot;Flon&quot; is also used for the metro station located in the gorge.

<text>A loyalty program or rewards program is a marketing strategy designed to encourage customers to continue to shop at or use the services of one or more businesses associated with the program.

==Single-company vs. coalition programs==
Loyalty programs may be either:
Single-brand programs, such as Starbucks)
*Single-corporation programs, such as the joint Gap Inc. program, work at the stores and digital channels of Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta, which are all owned by Gap Inc.
*Coalition loyalty programs, provide benefits to customers of multiple otherwise-unrelated businesses. Examples include Rakuten Rewards which, in the U.S. offers cashback at more than 3,500 stores and Air Miles which awards points for purchases from multiple merchants in each market it serves (Canada, The Netherlands, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE).
**Shopping center programs may also be based on a single or chain of shopping centers, such as the Tanger Outlets loyalty programs that can be used at merchants located at its outlet malls.
**Downtown Olympia, Washington, launched a coalition loyalty program in 2021 for merchants in its downtown shopping district.

In 2020 McKinsey spoke of loyalty program &quot;ecosystems&quot;.
==Features==
===How customers provide their account numbers=== 
====Physical loyalty cards====
A loyalty program typically involves the operator of a particular program setting up an account for a customer of a business associated with the scheme, and then issue to the customer a loyalty card (variously called rewards card, points card, advantage card, club card, or some other name) which may be a plastic or paper card, visually similar to a credit card, that identifies the cardholder as a participant in the program. Cards may have a barcode or magstripe to more easily allow for scanning, although some are chip cards or proximity cards. U.S. supermarkets often issue two copies of the card: one credit-card sized and one that fits on a keychain, in addition to providing access to the card via a mobile app, website.

====Digital loyalty cards====
As of 2024, most programs in the United States offer a digital version of the loyalty card, accessed via a mobile app, and often customers can scan a QR or bar code from the app at the physical point of sale. Some programs now offer digital cards only or only exceptionally, such as Marks and Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Sparks&quot; program in the UK launched in 2020 which no longer issues physical cards except upon special request. American Airlines no longer sends membership kits to new members of its frequent flyer program.

Encouraging or forcing customers to use a mobile app to present their loyalty account number, although criticized for being unfriendly to people without smartphones including many elderly people, benefits the merchant in a number of ways. It lets them present special offers to the customer (or even push them via push notifications), tailor customer experience to the individual consumer, and understand customer behavior better, including their purchasing amounts and patterns.

====Phone number and other methods====
At a physical point of sale, presenting a physical or digital card is not necessary at many U.S. merchants, if the customer enters the phone number associated with the account on a terminal or tells it to a cashier who enters it into the register. When purchasing online, customers usually must log in to the account on the merchant&#x27;s website. However, when purchasing airline tickets from online travel agencies, customers can usually enter their airline loyalty number into the agency website and the agency will pass it onto the airline. 

===Points===
Programs that feature points grant customers a certain number of points for each purchase, in the US often per $1 or $10 increment of spend. Once they have enough points, clients can redeem them for either:
*merchandise or services free of charge
*discounts on merchandise or services
*gift cards, credit vouchers, etc. to spend with the merchant
*&quot;cashback&quot;, either:
**money that the program transfers to the customer&#x27;s account or 
**a paper check that the program mails to the customer
===Tiers===
Programs with tiers define levels (such as silver, gold, and platinum levels) that customers are upgraded to when they spend enough with the merchant(s), usually over a certain period of time such as a year. For example, Sephora gives 1 point for $1 spent. Once customers earn a specific number of points, they can enter a new level with higher discounts and exclusive products.
===Membership fees===
In subscription-based programs, customers pay a fee to enjoy the program&#x27;s benefits, for example Barnes and Noble bookstores charge members about 40 U.S. dollars per year (as of mid-2024) for its &quot;Premium Membership and Rewards&quot; program, which gives members a 10% discount off most merchandise. There is also a free tier which does not offer such discounts but does allow members to collect virtual &quot;stamps&quot; (i.e. loyalty points).

==Types of rewards==
Depending on the program, rewards may take the form of:
*merchandise or services free of charge
*discounts on merchandise or services
*gift cards, credit vouchers, etc. to spend with the merchant 
*cashback

In addition to rewards, loyalty cards were may also be used identify consumers for benefits and other services, e.g.:
*when pharmacies dispense prescriptions
*for access to an airport lounge (using a frequent-flyer card)
*when customers presented checks for payment at a point-of sale
===Cashback===

Programs with cashback features give customers a portion of the money that they have spent with a business (usually a defined percent which may be higher than usual during promotions). The &quot;cash back&quot; is rarely actually cash money, but rather takes the form of a transfer of the &quot;cashback&quot; amount to the customer&#x27;s bank account.

Examples in the U.S. include Rakuten Rewards, a coalition reward program, and many banks that give their clients cash back for using their debit cards to pay for various products and services.
==Channels==
Depending on the program, ways that consumers may access their loyalty account (account number, promotions, other information) may include:
*Desktop, mobile, and/or responsive versions of the website(s) for the program and/or of participating merchant(s)
*Mobile apps for the program or participating merchant(s)
*At dedicated kiosks, such as in casinos
*Traditional methods such as:
**Physical membership cards
**Paper-based mailings of account statements, promotions, and other information
===Mobile apps and websites===
There has been a move away from traditional magnetic card, stamp, or punchcard based schemes to online and mobile online loyalty programs. While these schemes vary, the common element is a push toward eradication of a traditional card, in favour of an electronic equivalent. The choice of medium is often a QR code. Some prominent examples are Austrian based mobile-pocket established in 2009, the US-based Punchd (discontinued from June 2013,), which became part of Google in 2011. and an Australian-based loyalty card application called Stamp Me which incorporates iBeacon technology. Others, like Loopy Loyalty (HK), Loyalli (UK), Perka (US), and Whisqr Loyalty (CA), have offered similar programs. Passbook by Apple is the first attempt to standardize the format of mobile loyalty cards.

===Offline with mobile device===
With the introduction of host card emulation (HCE) and near field communication (NFC) technology for mobile applications, traditional contactless smart cards for prepaid and loyalty programs are emulated in a smartphone. Google Wallet adopted these technologies for mobile off-line payment applications.

The major advantage of off-line over the online system is that the user&#x27;s smartphone does not have to be online, and the transaction is fast. In addition, multiple emulated cards can be stored in a smartphone to support multi-merchant loyalty programs. Consequently, the user does not need to carry many physical cards anymore.

==Industries==
Today, such loyalty programs cover most types of commerce, each having varying features and rewards schemes, and range from programs of a single-location business to large chains or membership in a coalition loyalty program. Industries include:

*Retail: Supermarkets, department stores, clothing stores, beauty stores and other specialty shops
*Travel and Hospitality: Airlines, passenger railways, hotels, car rental and carshare companies
*Food and Beverage: Restaurants, coffee shops, fast-food chains
*Financial Services: Banks, credit card companies
*Telecommunications: Mobile service providers, internet service providers
*Entertainment: Cinemas, streaming services, theme parks, casinos
*E-commerce sites/apps and online marketplaces
*Fitness and Wellness: Gyms, fitness studios, spas etc.
*Automotive: Car dealerships and service centers

The market approach has shifted from product-centric to a customer-centric one due to a highly competitive market and a wide array of services offered to customers, therefore, it&#x27;s important that marketing strategies prioritize growing a sustainable business and increasing customer satisfaction.
===Casinos===
Almost all major U.S. casino chains also have loyalty cards, which offer members tier credits, reward credits, comps, and other perks based on card members&#x27; &quot;theo&quot; from gambling, various demographic data, and spend patterns on various purchases at the casino, within the casino network, and with the casino&#x27;s partners. Examples of such programs include Caesars Rewards (formerly called Total Rewards) and MGM Resorts International&#x27;s Mlife.
===Coffee shops===
====&quot;Disloyalty&quot; cards====
, some independent coffee shops in Boston, Toronto and London has set up experimental &quot;disloyalty card&quot; programs, which rewarded customers for visiting a variety of coffee shops.

==Benefits to merchants==
Loyalty programs&#x27; most important benefit to merchants is that they generate data, which bring more repeat business and therefore increase sales.

Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its marketing research. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer&#x27;s favorite brand of beer, or whether they are a vegetarian. 

As of the mid-2020s, loyalty program trends include:
*the integration of AI and data analytics into loyalty platforms in order to personalize customer experiences,
*focusing on emotional connections, and 
*offering personalized rewards that resonate with individual consumer preferences
*omnichannel experience to drive more interaction i.e. access across multiple physical and digital touchpoints such as in-store, via mail, e-mail, mobile apps, push notifications from the app or via SMS, websites, etc.

Loyalty programs are a means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. 

===Asia===
* Japan: see :ja:共通ポイント and :ja:ポイントプログラム#日本における歴史. In Japan, non credit card multi-brand points who awarded in addition to each store&#x27;s own points are becoming more common.

A later program, Tesco&#x27;s ClubCard, was criticized for not offering value for money. &quot;The Economist&quot; suggested that the real benefit of loyalty cards to UK outlets is the massive marketing research database potential they offer. Morrisons is another program. Many stores have kiosks that, with the cards, print vouchers that can be used at the till.Safeway&#x27;s ABC Card was discontinued in 2000. Maximiles is an online coalition program.Formerly operated by British Airways, Airmiles was rebranded in 2011 from Airmiles to Avios, with changes that caused members to pay taxes and fees on flights they used for redemption.

This is only available in Co-op Group stores. It replaced the dividend benefit previously used. Other Co-op chains continue with the dividend scheme, e.g. Midcounties Co-operative. Many of these accept other Co-operative loyalty cards but generally without the same benefits.

==As virtual currency==
Loyalty programs have been described as a form of centralized virtual currency, one with unidirectional cash flow, since reward points can be exchanged into a good or service but not into cash.
==Criticism==
Evidence for the effectiveness of loyalty programs is controversial. Many companies are unsure whether and how to use customer loyalty programs profitably. Many programs (regardless of location, size, or industry) are run without the appropriate metrics or target parameters.

Some companies complain that loyalty programs discount goods to people who are buying goods anyway. Moreover, the expense of participating in these programs rarely generates a good return on investment. The Forte Consultancy Group regards loyalty programs as bribes. In the case of infrequent spenders, loyalty fees provide a means of subsidizing discounts.

A 2015 study found that most supermarket loyalty cards in the United States do not offer any real value to their customers. Furthermore, commercial use of customers&#x27; personal data – collected as part of loyalty programs – has the potential for abuse; it is highly likely that consumer purchases are tracked and used for marketing research to increase the efficiency of marketing and advertising, which is one of the purposes of offering the loyalty card. For some customers, participating in a loyalty program (even with a fake or anonymous card) funds activities that violate privacy. Consumers have also expressed concern about the integration of RFID technology into loyalty-card systems.

One may view loyalty and credit-card reward-plans as modern-day examples of kickbacks.
Employees who need to buy something (such as an airline flight or a hotel room) for a business trip, but who have discretion to decide which airline or hotel chain to use, have an incentive to choose the payment method that provides the most cash-back, credit-card rewards or loyalty points instead of minimizing costs for their employer.

<doc id="18625" wikidata="Q1753262" url="?curid=18625" title="Ludwig Von Drake">
<text>Professor Ludwig Von Drake is a cartoon character created in 1961 by The Walt Disney Company. He is the paternal uncle of Donald Duck. He was first introduced as the presenter (and singer of &quot;The Spectrum Song&quot;) in the cartoon &quot;An Adventure in Color&quot;, part of the first episode of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; on NBC. According to the episode &quot;The Hunting Instinct&quot; of that series he and Donald Duck&#x27;s father are brothers. He is described as a scientist, lecturer, psychologist, and world traveler. The character displayed his &quot;expert&quot; knowledge on a variety of subjects in eighteen episodes of the classic anthology series, as well as on a number of Disneyland Records.

Paul Frees was the original voice of Ludwig Von Drake. After Frees retired from the role, the character was briefly voiced by Wayne Allwine and Walker Edmiston. Since 1987, he has been voiced by Corey Burton. Ludwig Von Drake has also appeared in numerous Disney comics stories.

==Character==
Ludwig Von Drake comes from Vienna, Austria and has a fascination with knowledge. Since his youth, he has been trying to obtain as many diplomas, in any science, as possible. When he is consulted by other family members, it is a running gag that he almost invariably turns out to have a university degree relevant for whatever information they are seeking. He is often shown as having little social competence, however, and is often portrayed as being very forgetful, sometimes even somewhat senile. In the comics, Ludwig usually visits with Donald Duck and Donald&#x27;s nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. On occasion, Daisy Duck will coax (or even trick) the professor into giving lectures and tours for her ladies&#x27; club. Ludwig can play the piano and acoustic guitar, as shown in a few television specials and more.

In the &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; episode &quot;The Hunting Instinct&quot;, Walt Disney states Ludwig is Donald Duck&#x27;s father&#x27;s brother. According to Walt Disney, Donald decided to adopt his maternal surname, Duck, when he got into show business, and that is the reason why he is not popularly known as Donald Von Drake. In the comic strips by Bob Karp and Al Taliaferro, Donald and his nephews usually call Ludwig &#x27;Uncle Ludwig&#x27;, and Daisy Duck refers to him as &#x27;sort of an uncle&#x27; of Donald&#x27;s in the first Sunday strip where his name is mentioned.

In the &quot;Wonderful World of Color&quot; episode &quot;Kids is Kids&quot;, Ludwig says, &quot;Of course, I don&#x27;t need any help raising children. I&#x27;m a bachelor.&quot; Besides, he has been shown to be a member of the &quot;Absentminded Dating Club&quot;, where he is the suitor of a duck woman called Alice. This is contradicted by Don Rosa&#x27;s private (and unpublished) Duck Family tree which shows Ludwig married to Donald Duck&#x27;s mother&#x27;s sister Matilda McDuck. The same family tree also states this is the only relationship between Ludwig and Donald Duck; thereby contradicting Walt Disney&#x27;s statement.

In the story &quot;Duckburg, U.S.A.&quot;, published in &quot;Ludwig Von Drake&quot; #1 (November 1961), Professor Ludwig Von Drake arrives in Duckburg by train, and it is shown that Donald Duck had never seen this Austrian relative before, not even in a picture. Grandma Duck, Uncle Scrooge McDuck, Daisy Duck, Gladstone Gander, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Gus Goose, and Gyro Gearloose also appear in this same story waiting to know Ludwig at the train station, and Grandma enthusiastically exclaims, &quot;Professor Ludwig Von Drake! Such a nice-sounding name!&quot;. In some old comic stories where Ludwig visits Grandma on her farm, it is clear that they have a close relationship, as shown in the story &quot;Message From Space&quot;, where Grandma exclaims, &quot;You need rest, dear boy!&quot;, after thinking he had a kind of nervous breakdown. In &quot;Pigeon Panic&quot; Ludwig exclaims, &quot;Ho! You know you can depend on me!&quot;, after Grandma warned him to be careful with her smartest homer. There is an enlightening sequence of two panels in the story &quot;The Rural Eggs-pert&quot;, where Ludwig is resting in an old chair of Grandma&#x27;s house when an antique buyer asks Grandma to sell him &quot;this fine old specimen&quot; (the chair) and she answers, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s been in the family for years, but I could do without it!&quot;, making Ludwig astonished, since he thinks she is referring to him as if he was a livestock. He would not have reacted this way if he was not her relative. In the last panel of the story &quot;Barn Dance Doctor&quot;, Grandma refers to Ludwig as her &quot;cityfied cousin&quot;. Since it was stipulated by Don Rosa that her father was a &quot;Coot&quot; and her mother was a &quot;Gadwall&quot;, it is not clear if Ludwig Von Drake is related to Elvira Coot through her father or her mother. Grandma Duck could have an Austrian ascendancy to explain her kinship to Ludwig. 

In the story &quot;The Family Tree Spree&quot;, Donald scares of seeing Ludwig&#x27;s specs on the floor and thinks about them as &quot;Uncle Ludwig&#x27;s specs&quot;. In the end of this same story, it is revealed that Ludwig also appears in Donald&#x27;s paternal family tree, wherein he and Donald both have an ancestor called Colombust Duck. According to Carl Barks, Donald&#x27;s father&#x27;s surname is Duck, his mother&#x27;s one being McDuck. Since Humperdink Duck (a.k.a. Grandpa Duck), Grandma Duck&#x27;s deceased husband and Donald&#x27;s paternal grandfather, was probably almost contemporary with Ludwig Von Drake, it is possible to consider they were half-brothers, Donald being thus Ludwig&#x27;s grandnephew. Ludwig reveals to Daisy and her friends in &quot;Blown Up Genius&quot; that he came from a long line of glass blowers. In &quot;Winning Ways&quot;, Daisy and her friends try to prepare Ludwig&#x27;s favorite dish, called &quot;Wiener Schnitzel a la Weltschmerz&quot;, whose recipe belonged to Ludwig&#x27;s great grandmother. Ludwig is really excited about it because he has not eaten that dish since he left Austria and came to Duckburg to know his relatives of Donald&#x27;s paternal family. In &quot;The Big Payoff&quot;, it is revealed that he spent many months living in Donald&#x27;s house since his arrival in Duckburg. Ludwig wins a TV chess challenge in this comic story, making Donald exclaim, &quot;Yippee! He did it! Now he can pay all he&#x27;s owed us (he and his nephews) for these many months!&quot;. According to the story &quot;The Jewels of Skull Rock&quot;, Ludwig spent six months in Donald&#x27;s house. In the Christmas story &quot;The Cuckoo Clock Caper&quot;, Ludwig exclaims that he and Scrooge are &quot;joined in good fellowship&quot;. Ludwig and Gyro Gearloose competed as to who is the greater inventor in the comic story &quot;I.Q. Bugaboo&quot;.

Those twelve stories mentioned above were drawn by Tony Strobl, who was the cartoonist responsible for introducing Professor Ludwig into American Disney comic books. Actually, Ludwig&#x27;s first comic book appearance was in a not previously mentioned story by Strobl, &quot;The Scene Stealer&quot;, first published in October 1961. The events shown in this one presumably happened after the ones shown in &quot;Duckburg, U.S.A.&quot;, which was published two months later.

==Filmography==

Professor Ludwig Von Drake was introduced as a new character alongside Walt Disney himself in the very first episode of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; after the series was moved to NBC in the fall of 1961. He was designed by Bill Berg. Von Drake was frequently animated by Milt Kahl and Ward Kimball, two of Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men animators. Some animation of the character was also done by Frank Thomas and Eric Larson.

==Print appearances==
The Disney studio encouraged the writers of Duck comics to introduce this new character in print, and already in September 1961, Von Drake started appearing in Al Taliaferro and Bob Karp&#x27;s featured daily strips. However, aside from a solitary cameo appearance in a one-page story in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #54 (December 1964), the character was not used by leading Disney duck artist Carl Barks.

In 1961, Dell Comics launched a comic book series starring Von Drake and illustrated by Tony Strobl, but it only lasted for four issues before being discontinued. The character made subsequent appearances in other comic titles such as &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; and in the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; newspaper strip.

Ludwig also appeared in a 1962 sequence of the annual &quot;Disney Christmas Story&quot; comic strip. In &quot;Sleeping Beauty&#x27;s Christmas Story&quot;, the professor helps Princess Aurora break Maleficent&#x27;s spell.

Professor Ludwig has often been used by Italian cartoonists, including in some of the long sagas inspired by famous books that they usually produce with the Duck Family, such as &quot;La storia di Marco Polo detta Il Milione&quot; (free translation &quot;The Million – A Story of Marco Polo&quot;) and &quot;Paperino in: Il mondo perduto&quot; (free translation &quot;Donald in: The Lost World&quot;). As a result, he has achieved significant popularity in Italy (where he is known as Pico De Paperis). He is portrayed in Italian comics as a scholar with multiple degrees in different subjects (even the more improbable ones) rather than a scientist.

<doc id="18627" wikidata="Q864124" url="?curid=18627" title="Los Altos, California">
<text>Los Altos (; Spanish for &quot;The Heights&quot;) is a city in Santa Clara County, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. The population was 31,625 according to the 2020 census.

Most of the city&#x27;s growth occurred between 1950 and 1980. Originally an agricultural town with many summer cottages and apricot orchards, Los Altos is a bedroom community on the western edge of Silicon Valley, serving as a major source of commuters to other parts of Silicon Valley. Los Altos strictly limits commercial zones to the downtown area and small shopping and office parks lining Foothill Expressway and El Camino Real.

==History==
The area was initially Fremont Judicial Township, Santa Clara County which was formed in 1853. Fremont Judicial Township was later unofficially called &quot;Banks and Braes&quot;. Paul Shoup, an executive of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and his colleagues formed the Altos Land Company in 1906 and started the development of Los Altos. The company acquired of land from Sarah Winchester. Shoup wanted to link Palo Alto and Los Gatos by making Los Altos a commuter town. It continued a train-a-day operation to and from San Francisco.

On April 19, 1908, Southern Pacific Railroad began running steam train service through Los Altos on the new Mayfield Cutoff with five trains per day. Two freight cars served as a train depot. Also, the first commercial building, Eschenbruecher&#x27;s Hardware, was built in downtown. In 1913, the craftsman-style Los Altos train station was built at 288 First Street.

By 1949, many residents were dissatisfied with the zoning policy of Santa Clara County, and there was a constant threat of annexation by neighboring Palo Alto and Mountain View, so they decided to incorporate. Los Altos became the eleventh city in Santa Clara County on December 1, 1952.

Train service ceased operation in January 1964, and the train track became Foothill Expressway. Los Altos may have the first scientifically designed sound baffle in 1970. Santa Clara County undertook a seminal study to calculate the effects of alternate soundwall designs along Foothill Expressway. The resulting wall brought about the predicted reduction of seven to ten decibels in noise pollution levels experienced by adjacent homes.

In 1976, Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak built the first 50 Apple I computers in Jobs&#x27;s garage in Los Altos.

In 2004, landlord Judy Fusco rented her Los Altos home, later known as &quot;Casa Facebook&quot;, to Mark Zuckerberg; there, he and a few other associates scaled Facebook from 200,000 members to 2.5 million.

On April 15, 2021, Los Altos became home to the world&#x27;s first consumer flying car showroom.

===Earthquakes===
Los Altos is near the San Andreas Fault and therefore subject to earthquakes.

*1906 San Francisco earthquake – Although Los Altos was hit extremely hard (VIII on the intensity level), the main local effort was to help rebuild nearby Santa Cruz, which was nearly destroyed.

*1989 – On October 17, Los Altos experienced the Loma Prieta earthquake, but was spared major damage.

==Geography==

Los Altos is bordered by Los Altos Hills to the west, Palo Alto to the west and northwest, Mountain View to the northwest and northeast, Sunnyvale to the east, and Cupertino to the southeast.

Los Altos is crossed by three creeks that flow north to San Francisco Bay, Adobe Creek on its western boundary, Stevens Creek on its eastern boundary and Permanente Creek in the middle. Hale Creek is a tributary to Permanente Creek, and Permanente Creek is now largely diverted to Stevens Creek by a diversion channel. All three creeks originate on the flanks of Black Mountain.

Los Altos strives to maintain a semi-rural atmosphere. Los Altos has few sidewalks except in commercial zones and along arterial roads. The minimum lot size for most residential housing is one-quarter of an acre. Most streets have broad dirt shoulders and no street lighting. The civic center sits in the middle of an orchard, a remnant of those that once covered the area. The downtown is a triangle with arterials and collector streets on all sides that enable most through traffic to bypass Main Street.

As of today, many Los Altos homes fetch $4 million and higher. The city is placed (along with neighboring Los Altos Hills, with which it shares ZIP codes) at numbers 24 and 28 on Forbes&#x27; &quot;Most Expensive ZIP Codes in America&quot; list in 2007.

For the 94024 ZIP code, the median home price is $2.8 million with an average of 36 days on the market.

==Economy==

Since the mid-1990s, downtown Los Altos has experienced mild economic difficulties due to competition from nearby shopping centers and chain stores, as well as its lack of a hotel or movie theater. Revitalizing downtown is a major issue in city politics.

==Education==

===Public===
Primary and middle school students attend schools in the Los Altos School District, the Cupertino Union School District, or Bullis Charter School (K–8). The Los Altos School District has one of the highest average API scores in California and includes seven elementary schools in the Los Altos–Mountain View area.

Local residents generally attend high school in one of two public school districts: Mountain View-Los Altos Union High School District or Fremont Union High School District.

All of the public schools are highly regarded, and many graduates of Los Altos-area high schools continue their education at well-known universities.

===Private===
Los Altos is also served by highly regarded private and religious schools. St. Nicholas School, St. Simon School, Miramonte Elementary School, (JrK–8th) Canterbury Christian School (Pre-K–8th), the Lower and Middle Campuses (K–6th) of Pinewood School, The School for Independent Learners, and the lower school campus of the Waldorf School of the Peninsula are located within city limits. Others nearby include St. Francis High School (Mountain View), Mountain View Academy, and The King&#x27;s Academy (Sunnyvale). Other schools farther away with students from Los Altos include Sacred Heart Schools, Atherton, Mitty High School, Menlo School, Woodside Priory School, Castilleja School, The Harker School, and Bellarmine College Preparatory.

===Public libraries===
Santa Clara County Library operates the Los Altos Library and the Woodland Branch Library in Los Altos. Members of the library have access to all the other locations in the Santa Clara County Library District. 

==Parks and recreation ==

Adobe Creek flows through Redwood Grove, a nature preserve off University Avenue in Los Altos purchased by the city in 1974. In October 2009 Los Altos contracted with Acterra to remove non-native plants and revitalize the redwood, oak woodland, riparian and grassland ecosystems by installing native plants, improving soil conditions, and creating habitat for wildlife such as bird houses and native bee boxes. The coast redwoods (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) were transplanted by the Halsey family from a location on Summit Road in the Santa Cruz Mountains and replaced the native willows. The historic Halsey House, built in the late 1920s by Theodore and Emma Halsey, is a good example of Spanish Revival architecture. The city designated Halsey House a local landmark in 1981 and until recently it housed the Florence Fava collection of Coastanoan or Ohlone Indian artifacts from a nearby archeological excavation in Los Altos Hills (now moved to the Los Altos History Museum). On June 16, 2010, the Los Altos City Council finalized the purchase of of creekside property from Delbert and Marlene Beumer, who wanted to provide a safe pathway connecting Shoup Park and Redwood Grove.

Steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) occurred historically in Adobe Creek. However, tidal gates at the mouth of Adobe Creek as well as culverts at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses probably preclude the passage of migrating salmonids, even though the reaches upstream from Hidden Villa in Los Altos Hills have been judged excellent trout habitat.

===Sports===
Los Altos has a variety of youth-oriented sports organizations, programs, and after-school activities. Some examples include:
*The Mountain View Los Altos Soccer Club (MVLASC) has provided competitive soccer for the MVLA community since 1972.

*West Valley Pop Warner offers cheerleading and football programs to local youth.
*The El Camino YMCA Youth Basketball League teaches basic basketball skills and the YMCA&#x27;s core values.

==Media==

<doc id="18628" wikidata="Q1756898" url="?curid=18628" title="Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome">
<text>Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness of the limbs. It is also known as myasthenic syndrome, Eaton–Lambert syndrome, and when related to cancer, carcinomatous myopathy. 
Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC); it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body). It is the result of antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The diagnosis is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also distinguish it from myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.
If the disease is associated with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous immunoglobulin, which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.
The condition affects about 3.4 per million people. LEMS usually occurs in people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age.

==Signs and symptoms==
The weakness from LEMS typically involves the muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).

Three-quarters of people with LEMS also have disruption of the autonomic nervous system. This may be experienced as a dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and orthostatic hypotension (falls in blood pressure on standing, potentially leading to blackouts). Some report a metallic taste in the mouth.

On neurological examination, the weakness demonstrated with normal testing of power is often less severe than would be expected on the basis of the symptoms. Strength improves further with repeated testing, e.g. improvement of power on repeated hand grip (a phenomenon known as &quot;Lambert&#x27;s sign&quot;). At rest, reflexes are typically reduced; with muscle use, reflex strength increases. This is a characteristic feature of LEMS. The pupillary light reflex may be sluggish.

In LEMS associated with small cell lung cancer, most have no suggestive symptoms of cancer at the time, such as cough, coughing blood, and unintentional weight loss. However, LEMS symptoms can occur up to 5 years prior to cancer diagnosis and also after cancer diagnosis. LEMS associated with lung cancer may be more severe.

==Causes==
LEMS is often associated with lung cancer (50–70%), specifically small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell lung cancer, 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the lung cancer, and it is otherwise asymptomatic.

LEMS may also be associated with endocrine diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen in the presence of tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.

==Mechanism==
In normal neuromuscular function, a nerve impulse is carried down the axon (the long projection of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse is transferred to the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.

In LEMS, antibodies against VGCC, particularly the P/Q-type VGCC and possibly the N-type VGCC antibody, decrease the amount of calcium that can enter the nerve ending, hence less acetylcholine can be released from the neuromuscular junction. Apart from skeletal muscle, the autonomic nervous system also requires acetylcholine neurotransmission; this explains the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in LEMS. P/Q voltage-gated calcium channels are also found in the cerebellum, explaining why some experience problems with coordination. The antibodies bind particularly to the part of the receptor known as the &quot;domain III S5–S6 linker peptide&quot;. Antibodies may also bind other VGCCs. Some have antibodies that bind synaptotagmin, the protein sensor for calcium-regulated vesicle fusion. Many people with LEMS, both with and without VGCC antibodies, have detectable antibodies against the M1 subtype of the acetylcholine receptor; their presence may participate in a lack of compensation for the weak calcium influx. N-type VGCCs are found on autonomic nerve terminals.

Apart from the decreased calcium influx, a disruption of active zone vesicle release sites also occurs, which may also be antibody-dependent, since people with LEMS have antibodies to components of these active zones (including voltage-dependent calcium channels). Together, these abnormalities lead to the decrease in muscle contractility. Repeated stimuli over a period of about 10 seconds eventually lead to sufficient delivery of calcium, and an increase in muscle contraction to normal levels, which can be demonstrated using an electrodiagnostic medicine study called needle electromyography by increasing amplitude of repeated compound muscle action potentials.

The antibodies found in LEMS associated with lung cancer also bind to calcium channels in the cancer cells, and it is presumed that the antibodies originally develop as a reaction to these cells. It has been suggested that the immune reaction to the cancer cells suppresses their growth and improves the prognosis from the cancer.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is usually made with nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), which is one of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. EMG involves the insertion of small needles into the muscles. NCS involves administering small electrical impulses to the nerves, on the surface of the skin, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. NCS investigation in LEMS primarily involves evaluation of compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) of effected muscles and sometimes EMG single-fiber examination can be used.

CMAPs show small amplitudes but normal latency and conduction velocities. If repeated impulses are administered (2 per second or 2 Hz), it is normal for CMAP amplitudes to become smaller as the acetylcholine in the motor end plate is depleted. In LEMS, this decrease is larger than observed normally. Eventually, stored acetylcholine is made available, and the amplitudes increase again. In LEMS, this remains insufficient to reach a level sufficient for transmission of an impulse from nerve to muscle; all can be attributed to insufficient calcium in the nerve terminal. A similar pattern is witnessed in myasthenia gravis. In LEMS, in response to exercising the muscle, the CMAP amplitude increases greatly (over 200%, often much more). This also occurs on the administration of a rapid burst of electrical stimuli (20 impulses per second for 10 seconds). This is attributed to the influx of calcium in response to these stimuli. On single-fiber examination, features may include increased jitter (seen in other diseases of neuromuscular transmission) and blocking.

Blood tests may be performed to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels can be identified in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months for the first two years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also be performed to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.

==Treatment==

If LEMS is caused by an underlying cancer, treatment of the cancer could lead to resolution of the symptoms. Treatment usually consists of chemotherapy, with radiation therapy in those with limited disease.

===Immunosuppression===
Some evidence supports the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used with a degree of effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.

===Other===
Three other treatment modalities also aim at improving LEMS symptoms, namely pyridostigmine, 3,4-diaminopyridine (amifampridine), and guanidine. They work to improve neuromuscular transmission. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and Mestinon tablets (Pyridostigmine) are secondary treatments.

Tentative evidence supports 3,4-diaminopyridine at least for a few weeks. The 3,4-diaminopyridine base or the water-soluble 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate may be used. Both 3,4-diaminopyridine formulations delay the repolarization of nerve terminals after a discharge, thereby allowing more calcium to accumulate in the nerve terminal.

Pyridostigmine decreases the degradation of acetylcholine after release into the synaptic cleft, and thereby improves muscle contraction. An older agent, guanidine, causes many side effects and is not recommended. 4-Aminopyridine (dalfampridine), an agent related to 3,4-aminopyridine, causes more side effects than 3,4-DAP and is also not recommended.

The FDA approved amifampridine for use in children 6 years and older with LEMS in addition to the prior approval for use in adults with LEMS on November 28, 2018.

==History==
Anderson and colleagues from St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London, were the first to mention a case with possible clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Edward H. Lambert, Lee Eaton, and E.D. Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.
