<text>Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany (; 24 July 1878 – 25 October 1957), commonly known as Lord Dunsany, was an Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist. He published more than 90 books during his lifetime, and his output consisted of hundreds of short stories, plays, novels, and essays; further works were published posthumously. Having gained a name in the 1910s as a writer in the English-speaking world, he is best known today for the 1924 fantasy novel &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and his first book, &quot;The Gods of Pegāna&quot;, which depicts a fictional pantheon. Many critics feel his early work laid grounds for the fantasy genre.

Born in London as heir to one of the oldest Irish peerages, he was raised partly in Kent, but later lived mainly at Ireland&#x27;s possibly longest-inhabited home, Dunsany Castle near Tara. He worked with W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, and supported the Abbey Theatre and some fellow writers. He was a chess and pistol champion of Ireland, and travelled and hunted. He devised an asymmetrical game called Dunsany&#x27;s chess. In later life, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin. He settled in Shoreham, Kent, in 1947. In 1957 he took ill when visiting Ireland and died in Dublin of appendicitis.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Edward Plunkett (&quot;Dunsany&quot;), known to his family as &quot;Eddie&quot;, was the first son of John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany (1853–1899), and his wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Ernle-Erle-Drax (née Burton) (1855–1916).

From a historically wealthy and famous family, Lord Dunsany was related to many well-known Irish figures. He was a kinsman of the Catholic Saint Oliver Plunkett, the martyred Archbishop of Armagh whose ring and crozier head are still held by the Dunsany family. He was also related to the prominent Anglo-Irish unionist and later nationalist / Home Rule politician Sir Horace Plunkett and George Count Plunkett, Papal Count and Republican politician, father of Joseph Plunkett, executed for his part in the 1916 Rising.

His mother was a cousin of Sir Richard Burton, and he inherited from her considerable height, being 1.93 metres tall (6&#x27;4&quot;). The Countess of Fingall, wife of Dunsany&#x27;s cousin, the Earl of Fingall, wrote a best-selling account of the life of the aristocracy in Ireland in the late 19th century and early 20th century called &quot;Seventy Years Young&quot;.

Plunkett&#x27;s only adult sibling, a younger brother, from whom he was estranged from about 1916, for reasons not fully clear but connected to his mother&#x27;s will, was the noted British naval officer Sir Reginald Drax. Another younger brother died in infancy.

Edward Plunkett grew up at the family properties, notably Dunstall Priory in Shoreham, Kent, and Dunsany Castle in County Meath, but also in family homes such as in London. His schooling was at Cheam, Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, which he entered in 1896.

===Title and marriage===

The title passed to him at his father&#x27;s death in 1899 at a fairly young age. The young Lord Dunsany returned to Dunsany Castle after war duty, in 1901. In that year he was also confirmed as an elector for the Irish representative peers in the House of Lords.

In 1903, he met Lady Beatrice Child Villiers (1880–1970), youngest daughter of The 7th Earl of Jersey (head of the Jersey banking family), who was then living at Osterley Park. They married in 1904. Their one child, Randal, was born in 1906. Lady Beatrice was supportive of Dunsany&#x27;s interests and helped him by typing his manuscripts, selecting work for his collections, including the 1954 retrospective short story collection, and overseeing his literary heritage after his death.

The Dunsanys were socially active in Dublin and London and travelled between homes in Meath, London and Kent, other than during the First and Second world wars and the Irish War of Independence. Dunsany circulated with many literary figures of the time. To many of these in Ireland he was first introduced by his uncle, the co-operative pioneer Sir Horace Plunkett, who also helped to manage his estate and investments for a time. He was friendly, for example, with George William Russell, Oliver St. John Gogarty, and for a time, W. B. Yeats. He also socialised at times with George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, and was a friend of Rudyard Kipling.

In 1910 Dunsany commissioned a two-storey extension to Dunsany Castle, with a billiard room, bedrooms and other facilities. The billiard room includes the crests of all the Lords Dunsany up to the 18th.

===Military experience===

Dunsany served as a second lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards in the Second Boer War. Volunteering in the First World War and appointed Captain in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he was stationed for a time at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. Hearing while on leave of disturbances in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916, he drove in to offer help and was wounded by a bullet lodged in his skull. After recovery at Jervis Street Hospital and what was then the King George V Hospital (now St. Bricin&#x27;s Military Hospital), he returned to duty. His military belt was lost in the episode and later used at the burial of Michael Collins. Having been refused forward positioning in 1916 and listed as valuable as a trainer, he served in the later war stages in the trenches and in the final period writing propaganda material for the War Office with MI7b(1). There is a book at Dunsany Castle with wartime photographs, on which lost members of his command are marked.

During the Irish War of Independence, Dunsany was charged with violating the Restoration of Order in Ireland Regulations, tried by court-martial on 4 February 1921, convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of 25 pounds or serve three months in prison without labour. The Crown Forces had searched Dunsany Castle and had found two double-barrelled shotguns, two rook rifles, four Very pistols, an automatic pistol and a large quantity of pistol ammunition, along with shotgun and rifle ammunition.

During the Second World War, Dunsany signed up for the Irish Army Reserve and the British Home Guard, the two countries&#x27; local defence forces, and was especially active in Shoreham, Kent, the English village bombed most during the Battle of Britain.
===Literary life===

Dunsany&#x27;s fame arose chiefly from his prolific writings. He was involved in the Irish Literary Revival. Supporting the Revival, Dunsany was a major donor to the Abbey Theatre and he moved in Irish literary circles. He was well acquainted with W. B. Yeats (who rarely acted as editor but gathered and published a Dunsany selection), Lady Gregory, Percy French, George &quot;AE&quot; Russell, Oliver St John Gogarty, Padraic Colum (with whom he jointly wrote a play) and others. He befriended and supported Francis Ledwidge, to whom he gave the use of his library, and Mary Lavin.

Dunsany made his first literary tour to the United States in 1919 and further such visits up to the 1950s, in the early years mostly to the eastern seaboard and later, notably, to California.

Dunsany&#x27;s own work and contribution to the Irish literary heritage were recognised with an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin.

===Early 1940s===
In 1940, Dunsany was appointed Byron Professor of English in Athens University, Greece. Having reached Athens by a circuitous route, he was so successful that he was offered a post as Professor of English in Istanbul. However, he had to be evacuated due to the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, returning home by an even more complex route, his travels forming a basis for a long poem published in book form (&quot;A Journey, in 5 cantos: The Battle of Britain, The Battle of Greece, The Battle of the Mediterranean, Battles Long Ago, The Battle of the Atlantic&quot;, special edition January 1944). Olivia Manning&#x27;s character Lord Pinkrose in her novel sequence the &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; was a mocking portrait of Dunsany in that period.

===Later life===

In 1947, Dunsany transferred his Meath estate in trust to his son and heir Randal and settled in Kent at his Shoreham house, Dunstall Priory. He visited Ireland only occasionally thereafter, and engaged actively in life in Shoreham and London. He also began a new series of visits to the United States, notably California, as recounted in Hazel Littlefield-Smith&#x27;s biographical &quot;Dunsany, King of Dreams&quot;.

===Death===
In 1957, Lord Dunsany became ill while dining with the Earl and Countess of Fingall at Dunsany, in what proved to be an attack of appendicitis. He died in hospital in Dublin, at the age of 79. He was buried in the churchyard of the ancient church of St Peter and St Paul, Shoreham, Kent. His funeral was attended by many family members (including Pakenhams, Jerseys and Fingalls), representatives of his old regiment and various bodies in which he had taken an interest, and figures from Shoreham. A memorial service was held at Kilmessan in Meath, with a reading of &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot;, which coincided with the passing of a flock of geese.

Beatrice survived Dunsany, living mainly at Shoreham and overseeing his literary legacy until her death in 1970. Their son Randal succeeded to the barony and was in turn succeeded by his grandson, the artist Edward Plunkett. Dunsany&#x27;s literary rights passed from Beatrice to Edward.

===Interests===
Aside from his literary work, Dunsany was a keen chess player, setting chess puzzles for journals such as &quot;The Times&quot; of London, playing José Raúl Capablanca to a draw in a simultaneous exhibition, and inventing Dunsany&#x27;s Chess, an asymmetrical chess variant notable for not involving any fairy pieces, unlike the many variants that require the player to learn unconventional piece movements. He was president of both the Irish Chess Union and the Kent County Chess Association for some years and of Sevenoaks Chess Club for 54 years. His short story &quot;The Three Sailors&#x27; Gambit&quot; is a classic work of suspense that incorporates a strong and unique chess element into its plot.

Dunsany was an avid horseman and hunter, for many years hosting the hounds of a local hunt and hunting in parts of Africa. He was at one time the pistol-shooting champion of Ireland. Dunsany also campaigned for animal rights, being known especially for his opposition to the &quot;docking&quot; of dogs&#x27; tails, and presided over the West Kent branch of the RSPCA in his later years. He enjoyed cricket, provided the local cricket ground situated near Dunsany Crossroads, and later played for and presided at Shoreham Cricket Club in Kent. He was a supporter of Scouting for many years, serving as President of the Sevenoaks district Boy Scouts Association. He also supported an amateur drama group, the Shoreham Players.

Dunsany provided support for the British Legion in both Ireland and Kent, including grounds in Trim and poetry for the Irish branch&#x27;s annual memorial service on a number of occasions.

==Writings==

Dunsany was a prolific writer of short stories, novels, plays, poetry, essays and autobiography. He published over 90 books in his lifetime, not including individual plays. Books have continued to appear, with more than 120 having been issued by 2017. Dunsany&#x27;s works have been published in many languages.

===Early career===
Dunsany began his literary career in the late 1890s writing under his given name, with published verses such as &quot;Rhymes from a Suburb&quot; and &quot;The Spirit of the Bog&quot;. In 1905, writing as Lord Dunsany, he produced the well-received collection &quot;The Gods of Pegāna.&quot;

===Early fantasy===
Dunsany&#x27;s most notable fantasy short stories appeared in collections from 1905 to 1919, before fantasy had been recognised as a distinct genre. He paid for the publication of the first collection, &quot;The Gods of Pegāna,&quot; earning a commission on sales.

The stories in his first two books, and perhaps the beginning of his third, were set in an invented world, Pegāna, with its own gods, history and geography. Starting with this, Dunsany&#x27;s name is linked to that of Sidney Sime, his chosen artist, who illustrated much of his work, notably up to 1922.

===Drama===
After &quot;The Book of Wonder&quot; (1912), Dunsany began to write plays – many of which were even more successful at the time than his early story collections – while continuing to write short stories. He carried on writing plays for the theatre into the 1930s, including the famous &quot;If&quot; (1921), and also some radio productions.

Although many of Dunsany&#x27;s plays were successfully staged in his lifetime, he also wrote &quot;chamber plays&quot; or closet dramas. Some of these chamber or radio plays involve supernatural events – a character appearing out of thin air or vanishing in full view of the audience, without an explanation of how the effect is to be staged, a matter of no importance, as Dunsany did not intend them to be performed live.

===Middle period===
After a successful US lecture tour in 1919–1920, Dunsany&#x27;s reputation was now related principally to his plays. He temporarily reduced his output of short stories, concentrating on plays, novels and poetry for a time. His poetry, now little seen, was for a time so popular that it is recited by the lead character of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. His sonnet &quot;A Dirge of Victory&quot; was the only poem included in the Armistice Day edition of the &quot;Times&quot; of London.

Launching another phase of his work, Dunsany&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley&quot; appeared in 1922. It is set in &quot;a Romantic Spain that never was&quot; and follows the adventures of a young nobleman, Don Rodriguez, and his servant in their search for a castle for Rodriguez. In 1924, Dunsany published his second novel, &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; a return to his early style of writing. In his next novel, &quot;The Charwoman&#x27;s Shadow,&quot; Dunsany returned to the Spanish milieu and the light style of &quot;Don Rodriguez&quot;.

Among his best-known characters was Joseph Jorkens, an obese, middle-aged raconteur who frequented the fictional Billiards Club in London and would tell fantastic stories if anyone bought him a large whiskey and soda. From his tales, it was clear that Jorkens had travelled to all seven continents, was extremely resourceful and well-versed in world cultures, but always came up short on becoming rich and famous. The &quot;Jorkens&quot; books, which sold well, were among the first of a type that would become popular in fantasy and science fiction writing: highly improbable &quot;club tales&quot; told at a gentleman&#x27;s club or bar.

Some saw Dunsany&#x27;s writing habits as peculiar. Lady Beatrice said, &quot;He always sat on a crumpled old hat while composing his tales&quot;. (The hat was eventually stolen by a visitor to Dunsany Castle.) Dunsany almost never rewrote anything; everything he published was a first draft. Much of his work was written with a quill pen he made himself; Lady Beatrice was usually the first to see the writings and would help to type them. It has been said that Lord Dunsany sometimes conceived stories while hunting and would return to the Castle and draw in his family and servants to re-enact his visions before he set them on paper.

===Translations===
Dunsany&#x27;s work was translated from early on into languages that include Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Czech and Turkish – his uncle, Horace Plunkett, suggested 14 languages by the 1920s.

===Style and themes===
Dunsany&#x27;s style varied significantly throughout his writing career. Prominent Dunsany scholar S. T. Joshi has described these shifts as Dunsany moving on after he felt he had exhausted the potential of a style or medium. From the naïve fantasy of his earliest writings, through his early short-story work in 1904–1908, he turned to the self-conscious fantasy of &quot;The Book of Wonder&quot; in 1912, in which he almost seems to be parodying his lofty early style.

Each of his collections varies in mood; &quot;A Dreamer&#x27;s Tales&quot; varies from the wistfulness of &quot;Blagdaross&quot; to the horrors of &quot;Poor Old Bill&quot; and &quot;Where the Tides Ebb and Flow&quot; to the social satire of &quot;The Day of the Poll.&quot; The opening paragraph of &quot;The Hoard of the Gibbelins&quot; from &quot;The Book of Wonder,&quot; (1912) gives a good indication of both the tone and tenor of Dunsany&#x27;s style at the time:

The Gibbelins eat, as is well known, nothing less good than man. Their evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a bridge. Their hoard is beyond reason; avarice has no use for it; they have a separate cellar for emeralds and a separate cellar for sapphires; they have filled a hole with gold and dig it up when they need it. And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of famine, they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough, their larders would soon be full again.

Despite his frequent shifts of style and medium, Dunsany&#x27;s thematic concerns remained essentially the same. Many of his later novels had an explicitly Irish theme, from the semi-autobiographical &quot;The Curse of the Wise Woman&quot; to &quot;His Fellow Men.&quot;

==Memberships, awards and honours==
Lord Dunsany was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a member and at one point President of the Authors&#x27; Society, and likewise President of the Shakespeare Reading Society from 1938 until his death in 1957, when he was succeeded by Sir John Gielgud.

Dunsany was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was an honorary member of the Institut Historique et Heraldique de France. He was initially an Associate Member of the Irish Academy of Letters, founded by Yeats and others, and later a full member. At one of their meetings, after 1922, he asked Seán Ó Faoláin, who was presiding, &quot;Do we not toast the King?&quot; Ó Faoláin replied that there was only one toast: to the Nation; but after it was given and O&#x27;Faolain had called for coffee, he saw Dunsany, standing quietly among the bustle, raise his glass discreetly, and whisper &quot;God bless him&quot;.

&quot;The Curse of the Wise Woman&quot; received the Harmsworth Literary Award in Ireland.

Dunsany received an honorary doctorate, D.Litt., from Trinity College Dublin, in 1940. 

In 1950, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Irish PEN, citing his fiction, poetry, and support for younger writers. However, after a negative appraisal by Per Hallström, the Nobel Committee did not consider him for the prize, which was won that year by Bertrand Russell.

==Bibliography==
==Influences==
*Dunsany studied Greek and Latin, particularly Greek drama and Herodotus, the &quot;Father of History&quot;. Dunsany wrote in a letter: &quot;When I learned Greek at Cheam and heard of other gods a great pity came on me for those beautiful marble people that had become forsaken and this mood has never quite left me.&quot;1
*The King James Bible: In a letter to Frank Harris, Dunsany wrote: &quot;When I went to Cheam School I was given a lot of the Bible to read. This turned my thoughts eastward. For years no style seemed to me natural but that of the Bible and I feared that I never would become a writer when I saw that other people did not use it.&quot;
*The Library of Dunsany Castle had a wide-ranging collection dating back centuries and comprising many classic works, from early encyclopaedias through parliamentary records, Greek and Latin works to Victorian illustrated books.
*His father&#x27;s tale about ancient Egypt also influenced him.
*He was affected by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, and by the work of Edgar Allan Poe.
*Rudyard Kipling and his works set in India were also read by him.
*Irish speech patterns were an influence.
*&quot;The Darling of the Gods&quot;, a stage play written by David Belasco and John Luther Long, was first performed in 1902–1903. It presents a fantastical, imaginary version of Japan that powerfully affected Dunsany and may be a template for his own imaginary kingdoms.
*Algernon Charles Swinburne, who wrote the line &quot;Time and the Gods are at strife&quot; in his 1866 poem &quot;Hymn to Proserpine&quot;: Dunsany later realised this was his unconscious influence for the title &quot;Time and the Gods&quot;.
*The heroic romances of William Morris, set in imaginary lands of the author&#x27;s creation affected him, such as &quot;The Well at the World&#x27;s End&quot;.
*Dunsany&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley&quot; seems to draw openly on Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot; (1605 and 1615).
*Dunsany named his play &quot;The Seventh Symphony&quot;, collected in &quot;Plays for Earth and Air&quot; [1937], after Beethoven&#x27;s 7th Symphony, which was one of Dunsany&#x27;s favourite works of music. One of the last &quot;Jorkens&quot; stories returns to this theme, referring to Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Tenth Symphony&quot;.

==Writers associated with Dunsany==
*Francis Ledwidge wrote to Dunsany in 1912 asking for help in getting his poetry published. After a delay due to a hunting trip in Africa, Dunsany invited him to his home and they met and corresponded regularly thereafter. Dunsany was so impressed that he helped with publication and with introductions to literary society. Dunsany, trying to discourage Ledwidge from joining the army when the First World War broke out, offered him financial support. Ledwidge, however, joined up and found himself for a time in the same unit as Dunsany, who helped with the publication of his first collection, &quot;Songs of the Fields&quot; – a critical success on its release in 1915. Ledwidge kept in contact with Dunsany through the war, sending him poems. He was killed at the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917, even as his second collection of poetry, also selected by Dunsany, circulated. Dunsany later arranged for a third collection to appear, and later still a first &quot;Collected Edition&quot;. Some unpublished Ledwidge poetry and drama, given or sent to Dunsany, are still held at the Castle.
*Mary Lavin who received support and encouragement from Dunsany over many years.
*William Butler Yeats, although he rarely acted as such, selected and edited a collection of Dunsany&#x27;s work in 1912.
*Lady Wentworth, a poet writing in a classical style, received support from Dunsany.

==Writers influenced by Dunsany==
*H. P. Lovecraft was much impressed by Dunsany after seeing him on a speaking tour of the United States. His &quot;Dream Cycle&quot; stories, his dark pseudo-history of how the universe came to be, and his god Azathoth all clearly show Dunsany&#x27;s influence. He once wrote: &quot;There are my &#x27;Poe&#x27; pieces and my &#x27;Dunsany&#x27; pieces – but alas – where are my Lovecraft pieces?&quot;
*Robert E. Howard placed Dunsany in a list of his favourite poets in a 1932 letter to Lovecraft.
*Clark Ashton Smith was a fan of Dunsany&#x27;s work, which had some influence on his fantasy stories.
*J. R. R. Tolkien, according to John D. Rateliff&#x27;s report, presented Clyde S. Kilby with a copy of &quot;The Book of Wonder&quot; as a preparation for his auxiliary role in compiling and developing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in the 1960s. Tolkien&#x27;s letters and divulged notes made allusions to two stories found in the volume, &quot;Chu-Bu and Sheemish&quot; and &quot;The Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweller.&quot; Dale J. Nelson has argued in &quot;Tolkien Studies 01&quot; that Tolkien may have been inspired by another of &quot;The Book of Wonder&quot; tales, &quot;The Hoard of the Gibbelins,&quot; while writing a poem, &quot;The Mewlips&quot;, included in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;.
*Guillermo del Toro, Mexican film-maker, cited Dunsany as an influence; He dedicated his book &quot;The Hollow Ones&quot; to him among other &quot;old-school horror/fantasy writers&quot;.
*Neil Gaiman expressed admiration for Dunsany and wrote an introduction to a collection of his stories. Some commentators have seen links between &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; (book and film). This is seemingly supported by a comment of Gaiman&#x27;s quoted in &quot;The Neil Gaiman Reader&quot;.
*Jorge Luis Borges included Dunsany&#x27;s short story &quot;The Idle City&quot; in &quot;Antología de la Literatura Fantástica&quot; (1940, revised 1976). He also, in his essay &quot;Kafka and His Precursors,&quot; included Dunsany&#x27;s story &quot;Carcassonne&quot; as one text that presaged or paralleled Franz Kafka&#x27;s themes.

==Curator and studies==
In the late 1990s, a curator, J. W. (Joe) Doyle, was appointed by the estate to work at Dunsany Castle, in part to locate and organise the author&#x27;s manuscripts, typescripts and other materials. Doyle found several works known to exist but thought to be &quot;lost&quot;: the plays &quot;The Ginger Cat&quot; and &quot;The Murderers,&quot; some Jorkens stories, and the novel &quot;The Pleasures of a Futuroscope&quot; (later published by Hippocampus Press). He also found hitherto unknown works, including &quot;The Last Book of Jorkens&quot;, to the first edition of which he wrote an introduction, and an unnamed 1956 short story collection, eventually published as part of &quot;The Ghost in the Corner and other stories&quot; in 2017. Doyle was still working as curator in 2020. Some uncollected works, previously published in magazines, and some unpublished works, have been selected in consultation with them, and published in chapbooks by a US small press.

Fans and scholars S. T. Joshi and Darrell Schweitzer worked on the Dunsany œuvre for over twenty years, gathering stories, essays and reference material, for a joint initial bibliography and separate scholarly studies of Dunsany&#x27;s work. An updated edition of their bibliography appeared in 2013. Joshi edited &quot;The Collected Jorkens&quot; and &quot;The Ginger Cat and other lost plays&quot; and co-edited &quot;The Ghost in the Corner and other stories&quot; using materials unearthed by the Dunsany curator.

In the late 2000s a PhD researcher, Tania Scott from the University of Glasgow, worked on Dunsany for some time and spoke at literary and other conventions; her thesis was published in 2011, entitled &quot;Locating Ireland in the fantastic fiction of Lord Dunsany&quot;. A Swedish fan, Martin Andersson, was also active in research and publication in the mid-2010s.

===Documentary===
An hour-long documentary, &quot;Shooting for the Butler&quot;, was released by Auteur TV and Justified Films in 2014, directed by Digby Rumsey. With footage from Dunsany and Shoreham, it included interviews with the author&#x27;s great-grandson, the estate&#x27;s curator, author Liz Williams, scholar S. T. Joshi, a local who knew the writer personally, and the head of the Irish Chess Union, among others.

==Legacy==

Dunsany&#x27;s literary rights passed to a will trust first managed by Beatrice, Lady Dunsany, and are currently handled by Curtis Brown of London and partner firms worldwide. (Some past US deals, for example, have been listed by Locus Magazine as by SCG.) A few Dunsany works are protected for longer than normal copyright periods in some territories, notably most of the contents of the &quot;Last Book of Jorkens&quot;, and some short stories published on the Dunsany website or elsewhere by the family in the early 2000s.

Dunsany&#x27;s primary home, over 820 years old, can be visited at certain times. Tours usually include the Library, but not the tower room where he often liked to work. His other home, Dunstall Priory, was sold to an admirer, Grey Gowrie, later head of the Arts Council of the UK, and then passed to other owners. The family still owns a farm and downland in the area and a Tudor cottage in Shoreham village. The grave of Dunsany and his wife can be seen in the church graveyard there. (Most previous barons are buried in the grounds of Dunsany Castle.)

Dunsany&#x27;s manuscripts are collected in the family archive, including some specially bound volumes of some of his works. Scholarly access is possible through the curator. Seven boxes of Dunsany&#x27;s papers are held at the Harry Ransom Center.

<doc id="17914" wikidata="Q255" url="?curid=17914" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 177026 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. He is one of the most revered figures in the history of Western music; his works rank among the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterised as heroic. During this time, Beethoven began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.

Born in Bonn, Beethoven displayed his musical talent at a young age. He was initially taught intensively by his father, Johann van Beethoven, and later by Christian Gottlob Neefe. Under Neefe&#x27;s tutelage in 1783, he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and was soon patronised by Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.

Beethoven&#x27;s first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, premiered in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. Despite his advancing deafness during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the &quot;Emperor&quot;), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria, premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1815, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; (1812).

After 1810, increasingly less socially involved as his hearing loss worsened, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature chamber music and the late piano sonatas. His only opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed the Missa solemnis between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony, No. 9, the first major example of a choral symphony, between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his late string quartets, including the &quot;Grosse Fuge&quot;, of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements. After several months of illness, which left him bedridden, he died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56.

== Life and career ==
===Early life and education===
Beethoven was the grandson of Ludwig van Beethoven, a musician from the town of Mechelen in the Austrian Duchy of Brabant in what is now the Flemish region of Belgium, who moved to Bonn at the age of 21. Ludwig was employed as a bass singer at the court of Clemens August, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, eventually rising to become, in 1761, Kapellmeister (music director) and hence a preeminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself toward the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson&#x27;s rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage. Ludwig had two sons, the younger of whom, Johann, worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to supplement his income.

Johann married Maria Magdalena Keverich in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701–1751), who was head chef at the court of Johann IX Philipp von Walderdorff, Archbishop of Trier. Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn, at what is now the Beethoven House Museum, Bonngasse 20. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; but the registry of his baptism, in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.

Of the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. Kaspar Anton Karl (generally known as Karl) was born on 8 April 1774, and Nikolaus Johann, who was generally known as Johann, the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.

Beethoven&#x27;s first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers, including the court organist Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), , a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition, Franz Rovantini, a relative who instructed him in playing the violin and viola, and court concertmaster Franz Anton Ries, who instructed Beethoven on the violin. His tuition began in his fifth year. The regime was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears. With the involvement of Pfeiffer, who was an insomniac, there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven dragged from his bed to the keyboard. Beethoven&#x27;s musical talent became obvious at a young age. Aware of Leopold Mozart&#x27;s successes in this area with his son Wolfgang and daughter Nannerl, Johann attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy, claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.

In 1780 or 1781, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn, Christian Gottlob Neefe. Neefe taught him composition; in March 1783, Beethoven&#x27;s first published work appeared, a set of keyboard variations (WoO 63). Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel. His first three piano sonatas, WoO 47, sometimes known as (Elector) for their dedication to Elector Maximilian Friedrich, were published in 1783. In the same year, the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the &quot;Magazin der Musik&quot; – &quot;Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent. He plays the piano very skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well ... the chief piece he plays is &quot;Das wohltemperierte Klavier&quot; of Sebastian Bach, which Herr Neefe puts into his hands&quot;. Maximilian Friedrich&#x27;s successor as Elector of Bonn was Maximilian Franz. He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and assisting financially with Beethoven&#x27;s move to Vienna in 1792.

During this time, Beethoven met several people who became important in his life. He developed a close relationship with the upper-class von Breuning family, and gave piano lessons to some of the children. The widowed Helene von Breuning became a &quot;second mother&quot; to Beethoven, taught him more refined manners and nurtured his passion for literature and poetry. The warmth and closeness of the von Breuning family offered the young Beethoven a retreat from his unhappy home life, dominated by his father&#x27;s decline due to alcoholism. Beethoven also met Franz Wegeler, a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend and married one of the von Breuning daughters. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was Count Ferdinand von Waldstein, who became a friend and financial supporter of Beethoven during this period. In 1791, Waldstein commissioned Beethoven&#x27;s first work for the stage, the ballet &quot;&quot; (WoO 1).

The period of 1785 to 1790 includes virtually no record of Beethoven&#x27;s activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the varied response his initial publications attracted, and also to ongoing issues in his family. While passing through Augsburg, Beethoven visited with composer Anna von Schaden and her husband, who gave him money to return to Bonn to be with his ailing mother. Beethoven&#x27;s mother died in July 1787, shortly after his return from Vienna, where he stayed for around two weeks and possibly met Mozart. In 1789, due to his chronic alcoholism, Beethoven&#x27;s father was forced to retire from the service of the Court and it was ordered that half of his father&#x27;s pension be paid directly to Ludwig for support of the family. Ludwig contributed further to the family&#x27;s income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had &quot;an extraordinary aversion&quot;) and by playing viola in the court orchestra. This familiarised him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, Gluck and Paisiello. There he also befriended Anton Reicha, a composer, flutist, and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra&#x27;s conductor, Josef Reicha.

From 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed several works, none of which were published at the time; they showed a growing range and maturity. Musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his Third Symphony in a set of variations written in 1791. It was perhaps on Neefe&#x27;s recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the recent death of Joseph II (WoO 87), and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of Leopold II as Holy Roman Emperor (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector. These two &quot;Emperor Cantatas&quot; were not performed during Beethoven&#x27;s lifetime and became lost until the 1880s, when Johannes Brahms called them &quot;Beethoven through and through&quot; and of the style that marked Beethoven&#x27;s music distinct from the classical tradition.

Beethoven was probably first introduced to Joseph Haydn in late 1790, when Haydn was travelling to London and made a brief stop in Bonn around Christmastime. In July 1792, they met again in Bonn on Haydn&#x27;s return trip from London to Vienna, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the Redoute in Godesberg. Arrangements were likely made at that time for Beethoven to study with Haydn. Waldstein wrote to Beethoven before his departure: &quot;You are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes ... With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart&#x27;s spirit from Haydn&#x27;s hands.&quot;

=== 1792–1802: Vienna – the early years ===

Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792 amid rumours of war spilling out of France. Shortly after departing, Beethoven learned that his father had died. Over the next few years, he responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying Mozart&#x27;s work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartian flavour.

Beethoven did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn&#x27;s direction, he sought to master counterpoint. He also studied violin under Ignaz Schuppanzigh. Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from Antonio Salieri, primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.

With Haydn&#x27;s departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with Johann Albrechtsberger and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return. But several Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz, Prince Karl Lichnowsky, and Baron Gottfried van Swieten.

Assisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility. His friend Nikolaus Simrock began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of Dittersdorf (WoO 66). By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.

In 1795, Beethoven made his public debut in Vienna over three days, beginning with a performance of one of his own piano concertos on 29 March at the Burgtheater and ending with a Mozart concerto on 31 March, probably the D minor concerto, for which he had written a cadenza soon after his arrival in Vienna. By this year he had two piano concertos available for performance, one in B-flat major he had begun composing before moving to Vienna and had worked on for over a decade, and one in C major composed for the most part during 1795. Viewing the latter as the more substantive work, he chose to designate it his first piano concerto, publishing it in March 1801 as Opus 15, before publishing the former as Opus 19 the following December. He wrote new cadenzas for both in 1809.

Shortly after his public debut, Beethoven arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, Opus 1. These works were dedicated to his patron Prince Lichnowsky, and were a financial success; Beethoven&#x27;s profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year. In 1799, Beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano &#x27;duel&#x27; at the home of Baron Raimund Wetzlar (a former patron of Mozart) against the virtuoso Joseph Wölfl; and the next year he similarly triumphed against Daniel Steibelt at the salon of Count Moritz von Fries. Beethoven&#x27;s eighth piano sonata, the Pathétique (Op. 13, published in 1799), is described by the musicologist Barry Cooper as &quot;surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation&quot;.

Between 1798 and 1800, Beethoven composed his first six string quartets (Op. 18) (commissioned by, and dedicated to, Prince Lobkowitz), published in 1801. He also completed his Septet (Op. 20) in 1799, a work which was extremely popular during Beethoven&#x27;s lifetime. With premieres of his First and Second Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, Beethoven became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published. For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the Burgtheater on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; called &quot;the most interesting concert in a long time&quot;, was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that &quot;the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist&quot;. By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.

In May 1799, Beethoven taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik. During this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter, Josephine. Among his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored Ferdinand Ries, who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters. The young Carl Czerny, who later became a renowned pianist and music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. Czerny described his teacher at their initial meeting in 1801: Beethoven was dressed in a jacket of shaggy dark grey material and matching trousers, and he reminded me immediately of Campe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, whose book I was reading just then. His jet-black hair bristled shaggily around his head. His beard, unshaven for several days, made the lower part of his swarthy face still darker. In late 1801, Beethoven met a young countess, Julie Guicciardi, through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing it. He dedicated his 1802 Sonata Op. 27 No. 2, now commonly known as the &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot;, to her.

In the spring of 1801, Beethoven completed a ballet, &quot;The Creatures of Prometheus&quot; (op. 43). The work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802 and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity. Beethoven completed his Second Symphony in 1802, intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled. The symphony received its premiere one year later, at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the Theater an der Wien, where Beethoven had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the Third Piano Concerto, and the oratorio &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot;. Reviews of the concert were mixed, but it was a financial success; Beethoven was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.

In 1802, Beethoven&#x27;s brother Kaspar began to assist the composer in handling his affairs, particularly his business dealings with music publishers. In addition to successfully negotiating higher payments for Beethoven&#x27;s latest works, Kaspar also began selling several of Beethoven&#x27;s earlier unpublished compositions and encouraged his brother (against Beethoven&#x27;s preference) to make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instruments and combinations. Beethoven decided to accede to these requests, as he was powerless to prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.

=== 1802–1812: The &quot;heroic&quot; period ===
====Deafness====

Beethoven told the English pianist Charles Neate (in 1815) that his hearing loss began in 1798, during a heated quarrel with a singer. During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend, , describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the issues). The cause was probably otosclerosis, possibly accompanied by degeneration of the auditory nerve.

On his doctor&#x27;s advice, Beethoven moved to the small Austrian town of Heiligenstadt, just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition. There he wrote the document now known as the Heiligenstadt Testament, a letter to his brothers that records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and his resolution to continue living for and through his art. The letter was never sent and was discovered in his papers after his death. The letters to Wegeler and Amenda were not so despairing; in them Beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to Wegeler, to &quot;seize Fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely&quot;. In 1806, Beethoven noted on one of his musical sketches: &quot;Let your deafness no longer be a secret—even in art.&quot;

Although Beethoven&#x27;s hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, it made playing at concerts—an important source of income at this phase of his life—increasingly difficult. It also contributed substantially to his social withdrawal. Czerny remarked that Beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812. Contrary to common belief, Beethoven never became totally deaf; in his final years, he was still able to distinguish low tones and sudden loud sounds.

====Heroic style====
Beethoven&#x27;s return to Vienna from Heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or &quot;heroic&quot; period, characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale. According to Czerny, Beethoven said: &quot;I am not satisfied with the work I have done so far. From now on I intend to take a new way.&quot; An early major work employing this new style was the Third Symphony in E-flat, Op. 55, known as the &quot;Eroica&quot;, written in 1803–04. The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of Napoleon may have been suggested to Beethoven by General Bernadotte in 1798. Sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, Beethoven originally gave the symphony the title &quot;Bonaparte&quot;, but disillusioned by Napoleon declaring himself Emperor in 1804, he scratched Napoleon&#x27;s name from the manuscript&#x27;s title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle &quot;to celebrate the memory of a great man&quot;. The &quot;Eroica&quot; was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony. When it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception. Some listeners objected to its length or disliked its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece.

Other middle-period works extend in the same dramatic manner the musical language Beethoven had inherited. The Rasumovsky string quartets and the &quot;Waldstein&quot; and &quot;Appassionata&quot; piano sonatas share the Third Symphony&#x27;s heroic spirit. Other works of this period include the Fourth through Eighth Symphonies, the oratorio &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot;, the opera &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and the Violin Concerto. Beethoven was hailed in 1810 by the writer and composer E. T. A. Hoffmann, in an influential review in the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, as the greatest of (what he considered) the three Romantic composers (that is, ahead of Haydn and Mozart); in Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony his music, wrote Hoffmann, &quot;sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism&quot;.

During this time, Beethoven&#x27;s income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period before their publication. Some of his early patrons, including Lobkowitz and Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works. Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was Archduke Rudolf of Austria, the youngest son of Emperor Leopold II, who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him. They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824. Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolf, including such major works as the &quot;Archduke&quot; Trio Op. 97 (1811) and &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; Op. 123 (1823).

His position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on &quot;Leonore&quot; (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian censor and finally premiered, under its present title of &quot;Fidelio&quot;, in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the French occupation of the city. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of &quot;Fidelio&quot; was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.

Despite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher Muzio Clementi secured the rights to publish his works in England, and Haydn&#x27;s former patron Prince Esterházy commissioned the Mass in C, Op. 86, for his wife&#x27;s name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert he organised in December 1808, widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and Sixth (&quot;Pastoral&quot;) symphonies, the Fourth Piano Concerto, extracts from the Mass in C, the scena and aria &quot;Ah! perfido&quot; Op. 65 and the Choral Fantasy op. 80. There was a large audience (including Czerny and the young Ignaz Moscheles), but it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the Fantasia Beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians &quot;badly played, wrong, again!&quot; The financial outcome is unknown.

In the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the Royal Theatre, Beethoven received an offer from Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jérôme Bonaparte, then king of Westphalia, for a well-paid position as Kapellmeister at the court in Cassel. To persuade him to stay in Vienna, Archduke Rudolf, Prince Kinsky and Prince Lobkowitz, after receiving representations from Beethoven&#x27;s friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year. In the event, Rudolf paid his share of the pension on the agreed date. Kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in November 1812 after falling from his horse. The Austrian currency destabilised and Lobkowitz went bankrupt in 1811 so that to benefit from the agreement Beethoven eventually had recourse to the law, which in 1815 brought him some recompense.

The imminence of war reaching Vienna itself was felt in early 1809. In April, Beethoven completed writing his Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat major, Op. 73, which the musicologist Alfred Einstein has called &quot;the apotheosis of the military concept&quot; in Beethoven&#x27;s music. Rudolf left the capital with the Imperial family in early May, prompting Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonata &quot;Les Adieux&quot; (Sonata No. 26, Op. 81a), actually titled by Beethoven in German &quot;Das Lebewohl&quot; (The Farewell), of which the final movement, &quot;Das Wiedersehen&quot; (The Return), is dated in the manuscript with the date of Rudolf&#x27;s homecoming of 30 January 1810. During the French bombardment of Vienna in May, Beethoven took refuge in the cellar of his brother Kaspar&#x27;s house. The subsequent occupation of Vienna and disruptions to cultural life and to Beethoven&#x27;s publishers, together with Beethoven&#x27;s poor health at the end of 1809, explain his significantly reduced output during this period, although other notable works of the year include his String Quartet No. 10 in E-flat major, Op. 74 (&quot;The Harp&quot;) and the Piano Sonata No. 24 in F-sharp major, Op. 78, dedicated to Josephine&#x27;s sister Therese Brunsvik.

====Goethe====

At the end of 1809, Beethoven was commissioned to write incidental music for Goethe&#x27;s play &quot;Egmont&quot;. The result (an overture, and nine additional entractes and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810, fit well with Beethoven&#x27;s heroic style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about him from a mutual acquaintance, Bettina Brentano (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor String Quartet Op. 95, to which Beethoven gave the subtitle &quot;Quartetto serioso&quot;, and the Op. 97 Piano Trio in B-flat major known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph, as the &quot;Archduke Trio&quot;.

In the spring of 1811, Beethoven became seriously ill, with headaches and high fever. His doctor Johann Malfatti recommended he take a cure at the spa of Teplitz (now Teplice in the Czech Republic), where he wrote two more overtures and sets of incidental music for dramas, this time by August von Kotzebue – &quot;King Stephen&quot; Op. 117 and &quot;The Ruins of Athens&quot; Op. 113. Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812, he met there with Goethe, who wrote: &quot;His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable ... by his attitude.&quot; Beethoven wrote to his publishers Breitkopf and Härtel, &quot;Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.&quot; But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Meeresstille und glückliche Fahrt&quot; &quot;(Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage)&quot;, Op. 112, completed in 1815. After it was published in 1822 with a dedication to the poet, Beethoven wrote to him: &quot;The admiration, the love and esteem which already in my youth I cherished for the one and only immortal Goethe have persisted.&quot;

====The Immortal Beloved====

While Beethoven was at Teplitz in 1812, he wrote a ten-page love letter to his &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;, which he never sent to its addressee. The identity of the intended recipient was long a subject of debate, although the musicologist Maynard Solomon has argued that the intended recipient was Antonie Brentano; other candidates included Julie Guicciardi, Therese Malfatti and Josephine Brunsvik.

All of these had been regarded by Beethoven as possible soulmates during his first decade in Vienna. Guicciardi, although she flirted with Beethoven, never had any serious interest in him and married Wenzel Robert von Gallenberg in November 1803. (Beethoven insisted to his later secretary and biographer, Anton Schindler, that Guicciardi had &quot;sought me out, crying, but I scorned her&quot;.) Josephine had, since Beethoven&#x27;s initial infatuation with her, married the elderly Count Joseph Deym, who died in 1804. Beethoven began to visit her and commenced a passionate correspondence. Initially, he accepted that Josephine could not love him, but he continued to address himself to her even after she had moved to Budapest, finally demonstrating that he had got the message in his last letter to her of 1807: &quot;I thank you for wishing still to appear as if I were not altogether banished from your memory&quot;. Malfatti was the niece of Beethoven&#x27;s doctor, and he had proposed to her in 1810. He was 40, and she was 19. The proposal was rejected. She is now remembered as the possible recipient of the piano bagatelle known as &quot;Für Elise&quot;.

Antonie (Toni) Brentano (née von Birkenstock), ten years younger than Beethoven, was the wife of , the half-brother of Bettina Brentano, who provided Beethoven&#x27;s introduction to the family. It would seem that Antonie and Beethoven had an affair during 1811–1812. Antonie left Vienna with her husband in late 1812 and never met with (or apparently corresponded with) Beethoven again, although in her later years, she wrote and spoke fondly of him. Some speculate that Beethoven was the father of Antonie&#x27;s son Karl Josef, though the two never met.

After 1812 there are no reports of any romantic liaisons of Beethoven&#x27;s; however, it is clear from his correspondence of the period and, later, from the conversation books, that he occasionally had sex with prostitutes.

===1813–1822: Acclaim===
====Family issues====

In early 1813, Beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped. His personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public, notably when dining.

Family issues may have played a part in this. Beethoven had visited his brother Johann at the end of October 1812. He wished to end Johann&#x27;s cohabitation with Therese Obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child. He was unable to convince Johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities, but Johann and Therese married on 8 November.

The illness and eventual death of his brother Kaspar from tuberculosis became an increasing concern. Kaspar had been ill for some time; in 1813 Beethoven lent him 1500 florins, to procure the repayment of which he was ultimately led to complex legal measures. After Kaspar died on 15 November 1815, Beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with Kaspar&#x27;s widow Johanna over custody of their son Karl, then nine years old. Beethoven had successfully applied to Kaspar to have himself named the sole guardian of the boy. A late codicil to Kaspar&#x27;s will gave him and Johanna joint guardianship. While Beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in January 1816, and had him removed to a private school, in 1818 he was again preoccupied with the legal processes around Karl. While giving evidence to the court for the nobility, the Landrechte, Beethoven was unable to prove that he was of noble birth and as a consequence, on 18 December 1818 the case was transferred to the civil magistrate of Vienna, where he lost sole guardianship. He regained custody after intensive legal struggles in 1820. During the years that followed, Beethoven frequently interfered in his nephew&#x27;s life in what Karl perceived as an overbearing manner.

====Post-war Vienna====

Beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in June 1813 when news arrived of the French defeat at the Battle of Vitoria by a coalition led by the Duke of Wellington. The inventor Johann Nepomuk Maelzel persuaded him to write a work commemorating the event for his mechanical instrument the Panharmonicon. This Beethoven also transcribed for orchestra as &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot; (Op. 91, also known as the &quot;Battle Symphony&quot;). It was first performed on 8 December, along with his Seventh Symphony, Op. 92, at a charity concert for victims of the war, a concert whose success led to its repeat on 12 December. The orchestra included several leading and rising musicians who happened to be in Vienna at the time, including Giacomo Meyerbeer and Domenico Dragonetti. The work received repeat performances at concerts staged by Beethoven in January and February 1814. These concerts brought Beethoven more profit than any others in his career, and enabled him to buy the bank shares that were the most valuable assets in his estate at his death.

Beethoven&#x27;s renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of &quot;Fidelio&quot;, which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its July opening in Vienna, and was frequently staged there during the following years. Beethoven&#x27;s publisher, Artaria, commissioned the 20-year-old Moscheles to prepare a piano score of the opera, which he inscribed &quot;Finished, with God&#x27;s help!&quot;—to which Beethoven added &quot;O Man, help thyself.&quot; That summer Beethoven composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years, his Sonata in E minor, Opus 90. He was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the Congress of Vienna that began in November 1814, with the cantata &quot;Der glorreiche Augenblick (The Glorious Moment)&quot; (Op. 136) and similar choral works which, in the words of Maynard Solomon, &quot;broadened Beethoven&#x27;s popularity, [but] did little to enhance his reputation as a serious composer&quot;.

In April and May 1814, playing in his &quot;Archduke&quot; Trio, Beethoven made his last public appearances as a soloist. The composer Louis Spohr noted: &quot;the piano was badly out of tune, which Beethoven minded little, since he did not hear it ... there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist ... I was deeply saddened.&quot; From 1814 onward Beethoven used for conversation ear-trumpets designed by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel (a number of these are on display at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn).

His 1815 compositions include an expressive second setting of the poem &quot;An die Hoffnung&quot; (Op. 94) in 1815. Compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for Josephine Brunsvik), it was &quot;far more dramatic ... The entire spirit is that of an operatic scena.&quot; But his energy seemed to be dropping: apart from these works, he wrote the two cello sonatas Op. 102 nos. 1 and 2, and a few minor pieces, and began but abandoned a sixth piano concerto.

====Pause====

Between 1815 and 1819, Beethoven&#x27;s output dropped again to a level unique in his mature life. He attributed part of this to a lengthy illness that he called an inflammatory fever that he had for more than a year starting in October 1816. Solomon suggests it is also doubtless a consequence of the ongoing legal problems concerning his nephew Karl, and of Beethoven finding himself increasingly at odds with current musical trends. Unsympathetic to developments in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by Spohr, Heinrich Marschner and Carl Maria von Weber), he also &quot;resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the ... cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces&quot; and turned towards study of Bach, Handel and Palestrina. An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven&#x27;s endorsement for his newly developed metronome. During these years the few major works he completed include the 1818 &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; Sonata (Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major, Op. 106) and his settings of poems by Alois Jeitteles, &quot;An die ferne Geliebte&quot; Op. 98 (1816), which introduced the song cycle into classical repertoire. In 1818 he began musical sketches that eventually formed part of his Ninth Symphony.

By early 1818 Beethoven&#x27;s health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January (although within a year Karl&#x27;s mother had won him back in the courts). By now Beethoven&#x27;s hearing had again seriously deteriorated, necessitating that he and his interlocutors write in notebooks to carry out conversations. These &#x27;conversation books&#x27; are a rich written resource for his life from this period onward. They contain discussions about music, business, and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music. His household management had also improved somewhat with the help of Nannette Streicher. A proprietor of the Stein piano workshop and a personal friend, Streicher had assisted in Beethoven&#x27;s care during his illness; she continued to provide some support, and in her he finally found a skilled cook. A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a Broadwood piano, for which Beethoven expressed thanks. He was not well enough, however, to carry out a visit to London that year which had been proposed by the Philharmonic Society.

====Resurgence====
Despite the time occupied by his ongoing legal struggles over Karl, which involved continuing extensive correspondence and lobbying, two events sparked off Beethoven&#x27;s major composition projects in 1819. The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf&#x27;s promotion to Cardinal-Archbishop as Archbishop of Olomouc (now in the Czech Republic), which triggered the &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was the invitation by the publisher Antonio Diabelli to 50 Viennese composers, including Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Czerny and the 8-year-old Franz Liszt, to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot; op. 120. Neither of these works was completed for a few years. A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf&#x27;s set of 40 piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200) and dedicated to the master. Beethoven&#x27;s portrait by of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the next century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, &quot;in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead ... the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, ... truer to nature than any other picture&quot;. Joseph Karl Stieler also created his own portrait of Beethoven.

Beethoven&#x27;s determination over the following years to write the &quot;Mass&quot; for Rudolf was not motivated by any devout Catholicism. Although he had been born a Catholic, the form of religion as practised at the court in Bonn where he grew up was, in the words of Solomon, &quot;a compromise ideology that permitted a relatively peaceful coexistence between the Church and rationalism&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Tagebuch&quot; (a diary he kept on an occasional basis between 1812 and 1818) shows his interest in a variety of religious philosophies, including those of India, Egypt and the Orient and the writings of the Rig-Veda. In a letter to Rudolf of July 1821, Beethoven shows his belief in a personal God: &quot;God ... sees into my innermost heart and knows that as a man I perform most conscientiously and on all occasions the duties which Humanity, God, and Nature enjoin upon me.&quot; On one of the sketches for the &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; he wrote &quot;Plea for inner and outer peace&quot;.

Beethoven&#x27;s status was confirmed by the series of &quot;Concerts sprituels&quot; given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio &quot;Christus&quot; and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed: when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer, Beethoven wrote in reply &quot;Geh! Bauer&quot; (Begone, peasant!)

In 1819, Beethoven was first approached by the publisher Moritz Schlesinger, who won the suspicious composer round, while visiting him at Mödling, by procuring for him a plate of roast veal. One consequence of this was that Schlesinger secured Beethoven&#x27;s three last piano sonatas and his final quartets; part of the attraction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany and France, and connections in England, which could overcome problems of copyright piracy. The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 ducats per sonata (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the Sonata in E major, Op. 109, dedicated to , Antonie Brentano&#x27;s daughter).

In early 1821, Beethoven was once again in poor health with rheumatism and jaundice. Despite this, he continued work on the remaining piano sonatas he had promised to Schlesinger (the Sonata in A flat major Op. 110 was published in December), and on the Mass. In early 1822 Beethoven sought a reconciliation with his brother Johann, whose marriage in 1812 had met with his disapproval, and Johann now became a regular visitor (as witnessed by the conversation books of the period) and began to assist him in his business affairs, including lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions. He also sought some reconciliation with the mother of his nephew, including supporting her income, although this did not meet with the approval of the contrary Karl. Two commissions at the end of 1822 improved Beethoven&#x27;s financial prospects. In November the Philharmonic Society of London offered a commission for a symphony, which he accepted with delight, as an appropriate home for the Ninth Symphony on which he was working. Also in November Prince Nikolai Galitzin of Saint Petersburg offered to pay Beethoven&#x27;s asking price for three string quartets. Beethoven set the price at the high level of 50 ducats per quartet in a letter dictated to his nephew Karl, who was then living with him.

During 1822, Anton Schindler, who in 1840 became one of Beethoven&#x27;s earliest and most influential (but not always reliable) biographers, began to work as the composer&#x27;s unpaid secretary. He later claimed that he had been a member of Beethoven&#x27;s circle since 1814, but there is no evidence for this. Cooper suggests that &quot;Beethoven greatly appreciated his assistance, but did not think much of him as a man&quot;.

===1823–1827: final years===

The year 1823 saw the completion of three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years: the &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;, the Ninth Symphony and the &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;.

Beethoven at last presented the manuscript of the completed &quot;Missa&quot; to Rudolph on 19 March (more than a year after the archduke&#x27;s enthronement as archbishop). But he was in no hurry to get it published or performed as he had formed a notion that he could profitably sell manuscripts of the work to various courts in Germany and Europe at 50 ducats each. One of the few who took up this offer was Louis XVIII of France, who also sent Beethoven a heavy gold medallion. The Symphony and the variations took up most of the rest of Beethoven&#x27;s working year. Diabelli hoped to publish both works, but the potential prize of the Mass excited many other publishers to lobby Beethoven for it, including Schlesinger and Carl Friedrich Peters. (In the end, it was obtained by Schotts).

Beethoven had become critical of the Viennese reception of his works. He told the visiting Johann Friedrich Rochlitz in 1822:You will hear nothing of me here ... &quot;Fidelio&quot;? They cannot give it, nor do they want to listen to it. The symphonies? They have no time for them. My concertos? Everyone grinds out only the stuff he himself has made. The solo pieces? They went out of fashion long ago, and here fashion is everything. At the most, Schuppanzigh occasionally digs up a quartet. He therefore enquired about premiering the &quot;Missa&quot; and the Ninth Symphony in Berlin. When his Viennese admirers learnt of this, they pleaded with him to arrange local performances. Beethoven was won over, and the symphony was first performed, along with sections of the &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;, on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the Kärntnertortheater. Beethoven stood by the conductor Michael Umlauf during the concert beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it. The &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; gushed, &quot;inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world&quot;, and Carl Czerny wrote that the Symphony &quot;breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit ... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads&quot;. The concert did not net Beethoven much money, as the expenses of mounting it were very high. A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that &quot;many people [had] already gone into the country&quot;. It was Beethoven&#x27;s last public concert. Beethoven accused Schindler of either cheating him or mismanaging the ticket receipts; this led to the replacement of Schindler as Beethoven&#x27;s secretary by Karl Holz, the second violinist in the Schuppanzigh Quartet, although by 1826 Beethoven and Schindler reconciled.

Beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for Galitzin, despite failing health. The first of these, the quartet in E♭ major, Op. 127 was premiered by the Schuppanzigh Quartet in March 1825. While writing the next, the quartet in A minor, Op. 132, in April 1825, he was struck by a sudden illness. Recuperating in Baden, he included in the quartet its slow movement to which he gave the title &quot;Holy song of thanks (Heiliger Dankgesang) to the Divinity, from a convalescent, in the Lydian mode&quot;. The next quartet to be completed was the Thirteenth, op. 130, in B♭ major. In six movements, the last, contrapuntal movement proved very difficult for both the performers and the audience at its premiere in March 1826 (again by the Schuppanzigh Quartet). Beethoven was persuaded by the publisher Artaria, for an additional fee, to write a new finale, and to issue the last movement as a separate work (the Grosse Fugue, Op. 133). Beethoven&#x27;s favourite was the last of this series, the quartet in C minor Op. 131, which he rated as his most perfect single work.

Beethoven&#x27;s relations with his nephew Karl had continued to be stormy; Beethoven&#x27;s letters to him were demanding and reproachful. In August, Karl, who had been seeing his mother again against Beethoven&#x27;s wishes, attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived and after discharge from hospital went to recuperate in the village of Gneixendorf with Beethoven and his uncle Johann. In Gneixendorf, Beethoven completed a further quartet (Op. 135 in F major), which he sent to Schlesinger. Under the introductory slow chords in the last movement, Beethoven wrote in the manuscript &quot;Muss es sein?&quot; (Must it be?); the response, over the faster main theme of the movement, is &quot;Es muss sein!&quot; (It must be!). The whole movement is headed &quot;Der schwer gefasste Entschluss&quot; (The difficult decision). Following this in November Beethoven completed his final composition, the replacement finale for the op. 130 quartet. Beethoven at this time was already ill and depressed; he began to quarrel with Johann, insisting that Johann make Karl his heir, in preference to Johann&#x27;s wife.

=== Death ===


On his return journey to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by , who throughout December noticed symptoms including fever, jaundice and dropsy, with swollen limbs, coughing and breathing difficulties. Several operations were carried out to tap off the excess fluid from Beethoven&#x27;s abdomen.

Karl stayed by Beethoven&#x27;s bedside during December, but left after the beginning of January to join the army at Iglau and did not see his uncle again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards: &quot;My dear father ... I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.&quot; Immediately following Karl&#x27;s departure, Beethoven wrote a will making his nephew his sole heir. Later in January, Beethoven was attended by Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his patient&#x27;s condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As the news spread of the severity of Beethoven&#x27;s condition, many old friends came to visit, including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel and his pupil Ferdinand Hiller. Many tributes and gifts were also sent, including £100 from the Philharmonic Society in London and a case of expensive wine from Schotts. During this period, Beethoven was almost completely bedridden despite occasional efforts to rouse himself. On 24 March, he said to Schindler and the others present &quot;Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est&quot; (&quot;Applaud, friends, the comedy is over&quot;). Later that day, when the wine from Schotts arrived, he whispered, &quot;Pity – too late.&quot;

Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56; only his friend Anselm Hüttenbrenner and a &quot;Frau van Beethoven&quot; (possibly his old enemy Johanna van Beethoven) were present. According to Hüttenbrenner, at about 5 pm there was a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder: &quot;Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up for several seconds with his fist clenched ... not another breath, not a heartbeat more.&quot; Many visitors came to the deathbed; some locks of the dead man&#x27;s hair were retained by Hüttenbrenner and Hiller, among others. An autopsy revealed Beethoven had significant liver damage, which may have been due to his heavy alcohol consumption, and also considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.

Beethoven&#x27;s funeral procession in Vienna on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 10,000 people. Franz Schubert and the violinist Joseph Mayseder were among the torchbearers. A funeral oration by the poet Franz Grillparzer (who would also write Schubert&#x27;s epitaph) was read by the actor Heinrich Anschütz. Beethoven was buried in the Währing cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche) in Alserstrasse. Beethoven&#x27;s remains were exhumed for study in 1863, and moved in 1888 to Vienna&#x27;s Zentralfriedhof where they were reinterred in a grave adjacent to that of Schubert.

=== The three periods ===

The historian William Drabkin notes that as early as 1818 a writer had proposed a three-period division of Beethoven&#x27;s works and that such a division (albeit often adopting different dates or works to denote changes in period) eventually became a convention adopted by all of Beethoven&#x27;s biographers, starting with Schindler, F.-J. Fétis and Wilhelm von Lenz. Later writers sought to identify sub-periods within this generally accepted structure. Its drawbacks include that it generally omits a fourth period, that is, the early years in Bonn, whose works are less often considered; and that it ignores the differential development of Beethoven&#x27;s composing styles over the years for different categories of work. The piano sonatas, for example, were written throughout Beethoven&#x27;s life in a progression that can be interpreted as continuous development; the symphonies do not all demonstrate linear progress; of all of the types of composition, perhaps the quartets, which seem to group themselves in three periods (Op. 18 in 1801–1802, Opp. 59, 74 and 95 in 1806–1814, and the quartets, today known as &#x27;late&#x27;, from 1824 onwards) fit this categorisation most neatly. Drabkin concludes that &quot;now that we have lived with them so long ... as long as there are programme notes, essays written to accompany recordings, and all-Beethoven recitals, it is hard to imagine us ever giving up the notion of discrete stylistic periods.&quot;

===Bonn 1782–1792===
Some forty compositions, including ten very early works written by Beethoven up to 1785, survive from the years that Beethoven lived in Bonn. It has been suggested that Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works. A 1784 review in Johann Nikolaus Forkel&#x27;s influential &quot;Musikalischer Almanack&quot; compared Beethoven&#x27;s efforts to those of rank beginners. The three early piano quartets of 1785 (WoO 36), closely modelled on violin sonatas of Mozart, show his dependency on the music of the period. Beethoven himself was not to give any of the Bonn works an opus number, save for those which he reworked for use later in his career, for example, some of the songs in his Op. 52 collection (1805) and the Wind Octet reworked in Vienna in 1793 to become his String Quintet, Op. 4. Charles Rosen points out that Bonn was something of a backwater compared to Vienna; Beethoven was unlikely to be acquainted with the mature works of Haydn or Mozart, and Rosen opines that his early style was closer to that of Hummel or Muzio Clementi. Kernan suggests that at this stage Beethoven was not especially notable for his works in sonata style, but more for his vocal music; his move to Vienna in 1792 set him on the path to develop the music in the genres he became known for.

===First period===
The conventional first period began after Beethoven&#x27;s arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years, he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the &#x27;Viennese style&#x27; (best known today from Haydn and Mozart) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.

He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies, the set of six string quartets Opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first twenty piano sonatas, including the famous &quot;Pathétique&quot; sonata, Op. 13.

===Middle period===
His middle period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3–8), the last two piano concertos, the Triple Concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (Nos. 7–11), several piano sonatas (including the &quot;Waldstein&quot; and &quot;Appassionata&quot; sonatas), the &quot;Kreutzer&quot; violin sonata and his only opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot;.

This period is sometimes associated with a &quot;heroic&quot; manner of composing, but the use of the term &quot;heroic&quot; has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period. The appropriateness of the term heroic to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the Third and Fifth Symphonies, are easy to describe as heroic, many others, like his Symphony No. 6, &quot;Pastoral&quot; or his Piano Sonata No. 24, are not.

===Late period===

Beethoven&#x27;s late period began in the decade 1810–1819. He began a renewed study of older music, including works by Palestrina, Johann Sebastian Bach, and George Frideric Handel, whom Beethoven considered &quot;the greatest composer who ever lived&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s late works incorporated polyphony, church modes, and Baroque-era devices. For example, the overture &quot;The Consecration of the House&quot; (1822) included a fugue influenced by Handel&#x27;s music. A new style emerged, as he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade; the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the &quot;Diabelli Variations&quot;, the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (including the massive &quot;Große Fuge&quot;), and two works for very large forces: the Missa solemnis and the Ninth Symphony. Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The String Quartet, Op. 131 has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.

===Beethoven&#x27;s pianos===
Beethoven&#x27;s earlier preferred pianos included those of Johann Andreas Stein; he may have been given a Stein piano by Count Waldstein. From 1786 onwards there is evidence of Beethoven&#x27;s cooperation with Johann Andreas Streicher, who had married Stein&#x27;s daughter Nannette. Streicher left Stein&#x27;s business to set up his own firm in 1803, and Beethoven continued to admire his products, writing to him in 1817 of his &quot;special preference&quot; for his pianos. Among the other pianos Beethoven possessed was an Érard piano given to him by the manufacturer in 1803. The Érard piano, with its exceptional resonance, may have influenced Beethoven&#x27;s piano style – shortly after receiving it he began writing his Waldstein Sonata – but despite initial enthusiasm he seems to have abandoned it before 1810 when he wrote that it was &quot;simply not of any use any more&quot;; in 1824 he gave it to his brother Johann. In 1818 Beethoven received, also as a gift, a grand piano by John Broadwood &amp; Sons. Although Beethoven was proud to receive it, he seems to have been dissatisfied by its tone (a dissatisfaction which was perhaps also a consequence of his increasing deafness), and sought to get it remodelled to make it louder. In 1825 Beethoven commissioned a piano from Conrad Graf, which was equipped with quadruple strings and a special resonator to make it audible to him, but it failed in this task.

== Legacy ==
===Museums===
There is a museum—the Beethoven House, in the place of his birth in Bonn. Bonn has also hosted a musical festival, the Beethovenfest, since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but since 2007 has been organised annually.

The Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies, in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library, on the campus of San Jose State University, California, serves as a museum, research centre, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to Beethoven&#x27;s life and works.

===Sculptures===

The Beethoven Monument in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of Beethoven&#x27;s birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the swift construction of the original Beethovenhalle in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of Franz Liszt). Vienna honoured Beethoven with a statue in 1880.

===Space===
The third-largest crater on Mercury is named in his honour, as is the main-belt asteroid 1815 Beethoven.

Beethoven&#x27;s music features twice on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes.

===Education===
The Beethoven Conservatory in St. Louis, Missouri was named for the composer.

<text>Lleyton Glynn Hewitt (born 24 February 1981) is an Australian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 80 weeks, including as the year-end No. 1 in 2001 and 2002. Hewitt won 30 singles titles and 3 doubles titles on the ATP Tour, including two singles majors at the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon Championships, a doubles major at the 2000 US Open, the 2001 and 2002 Tennis Masters Cups in singles, and led Australia to Davis Cup crowns in 1999 and 2003. In November 2001, Hewitt became (at the time) the youngest man to reach No. 1 in the ATP singles rankings, at the age of . He was also the runner-up at the 2004 US Open and 2005 Australian Open. He remains the most recent Australian man to win a singles major.
== Early life ==
Hewitt was born in Adelaide, South Australia. His father, Glynn, is a former Australian rules football player, and his mother, Cherilyn, was a physical education teacher. He has a younger sister, Jaslyn, a former tennis coach and bodybuilder, and his brother-in-law (Jaslyn&#x27;s husband) is Rob Shehadie. Hewitt also played Australian Football until the age of 13, when he decided to pursue a tennis career. His junior tennis club was Seaside Tennis Club in Henley Beach. He was also coached by Peter Smith at Denman Tennis Club in Mitcham.

== Tennis career ==
Hewitt commenced his professional career in 1998. He became one of the youngest winners of an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tournament when he won the 1998 Next Generation Adelaide International, defeating Jason Stoltenberg in the final, having defeated Andre Agassi in the semi-finals. Both Aaron Krickstein winning Tel Aviv in 1983 and Michael Chang winning San Francisco in 1988 were younger than Hewitt when they claimed their first ATP title. Hewitt then left Immanuel College to concentrate on his tennis career. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.
He finished his professional tennis career on 24 January 2016 after 20 straight Australian Open appearances. His last professional singles match was against David Ferrer in the second round of the 2016 Australian Open at the Rod Laver Arena on 21 January 2016. In 2022, Lleyton Hewitt was inducted into the ‘International Tennis Hall of Fame.’

===Junior years, first major appearance===
As a junior Hewitt posted a 44–19 record in singles and reached as high as No. 17 in the world in 1997 (and No. 13 in doubles).

====Junior singles titles====


=== 2000: US Open doubles title, Davis Cup finals ===
In 2000, Hewitt reached his first Grand Slam final at the Wimbledon mixed doubles partnering Belgian Kim Clijsters, his then girlfriend. They lost the match, to Americans Kimberly Po and Donald Johnson. Hewitt later won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open when he along with Max Mirnyi claimed the men&#x27;s doubles championship, thus becoming the youngest male (at 19 years, 6 months) to win a Grand Slam doubles crown in the open era. At the end of the year, Hewitt became the first teenager in ATP history to qualify for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup (ATP World Tour Finals).

===2001: US Open title, Masters Cup trophy, No. 1===
Hewitt started off the 2001 season well by winning the title in Sydney. He went on to win back-to-back tournaments in Queen&#x27;s and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. He captured his first Grand Slam singles title at the US Open, comprehensively defeating former world No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semi-finals, and four-time champion Pete Sampras the next day in straight sets (7-6, 6-1, 6-1). This win made Hewitt the most recent male player to win a Grand Slam singles and doubles title during his career. The Australian went on to win the Tokyo Open, and he again qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, held in Sydney. During the tournament, Hewitt won all matches in his group; with his round-robin victory against Pat Rafter, Hewitt secured the year-end world No. 1 ranking for the first time. Hewitt went on to defeat Sébastien Grosjean in the final to take the title and cement his position as the world number one.

===2002: Wimbledon victory and No. 1===
2002 started with disappointment for Hewitt, as he lost in the first round of the Australian Open, his home Grand Slam. This was the first time the number 1 seed had lost in the opening round of the Australia Open, although Hewitt was still recovering from chickenpox. The next few months proved more successful for Hewitt and he cemented his position as the best player in the world by winning three titles: San Jose, Indian Wells and Queen&#x27;s. His victory against Andre Agassi in the final of San Jose was heralded as one of the greatest matches of the season. He followed his 2001 US Open win by capturing the Wimbledon singles title. He defeated Jonas Björkman, Grégory Carraz, Julian Knowle, Mikhail Youzhny, Sjeng Schalken and dispatched home favourite Tim Henman - a rematch of their recent Queen&#x27;s final - before dominating first-time finalist David Nalbandian in straight sets in the championship match; Hewitt lost only two sets (both to Schalken) throughout the championship. His victory reinforced the idea that, although the tournament had tended to be dominated by serve-and-volleyers, a baseliner could still triumph on grass (Hewitt was the first &#x27;baseliner&#x27; to win the tournament since Agassi in 1992). Hewitt was the last man outside the so-called &quot;Big Four&quot; to win Wimbledon until Carlos Alcaraz in 2023.

For his third straight year, he qualified for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, held in Shanghai, and successfully defended his title by defeating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final. Hewitt&#x27;s win helped him finish the year ranked No. 1 for a second straight year, becoming the seventh man to achieve this feat.

===2003: Second Masters and Davis Cup titles===
In 2003, Hewitt defeated former No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten for the championship at Indian Wells. But at Wimbledon, as the defending champion, Hewitt lost in the first round to qualifier Ivo Karlović. Hewitt became the first defending Wimbledon men&#x27;s champion in the open era to lose in the first round. Only once before in the tournament&#x27;s 126-year history had a defending men&#x27;s champion lost in the opening round: in 1967, when Manuel Santana was beaten by Charlie Pasarell. Hewitt was only the third defending Grand Slam champion in the open era to lose in the first round, after Boris Becker at the 1997 Australian Open and Patrick Rafter at the 1999 US Open.

In June it was announced that Hewitt would be taking a wildcard into the Wimbledon doubles competition, playing alongside young compatriot Jordan Thompson. In the first round, the pair saved eight match points to defeat Nicolás Almagro and David Marrero 19–17 in the deciding set. However, they lost to the eighth seeds in the second round.

=== 2018: Comeback in doubles ===
In December 2017, it was announced that Hewitt would come out of retirement and accept a doubles wildcard with compatriot Sam Groth at the 2018 Australian Open.

Hewitt and Jordan Thompson accepted a wildcard to play Doubles at the 2018 Brisbane International. They lost in the first round to Grigor Dimitrov and Ryan Harrison.

Hewitt then played in the fast4 exhibition in Sydney where he lost to Grigor Dimitrov. Hewitt and Kyrgios won the doubles beating Alexander Zverev and Grigor Dimitrov. After that, he played the Tie Break Tens in Melbourne where he won his opening match against Novak Djokovic, before losing to world No. 1 Rafael Nadal.

In the Australian Open doubles, Hewitt and Groth made a run to the quarterfinals, including a win over third seeds Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecău. This was his best doubles result at the Australian Open in his career.

Hewitt&#x27;s doubles comeback continued with Lleyton playing doubles at the 2018 Estoril Open with Alex de Minaur where they defeated second seeds Michael Venus and Raven Klaasen before losing in the quarterfinals. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2018 Fuzion 100 Surbiton Trophy – Men&#x27;s doubles with Alex Bolt before Venus and Klaasen gained revenge on Hewitt (this time with Alex Bolt) at the 2018 Rosmalen Grass Court Championships – Men&#x27;s doubles.

Hewitt then teamed up with Nick Kyrgios at the 2018 Queen&#x27;s Club Championships – Doubles tournament where they defeated number 3 seeds Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert before losing in the quarterfinals. At the 2018 Wimbledon Championships – Men&#x27;s doubles, Hewitt was again wildcard with Alex Bolt however the pair again lost in the first round to Venus and Klaasen. After this loss, Hewitt teamed up with Jordan Thompson and lost in the first round of the 2018 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport.

Hewitt&#x27;s last professional match of 2018 was in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group play-offs against Austria where Hewitt paired up with experienced doubles specialist John Peers to defeat the Austrian team of doubles specialist Oliver Marach and experienced clay-courier Juergen Melzer.

=== 2019: Continuing to play doubles ===
In 2019, Hewitt played doubles at a number of tournaments. In a pairing with Jordan Thompson, they lost in the first round of the Sydney International. A week later he teamed up with John-Patrick Smith at the Australian Open, yet again losing in the first round. 
Hewitt and countryman Jordan Thompson received a wildcard to play at the Wimbledon Championships. They reached the second round before losing to R. Klaasen and M. Venus in straight sets.

Also that year, he played doubles in New York, Houston, Surbiton, and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, playing with the likes of Alexei Popyrin and Thompson yet again.

=== 2020: Back in hometown of Adelaide ===
Hewitt once again featured in the Australian summer of tennis, this time choosing to participate in the new Adelaide International, the first time he had played tour-tennis in his home town for over a decade. He partnered Jordan Thompson but lost in the first round to Cristian Garín and Juan Ignacio Londero. The two chose to compete at the Australian Open a week later, but lost in the first round in straight sets, to Korean duo Min-Kyu Song and Nam Ji-sung.

Hewitt continues to commentate matches at the Australian Open.

==National representation==

===Davis Cup===
Hewitt made his Davis Cup debut for Australia in the 1999 Davis Cup quarterfinals at age 18 against the United States in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In the first rubber of the tie Hewitt faced No. 8 and Wimbledon quarter finalist Todd Martin. Hewitt caused a major upset over Martin and would go on to win his second singles rubber against Alex O&#x27;Brien as well. The great start to his Davis Cup career would continue in the 1999 semi-finals against Russia where he would record another two wins against Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov. He would taste his first defeat in Davis Cup in the 1999 final against France but would become a Davis Cup champion anyway. In 2000 Hewitt and Australia would again make the Davis Cup final but fell to Spain in Barcelona.

In 2001 Hewitt would again be a part of the Australian team that would make the Davis Cup final but the Australians would lose the fifth rubber and hand France a 3–2 win. Determined to make amends for his last few finals, Hewitt led the Australian team to the 2003 Davis Cup final against Spain where he defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero in five sets. The team came away victorious 3–1 overall and Hewitt claimed his second Davis Cup title. By the age of 22, he had recorded more wins in Davis Cup singles than any other Australian player. Following the retirement of Pat Rafter and the semi-retirement of Mark Philippoussis, Hewitt would be forced to lead the Australian Davis Cup team with little success from his peers. In the 2006 quarterfinals in Melbourne, Hewitt defeated Belarusian Vladimir Voltchkov in just 91 minutes. Voltchkov said before the match that &quot;Hewitt has no weapons to hurt me.&quot; Hewitt responded, &quot;Voltchkov doesn&#x27;t have a ranking [of 457] to hurt me.&quot; In the semi-finals in Buenos Aires on clay, Hewitt lost to Argentine José Acasuso in five sets.

Despite a world group semi-final appearance in 2006, Hewitt and Australia would be relegated to the Asia/Oceania region in 2008. Hewitt continued showed his commitment to the team by competing in the regional ties but the team fell in the playoff stages every year between 2008 and 2011. In the 2011 playoffs, he played against Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka on a grass court in Sydney, losing both matches. In doubles, together with Chris Guccione, he was able to defeat Federer and Wawrinka, but this was not enough to take Australia to the World Group.

In 2012, Hewitt won his single and doubles match against China in February, which allowed Australia to return to the playoffs where they lost to Germany. After defeating Chinese Taipei and Uzbekistan, Australia earned the right to get to the playoffs again in 2013. They ended up routing Poland 4–1 on their soil including a convincing 6–1 6–3 6–2 win for Hewitt over recent Wimbledon quarterfinalist Łukasz Kubot. In 2014, Australia crashed out 5–0 in the World Group first round on the French clay of La Roche-sur-Yon. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Hewitt both in singles and doubles. Perth&#x27;s grass courts would then be hosting yet another playoff tie for Australia in September 2014. Hewitt won both his singles match (against Farrukh Dustov) and the subsequent doubles rubber (partnering Chris Guccione v. Dustov and Istomin) in straight sets while up and coming Nick Kyrgios won his encounter with Denis Istomin to give Australia an unassailable 3–0 lead over Uzbekistan, thus enabling their country to return to the World Group in 2015. Sam Groth and Nick Kyrgios wrapped up a 5–0 victory a day later. Australia will open their 2015 campaign in Czech Republic for a 6–8 March tie that is one of two worst-case scenarios for Australia.

Hewitt played the Davis Cup match against Great Britain in the semi-finals of the 2015 Davis Cup. He played doubles with Sam Groth losing in five sets to brothers Andy and Jamie Murray.

He came out of retirement to play the first round match against the United States at the 2016 Davis Cup as a player-captain, where he and partner John Peers lost to the Bryan brothers in a five-setter.

He competed in the 2018 Davis Cup World Group play-offs, again as a player-captain in doubles with Peers. They won the rubber against the Austrian duo Oliver Marach and Jürgen Melzer in four sets.

Hewitt is the sole holder of several Australian Davis Cup records, which include most wins, most singles wins, most ties played and most years played. His Davis Cup career has included wins over players who were top ten at the time, which include Todd Martin, Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Roger Federer, Gustavo Kuerten, Sébastien Grosjean and Juan Carlos Ferrero.

===World Team Cup===

Hewitt made his World Team Cup debut for Australia in 2000 at the age of 19. He recorded two singles victories over Albert Costa and Marcelo Ríos but fell to Yevgeny Kafelnikov in his last group stage match. Hewitt returned to the World Team Cup in 2001 and led Australia to the title by recording singles wins over Àlex Corretja, Magnus Norman, Tommy Haas in the group stages. In the final Hewitt defeated No. 2 Marat Safin.

Hewitt made his third appearance at the tournament in 2003 where he entered as the No. 1 singles player and went undefeated in his singles matches by recording wins over Jiří Novák, James Blake and Carlos Moyá but it was not enough to send Australia through to the final.

Fresh from their 2003 Davis Cup victory, Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis entered the 2004 World Team Cup with high hopes. In the group stages Hewitt recorded victories over Robby Ginepri and Martin Verkerk but fell to Gastón Gaudio in his last group singles match. Despite the loss, Australia still advanced to the final where Hewitt would lose to Fernando González and Australia would lose the final 2–1.

After a six-year hiatus Hewitt returned to compete in the 2010 World Team Cup and won his first match against John Isner but fell to Nicolás Almagro in his last match.

===Olympics===

A 19-year-old Hewitt entered his first Olympics in 2000 and was given the fourth seeding in the draw. Hewitt was considered a strong favourite for a medal given his victory at the Sydney International earlier in the year but despite competing in his home nation Hewitt went out in the first round to Max Mirnyi 6–3 6–3. Hewitt elected not to compete in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, deciding instead to focus on the 2004 US Open which would result in a runner-up showing. He would return for his second Olympic Games in Beijing for both the singles and doubles competitions. A first round 7–5 7–6 victory over Jonas Björkman would set up a second round clash with the number 2 seed Rafael Nadal. Nadal eliminated Hewitt in the second round 6–1 6–2 and would go on to win the singles gold medal. Pairing up with Chris Guccione in the doubles, the team would record victories over Agustín Calleri/Juan Mónaco and Rafael Nadal/Tommy Robredo before falling to the Bryan brothers in the quarterfinals.

Hewitt competed in his third Olympics in London 2012 where he entered the men&#x27;s singles event and defeated Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky in the first round. He was the only Australian in any tennis event to progress past the first round. In the second round Hewitt took out 13th seeded Croatian Marin Čilić. In the third round Hewitt stunned the tennis world when he won the first set against the number 2 ranked Novak Djokovic, he would end up falling in three sets. He also sent an application to the International Olympic Committee to enter the men&#x27;s doubles competition with Chris Guccione but the application was rejected. Following his men&#x27;s doubles rejection, Hewitt decided to apply for a spot in the mixed doubles competition with Sam Stosur. The pair were granted entry and defeated Polish pair Marcin Matkowski and Agnieszka Radwańska in the first round. In the quarterfinals, Hewitt/Stosur faced British pair Andy Murray and Laura Robson, they would lose the encounter.

==Rivalries==
===Hewitt vs Federer===
Hewitt and Roger Federer played each other on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semi-final, which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt&#x27;s longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer won the first and third sets 6–0 and the second set on a tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets, for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.

Hewitt and Federer teamed up in the men&#x27;s doubles at Wimbledon in 1999. They got to the third round before losing to Jonas Björkman and Pat Rafter.

===Hewitt vs Roddick===
Hewitt&#x27;s second longest rivalry was against American Andy Roddick, in which the two played on 14 occasions. Early on, Hewitt dominated the rivalry, with six wins from their first seven meetings. One of those wins included a five-set victory at the 2001 US Open, the tournament in which Hewitt captured his first Singles Grand Slam title. In later years, Roddick began to dominate Hewitt, with the rivalry finishing at 7 wins each.

===Hewitt vs Argentinian players===
A rivalry and feud between Hewitt and Argentinian tennis players began at the 2002 Wimbledon final where Hewitt defeated Argentina&#x27;s David Nalbandian in straight sets. The rivalry would hit boiling point in 2005 over a series of matches spread between the 2005 Australian Open and the 2005 Davis Cup Quarterfinals between Australia and Argentina. In the third round of 2005 Australian Open Hewitt faced Argentinian Juan Ignacio Chela in which Hewitt fired up Chela with his over-zealous celebrations for Chela&#x27;s unforced errors, causing the Argentinian to spit at Hewitt during a change of ends. Hewitt would then face David Nalbandian in the quarterfinals on Australia Day with Hewitt coming out victorious 10–8 in the fifth set. Later in 2005 Hewitt would face Guillermo Coria in the Davis Cup quarterfinals, where their rivalry would flare up. It did, however, die down the following year in the 2006 Davis Cup semi-finals, where Argentina came out victorious 5–0 over Hewitt and the Australians.

==Playing style==

Hewitt is a defensive counterpuncher. He typically likes to stay back towards the baseline during a rally and will usually approach the net only to catch a short reply or drop shot from his opponent. Hewitt&#x27;s lack of penetration in his groundstrokes, most notably in his forehand, a typically dominant shot for most male players, forces him to rely on placement rather than simply &quot;dominating&quot; the point. At the 2004 Cincinnati Masters Final, commentator MaliVai Washington said that Hewitt was even more difficult to &quot;ace&quot; than Agassi because he gets more returns in play. Hewitt&#x27;s tactics typically involve putting difficult service returns in play, consistently chasing down attempted winning shots from his opponent, and keeping the ball deep until he feels he can hit a winner.

Although he is known primarily as a baseliner, Hewitt is a skilled volleyer and is known for having one of the best overhead smashes in the game. His signature shot, however, is the offensive topspin lob, a shot that he executes efficiently off both wings when his opponent approaches the net. US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe, Jim Courier and Tim Henman have all described Hewitt&#x27;s lob as being the best in the world (although Henman has since declared Andy Murray to have succeeded him). In Andre Agassi&#x27;s book &quot;Open&quot;, Hewitt is described as one of the best shot selectors in the history of Men&#x27;s Tennis.

==Equipment==
In July 2000, Hewitt signed a multiyear endorsement deal with Nike. He is currently sponsored by American athletic apparel company Athletic DNA and the Japanese sports manufacturer Yonex, with whom he signed a &quot;Head to Toe&quot; deal in late 2005. Hewitt has used Yonex racquets as early as 2000, having used the Yonex Super RD Tour 95. Yonex provides Hewitt&#x27;s racquets, shoes and accessories. Hewitt&#x27;s Yonex shoes (SHT-306) are inscribed with his nickname &quot;Rusty&quot; along with an image of an Australian flag. As of 7 August 2007, his first appearance with a new racquet at the Montreal Masters, Hewitt used to use the Yonex RQiS 1 Tour. He used to use the Yonex RDS tour 90 Model, but switched to the Yonex RDiS 100 mid in 2009. In 2011, he switched to Yonex VCORE 95 D, using a grip size of 4 3/8 (L3). Since mid-2011, he began alternating between Yonex, Nike, Adidas, Asics and Fila shoes.

==Personal life==
Hewitt is a keen supporter of Australian rules football, having played the game earlier in his career, and is currently the joint No. 1 ticket holder for the Adelaide Crows, alongside MP Kate Ellis. He had once had a close friendship with Crows star Andrew McLeod, but this broke down amid much public controversy in 2005. Hewitt had produced a DVD titled &quot;Lleyton Hewitt: The Other Side&quot; which precipitated the falling out between him and McLeod over filming of certain Aboriginal sites.

Hewitt and Belgian tennis player Kim Clijsters started a relationship in January 2000, during the Australian Open. The two announced their engagement just before Christmas 2003, but separated in October 2004, cancelling a planned February 2005 wedding.

On 30 January 2005, shortly after losing the 2005 Australian Open final to Marat Safin, Hewitt proposed to Australian actress Bec Cartwright after they had been dating for six weeks. They married on 21 July 2005 at the Sydney Opera House and they have three children together.

In late 2008, to extend his tennis career and reduce the amount of tax he would otherwise have had to pay, Hewitt relocated his family for the European and North American season to their home in the Old Fort Bay estate, in Nassau, Bahamas.

Hewitt has a nickname, &quot;Rusty&quot;, which was given to him by Darren Cahill who at the time thought Hewitt resembled the character Rusty, from the National Lampoon film series. Hewitt has also been given the nickname &#x27;Rocky&#x27; by fans, which originated from his shouts of &quot;C&#x27;mon Balboa&quot;, in reference to the character Rocky Balboa from the Sylvester Stallone film &quot;Rocky&quot;. Hewitt has also been compared to the character.

In April 2021, his twelve-year-old son, Cruz Hewitt, won the Australian junior tennis clay-court title in Canberra. In January 2024, Hewitt Jr. made his Major debut in the junior tournament of the 2024 Australian Open.

In December 2021, Hewitt sold their family home in Toorak (Victoria), and purchased a new house in Burleigh Heads (Queensland) where he and his family now live.

==Controversies==

Hewitt has been involved in several public controversies. He was involved in a racism dispute while playing James Blake at the 2001 US Open. After a black linesman called a foot-fault on two critical points in the third set, Hewitt implied that the similarity in skin colour between Blake and the official influenced the decision to penalise him.

At the 2001 French Open Hewitt twice called the chair umpire and net judge &quot;spastics&quot; and was subsequently forced to apologise following a public backlash.

Hewitt&#x27;s frequent &quot;c&#x27;mons&quot; when he won a point or his opponents made an error have been remarked upon as poor sportsmanship by opponents and media commentators. This behaviour particularly riled his 2005 Australian Open second-round opponent James Blake.

<text>Lars von Trier (né Trier; born 30 April 1956) is a Danish film director and screenwriter.

Beginning in the late-1960s as a child actor working on Danish television series &quot;Secret Summer&quot;, von Trier&#x27;s career has spanned more than five decades. Considered a major figure of the European film industry, he and his works have been variously described as ambitious and provocative, as well as technically innovative. His films offer confrontational examinations of existential, social, psychosexual, and political issues, and deal in subjects including mercy, sacrifice, and mental health. He frequently collaborates with the actors Jens Albinus, Jean-Marc Barr, Udo Kier and Stellan Skarsgård.

Von Trier co-created the avant-garde filmmaking movement Dogme 95 alongside fellow director Thomas Vinterberg and co-founded the Danish film production company Zentropa, the films from which have sold more than 350million tickets and garnered eight Academy Award nominations.

Von Trier has been the subject of criticisms and controversies. Cannes Film Festival, in addition to awarding his films on numerous occasions, once listed him as for making a Nazism joke during an interview. Animal harm on &quot;Manderlay&quot;″s set, and graphic violence and unsimulated sex in some of his films have drawn criticism, and he has also been accused of mistreatment and negligence towards actresses during the filming process, including Björk.

== Early life and education ==
Born Lars Trier in Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, north of Copenhagen, his parents are Inger Høst and Ulf Trier. He later learned from Inger&#x27;s deathbed that his biological father was , Inger&#x27;s former boss at Denmark&#x27;s Ministry of Social Affairs and a World War II resistance fighter.

He studied film theory at the University of Copenhagen and film direction at the National Film School of Denmark. At 25, he won two Best School Film awards at the Munich International Festival of Film Schools for &quot;Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Last Detail&quot;. The same year, he added the nobiliary particle &quot;von&quot; to his name, possibly as a satirical homage to the equally self-invented titles of directors Erich von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, and saw his graduation film &quot;Images of Liberation&quot; released as a theatrical feature.

== Career ==
=== 1984–1994: Career beginnings and &quot;Europa&quot; trilogy ===
In 1984, &quot;The Element of Crime&quot;, von Trier&#x27;s breakthrough film, received twelve awards at seven international festivals including the Technical Grand Prize at Cannes, and a nomination for the Palme d&#x27;Or. The film&#x27;s slow, non-linear pace, innovative and multi-leveled plot design, and dark dreamlike visual effects combine to create an allegory for traumatic European historical events.

Von Trier&#x27;s next film, &quot;Epidemic&quot; (1987), was also shown at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard section, and featured two story lines that ultimately collide: the chronicle of two filmmakers (played by vonTrier and screenwriter Niels Vørse) in the midst of developing a new project, and a dark science fiction tale of a futuristic plaguethe very film von Trier and Vørsel are depicted making. He next directed &quot;Medea&quot; (1988) for television, based on a screenplay by Carl Th. Dreyer and starring Udo Kier, which won the Jean d&#x27;Arcy prize in France.

Von Trier has referred to his films as falling into thematic and stylistic trilogies. This pattern began with &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; (1984), the first of the &quot;Europa&quot; trilogy, which illuminated traumatic periods in Europe both in the past and the future. It also includes &quot;Epidemic&quot;. He completed the trilogy in 1991 with &quot;Europa&quot; (released as &quot;Zentropa&quot; in the US), which won the Prix duJury at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival, and picked up awards at other major festivals. In 1990 he also directed the music video for the song &quot;Bakerman&quot; by Laid Back. This video was re-used in 2006 by the English DJ and artist Shaun Baker in his remake of the song.

Seeking financial independence and creative control over their projects, in 1992 vonTrier and producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen founded the film production company Zentropa Entertainment, which has sold more than 350 million tickets and was nominated for multiple Academy Awards as of 2016. Named after a fictional railway company in &quot;Europa&quot;, their most recent film at the time, Zentropa has produced many movies other than Trier&#x27;s own, as well as several television series. It has also produced hardcore sex films: &quot;Constance&quot; (1998), &quot;Pink Prison&quot; (1999), &quot;HotMen CoolBoyz&quot; (2000), and &quot;All About Anna&quot; (2005). To make money for his newly founded company, vonTrier made &quot;The Kingdom&quot; (Danish title &quot;Riget&quot;, 1994) and &quot;The KingdomII&quot; (&quot;RigetII&quot;, 1997), a pair of miniseries recorded in the Danish national hospital, the name &quot;Riget&quot; being a colloquial name for the hospital known as Rigshospitalet (lit. The Kingdom&#x27;s Hospital) in Danish. A projected third season of the series was derailed by the death in 1998 of Ernst-Hugo Järegård, who played Dr. Helmer, and that of Kirsten Rolffes, who played Mrs. Drusse, in 2000, two of the major characters, which led to the series&#x27; cancellation.

=== 1995–2000: Dogme 95 manifesto, and &quot;Golden Heart&quot; trilogy ===

In 1995, von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg presented their manifesto for a new cinematic movement, which they called Dogme 95. The Dogme95 concept, which led to international interest in Danish film, inspired filmmakers all over the world. It required filmmakers to shirk several common techniques in modern filmmaking, such as studio lighting, sets, costumes, and non-diegetic music. In 2008, together with their fellow Dogme directors Kristian Levring and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, vonTrier and Thomas Vinterberg received the European film award for European Achievement in World Cinema.

In 1996 von Trier conducted an unusual theatrical experiment in Copenhagen involving 53 actors, which he titled &quot;Psychomobile1: The World Clock&quot;. A documentary chronicling the project was directed by Jesper Jargil, and was released in 2000 with the title &quot;De Udstillede&quot; (The Exhibited).

Von Trier achieved international success with his &quot;Golden Heart&quot; trilogy. Each film in the trilogy is about naive heroines who maintain their &quot;golden hearts&quot; despite the tragedies they experience. This trilogy consists of &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996), &quot;The Idiots&quot; (1998), and &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; (2000). While all three films are sometimes associated with the Dogme 95 movement, &quot;The Idiots&quot; was the only one to meet all the necessary criteria to be &quot;certified&quot; as such.

&quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and featured Emily Watson, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Its grainy images, and hand-held photography, pointed towards Dogme95 but violated several of the manifesto&#x27;s rules. The second film in the trilogy, &quot;The Idiots&quot;, was nominated for a Palme d&#x27;Or, with which he was presented in person at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, despite his dislike of traveling. In 2000, von Trier premiered &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, a musical featuring Icelandic musician Björk, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes. The song &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen It All&quot; (co-written by vonTrier) received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.{}

=== 2003–2008: &quot;Land of Opportunities&quot; trilogy and other works ===

&quot;The Five Obstructions&quot; (2003), made by vonTrier and Jørgen Leth, is a documentary that incorporates lengthy sections of experimental films. The premise is that vonTrier challenges Leth, his friend and mentor, to remake his 1967 experimental short &quot;The Perfect Human&quot; five times, each time with a different obstacle.

His next proposed trilogy, &quot;Land of Opportunities&quot;, consists of &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005), and the unmade &quot;&quot;. The first two installments were shot with the same distinctive, extremely stylized approach, with the actors performing on a bare sound stage with no decoration, buildings&#x27; walls marked by chalk lines on the floor, a style inspired by 1970s televised theatre. &quot;Dogville&quot; starred Nicole Kidman as Grace Margaret Mulligan, a role taken by Bryce Dallas Howard for &quot;Manderlay&quot;. Both films feature an ensemble cast including Harriet Andersson, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Danny Glover, and Willem Dafoe. The films question various issues relating to American society, such as intolerance and slavery.

In 2006, von Trier released the Danish-language comedy film, &quot;The Boss of It All&quot;, which was shot using an experimental process he named Automavision, involving the director choosing the best possible fixed camera position, then allowing a computer to randomly choose when to tilt, pan, or zoom. He followed this with an autobiographical film, &quot;The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1&quot; in 2007, which von Trier wrote and Jacob Thuesen directed, a film that tells the story of vonTrier&#x27;s years as a student at the National Film School of Denmark. It stars Jonatan Spang as vonTrier&#x27;s alter ego, called &quot;Erik Nietzsche&quot;, and is narrated by vonTrier himself, with all main characters being based on real people from the Danish film industry. The thinly veiled portrayals include Jens Albinus as director Nils Malmros, Dejan Čukić as screenwriter Mogens Rukov, and Søren Pilmark.

=== 2009–2014: &quot;Depression&quot; trilogy ===
The &quot;Depression&quot; trilogy consists of &quot;Antichrist&quot;, &quot;Melancholia&quot;, and &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;. The three films star Charlotte Gainsbourg, and deal with characters who suffer depression or grief in different ways. This trilogy is said to represent the depression that Trier himself experiences.

&quot;Antichrist&quot; follows &quot;a grieving couple who retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping a return to Eden will repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage; but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse&quot;. The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gainsbourg. It premiered in competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, where the festival&#x27;s jury honoured the movie by giving the Best Actress award to Gainsbourg.

&quot;Melancholia&quot;, released in 2011, is an apocalyptic drama about two depressive sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Gainsbourg, the former of whom marries just before a rogue planet is about to collide with Earth. The film was in competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Best Actress award for Dunst.

Following &quot;Melancholia&quot;, von Trier began the production of &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;, a film about the sexual awakening of a woman played by Gainsbourg. In early December 2013, a four-hour version was shown to the press in a private preview session. The cast also included Stellan Skarsgård (in his sixth film for von Trier), Shia LaBeouf, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Bell, Christian Slater, and Uma Thurman. In response to claims that he had merely created a &quot;porn film&quot;, Skarsgård stated &quot;... if you look at this film, it&#x27;s actually a really bad porn movie, even if you fast forward. And after a while you find you don&#x27;t even react to the explicit scenes. They become as natural as seeing someone eating a bowl of cereal.&quot; For its public release in the United Kingdom, the film was divided into two volumes. The film premiered in the UK on 22February 2014.

In interviews prior to the film&#x27;s release, Gainsbourg and co-star Stacy Martin revealed that prosthetic vaginas, body doubles, and special effects were used for the production of the film. Martin also stated that the film&#x27;s characters were a reflection of the director himself, and referred to the experience as an &quot;honour&quot; that she enjoyed. The film was also released in two &quot;volumes&quot; for the Australian release on 20 March 2014, with an interval separating the back-to-back sections. In February 2014, an uncensored version of &quot;Volume I&quot; was shown at the Berlin Film Festival, with no announcement of when or if the complete five-and-a-half-hour &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; would be made available to the public. The complete version premiered at the 2014 Venice Film Festival and was shortly afterward released in a limited theatrical run worldwide that fall.

=== 2015–2018: &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; and return to Cannes ===
In 2015, von Trier began work on a new feature film, &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, which was originally planned as an eight-part television series. The story is about a serial killer, seen from the murderer&#x27;s point of view. It starred Matt Dillon in the title role, alongside Bruno Ganz, Riley Keough and Sofie Gråbøl. Shooting started in March 2017 in Sweden, before moving to Copenhagen in May.

In February 2017, von Trier explained that the film &quot;celebrates the idea that life is evil and soulless, which is sadly proven by the recent rise of the &quot;Homo trumpus&quot; – the rat king&quot;. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2018. Despite more than a hundred walkouts by audience members, the film still received a 10-minute standing ovation.

=== 2019–present: &quot;The Kingdom&quot; trilogy ===
After the release of &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, von Trier planned to produce &quot;Études&quot;, an anthology film consisting of ten black and white segments, each ten minutes long, inspired by the musical form; though it never came to fruition In December 2020, it was announced he would produce a belated third and final season of &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, titled &quot;The Kingdom Exodus&quot;, with Søren Pilmark returning as Jørgen &#x27;Hook&#x27; Krogshøj, Ghita Nørby as Rigmor Mortensen, alongside a new cast including Mikael Persbrandt as Dr. Helmer, Jr. It was shot in 2021, consisting of five episodes released in November 2022. The miniseries premiered out of competition at the Venice Film Festival as a five-hour feature-length film. It received mixed reviews from critics.

In 2024, Von trier announced that he was working on a new film titled &quot;After&quot; which will benefit from funding from the Danish Film Institute. Filming is expected to begin in late 2024, with Stellan Skarsgård having been cast as the film&#x27;s lead.

== Aesthetics, themes, and style of working ==

=== Themes ===
Von Trier&#x27;s films deal with themes of religious imagery and his treatment of subjects such as mercy, sacrifice, and mental health, confrontational examination of existential, social, and political issues. Most of the films depicted in various forms of politics and religions, such as Nazism in &quot;Europa&quot;, Christianity in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; and &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot;, Atheism in &quot;Dogville&quot;, and Anti-bourgeois in &quot;The Idiots&quot;.

=== Influences ===
Von Trier is heavily influenced by the work of Carl Theodor Dreyer and the film &quot;The Night Porter&quot;. He was so inspired by the short film &quot;The Perfect Human&quot;, directed by Jørgen Leth, that he challenged Leth to redo the short five times in the feature film &quot;The Five Obstructions&quot;.

=== Writing ===
Von Trier&#x27;s writing style has been heavily influenced by his work with actors on set, as well as the Dogme 95 manifesto that he co-authored. In an interview with &quot;Creative Screenwriting&quot;, he described his process as &quot;writing a sketch and keep[ing] the story simple...then part of the script work is with the actors.&quot; He again cites Dreyer as an influence, pointing to his method of overwriting his scripts, then significantly cutting the length down. Reflecting on the storytelling across his body of work, von Trier said, &quot;all the stories are about a realist who comes into conflict with life. I&#x27;m not crazy about real life, and real life is not crazy about me.&quot;

=== Filming techniques ===
Von Trier has said that &quot;a film should be like a stone in your shoe&quot;. To create original art he feels that filmmakers must distinguish themselves stylistically from other films, often by placing restrictions on the film making process. The most famous such restriction is the cinematic &quot;vow of chastity&quot; of the Dogme 95 movement. In &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, he used jump shots and dramatically different color palettes and camera techniques for the &quot;real world&quot; and musical portions of the film.

Von Trier often shoots digitally and operates the camera himself, preferring to continuously shoot the actors in-character without stopping between takes. In &quot;Dogville&quot;, because there were no walls between the &quot;buildings&quot; on the set, actors needed to stay in character for hours, even when not part of the scene being filmed. These techniques often put great strain on the actors, most famously with Björk during the filming of &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;.

Von Trier would later return to explicit images in &quot;Antichrist&quot; (2009), exploring darker themes, but he ran into problems when he tried once more with &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;, which had 90 minutes cut out (reducing it from five-and-one-half to four hours) for its international release in 2013 in order to be commercially viable, taking nearly a year to be shown complete anywhere in an uncensored director&#x27;s cut.

While Lars von Trier commissioned new musical compositions for his early films, his more recent work has made use of existing music. With &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;, the principle of musical eclecticism is also applied within the film. He often heavily edits compositions to manipulate and provoke the audience.

=== Approach to actors ===
In an interview for IndieWire, von Trier compared his approach to actors with &quot;how a chef would work with a potato or a piece of meat&quot;, clarifying that working with actors has differed on each film based on the production conditions. He has occasionally courted controversy by his treatment of his lead actresses. He and Björk famously fell out during the shooting of &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, to the point where she would abscond from filming for days at a time. She stated of von Trier, who shattered a monitor while it was next to her, that &quot;you can take quite sexist film directors like Woody Allen or Stanley Kubrick and still they are the one that provide the soul to their movies. In Lars von Trier&#x27;s case it is not so and he knows it. He needs a female to provide his work soul. And he envies them and hates them for it. So he has to destroy them during the filming. And hide the evidence.&quot;

Nicole Kidman, who starred in von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot;, said in an interview with ABC Radio National that she tried to quit the film several times in response to comments von Trier made on set, often while inebriated, &quot;but I say this laughing...I didn&#x27;t do the sequel but I&#x27;m still very good friends with him, strangely enough, because I admire his honesty and I see him as an artist, and I say, my gosh, it&#x27;s such a hard world now to have a unique voice, and he certainly has that.&quot;

However, other actresses he has worked with, such as Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg have spoken out in defence of his approach. &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; star Stacy Martin has stated that he never forced her to do anything that was outside her comfort zone. She said &quot;I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a misogynist. The fact that he sometimes depicts women as troubled or dangerous or dark or even evil; that doesn&#x27;t automatically make him anti-feminist. It&#x27;s a very dated argument. I think that Lars loves women.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===

In 1989, von Trier&#x27;s mother confessed to him on her deathbed that his biological father was not the man who raised him, but her former employer, (1909–2000), who was descended from a long line of Danish classical musicians. Hartmann&#x27;s grandfather was Emil Hartmann, and his great-grandfather J. P. E. Hartmann. His uncles included Niels Gade and Johan Ernst Hartmann, and Niels Viggo Bentzon was his cousin. She stated that she did this to give her son &quot;artistic genes&quot;. Von Trier has jokingly said, by reference to the distant German origin of the Hartmann family, that while he believed he had a Jewish background, he is &quot;really more of a Nazi.&quot;

During the German occupation of Denmark, Hartmann in fact joined a resistance group, actively counteracting any pro-German and pro-Nazi colleagues in his civil service department. Another member of this resistance group was Hartmann&#x27;s colleague Viggo Kampmann, who would later become prime minister of Denmark. After vonTrier had four awkward meetings with his biological father, Hartmann refused further contact.

From 1987 to 1995, von Trier was married to producer and actress , with whom he has two daughters, Agnes and Selma (both producers like their parents), and from 1997 to 2015 to Bente Frøge, with whom he has two sons.

=== Family background and political and religious views ===
Von Trier&#x27;s mother considered herself a communist, while Ulf Trier was a social democrat. Both were committed nudists, and vonTrier went on several childhood holidays to nudist camps. They regarded the disciplining of children as reactionary. Von Trier has noted that he was brought up in an atheist family, and that although Ulf Trier was Jewish, he was not religious. His parents did not allow much room in their household for &quot;feelings, religion, or enjoyment&quot;, and also refused to make any rules for their children.

In a 2005 interview with &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, vonTrier said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m all that Catholic really. I&#x27;m probably not. Denmark is a very Protestant country. Perhaps I only turned Catholic to piss off a few of my countrymen.&quot; In 2009, he said, &quot;I&#x27;m a very bad Catholic. In fact I&#x27;m becoming more and more of an atheist.&quot;

=== Health ===
====Mental health====
Von Trier suffers from various fears and phobias, including an intense fear of flying. This fear frequently places severe constraints on him and his crew, necessitating that virtually all of his films be shot in either Denmark or Sweden.

On numerous occasions, he has stated that he suffers from occasional depression which renders him incapable of doing his work and unable to fulfill social obligations.

====Parkinson&#x27;s disease====
On 8 August 2022, it was announced that von Trier had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, von Trier plans to take a break from filmmaking to adjust to his new life with the disease, saying: &quot;I will take a little break and find out what to do, but I certainly hope that my condition will be better. It&#x27;s a disease you can&#x27;t take away; you can work with the symptoms, though.&quot; On 12 February 2025, Zentropa producer Louise Vesth announced via Instagram that von Trier had been admitted to a care facility for the condition.

== Controversies ==

=== Remarks during Cannes interview ===
In May 2011, known to be provocative in interviews, vonTrier&#x27;s remarks during the press conference before the premiere of &quot;Melancholia&quot; in Cannes caused significant controversy in the media, leading the festival to declare him &quot;persona non grata&quot;. He was therefore banned from Cannes for one year, although &quot;Melancholia&quot; still competed in that year&#x27;s competition.

Minutes before the end of the press conference, von Trier was asked about his German roots and the Nazi aesthetic, in response to his description of the film&#x27;s genre as &quot;German romance&quot;. He joked that since he was &quot;no longer Jewish,&quot; having been told the truth about his biological father, he now &quot;understands&quot; and &quot;sympathizes&quot; with Hitler, that he is not against the Jews except for Israel which is &quot;a pain in the ass&quot; and that he is a Nazi. Von Trier was branded an antisemite for his remarks. He released a formal apology immediately after the press conference and kept apologizing for his joke during all of the interviews he gave in the weeks following the incident, admitting that he was not sober, and saying that he did not need to explain that he is not a Nazi. However, in 2019, von Trier stated that he made this remark at the &quot;only press conference I ever had when I was sober.&quot;

The actors of &quot;Melancholia&quot; who were present during the incident – Dunst, Gainsbourg, Skarsgård – defended the director, pointing to his provocative sense of humor and his depression. He refused to attend a private press screening of his subsequent feature &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;. In the director&#x27;s defense, Skarsgård stated at the screening, &quot;Everyone knows he&#x27;s not a Nazi, and it was disgraceful the way the press had these headlines saying he was.&quot; The director of the Cannes festival later called the controversy &quot;unfair&quot; and as &quot;stupid&quot; as vonTrier&#x27;s bad joke, concluding that his films are welcome at the festival and that vonTrier is considered a &quot;friend&quot;.

=== Sex and violence in films ===
Several of his films – &quot;The Idiots&quot; (1998), &quot;Antichrist&quot; (2009), &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; (2013) and &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; (2018) – contain explicit content that has generated controversy; the first faced widespread backlash upon its release as one film critic was ejected from its premiere screening at Cannes for heckling, and the film was heavily censored for subsequent releases. At the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, approximately 100 audience members walked out of the premiere of &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;.

=== Sexual harassment allegations with Björk ===

In October 2017, Björk, in the wake of dozens of sexual abuse cases brought against film producer Harvey Weinstein, posted on her Facebook page that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director. She commented:

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found evidence identifying him as Lars von Trier. Von Trier has rejected Björk&#x27;s allegation that he sexually harassed her during the making of the film &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, and said &quot;That was not the case. But that we were definitely not friends, that&#x27;s a fact&quot;, to Danish daily &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; in its online edition. Peter Aalbæk Jensen, the producer of &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, told &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; that &quot;as far as I remember we [Lars von Trier and I] were the victims. That woman was stronger than both Lars von Trier and me and our company put together. She dictated everything and was about to close a movie of 100m kroner [$16m]&quot;. After von Trier&#x27;s statement, Björk explained the details about this incident:In the spirit of #metoo I would like to lend women around the world a hand with a more detailed description of my experience with a Danish director. It feels extremely difficult to come out with something of this nature into the public, especially when immediately ridiculed by offenders. I fully sympathise with everyone who hesitates, even for years. But I feel it is the right time especially now when it could make a change. Here comes a list of the encounters that I think count as sexual harassment:

# After each take the director ran up to me and wrapped his arms around me for a long time in front of all crew or alone and stroked me sometimes for minutes against my wishes.
# When after 2 months of this i said he had to stop the touching, he exploded and broke a chair in front of everyone on set. Like someone who has always been allowed to fondle his actresses. Then we all got sent home.
# During the whole filming process there were constant awkward paralysing unwanted whispered sexual offers from him with graphic descriptions, sometimes with his wife standing next to us.
# While filming in Sweden, he threatened to climb from his room&#x27;s balcony over to mine in the middle of the night with a clear sexual intention, while his wife was in the room next door. I escaped to my friends room. This was what finally woke me up to the severity of all this and made me stand my ground.
# Fabricated stories in the press about me being difficult by his producer. This matches beautifully the Weinstein methods and bullying. I have never eaten a shirt. Not sure that is even possible.
# I didn&#x27;t comply or agree on being sexually harassed. That was then portrayed as me being difficult. If being difficult is standing up to being treated like that, i&#x27;ll own it.

Hope

Let&#x27;s break this curse.

Warmth

BjörkBjörk&#x27;s manager, Derek Birkett, has also accused von Trier&#x27;s actions in the past:
&quot;The Guardian&quot; later found that Jensen&#x27;s studio, Zentropa, with which von Trier frequently collaborated, had an endemic culture of sexual harassment. Jensen stepped down from CEO position of Zentropa as further harassment allegations came to light in 2017.

=== Animal cruelty during filming ===
A donkey was slaughtered for dramatic purposes during production of &quot;Manderlay&quot;, an act that caused actors including John C. Reilly to quit the film in protest of its cruelty to animals. The scene was cut from the film before it was released.

Although &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot; was praised by animal rights organization PETA for its use of realistic effects, a scene involving the main character mutilating a duckling was the subject of criticism from some audiences.

=== Position on the Russian war against Ukraine ===
In August 2023, Lars von Trier published on Instagram a critical entry against the delivery of F-16 fighters to Ukraine, ending his post by saying &quot;Russian lives matter also!&quot; The entry immediately became publicized in official Russian media and by the Russian propaganda officer Margarita Simonyan. Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine&#x27;s National Security and Defense Council, responded on Twitter, criticising von Trier&#x27;s comments, saying, &quot;The choice between the executioner and the victim becomes a tragedy when the artist chooses the side of the executioner.&quot; Two days later, Von Trier then made another post on Instagram, saying, &quot;I support Ukraine with every beat of my heart! I was just stating the obvious: that all lives in this world matter!&quot;

== Filmography ==
=== Films ===
=== Frequent collaborators ===
Von Trier often works more than once with actors and production members. Manon Rasmussen was the only crew member as a costume designer to collaborate with von Trier in all of his works (except &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;The Idiots&quot;) since &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; (1984). His first, but initial acting collaborator for &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; was Leif Magnusson, who appeared in his role as a hotel guest, yet continued to appear again in the last two films as different minor roles for his first trilogy until his acting retirement in the early 1990s. His main crew members and producer team has remained intact since &quot;Europa&quot;. Many of his recurring actors have expressed their devotion to von Trier. European actors Jean-Marc Barr, Udo Kier, and Stellan Skarsgård have all appeared across several von Trier films. With the exception of &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, his incompleted &quot;USA Trilogy&quot;, and &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot;; British-French actress Charlotte Gainsbourg and Swedish actor Leif Magnusson are the only two acting collaborators (excluding himself) to have appeared in all installments of two of his trilogies, taking the lead roles in &quot;Depression&quot; for the former and minor roles in &quot;Europa&quot; for the latter.

&quot;Note: This list shows only the actors (in alphabetical order only) who have collaborated with von Trier in three or more productions&quot;.

=== Awards and honors ===
Among his more than 100 awards and 200 nominations at film festivals worldwide, von Trier has received: the Palme d&#x27;Or (for &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;), the Grand Prix (for &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;), the Prix du Jury (for &quot;Europa&quot;), and the Technical Grand Prize (for &quot;The Element of Crime&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot;) at the Cannes Film Festival. Von Trier has also received both Golden Globe Award and Academy Award nomination for the former.

<text>Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian (also known as Life of Brian) is a 1979 British black comedy film starring and written by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin). It was directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Judaean man who is born on the same day as—and next door to—Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.

Following the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, musician and former Beatle George Harrison and his business partner Denis O&#x27;Brien arranged financing for &quot;Life of Brian&quot; through the formation of their HandMade Films company.

The film&#x27;s themes of religious satire were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. In the United Kingdom, the film was given a AA (14) rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in August 1978. The BBFC (based in England) classify films on behalf of local councils (across the UK), though each local council ultimately has the power over the classification of any film screened in their jurisdiction. As a result of this, 11 councils outright banned the film, while a further 28 raised the rating from AA to X across their jurisdictions. (The certificate issued by the BBFC would later be amended, from AA to 15 in 1988, and from 15 to 12A in 2019). Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, and in a few of these, such as Italy, bans lasted over a decade. The filmmakers used the notoriety to promote the film, with posters in Sweden reading, &quot;So funny it was banned in Norway!&quot;

The film was a box office success, the fourth highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979, and highest-grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular and has been named as the greatest comedy film of all time by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, &quot;One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.&quot; In a 2006 Channel 4 poll, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; was ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films.

==Plot==

Brian Cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea.

While listening to Jesus&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel named Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exacerbated by his mother revealing that Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the &quot;People&#x27;s Front of Judea&quot; (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering independence movements that spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.

PFJ leader Reg tasks Brian to paint slogans overnight on Roman governor Pilate&#x27;s palace, but a Roman officer catches him in the act. However, the officer shows more concern with Brian&#x27;s appalling Latin grammar than the act of vandalism, and after correcting the slogan to &quot;Romani ite domum&quot;, orders him to write it on the wall one hundred times. Brian finishes after sunrise and is chased by guards, before being rescued by Judith. 

Reg gives a revolutionary speech to the PFJ asking, &quot;What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot; at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, public health and peace. He then outlines plans to kidnap Pilate&#x27;s wife. However, inside Pilate&#x27;s palace, the PFJ encounters another revolutionary group who had the same idea which sparks a violent argument. Brian is the sole survivor of the fight but is captured by the palace guards. The guards bring Brian before Pilate, but his questioning is cut short when the guards begin uncontrollably laughing at the names of Pilate&#x27;s friend from Rome, Biggus Dickus, and his wife, Incontinentia Buttocks.

Escaping, Brian is accidentally scooped up by a passing extraterrestrial spaceship that crash lands back on Earth. He tries to blend in among prophets who are preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus&#x27; sermons. Brian stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more.

Brian grows frantic when people chase him to the mountains, and there they declare him to be the Messiah. After spending the night with Judith, a naked Brian discovers an enormous crowd of followers assembled outside his mother&#x27;s house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to him addressing them. Although he tells them that they are all individuals and that they need to think for themselves, they ironically parrot his words as doctrine.

The PFJ seek to exploit Brian&#x27;s celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and sentenced to crucifixion. 

In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice as a show of friendship between the Romans and the people of Judea. However, the crowd shout out names containing the letter &quot;r&quot;, mocking Pilate&#x27;s speech impediment, and are further amused by his friend Biggus&#x27;s lisp. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd (assuming it is another joke) parrots, and Pilate agrees to &quot;welease Bwian&quot;.

The guards eventually catch up to Brian, who is already on the cross. But in a scene that parodies the climax of the film &quot;Spartacus&quot;, various crucified people all claim to be Brian so they can be freed, and the wrong man is released. Brian is successively approached and then abandoned by the PFJ, who praise his martyrdom, the Judean People&#x27;s Front, who commit mass suicide as a form of political protest, Judith, and his scolding mother.

As he despairs, the convict next to him leads the rest in a cheerful song, which Brian and the others join in with (&quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;).

Several characters remained unnamed during the film but do have names that are used in the soundtrack album track listing and elsewhere. There is no mention in the film that Eric Idle&#x27;s ever-cheerful joker is called &quot;Mr Cheeky&quot;, or that the Roman guard played by Michael Palin is named &quot;Nisus Wettus&quot;.

Spike Milligan appears as a prophet, ignored because his acolytes are chasing after Brian. By coincidence Milligan was visiting his old World War II battlefields in Tunisia where the film was being made. The Pythons were alerted to this and he was included in the scene being filmed that morning. He left in the afternoon before he could be included in any of the close-up or publicity shots for the film.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
There are various stories about the origins of &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. Shortly after the release of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons&#x27; forthcoming feature would be &quot;Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory&quot; (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film &quot;Patton, Patton: Ordeal and Triumph&quot;). This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed &quot;Holy Grail&quot;″s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way that &quot;Holy Grail&quot; had lampooned Arthurian legend. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting &quot;Holy Grail&quot; in Amsterdam, had come up with a sketch in which Jesus&#x27; cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early brainstorming stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was &quot;definitely a good guy&quot; and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: &quot;He&#x27;s not particularly funny, what he&#x27;s saying isn&#x27;t mockable, it&#x27;s very decent stuff&quot;, said Idle later. After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of &quot;the 13th disciple&quot;. The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.

The first draft of the screenplay, provisionally titled &quot;The Gospel According to St. Brian&quot;, was ready by Christmas 1976. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following &quot;a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados&quot;.

Python fan and former Beatle George Harrison set up HandMade Films along with Denis O&#x27;Brien to help fund the film at a cost of £3 million. Harrison put up the money for it as he &quot;wanted to see the movie&quot;—later described by Terry Jones as the &quot;world&#x27;s most expensive cinema ticket&quot;. The original backers—EMI Films and, particularly, Bernard Delfont—had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter. The very last words in the film are: &quot;I said to him, &#x27;Bernie, they&#x27;ll never make their money back on this one&#x27;&quot;, teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, &quot;They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally.&quot; As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, &quot;owner of the Mount&quot;, who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:08:50 in the film). His one word of dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse &quot;&#x27;ullo&quot;) had to be dubbed in later by Michael Palin.

===Filming===

Terry Jones was solely responsible for directing, having amicably agreed with Gilliam (who co-directed &quot;Holy Grail&quot;) to do so, with Gilliam concentrating on the look of the film. &quot;Holy Grail&quot;″s production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera. Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of Pilate&#x27;s fortress, which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping their structural artefacts (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the cinematography. Gilliam also worked on the matte paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done &quot;in camera&quot; using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics. Gilliam recounted in an interview: &quot;Well, we didn&#x27;t know what to do with Brian. He got himself to the top of the tower and we had to rescue him somehow, so I said, &#x27;OK, spaceship for that.&#x27; That was purely it. It was funny, because this was at the time when &quot;Star Wars&quot; had just come out.&quot;

The film was shot on location in Monastir, Tunisia, which allowed the production to reuse sets from Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977). The Tunisian shoot was documented by Iain Johnstone for his BBC film &quot;The Pythons&quot;. Many locals were employed as extras on &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. Director Jones noted, &quot;They were all very knowing because they&#x27;d all worked for Franco Zeffirelli on &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, so I had these elderly Tunisians telling me, &#x27;Well, Mr Zeffirelli wouldn&#x27;t have done it like that, you know.&#x27;&quot; Further location shooting also took place in Tunisia, at Sousse (Jerusalem outer walls and gateway), Carthage (Roman theatre) and Matmata (Sermon on the Mount and Crucifixion).

Graham Chapman, suffering from alcoholism, was so determined to play the lead role—at one point coveted by Cleese—that he sobered up in time for filming, so much so that he also acted as the on-set doctor.

===Rough cut and pre-screenings===
Following shooting between 16 September and 12 November 1978, a two-hour rough cut of the film was put together for its first private showing in January 1979. Over the next few months &quot;Life of Brian&quot; was re-edited and re-screened a number of times for different preview audiences, losing a number of entire filmed sequences.

===Editing===
A number of scenes were cut during the editing process. Five deleted scenes, a total of 13 minutes, including the controversial &quot;Otto&quot;, were first made available in 1997 on the Criterion Collection Laserdisc. An unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought Handmade Films. However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus&#x27;s birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate&#x27;s wife (a large woman played by John Case) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline Zionist Otto, leader of the Judean People&#x27;s Front (played by Eric Idle), and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help. The shepherds&#x27; scene has badly distorted sound, and the kidnap scene has poor colour quality. The same scenes that were on the Criterion laserdisc can now be found on the Criterion Collection DVD.

The most controversial cuts were the scenes involving Otto, initially a recurring character, who had a thin Adolf Hitler moustache and spoke with a German accent, shouting accusations of &quot;racial impurity&quot; at Judeans who were conceived (as Brian was) when their mothers were raped by Roman centurions, as well as other Nazi phrases. The logo of the Judean People&#x27;s Front, designed by Terry Gilliam, was a Star of David with a small line added to each point so it resembled a swastika, most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on Imperial German helmets. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto&#x27;s dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in &quot;The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons&quot;, said he thought it should have stayed, saying &quot;Listen, we&#x27;ve alienated the Christians, let&#x27;s get the Jews now.&quot; Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; &quot;It&#x27;s essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it&#x27;s rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.&quot; Michael Palin&#x27;s personal journal entries from the period when various edits of &quot;Brian&quot; were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons&#x27; and filmmakers&#x27; concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film. However, Oxford Brookes University historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented &quot;a form of self-censorship&quot; and the Otto sequence &quot;which involved a character representative of extreme forms of Zionism&quot; was cut &quot;in the interests of smoothing the way for the film&#x27;s distribution in America.&quot;

The only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the crucifixion sequence. Otto arrives with his &quot;crack suicide squad&quot;, sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, the squad stab themselves to death as Brian watches. Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to continuity reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene. He acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits, but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing.

Otto&#x27;s scenes, and those with Pilate&#x27;s wife, were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers, and so they can be found in the published version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the Fifth Legion to the headquarters of the People&#x27;s Front of Judea, Reg (John Cleese) says &quot;You cunt!! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed...&quot; The profanity was overdubbed to &quot;you klutz&quot; before the film was released. Cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the profanity would &quot;get in the way of the comedy.&quot;

An early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in &quot;Monty Python: The Case Against&quot; by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an English public school. Much of this material was first printed in the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook&quot; that accompanied the original script publication of &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; and then subsequently reused. The song &quot;All Things Dull and Ugly&quot; and the parody scripture reading &quot;Martyrdom of St. Victor&quot; were performed on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Contractual Obligation Album&quot; (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot; (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased &quot;The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album&quot; (1981).

==Soundtrack==

An album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the &quot;Brian Song&quot; and &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;, it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.

An album of the songs sung in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; was released on the Disky label. &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British football fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the Falklands War when sailors aboard the destroyer HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, severely damaged in an Argentinean Exocet missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue. Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to optimism. One of its more famous renditions was by the dignitaries of Manchester&#x27;s bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, just after they were awarded to Sydney. Idle later performed the song as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; is also featured in Eric Idle&#x27;s &quot;Spamalot&quot;, a Broadway musical based upon &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, and was sung by the rest of the Monty Python group at Graham Chapman&#x27;s memorial service and at the &quot;Monty Python Live at Aspen&quot; special. The song is a staple at Iron Maiden concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.

==Release==
For the original British and Australian releases, a spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, &quot;Away from It All&quot;, was shown before the film itself. It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment &quot;Hard to believe, isn&#x27;t it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western civilisation as we know it!&quot;, Communist Bulgaria being a member of the Warsaw Pact at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues &quot;per se&quot;, it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.

&quot;Life of Brian&quot; opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total gross was $19,398,164. It was the highest grossing British film in North America that year. Released on 8 November 1979 in the UK, the film was the fourth highest-grossing film in Britain in 1979. In London, it opened at the Plaza cinema and grossed £40,470 in its opening week.

On 30 April 2004, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; was re-released on five North American screens to &quot;cash in&quot; (as Terry Jones put it) on the box office success of Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. It grossed $26,376 ($5,275 per screen) in its opening weekend. It ran until October 2004, playing at 28 screens at its widest point, eventually grossing $646,124 during its re-release. By comparison, a re-release of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; had earned $1.8 million three years earlier. A DVD of the film was also released that year.

==Reception==
Reviews from critics were mostly positive on the film&#x27;s release. Movie historian Leonard Maltin reported that &quot;This will probably offend every creed and denomination equally, but it shouldn&#x27;t. The funniest and most sustained feature from Britain&#x27;s bad boys.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;the foulest-spoken biblical epic ever made, as well as the best-humored—a nonstop orgy of assaults, not on anyone&#x27;s virtue, but on the funny bone. It makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, &quot;What&#x27;s endearing about the Pythons is their good cheer, their irreverence, their willingness to allow comic situations to develop through a gradual accumulation of small insanities.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three and a half stars, calling it &quot;a gentle but very funny parody of the life of Jesus, as well as of biblical movies.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared, &quot;Even those of us who find Monty Python too hit-and-miss and gory must admit that its latest effort has numerous moments of hilarity.&quot; Clyde Jeavons of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the script was &quot;occasionally over-raucous and crude&quot;, but found the second half of the film &quot;cumulatively hilarious&quot;, with &quot;a splendidly tasteless finale, which even Mel Brooks might envy.&quot; Richard Grenier, writing in the neoconservative magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;, said &quot;&quot;Life of Brian&quot; contains appreciably more mocking of faddish radicalism and Third World &#x27;national-liberation movements&#x27; than it does of religion,&quot; citing numerous examples in the film of satire at the expense of &quot;left-wing ideas about imperialism, feminism, and terrorism,&quot; reflecting a satirical omnivorousness that Grenier associated with &quot;the tradition of what might be called &#x27;Tory wit,&#x27; reaching back to Congreve and Swift and all the way forward to Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had a negative opinion of the film, writing that it was &quot;a cruel fiction to foster the delusion that &#x27;Brian&#x27; is bristling with blasphemous nifties and throbbing with impious wit. If only it were! One might find it easier to keep from nodding off.&quot;
Over time, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; has regularly been cited as a significant contender for the title &quot;greatest comedy film of all time&quot;, and has been named as such in polls conducted by &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine in 2000, the British TV network Channel 4 where it topped the poll in the 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2007. Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of the best reviewed comedies, with a 96% approval rating from 67 published reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. Its critical consensus reads, &quot;One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.&quot; 

In 1999 the BFI declared &quot;Life of Brian&quot; to be the 28th best British film of all time. It was the seventh highest ranking comedy on this list (four of the better placed efforts were classic Ealing Films). Another Channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time (the only comedy that came higher was Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, which was ranked 5th). A 2011 poll by &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked it as the third greatest comedy film ever made, behind &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Life of Brian&quot; 2nd in their list of the 100 best British films, with only David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; ranking higher.

Various polls have voted the line, &quot;He&#x27;s not the Messiah, he&#x27;s a very naughty boy!&quot; (spoken by Brian&#x27;s mother Mandy to the crowd assembled outside her house), to be the funniest in film history. Other famous lines from the film have featured in polls, such as, &quot;What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Brian and so&#x27;s my wife&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Initial criticism and blasphemy accusations===
Richard Webster comments in &quot;A Brief History of Blasphemy&quot; (1990) that &quot;internalised censorship played a significant role in the handling&quot; of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;. In his view, &quot;As a satire on religion, this film might well be considered a rather slight production. As blasphemy it was, even in its original version, extremely mild. Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK. Once again a blasphemy was restrained – or its circulation effectively curtailed – not by the force of law but by the internalisation of this law.&quot; On its initial release in the UK, the film was banned by several town councils – some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries, or had not even seen the film. A member of Harrogate council, one of those that banned the film, revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film, and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the Nationwide Festival of Light, a grouping with an evangelical Christian base, of which they knew nothing.

In New York (the film&#x27;s release in the US preceded British distribution), screenings were picketed by both rabbis and nuns (&quot;Nuns with banners!&quot; observed Michael Palin). It was also banned for eight years in Ireland and for a year in Norway (it was marketed in Sweden as &quot;The film that is so funny that it was banned in Norway&quot;). During the film&#x27;s theatrical run in Finland, a text explaining that the film was a parody of Hollywood historical epics was added to the opening credits.

In the UK, Mary Whitehouse, and other traditionalist Christians, pamphleteered and picketed locations where the local cinema was screening the film, a campaign that was felt to have boosted publicity. Leaflets arguing against the film&#x27;s representation of the New Testament (for example, suggesting that the Wise Men would not have approached the wrong stable as they do in the opening of the film) were documented in Robert Hewison&#x27;s book &quot;Monty Python: The Case Against&quot;.

===Crucifixion issue===
One of the most controversial scenes was the film&#x27;s ending: Brian&#x27;s crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus&#x27; suffering by turning it into a &quot;Jolly Boys Outing&quot; (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: &quot;See, not so bad once you&#x27;re up!&quot;), capped by Brian&#x27;s fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: &quot;Oh, you&#x27;ll probably get away with crucifixion&quot;. In another example, Matthias, an old man who works with the People&#x27;s Front of Judea, dismisses crucifixion as &quot;a doddle&quot; and says being stabbed would be worse.

The director, Terry Jones, issued the following response to this criticism: &quot;Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.&quot; The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.

===Responses from the cast===
Shortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a debate on the BBC2 discussion programme &quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; with Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and Stockwood, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself. Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting Mother Teresa and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese stated that his reputation had &quot;plummeted&quot; in his eyes, while Palin commented, &quot;He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.&quot; Muggeridge&#x27;s verdict on the film was that it was &quot;Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn&#x27;t possibly destroy anyone&#x27;s genuine faith.&quot; In a 2013 interview on BBC Radio 4, Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he &quot;was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became&quot;. He added: &quot;I think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion – no attempt to find any common ground.&quot;
The Pythons unanimously deny that they were ever out to destroy people&#x27;s faith. On the DVD audio commentary, they contend that the film is heretical because it lampoons the practices of modern organised religion, but that it does not blasphemously lampoon the God that Christians and Jews worship. When Jesus does appear in the film (on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The music and lighting make it clear that there is a genuine aura around him. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love and tolerance (&quot;I think he said, &#x27;blessed are the cheese makers&#x27;&quot;). Importantly, he is distinct from the character of Brian, which is also evident in the scene where an annoying and ungrateful ex-leper pesters Brian for money, while moaning that since Jesus cured him, he has lost his source of income in the begging trade (referring to Jesus as a &quot;bloody do-gooder&quot;).

James Crossley, however, has argued that the film makes the distinction between Jesus and the character of Brian to make a contrast between the traditional Christ of both faith and cinema and the historical figure of Jesus in critical scholarship and how critical scholars have argued that ideas later got attributed to Jesus by his followers. Crossley points out that the film uses the character of Brian to address a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories about Jesus, such as the Messianic Secret, the Jewishness of Jesus, Jesus the revolutionary, and having a single mother.

In the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary, Terry Gilliam says, &quot;We were pilloried by religious groups on all sides from Jews to Catholics to Protestants. To me, what&#x27;s important is that we managed to offend a lot of people. But as you notice, we were very cautious about offending any Muslims. We would say &quot;nothing&quot; negative about a Muslim, &#x27;cause we&#x27;d get a fatwa after us. But your Jews, your Christians, they&#x27;re easy to push around.&quot;

Not all the Pythons agree on the definition of the movie&#x27;s tone. There was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998. In the section where &quot;Life of Brian&quot; is discussed, the following dialogue ensued:

In a later interview, Jones said the film &quot;isn&#x27;t blasphemous because it doesn&#x27;t touch on belief at all. It is heretical, because it touches on dogma and the interpretation of belief, rather than belief itself.&quot;

===21st century===
The film continues to cause controversy; in February 2007, the Church of St Thomas the Martyr in Newcastle upon Tyne held a public screening in the church itself, with song-sheets, organ accompaniment, stewards in costume and false beards for female members of the audience (alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able to take part in a stoning). Although the screening was a sell-out, some Christian groups, notably the conservative Christian Voice, were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead. Stephen Green, the head of Christian Voice, insisted that &quot;You don&#x27;t promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him.&quot; The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church&#x27;s clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion. Again on the film&#x27;s DVD commentary, Cleese also spoke up for religious people who have come forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the film&#x27;s highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith.

Some bans continued into the 21st century. In 2008, Torbay Council finally permitted the film to be shown after it won an online vote for the English Riviera International Comedy Film Festival. In 2009, it was announced that a thirty-year-old ban of the film in the Welsh town of Aberystwyth had finally been lifted, and the subsequent showing was attended by Terry Jones and Michael Palin alongside mayor Sue Jones-Davies (who portrayed Judith Iscariot in the film). However, before the showing, an Aberystwyth University student discovered that a ban had only been discussed by the council and in fact that it had been shown (or scheduled to be shown) at a cinema in the town in 1981. In 2013, a German official in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia considered the film to be possibly offensive to Christians and hence subject to a local regulation prohibiting its public screening on Good Friday, despite protests by local atheists.

==Political satire==
The film pokes fun at revolutionary groups and 1970s British left-wing politics. According to Roger Wilmut, &quot;What the film does do is place modern stereotypes in a historical setting, which enables it to indulge in a number of sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations&quot;. There are several groups in the film which oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences. The comical naming similarities of the groups were also a satire of fractious divisions between contemporary Palestinian liberation groups, all containing the words &quot;front&quot; and &quot;liberation&quot; along with &quot;Palestine&quot;: Palestinian Popular Struggle Front (PPSF) (formed 1967) had broken off from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which had divisions which lead to Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) (1968), which in turn split into Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) (1969), Popular Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFRLP) (1972). 

Such disunity indeed fatally hampered real-life Judean resistance against Roman rule. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on &quot;modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas&quot;.
The People&#x27;s Front of Judea, composed of the Pythons&#x27; characters, harangue their &quot;rivals&quot; with cries of &quot;splitters&quot; and stand vehemently opposed to the Judean People&#x27;s Front, the Judean People&#x27;s Popular Front, the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the Popular Front of Judea (the last composed of a single old man, mocking the size of real revolutionary Trotskyist factions). The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate&#x27;s wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle &quot;against the common enemy&quot;, the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, &quot;the Judean People&#x27;s Front!&quot; However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.

Other scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. The famous &quot;what have the Romans ever done for us&quot; scene has drawn significant attention, with Python biographer George Perry noting, &quot;The People&#x27;s Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of shop stewards&quot;. This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian Talmud; some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text.

==Film analysis==
===Themes and motifs===
==== Bible ====

The depictions of Jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on Christian iconography. The resistance fighters leave the Sermon on the Mount, which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (&quot;Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo…&quot;) In addition to the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film does not state that there is no God or that Jesus is not the son of God. The appearance of a leper, who says he was healed by Jesus, is in line with the Gospels and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.

Any direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman centurion could refer to the polemic legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier Panthera. Disguised as a prophet, Brian talks about &quot;the lilies on the field&quot; and states more clearly, &quot;Don&#x27;t pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself&quot;: Brian incoherently repeats statements he heard from Jesus.

Another significant figure in the film who is named in the Gospels is Pontius Pilate, the central antagonist. Although the humour largely involves Jews, there is no sinister Jew to compare with Judas or Caiaphas. An anti-Semitic interpretation of the story is therefore excluded, according to scholars. The crucifixion scene, a central part of Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. It is a historically accurate enactment of a routinely done mass crucifixion.

==== Belief and dogmatism ====

The intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious dogmatism, according to film theorists and statements from Monty Python. This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, &quot;blessed are the peacemakers&quot;, the audience understands the phonetically similar word &quot;Cheesemakers&quot; and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and beatification of those who produce dairy products.

&quot;Life of Brian&quot; satirises, in the words of David Hume, the &quot;strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous&quot;. When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere. In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. Even when Brian explicitly denies he is the Messiah, they still follow him, rationalizing that only the true Messiah would have the humility to deny his own divine status. The faithful gather beneath Brian&#x27;s window en masse to receive God&#x27;s blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film &quot;you don&#x27;t need to follow anybody! You&#x27;ve got to think for yourselves!&quot; Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practising Christians after the film was released.

According to Terry Jones, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; &quot;is not blasphemy but heresy&quot;, because Brian contested the authority of the Church whereas the belief in God remained untouched. He goes on to mention that &quot;Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can&#x27;t agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.&quot; The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the &quot;history of the Church in three minutes&quot;. Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.
For the most part, lost in the religious controversy was the film&#x27;s mockery of factional dogmatism among left-wing parties. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to each of them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent. In the film, rather than presenting a common front as their organisational names should imply, the leader of the People&#x27;s Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples&#x27;s Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the &quot;rather looney bunch of revolutionaries&quot; indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end, even though they have ample opportunity to rescue Brian, they instead leave Brian on the cross, thanking him for his sacrifice.
There is also a sideswipe at the women&#x27;s movement, which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to exercise &quot;his right as a man&quot; to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.

==== Individuality and meaninglessness ====
One of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don&#x27;t need to follow anybody. According to Edward Slowik, this is a rare moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly. &quot;Life of Brian&quot; accurately depicts the existentialist view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.

Brian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. He is honest to himself and others and lives as authentic a life as he can. However, Brian is too naïve to be called a hero based on the ideas of Albert Camus. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one&#x27;s own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The &quot;absurd hero&quot; rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn&#x27;t able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can&#x27;t triumph over it.

In &quot;Monty Python and Philosophy&quot;, Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the song the film finishes on, &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;, expresses this message clearly:

Shilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them. On this note, some people would claim that the film presents a nihilistic world view which contradicts any basis of religion. However, &quot;Life of Brian&quot; offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that &quot;religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can&#x27;t fight it.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Literature===
Spin-offs include a script-book &quot;The Life of Brian of Nazareth&quot;, which was printed back-to-back with &quot;MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK&quot; as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.

Julian Doyle, the film&#x27;s editor, wrote &quot;The Life of Brian/Jesus&quot;, a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by Kim &quot;Howard&quot; Johnson titled &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian&quot; was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of &quot;Life of Brian&quot; and the book is based on his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.

===Music===
With the success of Eric Idle&#x27;s musical retelling of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, called &quot;Spamalot&quot;, Idle announced that he would be giving &quot;Life of Brian&quot; a similar treatment. The oratorio, called &quot;Not the Messiah (He&#x27;s a Very Naughty Boy)&quot;, was commissioned to be part of the festival called Luminato in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and John Du Prez, who also worked with Idle on &quot;Spamalot&quot;. &quot;Not the Messiah&quot; is a spoof of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. It runs approximately 50 minutes, and was conducted at its world premiere by Toronto Symphony Orchestra music director Peter Oundjian, who is Idle&#x27;s cousin. &quot;Not the Messiah&quot; received its US premiere at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, New York. Oundjian and Idle joined forces once again for a double performance of the oratorio in July 2007.

===Other media===
In October 2011, BBC Four premiered the made-for-television comedy film &quot;Holy Flying Circus&quot;, written by Tony Roche and directed by Owen Harris. The &quot;Pythonesque&quot; film explores the events surrounding the 1979 television debate on talk show &quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; between John Cleese and Michael Palin and Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, then Bishop of Southwark.
In a &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; sketch, a bishop who has directed a scandalous film called &quot;The Life of Christ&quot; is hauled over the coals by a representative of the &quot;Church of Python&quot;, claiming that the film is an attack on &quot;Our Lord, John Cleese&quot; and on the members of Python, who, in the sketch, are the objects of Britain&#x27;s true religious faith. This was a parody of the infamous &quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; programme, broadcast a week previously. The bishop (played by Rowan Atkinson) claims that the reaction to the film has surprised him, as he &quot;didn&#x27;t expect the Spanish Inquisition.&quot;

Radio host John Williams of Chicago&#x27;s WGN 720 AM has used &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; in a segment of his Friday shows. The segment is used to highlight good events from the past week in listeners&#x27; lives and what has made them smile. In the 1997 film &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;, the misanthropic character played by Jack Nicholson sings &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot; as evidence of the character&#x27;s change in attitude.

A BBC history series &quot;What the Romans Did for Us&quot;, written and presented by Adam Hart-Davis and broadcast in 2000, takes its title from Cleese&#x27;s rhetorical question &quot;What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot; in one of the film&#x27;s scenes. (Cleese himself parodied this line in a 1986 BBC advert defending the Television Licence Fee: &quot;What has the BBC ever given us?&quot;).

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in his Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions of 3 May 2006 made a shorthand reference to the types of political groups, &quot;Judean People&#x27;s Front&quot; or &quot;People&#x27;s Front of Judea&quot;, lampooned in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. This was in response to a question from the Labour MP David Clelland, asking &quot;What has the Labour government ever done for us?&quot; – itself a parody of John Cleese&#x27;s &quot;What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot;

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2007, and again on New Year&#x27;s Eve, UK television station Channel 4 dedicated an entire evening to the Monty Python phenomenon, during which an hour-long documentary was broadcast called &quot;The Secret Life of Brian&quot; about the making of &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; and the controversy that was caused by its release. The Pythons featured in the documentary and reflected upon the events that surrounded the film. This was followed by a screening of the film itself. The documentary (in a slightly extended form) was one of the special features on the 2007 DVD re-release – the &quot;Immaculate Edition&quot;, also the first Python release on Blu-ray.

In June 2014 King&#x27;s College London hosted an academic conference on the film, in which internationally renowned Biblical scholars and historians discussed the film and its reception, looking both at how the Pythons had made use of scholarship and texts, and how the film can be used creatively within modern scholarship on the Historical Jesus. In a panel discussion, including Terry Jones and theologian Richard Burridge, John Cleese described the event as &quot;the most interesting thing to come out of Monty Python&quot;. The papers from the conference have gone on to prompt the publication of a book, edited by Joan E. Taylor, the conference organiser, &quot;Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and His Times via Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot;, published by Bloomsbury in 2015.

In 2023, John Cleese said he was working on a stage version of the film and in 2024, he said he expected it to play in London&#x27;s West End .

<text>Loglan is a logical constructed language originally designed for linguistic research, particularly for investigating the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr. James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. In 1960, &quot;Scientific American&quot; published an article introducing the language. Loglan is the first among, and the main inspiration for, the languages known as logical languages, which also includes Lojban.

Brown founded The Loglan Institute (TLI) to develop the language and other applications of it. He always considered the language an incomplete research project, and although he released many publications about its design, he continued to claim legal restrictions on its use. Because of this, a group of his followers later formed the Logical Language Group to create the language Lojban along the same principles, but with the intention to make it freely available and encourage its use as a real language.

Supporters of Lojban use the term &quot;Loglan&quot; as a generic term to refer to both their own language and Brown&#x27;s &quot;Loglan&quot;, referred to as &quot;TLI Loglan&quot; when in need of disambiguation. Although the non-trademarkability of the term &quot;Loglan&quot; was eventually upheld by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, many supporters and members of The Loglan Institute find this usage offensive and reserve &quot;Loglan&quot; for the TLI version of the language.

== Goals ==

Loglan (an abbreviation for &quot;logical language&quot;) was created to investigate whether people speaking a &quot;logical language&quot; would in some way think more logically, as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis might predict. The language&#x27;s grammar is based on predicate logic. The grammar was intended to be small enough to be teachable and manageable, yet complex enough to allow people to think and converse in the language.

Brown intended Loglan to be as culturally neutral as possible and metaphysically parsimonious, which means that obligatory categories are kept to a minimum. An example of an obligatory category in English is the time-tense of verbs, as it is impossible to express a finite verb without also expressing a tense.

Brown also intended the language to be completely regular and unambiguous. Each sentence can be parsed in only one way. Furthermore, the syllabic structure of words was designed so that a sequence of syllables can be separated into words in only one way, even if the word separation is not clear from pauses in speech. It has a small number of phonemes, so that regional &quot;accents&quot; are less likely to produce unintelligible speech. To make the vocabulary easier to learn, words were constructed to have elements in common with related words in the world&#x27;s eight most widely spoken languages.

==Alphabet and pronunciation==
The alphabet of Loglan has two historical versions. In that of 1975 there were only 21 letters with their corresponding phonemes. In the final version of 1989 five more phonemes had been incorporated: letter H (/h/) was added to the alphabet in 1977 by popular demand; letter Y (/ə/) was added in 1982 to work as a kind of hyphen between the terms of a complex word; letters Q (/θ/), W (/y/) and X (/x/) were added in 1986 in order to allow the incorporation of the Linnaean vocabulary of biology, and they were useful to give more exact pronunciations to many borrowed names.


*The letters I and U when placed before vowels represent the IPA sounds /j/ and /w/ respectively. For example: ie /je/ (&quot;what?&quot;), ue /we/ (&quot;what!&quot; as an expression of surprise or interest).

== Grammar ==

Loglan has three types of words: &quot;predicates&quot; (also called &quot;content words&quot;), &quot;structure words&quot; (also called &quot;little words&quot;), and &quot;names&quot;. The majority of words are predicates; these are words that carry meaning. Structure words are words that modify predicates or show how they are related to each other, like English conjunctions and prepositions. 

The class of a word can be determined from its form. A predicate has always two or more syllables, the last syllable being of the form CV, and the other syllables being of the form CVC or CCV. Thus, possible predicates are &quot;kanto&quot;, &quot;stari&quot;, &quot;simgroma&quot;, &quot;nirpatretka&quot;, and so on. A structure word has always one or more syllables, each syllable being one of the four forms V, VV, CV, or CVV. Thus possible structure words are &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;ga&quot;, &quot;kia&quot;, &quot;lemio&quot;, &quot;inorau&quot; and so on. A name may have any form but always ends with a consonant, which distinguishes names from other words, since predicates and structure words always end in a vowel. Names in Loglan are spelled in accordance with Loglan phonetics, so if the name comes from another language, the Loglan spelling may differ from the spelling in that language. If a name in its native language ends in a vowel, it is conventional to add an &quot;s&quot; to form the Loglan name; for example, the English name &quot;Mary&quot; is rendered in Loglan as &quot;Meris&quot; (pronounced /ˈmɛriːs/).

=== Predicates ===
Loglan makes no distinction between nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. A predicate may act as any of these, depending on its position in a sentence. Each predicate has its own argument structure with fixed positions for arguments. For example: &quot;vedma&quot; is the word for &quot;sell&quot;. It takes four arguments: the seller, the item sold, the buyer and the price, in that order. When a predicate is used as a verb, the first argument appears before the predicate, and any subsequent arguments appear after it. So &quot;S pa vedma T B P&quot; means &quot;S sold T to B for price P&quot;. (The structure word &quot;pa&quot; is the past-tense marker, discussed in more detail below.) Not all arguments need to be present; for example, &quot;S pa vedma T B&quot; means &quot;S sold T to B&quot;, &quot;S pa vedma T&quot; means &quot;S sold T&quot;, and &quot;S pa vedma&quot; simply means &quot;S sold (something)&quot;.

Certain structure words can be used to reorder the arguments of a predicate, to emphasize one of the arguments by putting it first. For example, &quot;nu&quot; swaps the first and second arguments of any predicate. So &quot;T pa nu vedma S&quot; means the same thing as &quot;S pa vedma T&quot; and might be translated &quot;T was sold by S&quot;. Similarly, &quot;fu&quot; swaps the first and third argument, and &quot;ju&quot; swaps the first and fourth argument. Thus &quot;B pa fu vedma T S&quot; = &quot;B bought T from S&quot;, and &quot;P pa ju vedma T B&quot; = &quot;P was paid to buy T by B&quot;.

=== Arguments ===
The structure word &quot;le&quot; makes a predicate behave as a noun, so that it can be used as an argument of another predicate. The three-place predicate &quot;matma&quot; means &quot;M is the mother of C by father F&quot;, so &quot;le matma&quot; means &quot;the mother&quot;. Thus &quot;Le matma pa vedma&quot; means &quot;the mother sold (something)&quot;, while &quot;Le vedma pa matma&quot; means &quot;the seller was a mother (of someone)&quot;.

A name can be used as an argument by preceding it with the structure word &quot;la&quot;. Thus &quot;La Adam vedma&quot; means &quot;Adam sells&quot;. Unlike in English and many other languages, this structure word is required; an unadorned name cannot be used as an argument. (The sentence &quot;Adam vedma&quot; is an imperative meaning &quot;Adam, sell (something).&quot; In this case, the name is used as a vocative, not as an argument.) 

A name, or any other word or phrase, can be explicitly quoted with the structure words &quot;li&quot; and &quot;lu&quot; to use the word itself, rather than the thing that word refers to, as an argument. Thus &quot;Li Adam lu corta purda&quot; means &quot;&quot;Adam&quot; is a short word.&quot; Without the li/lu quotes, the sentence &quot;La Adam corta purda&quot; (&quot;Adam is a short word&quot;) would claim that Adam, the person himself, is a short word.

=== Predicate modifiers ===
Any predicate can be used as an adjective or adverb by placing the predicate before the expression that it modifies. The predicate &quot;sadji&quot; means &quot;X is wiser than Y about Z&quot;. So &quot;Le sadji matma pa vedma&quot; means &quot;The wise mother sold&quot;, and &quot;Le matma vedma pa sadji&quot; means &quot;The motherly seller was wise&quot;. Predicates can be used adverbially to modify the main predicate in the sentence in the same way. So &quot;Le matma pa sadji vedma&quot; means &quot;The mother wisely sold&quot;. The structure word &quot;go&quot; can be used to invert the normal word order, so that the modifier follows the expression being modified. Thus &quot;le matma go sadji&quot; (the mother who is wise) means the same as &quot;le sadji matma&quot; (the wise mother).

A string of more than two predicates is left-associative. This grouping can be changed by using the structure word &quot;ge&quot;, which groups what follows into a single unit. Thus Loglan can distinguish between the many possible meanings of the ambiguous English phrase &quot;the pretty little girls&#x27; school&quot;, as in these examples:
* &quot;le bilti cmalo nirli ckela&quot; = the ((pretty little) girls&#x27;) schoolthe school for girls who are beautifully small;
* &quot;le bilti cmalo ge nirli ckela&quot; = the (pretty little) (girls&#x27; school)the school that is beautifully small for a girls&#x27; school;
* &quot;le bilti ge cmalo nirli ckela&quot; = the pretty ((little girls&#x27;) school)the school that is beautiful for a small-girls&#x27; school;
* &quot;le bilti ge cmalo ge nirli ckela&quot; = the pretty (little (girls&#x27; school))the school that is beautiful for a small type of girls&#x27;-school.

Predicates can be modified to indicate the time at which something occurred (English tense) with the optional structure words &quot;na&quot; (present), &quot;pa&quot; (past) and &quot;fa&quot; (future). Thus &quot;Le matma na vedma&quot; means &quot;The mother is (now) selling&quot;, while &quot;Le matma fa vedma&quot; means &quot;The mother will sell&quot;. Marking the verb for tense is optional, so the word &quot;ga&quot; can be used when the time is not being specified. So &quot;Le matma ga vedma&quot; means &quot;The mother sells (at some unspecified time in the past, present or future)&quot;.

=== Free variables ===
A set of structure words called &quot;free variables&quot; are used like English pronouns, but are designed to avoid the ambiguity of pronouns in such sentences as &quot;Adam told Greg that he needed to leave.&quot; The free variable &quot;da&quot; refers to the most recently mentioned noun, &quot;de&quot; refers to the one mentioned prior to that, &quot;di&quot; to the one prior to that, and so on. Compare the sentences
* &quot;La Adam pa vedma le negda la Greg i da gacpi&quot; = Adam sold the egg to Greg; he (Greg) was happy.
* &quot;La Adam pa vedma le negda la Greg i di gacpi&quot; = Adam sold the egg to Greg; he (Adam) was happy.
Free variables apply equally to people of any gender and inanimate objects; there is no distinction similar to that between English &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot;. This explains why &quot;di&quot; rather than &quot;de&quot; was used in the second example. &quot;La Adam pa vedma le negda la Greg i de gacpi&quot; would mean &quot;Adam sold the egg to Greg; it (the egg) was happy.&quot;

=== Conjunctions ===
Loglan has several sets of conjunctions to express the fourteen possible logical connectives. One set is used to combine predicate expressions (&quot;e&quot; = and, &quot;a&quot; = inclusive or, &quot;o&quot; = if and only if), and another set is used to combine predicates to make more complex predicates (&quot;ce&quot;, &quot;ca&quot;, &quot;co&quot;). The sentence &quot;La Kim matma e sadji&quot; means &quot;Kim is a mother and is wise&quot;, while &quot;La Kim matma ce sadji vedma&quot; means &quot;Kim is a motherly and wise seller&quot;, or &quot;Kim sells in a motherly and wise manner&quot;. In the latter sentence, &quot;ce&quot; is used to combine matma and sadji into one predicate which modifies vedma. The sentence &quot;La Kim matma e sadji vedma&quot;, using &quot;e&quot; rather than &quot;ce&quot;, would mean &quot;Kim is a mother and wisely sells.&quot;

Other logical connectives are based on the elementary connectives &quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot;, along with the negation word &quot;no&quot;. For example, logical implication is indicated by the word &quot;noa&quot;. The word is chosen to make it easy for a Loglan speaker to see that &quot;A noa B&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;no A a B&quot;. Brown argues that it is thus easier in Loglan than in English to see that two sentences like these are different ways of saying the same thing:
* &quot;La Kim ga sadji noa fa vedma da.&quot; = If Kim is wise, she will sell it.
* &quot;La Kim ga no sadji a fa vedma da.&quot; = Kim is not wise, and/or she will sell it.

The conjunction &quot;a&quot; expresses the inclusive-or relation; that is, one of the two alternatives is true, or possibly both. The exclusive-or relation, in which only one of the alternatives is true, but not both, is expressed by a different word, &quot;onoi&quot;. Again, the word is chosen to make clear the logical equivalence of &quot;A o no B&quot; and &quot;A onoi B&quot;:
* &quot;Tu fa titci o no tu fa morce.&quot; = You will eat if and only if you do not die.
* &quot;Tu fa titci onoi tu fa morce.&quot; = You will eat, or you will die.

A special conjunction &quot;ze&quot; is used to create a &quot;mixed&quot; predicate which may be true even if it is not necessarily true for either of the component predicates. For example, &quot;Le negda ga nigro ze blabi&quot; means &quot;The egg is black-and-white&quot;. This would be true if the egg were striped or speckled; in that case it would not be true that the egg is black nor that it is white. On the other hand, &quot;Le negda ga nigro e blabi&quot; would make the claim that &quot;The egg is black and (it is also) white&quot;.

=== Attitude indicators ===
There is a set of words used for expressing attitudes about what one is saying, which convey conviction, intention, obligation and emotion. These words follow what they modify, but when used at the start of a sentence, they modify the entire sentence. For example:
* &quot;Ae le matma pa sadji&quot; = Hopefully, the mother was wise.
* &quot;Ui le matma pa sadji&quot; = Happily, the mother was wise.
* &quot;Ou le matma pa sadji&quot; = It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the mother was wise.

== In popular culture ==
Loglan was mentioned in a couple of science fiction works: Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s well-known books, including &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, Robert Rimmer&#x27;s utopian book &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot; (1978) and Stanisław Lem novel &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;.

Loglan&#x27;s inventor, James Cooke Brown, also wrote a utopian science fiction novel called &quot;The Troika Incident&quot; (1970) that uses Loglan phrases but calls the language a different name, &quot;Panlan&quot;.

Loglan is used as the official interspecies language in the roleplaying game &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="17924" wikidata="Q165589" url="?curid=17924" title="Leucippus">
<text>Leucippus (; , &quot;Leúkippos&quot;; ) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. He is traditionally credited as the founder of atomism, which he developed with his student Democritus. Leucippus divided the world into two entities: atoms, indivisible particles that make up all things, and the void, the nothingness that exists between the atoms. He developed his philosophy as a response to the Eleatics, who believed that all things are one and the void does not exist. Leucippus&#x27;s ideas were influential in ancient and Renaissance philosophy. Leucippus was the first Western philosopher to develop the concept of atoms, but his ideas only bear a superficial resemblance to modern atomic theory.

Leucippus&#x27;s atoms come in infinitely many forms and exist in constant motion, creating a deterministic world in which everything is caused by the collisions of atoms. Leucippus described the beginning of the cosmos as a vortex of atoms that formed the Earth, the Sun, the stars, and other celestial bodies. As Leucippus considered both atoms and the void to be infinite, he presumed that other worlds must exist as cosmoses are formed elsewhere. Leucippus and Democritus described the soul as an arrangement of spherical atoms, which are cycled through the body through respiration and create thought and sensory input.

The only records of Leucippus come from Aristotle and Theophrastus, ancient philosophers who lived after him, and little is known of his life. Most scholars agree that Leucippus existed, but some have questioned this, instead attributing his ideas purely to Democritus. Contemporary philosophers rarely distinguish their respective ideas. Two works are attributed to Leucippus (&quot;The Great World System&quot; and &quot;On Mind&quot;), but all of his writing has been lost with the exception of one sentence.

== Life ==
Almost nothing is known about the life of Leucippus. He was born in the first half of the 5th century BCE, and he presumably developed the philosophy of atomism during the 430s BCE, but the exact dates are unknown. Though he was a contemporary of the philosopher Socrates, Leucippus is categorized as a pre-Socratic philosopher because he continued the pre-Socratic tradition of physical inquiry that began with the Milesian philosophers. Leucippus is traditionally understood to have been a student of Zeno of Elea, though various ancient records have suggested Melissus of Samos, Parmenides, and Pythagoras as possible instructors of Leucippus. No students of Leucippus have been confirmed other than Democritus. Epicurus has been described as a student of Leucippus, but Epicurus has also been said to have denied the existence of Leucippus.

Miletus, Elea, and Abdera have all been suggested as places where Leucippus lived, but these are most likely described as his home city because of their associations with other philosophers: Miletus was associated with the Ionian School that influenced Leucippus, Elea was associated with the Eleatic philosophers whom Leucippus challenged, and Abdera was the home of his student Democritus. Some 20th-century classicists such as Walther Kranz and John Burnet have suggested that he lived in all three cities—that he was born in Miletus before studying under Zeno in Elea and then settling in Abdera.

== Philosophy ==
=== Atoms ===
Leucippus is credited with developing the philosophical school of atomism. He proposed that all things are made up of microscopic, indivisible particles that interact and combine to produce all the things of the world. The atoms postulated by Leucippus come in infinitely many shapes and sizes, although the size and shape of each atom is fixed and unchanging. They are in a state of constant motion and continuously change arrangements with one another. He reasoned that there must be infinite types of atoms because there is no reason why there should not be.

According to the 4th-century BCE philosopher Aristotle, Leucippus argued that logically there must be indivisible points in everything. His reasoning was that if an object was made entirely of divisible points, then it would not have any structure and it would be intangible. Leucippus developed atomism along with his student, Democritus; while Leucippus is credited with the philosophy&#x27;s creation, Democritus is understood to have elaborated upon it and applied it to natural phenomena.

Two works are attributed to Leucippus: &quot;The Great World System&quot; and &quot;On Mind&quot;. The former may have originally been titled &quot;The World System&quot; and then later renamed to avoid confusion with Democritus&#x27;s &quot;The Little World System&quot;. Leucippus&#x27;s &quot;The Great World System&quot; has sometimes been attributed to Democritus. Only one extant fragment is attributed to Leucippus, taken from &quot;On Mind&quot;: &quot;Nothing happens at random, but everything for a reason and by necessity&quot;. Leucippus believed that all things must happen deterministically, as the positions and motions of the atoms guarantee that they will collide in a certain way, invoking the principle of causality. This was reminiscent of the 6th-century BCE philosopher Anaximander&#x27;s argument that movement is created by differences, and it was later codified by the 17th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz with the principle of sufficient reason. Leucippus rejected the idea that there was an intelligent force governing the universe.

=== Eleatics and the void ===
Leucippus&#x27;s atomism was a direct response to Eleatic philosophy. The Eleatics believed that nothingness, or the void, cannot exist in its own right. They concluded that if there is no void, then there is no motion and all things must be one. Leucippus agreed with their logic, but he said that the void did exist, and he was therefore able to accept the existence of motion and plurality. Like the Eleatics, Leucippus believed that everything exists in an eternal state and nothing can come into or out of existence, applying this to both atoms and the void. Aristotle described Leucippus as saying that atoms are not an addition to the void, but that atoms and the void are two opposites that exist beside one another. The 6th-century CE philosopher Simplicius of Cilicia also wrote about this idea, but he attributed it to Democritus. According to the Christian author Lactantius, Leucippus compared atoms to the particles of floating dust that are visible in sunlight.

Leucippus&#x27;s atomism kept the concepts of reality developed by the Eleatics, but it applied them to a physical explanation of the world. By moving away from the abstract points and units of geometry, he formed a possible solution to the paradoxes of motion created by Zeno of Elea, which held that indivisibility made motion impossible. Leucippus also contested the Eleatic argument against divisibility: that any divider between two objects can also be divided. He argued that the void is a divider that does not have being and therefore cannot be divided. Though Leucippus described atoms as being able to touch one another, Aristotle understood this to mean atoms being near one another, as Leucippus maintained that the void must exist between all atoms.

=== Soul and perception ===
Leucippus and Democritus proposed that heat, fire, and the soul are made of spherical atoms, as this shape would let them move past one another and cause the others to move more efficiently. They believed in a physical soul that drives motion in living things, and they described respiration as the process of expelling soul atoms and absorbing new ones. Death then coincides with the last breath, as soul atoms are no longer being replenished. Sleep is a similar state in which a reduced number of soul atoms are in the body.

Leucippus was the first philosopher to describe a theory of thought and perception. He described sensory input as a transfer between atoms, created when external atoms come into contact with the atoms of the soul. Leucippus said that sight is caused by a film of atoms emitted from an object, maintaining the shapes of its atoms and creating a reflection of the object in the viewer&#x27;s eye. His description of vision was inspired by Empedocles, who formed a similar concept of objects emitting films of themselves. Leucippus posited that concepts such as color and texture are created by different arrangements of atoms, and that abstract concepts such as justice and wisdom are produced through the arrangement of soul atoms.

According to Epiphanius, Leucippus said that reasoned knowledge is impossible to obtain and only unreasoned belief exists. The 20th-century writer Constantine Vamvacas said that Leucippus rejected this belief, and that it was the Eleatic philosopher Parmenides who held it. According to Vamvacas, Leucippus and Democritus &quot;believe that sense experience, however limited, constitutes objective knowledge of the physical world&quot;. The 20th-century scholar C. C. W. Taylor said that &quot;we have no evidence to suggest that Leucippus was concerned with epistemological questions&quot;.

=== Cosmology ===
Leucippus said that the void extends infinitely, expanding across the entire universe. He also said that there is an infinite number of atoms, spread across the void. The Earth and the cosmos—including the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and anything else visible in the night sky—exist together in the void.

Leucippus said that the cosmos was created when a large group of atoms came together and swirled as a vortex. They shifted around each other until they were sorted &quot;like to like&quot;. The larger atoms gathered in the center while the smaller ones were pushed to the edge. The smaller atoms became the celestial bodies of the cosmos. The larger atoms in the center came together as a membrane from which the Earth was formed. Ancient writers disagreed about what Leucippus meant when he described the membrane: Aetius said that the smaller atoms were part of the membrane, encasing the larger atoms, but Diogenes Laertius said that the larger atoms formed a membrane themselves and the smaller ones were excluded. Leucippus also believed that there were distant cosmoses in other parts of the void; this makes him the first known philosopher to propose the existence of other worlds besides Earth, though some ancient doxographers have attributed these ideas to the earlier Ionian philosophers.

Like other pre-Socratic philosophers, Leucippus believed that the Earth was in the center of the cosmos. He said that the other celestial bodies orbited around the Earth, with the Moon being the closest to the Earth and the Sun being the farthest. He described the stars as orbiting the fastest. While initially &quot;moist and muddy&quot;, the stars dried and then ignited.

Leucippus adopted the idea of the Ionian philosophers that the Earth is flat. According to Aetius, Leucippus thought of the Earth as &quot;drum-shaped&quot;, with a flat surface and some degree of depth. He said that the flat Earth is tilted on its horizontal axis so that the south is lower than the north, explaining that the northern region is colder than the southern region, and the cold compacted air of the north can better support the Earth&#x27;s weight than the warm rarefied air of the south. Aetius also tells of Leucippus&#x27;s explanation for thunder: that it is caused by fire being compressed in clouds and then bursting out.

Many early philosophers were confused by the fact that earthly objects fell downward while celestial objects moved in a curved trajectory. This prompted many of them to believe in a non-earthly substance that composes the celestial bodies. With his model of the cosmos, Leucippus was able to justify why these entities move differently even though they are made of the same substance. Leucippus gave no explanation for how motion began, for which he was criticized by Aristotle. It is unclear whether Leucippus considered vorticies to arise by chance or as a deterministic outcome.

== Legacy ==

=== Ancient Greece ===
Modern understanding of Leucippus&#x27;s role in the development of atomism comes from the writings of the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Theophrastus. Aristotle&#x27;s 4th-century BCE record of Leucippus and Democritus&#x27;s philosophy is the oldest surviving source on the subject, though he did not distinguish who developed which atomist ideas. Aetius also wrote about Leucippus, but it was well after Leucippus&#x27;s own time and derivative of previous writings on the subject. Some later histories of philosophy omitted Leucippus entirely. Since ancient times, Leucippus has languished in obscurity compared to Democritus, and since the earliest records of atomist thought, it has been common practice to consider the ideas of Leucippus and Democritus collectively rather than attempting to distinguish them.

The atomist philosophy of Leucippus and Democritus influenced Greek philosophy for centuries, particularly in the work of Aristotle and Epicurus. Aristotle was critical of atomism. He questioned why stone should fall but fire should rise if they are both made of the same material. According to Diogenes Laertius, Diogenes of Apollonia&#x27;s interpretation of the void may have been inspired by Leucippus. Plato explored cosmological ideas similar to those of Leucippus in the dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot;.

=== Modern era ===
Ancient atomism was revived in the 16th and 17th centuries, especially by proponents of the mechanical philosophy such as Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) and Robert Boyle (1627–1691). Nevertheless, in practice experimental chemists such as Boyle rather relied on the tradition of corpuscularianism which had developed in medieval alchemy and ultimately goes back to works such as Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorology IV&quot;. Throughout the 18th century chemists worked independently from philosophical atomism, which only changed when John Dalton (1766–1844) proposed a form of atomism that was rooted in chemical experiment.

Although Leucippus&#x27; ideas form an important historical precedent for the concept of atoms in general, they only bear a superficial resemblance to modern atomic theory. Leucippus&#x27;s philosophy was conjecture based on &quot;a priori&quot; evidence, while modern atomic theory is supported by empirical evidence found through the scientific method. The main practical difference between Leucippus&#x27;s atomism and modern atomic theory is the introduction of non-tangible phenomena such as mass–energy equivalence and fundamental forces. Instead of the purely material atoms of Leucippus, modern atomic theory shows that fundamental forces combine subatomic particles into atoms and link atoms together into molecules. The 20th-century physicist Werner Heisenberg argued that Plato&#x27;s theory of forms was closer to the 20th-century understanding of physics than Leucippus&#x27;s conception of atoms, saying that modern atoms are more like the intangible Platonic forms than the discrete material units of Leucippus.

==== Scholarship on Leucippus ====

Modern philosophy generally takes more interest in Leucippus&#x27;s concept of atoms than his cosmology. Two major systems have been created to distinguish Leucippus and Democritus. The 20th-century philosopher developed a set of distinctions between Leucippus and Democritus: he proposed that Leucippus was responsible for the atomist response to the Eleatics while Democritus responded to the Sophists and that Leucippus was a cosmologist while Democritus was a polymath. The 20th-century classicist Cyril Bailey proposed another system to differentiate the two philosophers, attributing atomism and belief in the void to Leucippus while attributing &quot;The Great Cosmology&quot; to Democritus as an application of Leucippus&#x27;s philosophy. Unlike Democritus, Leucippus is only known to have studied cosmology and physics.

=== Historicity ===
According to Diogenes Laertius, Epicurus alleged that Leucippus never existed—an allegation that triggered extensive philosophical debate. Most modern philosophers agree that Leucippus existed, but there is disagreement on whether his work can be meaningfully distinguished from that of Democritus. In 2008, the philosopher Daniel Graham wrote that no significant work on the historicity of Leucippus has been produced since the early 20th century, arguing that &quot;recent scholarship tends to avoid the question as much as possible&quot;.

Scholars who maintain that Leucippus existed argue that he only taught orally or that any written works he produced were never meant for publication. The 20th-century classicist John Burnet proposed an alternate reading of Epicurus&#x27;s claims, according to which Epicurus may have been saying that Leucippus was not worth discussing as a philosopher, not that he literally did not exist. Supporting this argument is that Epicurus considered ethics to be foundational to philosophy, and Leucippus had no teachings on that subject. Among scholars who argue against Leucippus&#x27;s existence, alternate ideas have been proposed: Leucippus may have been a pseudonym of Democritus, or he may have been a character in a dialogue. Modern scholars who have rejected the existence of Leucippus include Erwin Rohde, Paul Natorp, Paul Tannery, P. Bokownew, , , , and Wilhelm Nestle.

The existence of Leucippus was an issue in 19th-century German philosophy, where it spawned a debate between Rohde, Natorp, and Hermann Alexander Diels. Rhode believed that even in the time of Epicurus there was no evidence of Leucippus&#x27;s existence, and there was therefore no purpose in attributing the atomism of Democritus to an unknown figure such as Leucippus, rejecting Theophrastus&#x27;s account. Natorp likewise rejected that Diogenes of Apollonia was preceded by Leucippus. Diels affirmed the account of Theophrastus and produced writings criticizing Rhode and Natorp. The problem was significant enough that it was given its own name in German: ().

<text>The League of Nations (LN or LoN; , SdN) was the first worldwide intergovernmental organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was founded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many of its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was created in the aftermath of World War II. As the template for modern global governance, the League profoundly shaped the modern world.

The League&#x27;s primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They included preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and settling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other concerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants, human and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war, and protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it became effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was granted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the start of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of the Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S. president Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading architect of the League.

The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France, Italy and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that &quot;the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.&quot;

At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States never joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain left in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute approach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further conflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy was the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy&#x27;s sanctions were only limited from the outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned despite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the Second World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary purpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its abolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations replaced it in 1946 and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.

Current scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic stabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the 1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were &quot;institutionalised&quot;, as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

==Origins==
===Background===
The concept of a peaceful community of nations had been proposed as early as 1795, when Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot; outlined the idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between states. Kant argued for the establishment of a peaceful world community, not in a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would declare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide. International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century in an attempt to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; between European states and so avoid war.

By 1910, international law developed, with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Theodore Roosevelt at the acceptance for his Nobel Prize in 1910, said: &quot;it would be a masterstroke if those great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace.&quot;

One small forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by the peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889 (and still exists as an international body focused on the world&#x27;s various elected legislative bodies). The IPU was founded with an international scope, with a third of the members of parliaments (in the 24 countries that had parliaments) serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its foundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means. Annual conferences were established to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. Its structure was designed as a council headed by a president, which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.

===Plans and proposals===

At the start of the First World War, the first schemes for an international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support, particularly in Great Britain and the United States. Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, a British political scientist, coined the term &quot;League of Nations&quot; in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation. Together with Lord Bryce, he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group, later the League of Nations Union. The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then-governing Liberal Party. In Dickinson&#x27;s 1915 pamphlet &quot;After the War&quot; he wrote of his &quot;League of Peace&quot; as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war, and thus, could write that, &quot;the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion.&quot; The &#x27;Proposals&#x27; of the Bryce Group were circulated widely, both in England and the US, where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement.
In January 1915, a peace conference directed by Jane Addams was held in the neutral United States. The delegates adopted a platform calling for creation of international bodies with administrative and legislative powers to develop a &quot;permanent league of neutral nations&quot; to work for peace and disarmament. Within months, a call was made for an international women&#x27;s conference to be held in The Hague. Coordinated by Mia Boissevain, Aletta Jacobs and Rosa Manus, the congress, which opened on 28 April 1915 was attended by 1,136 participants from neutral nations, and resulted in the establishment of an organisation which would become the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). At the close of the conference, two delegations of women were dispatched to meet European heads of state over the next several months. They secured agreement from reluctant foreign ministers, who overall felt that such a body would be ineffective, but agreed to participate in or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other nations agreed and if President Woodrow Wilson would initiate a body. In the midst of the War, Wilson refused.
In 1915, a body similar to the Bryce Group was set up in the United States, led by former president William Howard Taft. It was called the League to Enforce Peace. It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and the imposition of sanctions on aggressive countries. None of these early organisations envisioned a continuously functioning body; with the exception of the Fabian Society in England, they maintained a legalistic approach that would limit the international body to a court of justice. The Fabians were the first to argue for a &quot;council&quot; of states, necessarily the Great Powers, who would adjudicate world affairs, and for the creation of a permanent secretariat to enhance international co-operation across a range of activities.

In the course of the diplomatic efforts surrounding World War I, both sides had to clarify their long-term war aims. By 1916 in Britain, fighting on the side of the Allies, and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of David Lloyd George took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation. Wilson himself included in his Fourteen Points in January 1918 a &quot;league of nations to ensure peace and justice.&quot; British foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, argued that, as a condition of durable peace, &quot;behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.&quot;

The war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage. Several empires collapsed: first the Russian Empire in February 1917, followed by the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire. Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as &quot;the war to end all wars&quot;, and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.

In London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord Robert Cecil. The British committee was finally appointed in February 1918. It was led by Walter Phillimore (and became known as the Phillimore Committee), but also included Eyre Crowe, William Tyrrell, and Cecil Hurst. The recommendations of the so-called Phillimore Commission included the establishment of a &quot;Conference of Allied States&quot; that would arbitrate disputes and impose sanctions on offending states. The proposals were approved by the British government, and much of the commission&#x27;s results were later incorporated into the Covenant of the League of Nations.

The French authorities also drafted a much more far-reaching proposal in June 1918; they advocated annual meetings of a council to settle all disputes, as well as an &quot;international army&quot; to enforce its decisions.

American President Woodrow Wilson instructed Edward M. House to draft a US plan which reflected Wilson&#x27;s own idealistic views (first articulated in the Fourteen Points of January 1918), as well as the work of the Phillimore Commission. The outcome of House&#x27;s work and Wilson&#x27;s own first draft proposed the termination of &quot;unethical&quot; state behaviour, including forms of espionage and dishonesty. Methods of compulsion against recalcitrant states would include severe measures, such as &quot;blockading and closing the frontiers of that power to commerce or intercourse with any part of the world and to use any force that may be necessary...&quot;

The two principal drafters and architects of the covenant of the League of Nations were the British politician Lord Robert Cecil and the South African statesman Jan Smuts. Smuts&#x27;s proposals included the creation of a council of the great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the minor states. He also proposed the creation of a mandate system for captured colonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the administrative side and proposed annual council meetings and quadrennial meetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and permanent secretariat to carry out the League&#x27;s administrative duties.

According to historian Patricia Clavin, Cecil and the British continued their leadership of the development of a rules-based global order into the 1920s and 1930s, with a primary focus on the League of Nations. The British goal was to systematise and normalise the economic and social relations between states, markets, and civil society. They gave priority to business and banking issues, but also considered the needs of ordinary women, children and the family as well. They moved beyond high-level intellectual discussions, and set up local organisations to support the League. The British were particularly active in setting up junior branches for secondary students.

The League of Nations was relatively more universal and inclusive in its membership and structure than previous international organisations, but the organisation enshrined racial hierarchy by curtailing the right to self-determination and prevented decolonisation.

===Establishment===

At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Wilson, Cecil and Smuts all put forward their draft proposals. After lengthy negotiations between the delegates, the Hurst–Miller draft was finally produced as a basis for the Covenant. After more negotiation and compromise, the delegates finally approved of the proposal to create the League of Nations (, ) on 25 January 1919. The final Covenant of the League of Nations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919.

French women&#x27;s rights advocates invited international feminists to participate in a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain permission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women&#x27;s Conference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations and commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing specifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement and full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were ignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or delegates in the League of Nations organisation. They also won a declaration that member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and should equally support humane conditions for children, women and men labourers. At the Zürich Peace Conference held between 17 and 19 May 1919, the women of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both its punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of violence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon reading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall, a British suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely undemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.

The League would be made up of a Assembly (representing all member states), a Council (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent Secretariat. Member states were expected to &quot;respect and preserve as against external aggression&quot; the territorial integrity of other members and to disarm &quot;to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.&quot; All states were required to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going to war. The Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to make judgements on the disputes.

Despite Wilson&#x27;s efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1919, the United States never joined. Senate Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge wanted a League with the reservation that only Congress could take the U.S. into war. Lodge gained a majority of Senators and Wilson refused to allow a compromise. The Senate voted on the ratification on 19 March 1920, and the 49–35 vote fell short of the needed 2/3 majority.

The League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations came into force. On 1 November 1920, the headquarters of the League was moved from London to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920. Geneva made sense as an ideal city for the League, since Switzerland had been a neutral country for centuries and was already the headquarters for the International Red Cross. Its strong democracy and location in central Europe made it a good choice for the nations of the world. Support for Geneva as the selection came from Swiss Federal Councillor Gustave Ador and economist William Rappard. The Palais Wilson on Geneva&#x27;s western lakeshore, named after Woodrow Wilson, was the League&#x27;s first permanent home.

====Mission====
The covenant had ambiguities, as Carole Fink points out. There was not a good fit between Wilson&#x27;s &quot;revolutionary conception of the League as a solid replacement for a corrupt alliance system, a guardian of international order, and protector of small states,&quot; versus Lloyd George&#x27;s desire for a &quot;cheap, self-enforcing, peace, such as had been maintained by the old and more fluid Concert of Europe.&quot;
Furthermore, the League, according to Carole Fink, was, &quot;deliberately excluded from such great-power prerogatives as freedom of the seas and naval disarmament, the Monroe Doctrine and the internal affairs of the French and British empires, and inter-Allied debts and German reparations, not to mention the Allied intervention and the settlement of borders with Soviet Russia.&quot;

Although the United States never joined, unofficial observers became more and more involved, especially in the 1930s. American philanthropies became heavily involved, especially the Rockefeller Foundation. It made major grants designed to build up the technical expertise of the League staff. Ludovic Tournès argues that by the 1930s the foundations had changed the League from a &quot;Parliament of Nations&quot; to a modern think tank that used specialised expertise to provide an in-depth impartial analysis of international issues.

==Languages and symbols==
The official languages of the League of Nations were French and English.

During the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, a semi-official flag and emblem for the League of Nations emerged: two five-pointed stars within a blue pentagon. They symbolised the Earth&#x27;s five continents and &quot;five races&quot;. A bow at the top displayed the English name (&quot;League of Nations&quot;), while another at the bottom showed the French (&quot;Société des Nations&quot;).

==Membership==

The League consisted of 42 founding members in November 1920. Six other states joined in its founding year (by December 1920), and seven more joined by September 1924, bringing the League&#x27;s size to 55. Costa Rica withdrew in December 1924, making it the member to have most quickly withdrawn, and Brazil became the first founding member to withdraw in June 1926. Germany (under the Weimar Republic) was admitted to the League of Nations through a resolution passed on 8 September 1926. The League&#x27;s size remained at 54 for the next five years.

Through the first half of the 1930s, six more states joined, including Iraq in 1932 (newly independent from a League of Nations mandate) and the Soviet Union on 18 September 1934, but the Empire of Japan and Germany (under Hitler) withdrew in 1933. This marked the League&#x27;s largest extent at 58 member states.

In December 1920, Argentina quit (being absent from all sessions and votes) without formally withdrawing, on rejection of an Argentine resolution that all sovereign states would be admitted to the League. It resumed its participation in September 1933.

The League&#x27;s membership declined through the second half of the 1930s as it weakened. Between 1935 and the start of World War II in Europe in September 1939, only Egypt joined (becoming the last state to join), 11 members left, and 3 members ceased to exist or fell under military occupation (Ethiopia, Austria, and Czechoslovakia). The Soviet Union was expelled on 14 December 1939 for invading Finland, as one of the last acts of the League before it ceased functioning.

==Organization==
 
===Permanent organs===

The main constitutional organs of the League were the Assembly, the council, and the Permanent Secretariat. It also had two essential wings: the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Labour Organization. In addition, there were several auxiliary agencies and bodies. Each organ&#x27;s budget was allocated by the Assembly (the League was supported financially by its member states).

The relations between the assembly and the council and the competencies of each were for the most part not explicitly defined. Each body could deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the league or affecting peace in the world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred to either.

Unanimity was required for the decisions of both the assembly and the council, except in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the admission of new members. This requirement was a reflection of the league&#x27;s belief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the league sought a solution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.

The Permanent Secretariat, established at the seat of the League at Geneva, comprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the general secretary. Its principal sections were Political, Financial and Economics, Transit, Minorities and Administration (administering the Saar and Danzig), Mandates, Disarmament, Health, Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children), Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux, Legal, and Information. The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the League&#x27;s civil service. In 1931 the staff numbered 707.

The Assembly consisted of representatives of all members of the League, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote. It met in Geneva and, after its initial sessions in 1920, it convened once a year in September. The special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members, the periodical election of non-permanent members to the council, the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court, and control of the budget. In practice, the Assembly was the general directing force of League activities.

The Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly&#x27;s business. It began with four permanent members – Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan – and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly for a three-year term. The first non-permanent members were Belgium, Brazil, Greece, and Spain.

The composition of the Council was changed several times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926. Werner Dankwort of Germany pushed for his country to join the League; joining in 1926, Germany became the fifth permanent member of the Council. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven, and the Soviet Union was made a permanent member giving the council a total of fifteen members. The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.

===Other bodies===

The League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the Disarmament Commission, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Mandates Commission, the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation (precursor to UNESCO), the Permanent Central Opium Board, the Commission for Refugees, the Slavery Commission, and the Economic and Financial Organization. Three of these institutions were transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War: the International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the International Court of Justice), and the Health Organisation (restructured as the World Health Organization).

The Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget was provided by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions.

The International Labour Organization was created in 1919 on the basis of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. The ILO, although having the same members as the League and being subject to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference and its own Secretariat. Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers&#x27; and workers&#x27; organisations. Albert Thomas was its first director.

The ILO successfully restricted the addition of lead to paint, and convinced several countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working week. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase the rights of women in the workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen. After the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations in 1946.

The League&#x27;s Health Organisation had three bodies: the Health Bureau, containing permanent officials of the League; the General Advisory Council or Conference, an executive section consisting of medical experts; and the Health Committee. In practice, the Paris-based Office international d&#x27;hygiène publique (OIHP) founded in 1907 after the International Sanitary Conferences, was discharging most of the practical health-related questions, and its relations with the League&#x27;s Health Committee were often conflictual. The Health Committee&#x27;s purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League&#x27;s health work, and prepare work to be presented to the council. This body focused on ending leprosy, malaria, and yellow fever, the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent typhus epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.

Linked with health, but also commercial concerns, was the topic of narcotics control. Introduced by the second International Opium Convention, the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin. The board also established a system of import certificates and export authorisations for the legal international trade in narcotics.

The League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual cooperation since its creation. The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a committee on intellectual co-operation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee. The work of the committee included: an inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual cooperation, cooperation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.

The Slavery Commission sought to eradicate slavery and slave trading across the world, and fought forced prostitution. Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in those countries. The League secured a commitment from Ethiopia to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with Liberia to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery. The United Kingdom had not supported Ethiopian membership of the League on the grounds that &quot;Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission.&quot;

The League also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing the Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 per cent. Records were kept to control slavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children. Partly as a result of pressure brought by the League of Nations, Afghanistan abolished slavery in 1923, Iraq in 1924, Nepal in 1926, Transjordan and Persia in 1929, Bahrain in 1937, and Ethiopia in 1942.
Led by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was established on 27 June 1921 to look after the interests of refugees, including overseeing their repatriation and, when necessary, resettlement. At the end of the First World War, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations dispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission&#x27;s foundation, it had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in 1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent the spread of cholera, smallpox and dysentery as well as feeding the refugees in the camps. It also established the Nansen passport as a means of identification for stateless people.

The Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women sought to inquire into the status of women all over the world. It was formed in 1937, and later became part of the United Nations as the Commission on the Status of Women.

The Covenant of the League said little about economics. Nonetheless, in 1920 the Council of the League called for a financial conference. The First Assembly at Geneva provided for the appointment of an Economic and Financial Advisory Committee to provide information to the conference. In 1923, a permanent Economic and Financial Organisation came into being. The existing bilateral treaty regime was integrated into the League where the most-favoured-nation norm was codified and the League took on responsibilities related to international oversight and standardisation.

==Mandates==

At the end of the First World War, the Allied Powers were confronted with the question of the disposal of the former German colonies in Africa and the Pacific, and the several Arabic-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Many British and French leaders wanted to annex colonies of the defeated Central Powers, but U.S. President Woodrow Wilson strongly insisted that instead of annexation, these territories should be assisted under League of Nations supervision in achieving self-governance and eventual independence depending on the inhabitants&#x27; choices.

The Paris Peace Conference compromised with Wilson by adopting the principle that these territories should be administered by different governments on behalf of the League – a system of national responsibility subject to international supervision. This plan, defined as the mandate system, was adopted by the &quot;Council of Ten&quot; (the heads of government and foreign ministers of the main Allied Powers: Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations.

League of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates, and also organised plebiscites in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join. There were three mandate classifications: A, B and C.

The A mandates (applied to parts of the old Ottoman Empire) were &quot;certain communities&quot; that had 

The B mandates were applied to the former German colonies that the League took responsibility for after the First World War. These were described as &quot;peoples&quot; that the League said were 

South West Africa and certain South Pacific Islands were administered by League members under C mandates. These were classified as &quot;territories&quot; 

===Mandatory powers===
The territories were governed by mandatory powers, such as the United Kingdom in the case of the Mandate of Palestine, and the Union of South Africa in the case of South-West Africa, until the territories were deemed capable of self-government. Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. With the exception of the Kingdom of Iraq, which joined the League on 3 October 1932, most of these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990. Following the demise of the League, most of the remaining mandates became United Nations Trust Territories.

In addition to the mandates, the League itself governed the Territory of the Saar Basin for 15 years, before it was returned to Germany following a plebiscite, and the Free City of Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland) from 15 November 1920 to 1 September 1939.

==Resolving territorial disputes==
The aftermath of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied Powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allied Powers tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.

As the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and the Soviet Union, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League&#x27;s machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.

===Åland Islands===

Åland is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between Sweden and Finland. The islands are almost exclusively Swedish-speaking, but in 1809, the Åland Islands, along with Finland, were taken by Imperial Russia. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, Finland declared its independence, but most of the Ålanders wished to rejoin Sweden. The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included Åland in the Grand Duchy of Finland, formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League of Nations Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created. In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden&#x27;s reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.

===Upper Silesia===

The Allied powers referred the problem of Upper Silesia to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute between Poland and Germany. In 1919 Poland voiced a claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921.

On 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation. The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas – for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas. In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region&#x27;s mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.

===Albania===
The frontiers of the Principality of Albania had not been set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide. They had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.

The borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 27 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader Benito Mussolini was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy Lire50 million in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.

Mussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces occupied the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League of Nations Covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allied Powers agreed (at Mussolini&#x27;s insistence) that the Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League of Nations Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League&#x27;s recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.

===Memel===

The port city of Memel (now Klaipėda) and the surrounding area, with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city, while Lithuania wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allied Powers failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League of Nations Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied Powers and Lithuania. In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the Nazis and an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.

===Hatay===

With League oversight, the Sanjak of Alexandretta in the French Mandate of Syria was given autonomy in 1937. Renamed Hatay, its parliament declared independence as the Republic of Hatay in September 1938, after elections the previous month. It was annexed by Turkey with French consent in mid-1939.

===Mosul===

The League resolved a dispute between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey over control of the former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), it rejected the decision, questioning the Council&#x27;s authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.

===Vilnius===

After the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes. During the Polish–Soviet War, Lithuania signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Russia that laid out Lithuania&#x27;s frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of Vilnius (, ), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population. This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the Polish–Lithuanian War, and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the Suwałki Agreement establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations. On 9 October 1920, General Lucjan Żeligowski, commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwałki Agreement, took the city and established the Republic of Central Lithuania.

After a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League of Nations Council called for Poland&#x27;s withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Russia, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth which the two nations had shared before losing their independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus &quot;de facto&quot; accepted the borders.

===Colombia and Peru===

There were several border conflicts between Colombia and Peru in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the Salomón-Lozano Treaty in an attempt to resolve them. As part of this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River. On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia. At first, the Peruvian government did not recognise the military takeover, but President of Peru Luis Sánchez Cerro decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations. After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded. In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and Putumayo Rivers, and a pledge of non-aggression.

===Saar===

Saar was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the Rhenish Palatinate and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League of Nations Council.

==Other conflicts==
In addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.

===Greece and Bulgaria===

After an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries. Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League condemned the Greek invasion, and called for both Greek withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria.

===Liberia===
Following accusations of forced labour on the large American-owned Firestone rubber plantation and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of slavery and forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia and led to the resignation of President Charles D. B. King and his vice-president. The Liberian government outlawed forced labour and slavery and asked for American help in social reforms.

===Mukden Incident===
The Mukden Incident, also known as the &quot;Manchurian Incident&quot;, was a decisive setback that weakened the League because its major members refused to tackle Japanese aggression. Japan itself withdrew.

Under the agreed terms of the Twenty-One Demands with China, the Japanese government had the right to station its troops in the area around the South Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between China and Korea (then a Japanese colony), in the Chinese region of Manchuria. In September 1931, a section of the railway was lightly damaged by the Japanese Kwantung Army as a pretext for an invasion of Manchuria. The Japanese army claimed that Chinese soldiers had sabotaged the railway and in apparent retaliation (acting contrary to orders from Tokyo) occupied all of Manchuria. They renamed the area Manchukuo, and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with Puyi, the final emperor of China, as its nominal head of state.

The League of Nations sent observers. The Lytton Report appeared a year later (October 1932). It refused to recognise Manchukuo and demanded Manchuria be returned to China. The report passed 42–1 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League. In the end, as British historian Charles Mowat argued, collective security was dead:
:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.

===Chaco War===

The League failed to prevent the 1932 war between Bolivia and Paraguay over the arid Gran Chaco region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the Paraguay River, which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean, and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum. Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio López at Lake Pitiantuta. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million. It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a ceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, Paraguay had seized control of most of the region, as was later recognised by the 1938 truce.

Initially, both sides refused to allow the League to conduct an inquiry until November 1933, over a year after the start of the war. As a result, the League did not formally invoke Article 16 to apply sanctions. The Pan-American Conference offered to mediate and the League deferred to the conference, but the warring sides ignored the conference. Eventually (without going through Article 16), an arms embargo was enacted by several members of the League (plus non-League members the United States and Brazil), but several neighbouring states ignored the embargo rendering it ineffective. In November 1934, the League demanded that both sides withdraw and undergo arbitration. Bolivia accepted, but Paraguay by then had taken control of all of the disputed area. Paraguay rejected arbitration and quit the League.

===Italian invasion of Abyssinia===
In October 1935, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini sent 400,000 troops to invade Abyssinia (Ethiopia). Marshal Pietro Badoglio led the campaign from November 1935, ordering bombing, the use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas, and the poisoning of water supplies, against targets which included undefended villages and medical facilities. The modern Italian Army defeated the poorly armed Abyssinians and captured Addis Ababa in May 1936, forcing Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie to flee to exile in England.

The League of Nations condemned Italy&#x27;s aggression and imposed economic sanctions in November 1935, but the sanctions were largely ineffective since they did not ban the sale of oil or close the Suez Canal (controlled by Britain). As Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister, later observed, this was ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an Italian attack. In October 1935, the US president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, invoked the recently passed Neutrality Acts and placed an embargo on arms and munitions to both sides, but extended a further &quot;moral embargo&quot; to the belligerent Italians, including other trade items. On 5 October and later on 29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to limit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels. The League sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point, Italy had already gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.

The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was an attempt by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the conflict in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.

The Abyssinian crisis showed how the League could be influenced by the self-interest of its members; one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and Adolf Hitler into an alliance.

===Spanish Civil War===

On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army launched a coup d&#x27;état, leading to a prolonged armed conflict between Spanish Republicans (the elected leftist national government) and the Nationalists (conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army). Julio Álvarez del Vayo, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain&#x27;s territorial integrity and political independence. The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. Adolf Hitler and Mussolini aided General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban foreign volunteers, but this was in practice a symbolic move. The result was a Nationalist victory in 1939 and confirmation to all observers that the League was ineffective in dealing with a major issue.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===

Following a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937. On 12 September, the Chinese representative, Wellington Koo, appealed to the League for international intervention. Western countries were sympathetic to the Chinese in their struggle, particularly in their stubborn defence of Shanghai, a city with a substantial number of foreigners. The League was unable to provide any practical measures; on 4 October, it turned the case over to the Nine Power Treaty Conference.

===Soviet invasion of Finland===

The Nazi-Soviet Pact of 23 August 1939 contained secret protocols outlining spheres of interest. Finland and the Baltic states, as well as eastern Poland, fell into the Soviet sphere. After invading Poland on 17 September 1939, on 30 November the Soviets invaded Finland. Then &quot;the League of Nations for the first time expelled a member who had violated the Covenant.&quot; The League action of 14 December 1939, stung, because the Soviet Union became &quot;the only League member ever to suffer such an indignity&quot;.

==Failure of disarmament==

Article 8 of the Covenant gave the League the task of reducing &quot;armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations&quot;. Haakon Ikonomou argues that the Disarmament Section was a major failure. It was distrusted by the great powers, and given little autonomy by the Secretariat. Its mediocre staffers generated information that was unreliable and caused unrealistic expectations in the general public.

===Successes===
The League scored some successes, including the 1925 Conference for the Supervision of the International Trade in Arms and Ammunition and in Implements of War. It started to collect international arms data. Most important was the passage in 1925 of the Geneva protocol banning poison gas in war. It reflected strong worldwide public opinion, although the United States did not ratify it until 1975.

===Failures===
The League had numerous failures and shortfalls. In 1921, it set up the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments to explore possibilities for disarmament. It was made up not of government representatives but of famous individuals. They rarely agreed. Proposals ranged from abolishing chemical warfare and strategic bombing to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks.

====1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance====

The 1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance was an unsuccessful proposal made by the League of Nations to address the issue of disarmament and security in Europe after World War I. It was rejected by the British government in 1924 and was never adopted. The Draft Treaty was an early attempt by the League to create a system of collective security and disarmament, leading the League to pursue alternative approaches that also ultimately failed to gain traction.

====Geneva Protocol of 1924====
A draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by Great Britain, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police its British Empire.

The &quot;Geneva Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes&quot; was a proposal by British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald and his French counterpart Édouard Herriot. It set up compulsory arbitration of disputes and created a method to determine the aggressor in international conflicts. All legal disputes between nations would be submitted to the World Court. It called for a disarmament conference in 1925. Any government that refused to comply in a dispute would be named an aggressor. Any victim of aggression was to receive immediate assistance from League members.

British Conservatives condemned the proposal for fear that it would lead to conflict with the United States, which also opposed the proposal. The British Dominions strongly opposed it. The Conservatives came to power in Britain and in March 1925 the proposal was shelved and never reintroduced.

====World Disarmament Conference====

The Allied powers were also under obligation by the Treaty of Versailles to attempt to disarm, and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had been described as the first step toward worldwide disarmament. The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932–1934 World Disarmament Conference. Members of the League held different views towards the issue. The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and Czechoslovakia felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League&#x27;s response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed. Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became German Chancellor in 1933. In particular, Germany&#x27;s attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.

The World Disarmament Conference was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states. It was a failure. A one-year moratorium on the expansion of armaments, later extended by a few months, was proposed at the start of the conference. The Disarmament Commission obtained initial agreement from France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Britain to limit the size of their navies but no final agreement was reached. Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s.

====Helpless during buildup to World War II====
The League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler&#x27;s remilitarisation of the Rhineland, occupation of the Sudetenland and &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria, which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy in 1937, and Spain in 1939. The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after it invaded Finland.

==Economic policies==
=== International taxation ===
The intellectual foundation of the modern international taxation regime was set with a 1923 report prepared by prominent political economists and tax law experts for the League of Nations. The report formulated &quot;general principles&quot; to avoid the adverse effects of double taxation and encourage free trade, international capital flows, and economic growth. For example, the report tried to set guidelines for resolving who would be allowed to tax a resident or citizen of one state when that individual earned income in another state. Prior to the publication of the report, these kinds of questions were primarily decided through unilateral state decisions or bilateral tax treaties.

==General weaknesses==

The onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States&#x27; refusal to join.

===Origins and structure===
The origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a &quot;League of Victors&quot;. The League&#x27;s neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries and (by enforcing unanimous voting) had effectively given themselves veto power.

===Global representation===
Representation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League&#x27;s formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the Nazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with international incidents. The structure of the US federal government might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League would only be able to answer on behalf of the executive branch, certain League decisions such as to go to war, would always require prior approval of the legislative branch regardless of the outcome of any floor vote even.

In January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. Soviet Russia was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the ongoing Russian Civil War in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria. Italy also began as a permanent member of the council. However the League staunchly opposed Italy&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia in 1934. When the war ended in an Italian conquest, the League refused to recognise Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia, prompting the Italian-Fascist government to withdraw from the organisation altogether in 1937. Though neutral during World War I, Spain (then still a kingdom) also began as a permanent member of the council, but withdrew in 1939 after the Spanish Civil War ended in a victory for the Nationalists. Though world opinion was much more divided over the Spanish Civil War than the conflicts involving Japan and Italy, the general perception leaned in favour of the Republican cause. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the council, in 1926, deeming it to have become a &quot;peace-loving country&quot; under the Weimar Republic. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler withdrew Germany almost immediately.

===Collective security===
Another important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of collective security that formed the basis of the League and international relations between individual states. The League&#x27;s collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their national interests, to support states for which they had no normal affinity. This weakness was exposed during the Abyssinia Crisis, when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe &quot;to defend against the enemies of internal order&quot;, in which Italy&#x27;s support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.

On 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy&#x27;s war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, told the House of Commons that collective security had 

Ultimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of appeasement in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.
In this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, France. This debate established precedents regarding global surveillance (in the form of routine international sharing of surveillance data), the punishment of terrorists as an international (rather than national) matter, and the right of a nation to conduct military attacks within another nation as a response to international terrorism. Many of these concepts are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after 9/11.

American diplomatic historian Samuel Flagg Bemis originally supported the League, but after two decades changed his mind:

The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.

===Pacifism, disarmament and radio===
The League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do. Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, pacifism became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The British Conservatives were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation. Moreover, the League&#x27;s advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.

David Goodman argues that the 1936 League of Nations Convention on the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace tried to create the standards for a liberal international public sphere. The Convention encouraged friendly radio broadcasts to other nations. It called for League prohibitions on international broadcasts containing hostile speech and false claims. It tried to draw the line between liberal and illiberal policies in communications, and emphasised the dangers of nationalist chauvinism. With Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia active on the radio, its liberal goals were ignored, while liberals warned that the code represented restraints on free speech.

==Demise and legacy==
As the situation in Europe escalated into war, the Assembly transferred enough power to the Secretary General on 30 September 1938 and 14 December 1939 to allow the League to continue to exist legally and carry on reduced operations. The headquarters of the League, the Palace of Nations, remained unoccupied for nearly six years until the Second World War ended.

At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers agreed to create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations. Many League bodies, such as the International Labour Organization, continued to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN. The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more effective than the League.

The final session of the League of Nations concluded on 18 April 1946 in Geneva. Delegates from 34 nations attended the assembly. This session concerned itself with liquidating the League: it transferred assets worth approximately $22,000,000 (U.S.) in 1946 (including the Palace of Nations and the League&#x27;s archives) to the UN, returned reserve funds to the nations that had supplied them, and settled the debts of the League. Robert Cecil, addressing the final session, said:
The Assembly passed a resolution that &quot;With effect from the day following the close of the present session of the Assembly [i.e., April 19], the League of Nations shall cease to exist except for the sole purpose of the liquidation of its affairs as provided in the present resolution.&quot; A Board of Liquidation consisting of nine persons from different countries spent the next 15 months overseeing the transfer of the League&#x27;s assets and functions to the United Nations or specialised bodies, finally dissolving itself on 31 July 1947. The archive of the League of Nations was transferred to the United Nations Office at Geneva and is now an entry in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

In the Assembly&#x27;s last session in 1946, Philip Noel-Baker (representing the United Kingdom) remarked that failure to act as soon as a great power had invaded another state had ultimately doomed the League: &quot;We know the World War began in Manchuria 15 years ago...Manchuria, Abyssinia, Munich have killed another great illusion, the belief that appeasement, seeking the national interest at the expense of others, individual action, secret bargains, could bring us peace.&quot;

In the past few decades, by research using the League Archives at Geneva, historians have reviewed the legacy of the League of Nations as the United Nations has faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation. Erez Manela situated the League as a catalyst for transforming the postwar global order into one critical of the arrangements of empire. Alternatively, Laura Robson &amp; Joe Maiolo posit the argument that the Mandate System under the League was a re-vitalised form of imperialism that placed former colonies under the ownership of greater powers.

Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when international affairs were &quot;institutionalised&quot;, as opposed to the pre–First World War methods of law and politics.

The principal Allies in the Second World War (the UK, the USSR, France, the U.S., and the Republic of China) became permanent members of the United Nations Security Council in 1946; in 1971, the People&#x27;s Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (then only in control of Taiwan) as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and in 1991 the Russian Federation assumed the seat of the dissolved USSR. Decisions of the Security Council are binding on all members of the UN, and unanimous decisions are not required, unlike in the League Council. Only the five permanent members of the Security Council can wield a veto to protect their vital interests.

== League of Nations archives ==

The League of Nations archives is a collection of the League&#x27;s records and documents. It consists of approximately 15 million pages of content dating from the inception of the League of Nations in 1919 extending through its dissolution in 1946. It is located at the United Nations Office at Geneva. In 2017, the UN Library &amp; Archives Geneva launched the Total Digital Access to the League of Nations Archives Project (LONTAD), with the intention of preserving, digitising, and providing online access to the League of Nations archives. It was completed in 2022.

<text>Logic programming is a programming, database and knowledge representation paradigm based on formal logic. A logic program is a set of sentences in logical form, representing knowledge about some problem domain. Computation is performed by applying logical reasoning to that knowledge, to solve problems in the domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of &quot;clauses&quot;:

:codice_1

and are read as declarative sentences in logical form:

:codice_2

codice_3 is called the &quot;head&quot; of the rule, codice_4, ..., codice_5 is called the &quot;body&quot;, and the codice_6 are called &quot;literals&quot; or conditions. When n = 0, the rule is called a &quot;fact&quot; and is written in the simplified form:

:codice_7

Queries (or goals) have the same syntax as the bodies of rules and are commonly written in the form:

:codice_8

In the simplest case of Horn clauses (or &quot;definite&quot; clauses), all of the A, B1, ..., Bn are atomic formulae of the form p(t1 ..., tm), where p is a predicate symbol naming a relation, like &quot;motherhood&quot;, and the ti are terms naming objects (or individuals). Terms include both constant symbols, like &quot;charles&quot;, and variables, such as X, which start with an upper case letter.

Consider, for example, the following Horn clause program:

mother_child(elizabeth, charles).
father_child(charles, william).
father_child(charles, harry).
parent_child(X, Y) :- 
 mother_child(X, Y).
parent_child(X, Y) :- 
 father_child(X, Y).
grandparent_child(X, Y) :- 
 parent_child(X, Z), 
 parent_child(Z, Y).

Given a query, the program produces answers.
For instance for a query codice_9, the single answer is

X = charles

Various queries can be asked. For instance
the program can be queried both to generate grandparents and to generate grandchildren. It can even be used to generate all pairs of grandchildren and grandparents, or simply to check if a given pair is such a pair:

grandparent_child(X, william).
X = elizabeth

?- grandparent_child(elizabeth, Y).
Y = william;
Y = harry.

?- grandparent_child(X, Y).
X = elizabeth
Y = william;
X = elizabeth
Y = harry.

?- grandparent_child(william, harry).
no
?- grandparent_child(elizabeth, harry).
yes
Although Horn clause logic programs are Turing complete, for most practical applications, Horn clause programs need to be extended to &quot;normal&quot; logic programs with negative conditions. For example, the definition of sibling uses a negative condition, where the predicate = is defined by the clause codice_10:

sibling(X, Y) :- 
 parent_child(Z, X), 
 parent_child(Z, Y), 
 not(X = Y).

Logic programming languages that include negative conditions have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.

In ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures. From this point of view, clause A :- B1...,Bn is understood as:

:to solve codice_3, solve codice_4, and ... and solve codice_5.

Negative conditions in the bodies of clauses also have a procedural interpretation, known as &quot;negation as failure&quot;: A negative literal codice_14 is deemed to hold if and only if the positive literal codice_15 fails to hold.

Much of the research in the field of logic programming has been concerned with trying to develop a logical semantics for negation as failure and with developing other semantics and other implementations for negation. These developments have been important, in turn, for supporting the development of formal methods for logic-based program verification and program transformation.

==History==
The use of mathematical logic to represent and execute computer programs is also a feature of the lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. However, the first proposal to use the clausal form of logic for representing computer programs was made by Cordell Green. This used an axiomatization of a subset of LISP, together with a representation of an input-output relation, to compute the relation by simulating the execution of the program in LISP. Foster and Elcock&#x27;s Absys, on the other hand, employed a combination of equations and lambda calculus in an assertional programming language that places no constraints on the order in which operations are performed.

Logic programming, with its current syntax of facts and rules, can be traced back to debates in the late 1960s and early 1970s about declarative versus procedural representations of knowledge in artificial intelligence. Advocates of declarative representations were notably working at Stanford, associated with John McCarthy, Bertram Raphael and Cordell Green, and in Edinburgh, with John Alan Robinson (an academic visitor from Syracuse University), Pat Hayes, and Robert Kowalski. Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT, under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.

Although it was based on the proof methods of logic, Planner, developed by Carl Hewitt at MIT, was the first language to emerge within this proceduralist paradigm. Planner featured pattern-directed invocation of procedural plans from goals (i.e. goal-reduction or backward chaining) and from assertions (i.e. forward chaining). The most influential implementation of Planner was the subset of Planner, called Micro-Planner, implemented by Gerry Sussman, Eugene Charniak and Terry Winograd. Winograd used Micro-Planner to implement the landmark, natural-language understanding program SHRDLU. For the sake of efficiency, Planner used a backtracking control structure so that only one possible computation path had to be stored at a time. Planner gave rise to the programming languages QA4, Popler, Conniver, QLISP, and the concurrent language Ether.

Hayes and Kowalski in Edinburgh tried to reconcile the logic-based declarative approach to knowledge representation with Planner&#x27;s procedural approach. Hayes (1973) developed an equational language, Golux, in which different procedures could be obtained by altering the behavior of the theorem prover.

In the meanwhile, Alain Colmerauer in Marseille was working on natural-language understanding, using logic to represent semantics and using resolution for question-answering. During the summer of 1971, Colmerauer invited Kowalski to Marseille, and together they discovered that the clausal form of logic could be used to represent formal grammars and that resolution theorem provers could be used for parsing. They observed that some theorem provers, like hyper-resolution, behave as bottom-up parsers and others, like SL resolution (1971) behave as top-down parsers.

It was in the following summer of 1972, that Kowalski, again working with Colmerauer, developed the procedural interpretation of implications in clausal form. It also became clear that such clauses could be restricted to definite clauses or Horn clauses, and that SL-resolution could be restricted (and generalised) to SLD resolution. Kowalski&#x27;s procedural interpretation and SLD were described in a 1973 memo, published in 1974.

Colmerauer, with Philippe Roussel, used the procedural interpretation as the basis of Prolog, which was implemented in the summer and autumn of 1972. The first Prolog program, also written in 1972 and implemented in Marseille, was a French question-answering system. The use of Prolog as a practical programming language was given great momentum by the development of a compiler by David H. D. Warren in Edinburgh in 1977. Experiments demonstrated that Edinburgh Prolog could compete with the processing speed of other symbolic programming languages such as Lisp. Edinburgh Prolog became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard and strongly influenced the definition of ISO standard Prolog.

Logic programming gained international attention during the 1980s, when it was chosen by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry to develop the software for the Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) project. The FGCS project aimed to use logic programming to develop advanced Artificial Intelligence applications on massively parallel computers. Although the project initially explored the use of Prolog, it later adopted the use of concurrent logic programming, because it was closer to the FGCS computer architecture.

However, the committed choice feature of concurrent logic programming interfered with the language&#x27;s logical semantics and with its suitability for knowledge representation and problem solving applications. Moreover, the parallel computer systems developed in the project failed to compete with advances taking place in the development of more conventional, general-purpose computers. Together these two issues resulted in the FGCS project failing to meet its objectives. Interest in both logic programming and AI fell into world-wide decline.

In the meanwhile, more declarative logic programming approaches, including those based on the use of Prolog, continued to make progress independently of the FGCS project. In particular, although Prolog was developed to combine declarative and procedural representations of knowledge, the purely declarative interpretation of logic programs became the focus for applications in the field of deductive databases. Work in this field became prominent around 1977, when Hervé Gallaire and Jack Minker organized a workshop on logic and databases in Toulouse. The field was eventually renamed as &quot;Datalog&quot;.

This focus on the logical, declarative reading of logic programs was given further impetus by the development of constraint logic programming in the 1980s and Answer Set Programming in the 1990s. It is also receiving renewed emphasis in recent applications of Prolog

The Association for Logic Programming (ALP) was founded in 1986 to promote Logic Programming. Its official journal until 2000, was &quot;The Journal of Logic Programming&quot;. Its founding editor-in-chief was J. Alan Robinson. In 2001, the journal was renamed &quot;The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming&quot;, and the official journal of ALP became &quot;Theory and Practice of Logic Programming&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press.

==Concepts==
Logic programs enjoy a rich variety of semantics and problem solving methods, as well as a wide range of applications in programming, databases, knowledge representation and problem solving.

===Algorithm = Logic + Control===
The procedural interpretation of logic programs, which uses backward reasoning to reduce goals to subgoals, is a special case of the use of a problem-solving strategy to control the use of a declarative, logical representation of knowledge to obtain the behaviour of an algorithm. More generally, different problem-solving strategies can be applied to the same logical representation to obtain different algorithms. Alternatively, different algorithms can be obtained with a given problem-solving strategy by using different logical representations.

The two main problem-solving strategies are backward reasoning (goal reduction) and forward reasoning, also known as top-down and bottom-up reasoning, respectively.

In the simple case of a propositional Horn clause program and a top-level atomic goal, backward reasoning determines an and-or tree, which constitutes the search space for solving the goal. The top-level goal is the root of the tree. Given any node in the tree and any clause whose head matches the node, there exists a set of child nodes corresponding to the sub-goals in the body of the clause. These child nodes are grouped together by an &quot;and&quot;. The alternative sets of children corresponding to alternative ways of solving the node are grouped together by an &quot;or&quot;.

Any search strategy can be used to search this space. Prolog uses a sequential, last-in-first-out, backtracking strategy, in which only one alternative and one sub-goal are considered at a time. For example, subgoals can be solved in parallel, and clauses can also be tried in parallel. The first strategy is called &#x27; and the second strategy is called &#x27;. Other search strategies, such as intelligent backtracking, or best-first search to find an optimal solution, are also possible.

In the more general, non-propositional case, where sub-goals can share variables, other strategies can be used, such as choosing the subgoal that is most highly instantiated or that is sufficiently instantiated so that only one procedure applies. Such strategies are used, for example, in concurrent logic programming.

In most cases, backward reasoning from a query or goal is more efficient than forward reasoning. But sometimes with Datalog and Answer Set Programming, there may be no query that is separate from the set of clauses as a whole, and then generating all the facts that can be derived from the clauses is a sensible problem-solving strategy. Here is another example, where forward reasoning beats backward reasoning in a more conventional computation task, where the goal codice_16 is to find the nth fibonacci number:

fibonacci(0, 0).
fibonacci(1, 1).

fibonacci(N, Result) :-
 N &gt; 1,
 N1 is N - 1,
 N2 is N - 2,
 fibonacci(N1, F1),
 fibonacci(N2, F2),
 Result is F1 + F2. 
Here the relation codice_17 stands for the function codice_18, and the predicate codice_19 is Prolog notation for the predicate that instantiates the variable codice_20 to the value of codice_21.

Given the goal of computing the fibonacci number of codice_22, backward reasoning reduces the goal to the two subgoals of computing the fibonacci numbers of n-1 and n-2. It reduces the subgoal of computing the fibonacci number of n-1 to the two subgoals of computing the fibonacci numbers of n-2 and n-3, redundantly computing the fibonacci number of n-2. This process of reducing one fibonacci subgoal to two fibonacci subgoals continues until it reaches the numbers 0 and 1. Its complexity is of the order 2n. In contrast, forward reasoning generates the sequence of fibonacci numbers, starting from 0 and 1 without any recomputation, and its complexity is linear with respect to n.

Prolog cannot perform forward reasoning directly. But it can achieve the effect of forward reasoning within the context of backward reasoning by means of tabling: Subgoals are maintained in a table, along with their solutions. If a subgoal is re-encountered, it is solved directly by using the solutions already in the table, instead of re-solving the subgoals redundantly.

=== Relationship with functional programming ===

Logic programming can be viewed as a generalisation of functional programming, in which functions are a special case of relations.
For example, the function, mother(X) = Y, (every X has only one mother Y) can be represented by the relation mother(X, Y). In this respect, logic programs are similar to relational databases, which also represent functions as relations.

Compared with relational syntax, functional syntax is more compact for nested functions. For example, in functional syntax the definition of maternal grandmother can be written in the nested form:

maternal_grandmother(X) = mother(mother(X)).

The same definition in relational notation needs to be written in the unnested, flattened form:

maternal_grandmother(X, Y) :- mother(X, Z), mother(Z, Y).
However, nested syntax can be regarded as syntactic sugar for unnested syntax. Ciao Prolog, for example, transforms functional syntax into relational form and executes the resulting logic program using the standard Prolog execution strategy. Moreover, the same transformation can be used to execute nested relations that are not functional. For example:
 
grandparent(X) := parent(parent(X)).
parent(X) := mother(X).
parent(X) := father(X).

mother(charles) := elizabeth.
father(charles) := phillip.
mother(harry) := diana.
father(harry) := charles.

?- grandparent(X,Y).
X = harry,
Y = elizabeth.
X = harry,
Y = phillip.
=== Relationship with relational programming ===
The term &quot;relational programming&quot; has been used to cover a variety of programming languages that treat functions as a special case of relations. Some of these languages, such as miniKanren
and relational linear programming
are logic programming languages in the sense of this article.

However, the relational language RML is an imperative programming language
 whose core construct is a
relational expression, which is similar to an expression in first-order predicate logic.

Other relational programming languages are based on the relational calculus or relational algebra.

=== Semantics of Horn clause programs ===

Viewed in purely logical terms, there are two approaches to the declarative semantics of Horn clause logic programs: One approach is the original &quot;logical consequence semantics&quot;, which understands solving a goal as showing that the goal is a theorem that is true in all models of the program.

In this approach, computation is theorem-proving in first-order logic; and both backward reasoning, as in SLD resolution, and forward reasoning, as in hyper-resolution, are correct and complete theorem-proving methods. Sometimes such theorem-proving methods are also regarded as providing a separate proof-theoretic (or operational) semantics for logic programs. But from a logical point of view, they are proof methods, rather than semantics.

The other approach to the declarative semantics of Horn clause programs is the &quot;satisfiability semantics&quot;, which understands solving a goal as showing that the goal is true (or satisfied) in some intended (or standard) model of the program. For Horn clause programs, there always exists such a standard model: It is the unique &quot;minimal model&quot; of the program.

Informally speaking, a minimal model is a model that, when it is viewed as the set of all (variable-free) facts that are true in the model, contains no smaller set of facts that is also a model of the program.

For example, the following facts represent the minimal model of the family relationships example in the introduction of this article. All other variable-free facts are false in the model:
mother_child(elizabeth, charles).
father_child(charles, william).
father_child(charles, harry).
parent_child(elizabeth, charles).
parent_child(charles, william).
parent_child(charles, harry).
grandparent_child(elizabeth, william).
grandparent_child(elizabeth, harry).
The satisfiability semantics also has an alternative, more mathematical characterisation as the least fixed point of the function that uses the rules in the program to derive new facts from existing facts in one step of inference.

Remarkably, the same problem-solving methods of forward and backward reasoning, which were originally developed for the logical consequence semantics, are equally applicable to the satisfiability semantics: Forward reasoning generates the minimal model of a Horn clause program, by deriving new facts from existing facts, until no new additional facts can be generated. Backward reasoning, which succeeds by reducing a goal to subgoals, until all subgoals are solved by facts, ensures that the goal is true in the minimal model, without generating the model explicitly.

The difference between the two declarative semantics can be seen with the definitions of addition and multiplication in successor arithmetic, which represents the natural numbers codice_23 as a sequence of terms of the form codice_24. In general, the term codice_25 represents the successor of codice_26 namely codice_27 Here are the standard definitions of addition and multiplication in functional notation:

Here are the same definitions as a logic program, using codice_28 to represent codice_29 and codice_30 to represent codice_31:

add(X, 0, X).
add(X, s(Y), s(Z)) :- add(X, Y, Z).

multiply(X, 0, 0).
multiply(X, s(Y), W) :- multiply(X, Y, Z), add(X, Z, W).
The two declarative semantics both give the same answers for the same existentially quantified conjunctions of addition and multiplication goals. For example codice_32 has the solution codice_33; and codice_34 has two solutions codice_35 and codice_36:
?- multiply(s(s(0)), s(s(0)), X).
X = s(s(s(s(0)))).

?- multiply(X, X, Y), add(X, X, Y).
X = 0, Y = 0.
X = s(s(0)), Y = s(s(s(s(0)))).
However, with the logical-consequence semantics, there are non-standard models of the program, in which, for example, codice_37 i.e. codice_38 is true. But with the satisfiability semantics, there is only one model, namely the standard model of arithmetic, in which codice_38 is false.

In both semantics, the goal ?- add(s(s(0)), s(s(0)), s(s(s(s(s(0)))))) fails. In the satisfiability semantics, the failure of the goal means that the truth value of the goal is false. But in the logical consequence semantics, the failure means that the truth value of the goal is unknown.

===Negation as failure===

Negation as failure (NAF), as a way of concluding that a negative condition codice_40 holds by showing that the positive condition codice_41 fails to hold, was already a feature of early Prolog systems. The resulting extension of SLD resolution is called SLDNF. A similar construct, called &quot;thnot&quot;, also existed in Micro-Planner.

The logical semantics of NAF was unresolved until Keith Clark showed that, under certain natural conditions, NAF is an efficient, correct (and sometimes complete) way of reasoning with the logical consequence semantics using the &quot;completion&quot; of a logic program in first-order logic.

Completion amounts roughly to regarding the set of all the program clauses with the same predicate in the head, say:

:codice_42
:codice_43
:codice_44

as a definition of the predicate:

:codice_45

where codice_46 means &quot;if and only if&quot;. The completion also includes axioms of equality, which correspond to unification. Clark showed that proofs generated by SLDNF are structurally similar to proofs generated by a natural deduction style of reasoning with the completion of the program.

Consider, for example, the following program:

should_receive_sanction(X, punishment) :- 
 is_a_thief(X),
 not should_receive_sanction(X, rehabilitation).
should_receive_sanction(X, rehabilitation) :-
 is_a_thief(X),
 is_a_minor(X),
 not is_violent(X).
is_a_thief(tom).
Given the goal of determining whether tom should receive a sanction, the first rule succeeds in showing that tom should be punished:
?- should_receive_sanction(tom, Sanction).
Sanction = punishment.
This is because tom is a thief, and it cannot be shown that tom should be rehabilitated. It cannot be shown that tom should be rehabilitated, because it cannot be shown that tom is a minor.

If, however, we receive new information that tom is indeed a minor, the previous conclusion that tom should be punished is replaced by the new conclusion that tom should be rehabilitated:
minor(tom).

?- should_receive_sanction(tom, Sanction).
Sanction = rehabilitation.
This property of withdrawing a conclusion when new information is added, is called non-monotonicity, and it makes logic programming a non-monotonic logic.

But, if we are now told that tom is violent, the conclusion that tom should be punished will be reinstated:
violent(tom).

?- should_receive_sanction(tom, Sanction).
Sanction = punishment.
The completion of this program is:
should_receive_sanction(X, Sanction) iff 
 Sanction = punishment, is_a_thief(X), 
 not should_receive_sanction(X, rehabilitation)
 or Sanction = rehabilitation, is_a_thief(X), is_a_minor(X),
 not is_violent(X).
is_a_thief(X) iff X = tom.
is_a_minor(X) iff X = tom.
is_violent(X) iff X = tom.
The notion of completion is closely related to John McCarthy&#x27;s circumscription semantics for default reasoning, and to Ray Reiter&#x27;s closed world assumption.

The completion semantics for negation is a logical consequence semantics, for which SLDNF provides a proof-theoretic implementation. However, in the 1980s, the satisfiability semantics became more popular for logic programs with negation. In the satisfiability semantics, negation is interpreted according to the classical definition of truth in an intended or standard model of the logic program.

In the case of logic programs with negative conditions, there are two main variants of the satisfiability semantics: In the well-founded semantics, the intended model of a logic program is a unique, three-valued, minimal model, which always exists. The well-founded semantics generalises the notion of inductive definition in mathematical logic. XSB Prolog implements the well-founded semantics using SLG resolution.

In the alternative stable model semantics, there may be no intended models or several intended models, all of which are minimal and two-valued. The stable model semantics underpins answer set programming (ASP).

Both the well-founded and stable model semantics apply to arbitrary logic programs with negation. However, both semantics coincide for stratified logic programs. For example, the program for sanctioning thieves is (locally) stratified, and all three semantics for the program determine the same intended model:
should_receive_sanction(tom, punishment).
is_a_thief(tom).
is_a_minor(tom).
is_violent(tom).
Attempts to understand negation in logic programming have also contributed to the development of abstract argumentation frameworks. In an argumentation interpretation of negation, the initial argument that tom should be punished because he is a thief, is attacked by the argument that he should be rehabilitated because he is a minor. But the fact that tom is violent undermines the argument that tom should be rehabilitated and reinstates the argument that tom should be punished.

===Metalogic programming===
Metaprogramming, in which programs are treated as data, was already a feature of early Prolog implementations. For example, the Edinburgh DEC10 implementation of Prolog included &quot;an interpreter and a compiler, both written in Prolog itself&quot;. The simplest metaprogram is the so-called &quot;vanilla&quot; meta-interpreter:

 solve(true).
 solve((B,C)):- solve(B),solve(C).
 solve(A):- clause(A,B),solve(B).
where true represents an empty conjunction, and (B,C) is a composite term representing the conjunction of B and C. The predicate clause(A,B) means that there is a clause of the form A :- B.

Metaprogramming is an application of the more general use of a &quot;metalogic&quot; or &quot;metalanguage&quot; to describe and reason about another language, called the &quot;object language&quot;.

Metalogic programming allows object-level and metalevel representations to be combined, as in natural language. For example, in the following program, the atomic formula codice_47 occurs both as an object-level formula, and as an argument of the metapredicates codice_48 and codice_49
prohibited(attends(Person, Meeting)) :- 
 not(approved(attends(Person, Meeting))).

should_receive_sanction(Person, scolding) :- attends(Person, Meeting), 
 lofty(Person), prohibited(attends(Person, Meeting)).
should_receive_sanction(Person, banishment) :- attends(Person, Meeting), 
 lowly(Person), prohibited(attends(Person, Meeting)).

approved(attends(alice, tea_party)).
attends(mad_hatter, tea_party).
attends(dormouse, tea_party).

lofty(mad_hatter).
lowly(dormouse).

?- should_receive_sanction(X,Y).
Person = mad_hatter,
Sanction = scolding.
Person = dormouse,
Sanction = banishment.
===Relationship with the Computational-representational understanding of mind===

In his popular Introduction to Cognitive Science, Paul Thagard includes logic and rules as alternative approaches to modelling human thinking. He argues that rules, which have the form &quot;IF condition THEN action&quot;, are &quot;very similar&quot; to logical conditionals, but they are simpler and have greater psychological plausibility (page 51). Among other differences between logic and rules, he argues that logic uses deduction, but rules use search (page 45) and can be used to reason either forward or backward (page 47). Sentences in logic &quot;have to be interpreted as &quot;universally true&quot;&quot;, but rules can be &quot;defaults&quot;, which admit exceptions (page 44).

He states that &quot;unlike logic, rule-based systems can also easily represent strategic information
about what to do&quot; (page 45). For example, &quot;IF you want to go home for the weekend, and you have bus fare, THEN
you can catch a bus&quot;. He does not observe that the same strategy of reducing a goal to subgoals can be interpreted, in the manner of logic programming, as applying backward reasoning to a logical conditional:
can_go(you, home) :- have(you, bus_fare), catch(you, bus).
All of these characteristics of rule-based systems - search, forward and backward reasoning, default reasoning, and goal-reduction - are also defining characteristics of logic programming. This suggests that Thagard&#x27;s conclusion (page 56) that:
Much of human knowledge is naturally described in terms of rules, and many kinds of thinking such as planning can be modeled by rule-based systems.

also applies to logic programming.

Other arguments showing how logic programming can be used to model aspects of human thinking are presented by Keith Stenning and Michiel van Lambalgen in their book,
Human Reasoning and Cognitive Science. They show how the non-monotonic character of logic programs can be used to explain human performance on a variety of psychological tasks. They also show (page 237) that &quot;closed–world reasoning in its guise as logic programming has an appealing neural implementation, unlike classical logic.&quot;
In The Proper Treatment of Events,
Michiel van Lambalgen and Fritz Hamm investigate the use of constraint logic programming to code &quot;temporal notions in natural language by looking at the way human beings construct time&quot;.

===Knowledge representation===
The use of logic to represent procedural knowledge and strategic information was one of the main goals contributing to the early development of logic programming. Moreover, it continues to be an important feature of the Prolog family of logic programming languages today. However, many applications of logic programming, including Prolog applications, increasingly focus on the use of logic to represent purely declarative knowledge. These applications include both the representation of general commonsense knowledge and the representation of domain specific expertise.

Commonsense includes knowledge about cause and effect, as formalised, for example, in the situation calculus, event calculus and action languages. Here is a simplified example, which illustrates the main features of such formalisms. The first clause states that a fact holds immediately after an event initiates (or causes) the fact. The second clause is a &quot;frame axiom&quot;, which states that a fact that holds at a time continues to hold at the next time unless it is terminated by an event that happens at the time. This formulation allows more than one event to occur at the same time:

holds(Fact, Time2) :- 
 happens(Event, Time1),
 Time2 is Time1 + 1,
 initiates(Event, Fact).
holds(Fact, Time2) :- 
 happens(Event, Time1),
 Time2 is Time1 + 1,
 holds(Fact, Time1),
 not(terminated(Fact, Time1)).

terminated(Fact, Time) :-
 happens(Event, Time),
 terminates(Event, Fact).
Here codice_50 is a meta-predicate, similar to codice_51 above. However, whereas codice_51 has only one argument, which applies to general clauses, the first argument of codice_50 is a fact and the second argument is a time (or state). The atomic formula codice_54 expresses that the codice_55 holds at the codice_56. Such time-varying facts are also called fluents. The atomic formula codice_57 expresses that the Event happens at the codice_56.

The following example illustrates how these clauses can be used to reason about causality in a toy blocks world. Here, in the initial state at time 0, a green block is on a table and a red block is stacked on the green block (like a traffic light). At time 0, the red block is moved to the table. At time 1, the green block is moved onto the red block. Moving an object onto a place terminates the fact that the object is on any place, and initiates the fact that the object is on the place to which it is moved:

holds(on(green_block, table), 0).
holds(on(red_block, green_block), 0).

happens(move(red_block, table), 0).
happens(move(green_block, red_block), 1).

initiates(move(Object, Place), on(Object, Place)).
terminates(move(Object, Place2), on(Object, Place1)).

?- holds(Fact, Time).

Fact = on(green_block,table),
Time = 0.
Fact = on(red_block,green_block),
Time = 0.
Fact = on(green_block,table),
Time = 1.
Fact = on(red_block,table),
Time = 1.
Fact = on(green_block,red_block),
Time = 2.
Fact = on(red_block,table),
Time = 2.

Forward reasoning and backward reasoning generate the same answers to the goal codice_54. But forward reasoning generates fluents &quot;progressively&quot; in temporal order, and backward reasoning generates fluents &quot;regressively&quot;, as in the domain-specific use of regression in the situation calculus.

Logic programming has also proved to be useful for representing domain-specific expertise in expert systems. But human expertise, like general-purpose commonsense, is mostly implicit and tacit, and it is often difficult to represent such implicit knowledge in explicit rules. This difficulty does not arise, however, when logic programs are used to represent the existing, explicit rules of a business organisation or legal authority.

For example, here is a representation of a simplified version of the first sentence of the British Nationality Act, which states that a person who is born in the UK becomes a British citizen at the time of birth if a parent of the person is a British citizen at the time of birth:

initiates(birth(Person), citizen(Person, uk)):-
 time_of(birth(Person), Time),
 place_of(birth(Person), uk),
 parent_child(Another_Person, Person),
 holds(citizen(Another_Person, uk), Time).

Historically, the representation of a large portion of the British Nationality Act as a logic program in the 1980s was &quot;hugely influential for the development of computational representations of legislation, showing how logic programming enables intuitively appealing representations that can be directly deployed to generate automatic inferences&quot;.

More recently, the PROLEG system, initiated in 2009 and consisting of approximately 2500 rules and exceptions of civil code and supreme court case rules in Japan, has become possibly the largest legal rule base in the world.

==Variants and extensions==

===Prolog===
The SLD resolution rule of inference is neutral about the order in which subgoals in the bodies of clauses can be &quot;selected&quot; for solution. For the sake of efficiency, Prolog restricts this order to the order in which the subgoals are written. SLD is also neutral about the strategy for searching the space of SLD proofs.
Prolog searches this space, top-down, depth-first, trying different clauses for solving the same (sub)goal in the order in which the clauses are written.

This search strategy has the advantage that the current branch of the tree can be represented efficiently by a stack. When a goal clause at the top of the stack is reduced to a new goal clause, the new goal clause is pushed onto the top of the stack. When the selected subgoal in the goal clause at the top of the stack cannot be solved, the search strategy &quot;backtracks&quot;, removing the goal clause from the top of the stack, and retrying the attempted solution of the selected subgoal in the previous goal clause using the next clause that matches the selected subgoal.

Backtracking can be restricted by using a subgoal, called &quot;cut&quot;, written as !, which always succeeds but cannot be backtracked. Cut can be used to improve efficiency, but can also interfere with the logical meaning of clauses. In many cases, the use of cut can be replaced by negation as failure. In fact, negation as failure can be defined in Prolog, by using cut, together with any literal, say &quot;fail&quot;, that unifies with the head of no clause:

not(P) :- P, !, fail.
not(P).
Prolog provides other features, in addition to cut, that do not have a logical interpretation. These include the built-in predicates &quot;assert&quot; and &quot;retract&quot; for destructively updating the state of the program during program execution.

For example, the toy blocks world example above can be implemented without frame axioms using destructive change of state:
on(green_block, table).
on(red_block, green_block).

move(Object, Place2) :- 
 retract(on(Object, Place1)), 
 assert(on(Object, Place2).
The sequence of move events and the resulting locations of the blocks can be computed by executing the query:

?- move(red_block, table), move(green_block, red_block), on(Object, Place).

Object = red_block,
Place = table.
Object = green_block,
Place = red_block.
Various extensions of logic programming have been developed to provide a logical framework for such destructive change of state.

The broad range of Prolog applications, both in isolation and in combination with other languages is highlighted in the Year of Prolog Book, celebrating the 50 year anniversary of Prolog in 2022.

Prolog has also contributed to the development of other programming languages, including ALF, Fril, Gödel, Mercury, Oz, Ciao, Visual Prolog, XSB, and λProlog.

===Constraint logic programming===

Constraint logic programming (CLP) combines Horn clause logic programming with constraint solving. It extends Horn clauses by allowing some predicates, declared as constraint predicates, to occur as literals in the body of a clause. Constraint predicates are not defined by the facts and rules in the program, but are predefined by some domain-specific model-theoretic structure or theory.

Procedurally, subgoals whose predicates are defined by the program are solved by goal-reduction, as in ordinary logic programming, but constraints are simplified and checked for satisfiability by a domain-specific constraint-solver, which implements the semantics of the constraint predicates. An initial problem is solved by reducing it to a satisfiable conjunction of constraints.

Interestingly, the first version of Prolog already included a constraint predicate dif(term1, term2), from Philippe Roussel&#x27;s 1972 PhD thesis, which succeeds if both of its arguments are different terms, but which is delayed if either of the terms contains a variable.

The following constraint logic program represents a toy temporal database of codice_60 history as a teacher:

teaches(john, hardware, T) :- 1990 ≤ T, T &lt; 1999.
teaches(john, software, T) :- 1999 ≤ T, T &lt; 2005.
teaches(john, logic, T) :- 2005 ≤ T, T ≤ 2012.
rank(john, instructor, T) :- 1990 ≤ T, T &lt; 2010.
rank(john, professor, T) :- 2010 ≤ T, T &lt; 2014.

Here codice_61 and codice_62 are constraint predicates, with their usual intended semantics. The following goal clause queries the database to find out when codice_63 both taught codice_64 and was a codice_65:

?- teaches(john, logic, T), rank(john, professor, T).

The solution 
codice_66
results from simplifying the constraints
codice_67

Constraint logic programming has been used to solve problems in such fields as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, digital circuit verification, automated timetabling, air traffic control, and finance. It is closely related to abductive logic programming.

=== Datalog ===

Datalog is a database definition language, which combines a relational view of data, as in relational databases, with a logical view, as in logic programming.

Relational databases use a relational calculus or relational algebra, with relational operations, such as &quot;union&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, &quot;set difference&quot; and &quot;cartesian product&quot; to specify queries, which access a database. Datalog uses logical connectives, such as &quot;or&quot;, &quot;and&quot; and &quot;not&quot; in the bodies of rules to define relations as part of the database itself.

It was recognized early in the development of relational databases that recursive queries cannot be expressed in either relational algebra or relational calculus, and that this defficiency can be remedied by introducing a least-fixed-point operator. In contrast, recursive relations can be defined naturally by rules in logic programs, without the need for any new logical connectives or operators.

Datalog differs from more general logic programming by having only constants and variables as terms. Moreover, all facts are variable-free, and rules are restricted, so that if they are executed bottom-up, then the derived facts are also variable-free.

For example, consider the family database:
mother_child(elizabeth, charles).
father_child(charles, william).
father_child(charles, harry).
parent_child(X, Y) :- 
 mother_child(X, Y).
parent_child(X, Y) :- 
 father_child(X, Y).
ancestor_descendant(X, Y) :- 
 parent_child(X, X).
ancestor_descendant(X, Y) :- 
 ancestor_descendant(X, Z), 
 ancestor_descendant(Z, Y).
Bottom-up execution derives the following set of additional facts and terminates:
parent_child(elizabeth, charles).
parent_child(charles, william).
parent_child(charles, harry).

ancestor_descendant(elizabeth, charles).
ancestor_descendant(charles, william).
ancestor_descendant(charles, harry).

ancestor_descendant(elizabeth, william).
ancestor_descendant(elizabeth, harry).
Top-down execution derives the same answers to the query:

?- ancestor_descendant(X, Y).
But then it goes into an infinite loop. However, top-down execution with tabling gives the same answers and terminates without looping.

=== Answer set programming ===
Like Datalog, Answer Set programming (ASP) is not Turing-complete. Moreover, instead of separating goals (or queries) from the program to be used in solving the goals, ASP treats the whole program as a goal, and solves the goal by generating a stable model that makes the goal true. For this purpose, it uses the stable model semantics, according to which a logic program can have zero, one or more intended models. For example, the following program represents a degenerate variant of the map colouring problem of colouring two countries red or green:

country(oz).
country(iz).
adjacent(oz, iz).
colour(C, red) :- country(C), not(colour(C, green)).
colour(C, green) :- country(C), not(colour(C, red)).
The problem has four solutions represented by four stable models:

country(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, red). colour(iz, red).

country(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, green). colour(iz, green).

country(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, red). colour(iz, green).

country(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, green). colour(iz, red).
To represent the standard version of the map colouring problem, we need to add a constraint that two adjacent countries cannot be coloured the same colour. In ASP, this constraint can be written as a clause of the form:

:- country(C1), country(C2), adjacent(C1, C2), colour(C1, X), colour(C2, X).
With the addition of this constraint, the problem now has only two solutions:

country(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, red). colour(iz, green).

country(oz). country(iz). adjacent(oz, iz). colour(oz, green). colour(iz, red).

The addition of constraints of the form codice_68 eliminates models in which codice_69 is true.

Confusingly, &quot;constraints in ASP&quot; are different from &quot;constraints in CLP&quot;. Constraints in CLP are predicates that qualify answers to queries (and solutions of goals). Constraints in ASP are clauses that eliminate models that would otherwise satisfy goals. Constraints in ASP are like integrity constraints in databases.

This combination of ordinary logic programming clauses and constraint clauses illustrates the generate-and-test methodology of problem solving in ASP: The ordinary clauses define a search space of possible solutions, and the constraints filter out unwanted solutions.

Most implementations of ASP proceed in two steps: First they instantiate the program in all possible ways, reducing it to a propositional logic program (known as &quot;grounding&quot;). Then they apply a propositional logic problem solver, such as the DPLL algorithm or a Boolean SAT solver. However, some implementations, such as s(CASP) use a goal-directed, top-down, SLD resolution-like procedure without
grounding.

===Abductive logic programming===

Abductive logic programming (ALP), like CLP, extends normal logic programming by allowing the bodies of clauses to contain literals whose predicates are not defined by clauses. In ALP, these predicates are declared as &quot;abducible&quot; (or &quot;assumable&quot;), and are used as in abductive reasoning to explain observations, or more generally to add new facts to the program (as assumptions) to solve goals.

For example, suppose we are given an initial state in which a red block is on a green block on a table at time 0:

holds(on(green_block, table), 0).
holds(on(red_block, green_block), 0).
Suppose we are also given the goal:

?- holds(on(green_block,red_block), 3), holds(on(red_block,table), 3).
The goal can represent an observation, in which case a solution is an explanation of the observation. Or the goal can represent a desired future state of affairs, in which case a solution is a plan for achieving the goal.

We can use the rules for cause and effect presented earlier to solve the goal, by treating the codice_70 predicate as abducible:
holds(Fact, Time2) :- 
 happens(Event, Time1),
 Time2 is Time1 + 1,
 initiates(Event, Fact).
holds(Fact, Time2) :- 
 happens(Event, Time1),
 Time2 is Time1 + 1,
 holds(Fact, Time1),
 not(terminated(Fact, Time1)).
terminated(Fact, Time) :-
 happens(Event, Time),
 terminates(Event, Fact).

initiates(move(Object, Place), on(Object, Place)).
terminates(move(Object, Place2), on(Object, Place1)).
ALP solves the goal by reasoning backwards and adding assumptions to the program, to solve abducible subgoals. In this case there are many alternative solutions, including:
happens(move(red_block, table), 0).
happens(tick, 1).
happens(move(green_block, red_block), 2).

happens(tick,0).
happens(move(red_block, table), 1).
happens(move(green_block, red_block), 2).

happens(move(red_block, table), 0).
happens(move(green_block, red_block), 1).
happens(tick, 2).

Here tick is an event that marks the passage of time without initiating or terminating any fluents.

There are also solutions in which the two codice_71 events happen at the same time. For example:

happens(move(red_block, table), 0).
happens(move(green_block, red_block), 0).
happens(tick, 1).
happens(tick, 2).
Such solutions, if not desired, can be removed by adding an integrity constraint, which is like a constraint clause in ASP:
:- happens(move(Block1, Place), Time), happens(move(Block2, Block1), Time).
Abductive logic programming has been used for fault diagnosis, planning, natural language processing and machine learning. It has also been used to interpret negation as failure as a form of abductive reasoning.

===Inductive logic programming===
Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to machine learning that induces logic programs as hypothetical generalisations of positive and negative examples. Given a logic program representing background knowledge and positive examples together with constraints representing negative examples, an ILP system induces a logic program that generalises the positive examples while excluding the negative examples.

ILP is similar to ALP, in that both can be viewed as generating hypotheses to explain observations, and as employing constraints to exclude undesirable hypotheses. But in ALP the hypotheses are variable-free facts, and in ILP the hypotheses are general rules.

For example, given only background knowledge of the mother_child and father_child relations, and suitable examples of the grandparent_child relation, current ILP systems can generate the definition of grandparent_child, inventing an auxiliary predicate, which can be interpreted as the parent_child relation:
grandparent_child(X, Y):- auxiliary(X, Z), auxiliary(Z, Y).
auxiliary(X, Y):- mother_child(X, Y).
auxiliary(X, Y):- father_child(X, Y).

Stuart Russell has referred to such invention of new concepts as the most important step needed for reaching human-level AI.

Recent work in ILP, combining logic programming, learning and probability, has given rise to the fields of statistical relational learning and probabilistic inductive logic programming.

===Concurrent logic programming===

Concurrent logic programming integrates concepts of logic programming with concurrent programming. Its development was given a big impetus in the 1980s by its choice for the systems programming language of the Japanese Fifth Generation Project (FGCS).

A concurrent logic program is a set of guarded Horn clauses of the form:

::codice_72

The conjunction codice_73 is called the guard of the clause, and is the commitment operator. Declaratively, guarded Horn clauses are read as ordinary logical implications:

::codice_74

However, procedurally, when there are several clauses whose heads codice_75 match a given goal, then all of the clauses are executed in parallel, checking whether their guards codice_73 hold. If the guards of more than one clause hold, then a committed choice is made to one of the clauses, and execution proceeds with the subgoals codice_77 of the chosen clause. These subgoals can also be executed in parallel. Thus concurrent logic programming implements a form of &quot;don&#x27;t care nondeterminism&quot;, rather than &quot;don&#x27;t know nondeterminism&quot;.

For example, the following concurrent logic program defines a predicate codice_78, which can be used to shuffle two lists codice_79 and codice_80, combining them into a single list codice_81 that preserves the ordering of the two lists codice_79 and codice_80:
shuffle([], [], []).
shuffle(Left, Right, Merge) :-
 Left = [First | Rest] |
 Merge = [First | ShortMerge],
 shuffle(Rest, Right, ShortMerge).
shuffle(Left, Right, Merge) :-
 Right = [First | Rest] |
 Merge = [First | ShortMerge],
 shuffle(Left, Rest, ShortMerge).
Here, codice_84 represents the empty list, and codice_85 represents a list with first element codice_86 followed by list codice_87, as in Prolog. (Notice that the first occurrence of in the second and third clauses is the list constructor, whereas the second occurrence of is the commitment operator.) The program can be used, for example, to shuffle the lists codice_88 and codice_89 by invoking the goal clause:
shuffle([ace, queen, king], [1, 4, 2], Merge).
The program will non-deterministically generate a single solution, for example codice_90.

Carl Hewitt has argued that, because of the indeterminacy of concurrent computation, concurrent logic programming cannot implement general concurrency. However, according to the logical semantics, any result of a computation of a concurrent logic program is a logical consequence of the program, even though not all logical consequences can be derived.

===Concurrent constraint logic programming===
Concurrent constraint logic programming combines concurrent logic programming and constraint logic programming, using constraints to control concurrency. A clause can contain a guard, which is a set of constraints that may block the applicability of the clause. When the guards of several clauses are satisfied, concurrent constraint logic programming makes a committed choice to use only one.

===Higher-order logic programming===
Several researchers have extended logic programming with higher-order programming features derived from higher-order logic, such as predicate variables. Such languages include the Prolog extensions HiLog and λProlog.

===Linear logic programming===
Basing logic programming within linear logic has resulted in the design of logic programming languages that are considerably more expressive than those based on classical logic. Horn clause programs can only represent state change by the change in arguments to predicates. In linear logic programming, one can use the ambient linear logic to support state change. Some early designs of logic programming languages based on linear logic include LO, Lolli, ACL, and Forum. Forum provides a goal-directed interpretation of all linear logic.

===Object-oriented logic programming===
F-logic extends logic programming with objects and the frame syntax.

Logtalk extends the Prolog programming language with support for objects, protocols, and other OOP concepts. It supports most standard-compliant Prolog systems as backend compilers.

===Transaction logic programming===
Transaction logic is an extension of logic programming with a logical theory of state-modifying updates. It has both a model-theoretic semantics and a procedural one. An implementation of a subset of Transaction logic is available in the Flora-2 system. Other prototypes are also available.

<text>Lake Tana (; previously transcribed Tsana) is the largest lake in Ethiopia and a source of the Blue Nile. Located in Amhara Region in the north-western Ethiopian Highlands, the lake is approximately long and wide, with a maximum depth of , and an elevation of . Lake Tana is fed by the Gilgel Abay, Reb and Gumara rivers. Its surface area ranges from , depending on season and rainfall. The lake level has been regulated since the construction of the control weir where the lake discharges into the Blue Nile. This controls the flow to the Blue Nile Falls (Tis Abbai) and hydro-power station.

In 2015, the Lake Tana region was nominated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve recognizing its national and international natural and cultural importance.

==Overview==


Lake Tana was formed by volcanic activity, blocking the course of inflowing rivers in the early Pleistocene epoch, about 5 million years ago.

The lake was originally much larger than it is today. Seven large permanent rivers feed the lake as well as 40 small seasonal rivers. The main tributaries to the lake are Gilgel Abbay (Little Nile River), and the Megech, Gumara, and Rib rivers.

Lake Tana has a number of islands, whose number varies depending on the level of the lake. It has fallen about in the last 400 years. According to Manoel de Almeida (a Portuguese missionary in the early 17th century), there were 21 islands, seven to eight of which had monasteries on them &quot;formerly large, but now much diminished.&quot; When James Bruce visited the area in 1771, he noted that the locals counted 45 inhabited islands, but stated he believed that &quot;the number may be about eleven.&quot; Anton Stecker, in 1881, made a detailed examination of the lake, enabling substantially accurate maps, and counted 44 islands. A 20th-century geographer named 37 islands, of which he believed 19 have or had monasteries or churches on them.

Remains of ancient Ethiopian emperors and treasures of the Ethiopian Church are kept in the isolated island monasteries (including Kebran Gabriel, Ura Kidane Mehret, Narga Selassie, Daga Estifanos, Medhane Alem of Rema, Kota Maryam, and Mertola Maryam). On the island of Tana Qirqos is a rock shown to Paul B. Henze, on which he was told the Virgin Mary had rested on her journey back from Egypt; he was also told that Frumentius, who introduced Christianity to Ethiopia, is &quot;allegedly buried on Tana Cherqos.&quot; The body of Yekuno Amlak is interred in the monastery of St. Stephen on Daga Island. Emperors whose tombs are also on Daga include Dawit I, Zara Yaqob, Za Dengel, and Fasilides. Other important islands in Lake Tana include Dek, Mitraha, Gelila Zakarias, Halimun and Briguida.

The monasteries are believed to have been built during the Middle Ages over earlier religious sites. They include the fourteenth-century Debre Maryam, and the eighteenth-century Narga Selassie, Tana Qirqos (said to have housed the Ark of the Covenant before it was moved to Axum), and Ura Kidane Mehret, known for its regalia. A ferry service links Bahir Dar with Gorgora via Dek Island and various lakeshore villages.

There is also Zege Peninsula on the southwest portion of the lake. Zege is the site of the Azwa Maryam monastery.

==Water characteristics and floods==
Compared to other tropical lakes, the waters in Lake Tana are relatively cold, typically ranging from about . The water has a pH that is neutral to somewhat alkaline and its transparency is quite low.

Because of the large seasonal variations in the inflow of its tributaries, rain and evaporation, the water levels of Lake Tana typically vary by in a year, peaking in September–October just after the main wet season. When the water levels are high, the plains around the lake often are flooded and other permanent swamps in the region become connected to the lake.

==Fauna==
Since there are no inflows that link the lake to other large waterways and the main outflow, the Blue Nile, is obstructed by the Blue Nile Falls, the lake supports a highly distinctive aquatic fauna, which generally is related to species from the Nile Basin. The lake&#x27;s nutrient levels are low.

===Fish===
There are 27 fish species in Lake Tana and 20 of these are endemic. This includes one of only two known cyprinid species flocks (the other, from Lake Lanao in the Philippines, has been decimated by introduced species). It consists of 15 relatively large, up to long, &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; barbs that formerly were included in &quot;Barbus&quot; instead. Among these, &quot;L. acutirostris&quot;, &quot;L. longissimus&quot;, &quot;L. megastoma&quot; and &quot;L. truttiformis&quot; are strictly piscivorous, and &quot;L. dainellii&quot;, &quot;L. gorguari&quot;, &quot;L. macrophtalmus&quot; and &quot;L. platydorsus&quot; are mostly piscivorous. Their most important prey are the small &quot;Enteromius&quot; and &quot;Garra&quot; species. The remaining &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; in Lake Tana have other specialized feeding habits: &quot;L. beso&quot; (non-endemic and not closely related to the others) feeds on algae, &quot;L. surkis&quot; mostly on macrophytes, &quot;L. gorgorensis&quot; on macrophytes and molluscs, &quot;L. brevicephalus&quot; on zooplankton (however, juveniles of all members of the species flock feed on zooplankton), &quot;L. osseensis&quot; on macrophytes and adults insects, and &quot;L. crassibarbis&quot;, &quot;L. intermedius&quot; (non-endemic but closely related to the others), &quot;L. nedgia&quot; and &quot;L. tsanensis&quot; on benthic invertebrates like chironomid larvae. Among the endemic &quot;Labeobarbus&quot;, eight species spawn in the lake&#x27;s wetlands and the remaining move seasonally into its tributaries where they spawn.

In addition to the &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; species flock, the endemic species are &quot;Enteromius pleurogramma&quot;, &quot;E. tanapelagius&quot;, &quot;Garra regressus&quot; and &quot;Afronemacheilus abyssinicus&quot; (one of only two African stone loaches). The remaining non-endemic species are Nile tilapia (widespread in Africa, but with the endemic subspecies &quot;tana&quot; in the lake), &quot;E. humilis&quot;, &quot;G. dembecha&quot;, &quot;G. dembeensis&quot; and the large African sharptooth catfish.

===Fishing and threats===
Lake Tana supports a large fishing industry, mainly based on the &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; barbs, Nile tilapia and sharptooth catfish. According to the Ethiopian Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 1,454 tons of fish were landed in 2011 at Bahir Dar, which the department estimated was 15% of its sustainable amount. Nevertheless, in a review that compared catches in 2001 to those ten years earlier, it was found that typical sizes of both the tilapia and the catfish had significantly decreased, and populations of the &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; barbs that breed in the tributaries had significantly declined. Among the endemic fish, most are considered threatened (endangered or vulnerable) or data deficient (available data insufficient for evaluating a status) by the IUCN. In the early 2000s, the local government for the first time introduced a fisheries legislation and it is hoped this will have a positive effect on the fish populations.

Other serious threats are habitat destruction and pollution. Bahir Dar has become a large city and it is rapidly growing; its wastewater is generally released directly into the lake. The vegetation in the lake&#x27;s wetlands, which are an important nursery for the &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; and other fish, are being cleared at a fast pace. A potentially serious threat to the unique ecosystem would be an introduction of a large and efficient predatory species like the Nile perch, which has been implicated in numerous extinctions in Lake Victoria. The piscivorous &quot;Labeobarbus&quot; of Lake Tana are relatively inefficient predators that can only take fish up to about 15% of the length of the predator itself.

===Other fauna===
Among other fauna, the lake supports relatively few invertebrates: There are fifteen species of mollusks, including one endemic, and also an endemic freshwater sponge.

About 230 species of birds, including more than 80 wetland birds such as the great white pelican, African darter, hamerkop, storks, African spoonbill, ibis, ducks, kingfishers and African fish eagle, are known from Lake Tana. It is an important resting and feeding ground for many Palearctic migrant waterbirds.

There are no crocodiles, but the African softshell turtle and Nile monitor have been recorded near the Blue Nile outflow from the lake. Hippos are present, mostly near the Blue Nile outflow.

<text>Lola Glenn Graham (23 September 19182 January 1992). She first came to public attention after winning a musical competition at age six by playing the piano. She attended Shelford Church of England Girls&#x27; Grammar School and passed her music examinations in December 1933. In October 1936 her piano teacher, Sheila MacFie, organised a recital for Graham and fellow student, Eda Ashton, at the British Music Society&#x27;s rooms, Melbourne. In April 1942 Graham and Ashton were pianists for a radio broadcast on 3LO on the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#x27;s network. In May of the following year her chamber music piano work was described by &quot;The Argus&quot;″ reporter, &quot;Graham showed virtuosity in her playing of Albanesi&#x27;s Sonata in C Major.&quot;

She worked in radio for most of her career. In October 1946 she performed a duo piano recital with Mamie Reid on national radio. She worked in live musical theatre both as a band member and accompanist. Graham married Fred Menhennitt on 23 February 1957 and the couple had two sons. She was a backing musician for Barry Humphries, and in 1962, she provided piano on his album, &quot;A Nice Night&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;. She died, aged 73, after being diagnosed with cancer.

<text>A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers to display information. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly but instead use a backlight or reflector to produce images in color or monochrome.

LCDs are available to display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low information content, which can be displayed or hidden: preset words, digits, and seven-segment displays (as in a digital clock) are all examples of devices with these displays. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made from a matrix of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements.

LCDs are used in a wide range of applications, including LCD televisions, computer monitors, instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage. Small LCD screens are common in LCD projectors and portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky and less energy-efficient cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications since the late 2000s to the early 2010s.

LCDs can either be normally on (positive) or off (negative), depending on the polarizer arrangement. For example, a character positive LCD with a backlight has black lettering on a background that is the color of the backlight, and a character negative LCD has a black background with the letters being of the same color as the backlight. 

LCDs are not subject to screen burn-in like on CRTs. However, LCDs are still susceptible to image persistence.

==General characteristics==
Each pixel of an LCD typically consists of a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes called alignment layers, often made of indium tin oxide (ITO), and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular polarizers), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the second (crossed) polarizer. Before an electric field is applied, the orientation of the liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a twisted nematic (TN) device, the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This induces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules in the center of the layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray.

The chemical formula of the liquid crystals used in LCDs may vary. Formulas may be patented. An example is a mixture of 2-(4-alkoxyphenyl)-5-alkylpyrimidine with cyanobiphenyl, patented by Merck and Sharp Corporation. The patent that covered that specific mixture has expired.

Most color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue subpixels. The LCD color filters are made with a photolithography process on large glass sheets that are later glued with other glass sheets containing a thin-film transistor (TFT) array, spacers and liquid crystal, creating several color LCDs that are then cut from one another and laminated with polarizer sheets. Red, green, blue and black colored photoresists (resists) are used to create color filters. All resists contain a finely ground powdered pigment, with particles being just 40 nanometers across. The black resist is the first to be applied; this will create a black grid (known in the industry as a black matrix) that will separate red, green and blue subpixels from one another, increasing contrast ratios and preventing light from leaking from one subpixel onto other surrounding subpixels. After the black resist has been dried in an oven and exposed to UV light through a photomask, the unexposed areas are washed away, creating a black grid. Then the same process is repeated with the remaining resists. This fills the holes in the black grid with their corresponding colored resists. Black matrices made in the 1980s and 1990s when most color LCD production was for laptop computers, are made of Chromium due to its high opacity, but due to environmental concerns, manufacturers shifted to black colored photoresist with carbon pigment as the black matrix material. Another color-generation method used in early color PDAs and some calculators was done by varying the voltage in a Super-twisted nematic LCD, where the variable twist between tighter-spaced plates causes a varying double refraction birefringence, thus changing the hue. They were typically restricted to 3 colors per pixel: orange, green, and blue.

The optical effect of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less dependent on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, particularly in smartphones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied for a long period of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).

Displays for a small number of individual digits or fixed symbols (as in digital watches and pocket calculators) can be implemented with independent electrodes for each segment. In contrast, full alphanumeric or variable graphics displays are usually implemented with pixels arranged as a matrix consisting of electrically connected rows on one side of the liquid crystal (LC) layer and columns on the other side, which makes it possible to address each pixel at the intersections. The general method of matrix addressing consists of sequentially addressing one side of the matrix, for example by selecting the rows one-by-one and applying the picture information on the other side at the columns row-by-row. &quot;For details on the various matrix addressing schemes see&quot; passive-matrix and active-matrix addressed LCDs.

==History==
The origin and the complex history of liquid-crystal displays from the perspective of an insider during the early days were described by Joseph A. Castellano in &quot;Liquid Gold: The Story of Liquid Crystal Displays and the Creation of an Industry&quot;.
Another report on the origins and history of LCD from a different perspective until 1991 has been published by Hiroshi Kawamoto, available at the IEEE History Center.
A description of Swiss contributions to LCD developments, written by Peter J. Wild, can be found at the &quot;Engineering and Technology History Wiki&quot;.

===Background===
In 1888, Friedrich Reinitzer (1858–1927) discovered the liquid crystalline nature of cholesterol extracted from carrots (that is, two melting points and generation of colors) and published his findings. In 1904, Otto Lehmann published his work &quot;Flüssige Kristalle&quot; (Liquid Crystals). In 1911, Charles Mauguin first experimented with liquid crystals confined between plates in thin layers.

In 1922, Georges Friedel described the structure and properties of liquid crystals and classified them in three types (nematics, smectics and cholesterics). In 1927, Vsevolod Frederiks devised the electrically switched light valve, called the Fréedericksz transition, the essential effect of all LCD technology. In 1936, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph company patented the first practical application of the technology, &quot;The Liquid Crystal Light Valve&quot;. In 1962, the first major English language publication &quot;Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals&quot; was published by Dr. George W. Gray. In 1962, Richard Williams of RCA found that liquid crystals had some interesting electro-optic characteristics and he realized an electro-optical effect by generating stripe patterns in a thin layer of liquid crystal material by the application of a voltage. This effect is based on an electro-hydrodynamic instability forming what are now called &quot;Williams domains&quot; inside the liquid crystal.

Building on early MOSFETs, Paul K. Weimer at RCA developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962. It was a type of MOSFET distinct from the standard bulk MOSFET.

===1960s===
In 1964, George H. Heilmeier, who was working at the RCA laboratories on the effect discovered by Richard Williams, achieved the switching of colors by field-induced realignment of dichroic dyes in a homeotropically oriented liquid crystal. Practical problems with this new electro-optical effect made Heilmeier continue to work on scattering effects in liquid crystals and finally the achievement of the first operational liquid-crystal display based on what he called the &quot;dynamic scattering mode&quot; (DSM). Application of a voltage to a DSM display switches the initially clear transparent liquid crystal layer into a milky turbid state. DSM displays could be operated in transmissive and in reflective mode but they required a considerable current to flow for their operation. George H. Heilmeier was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and credited with the invention of LCDs. Heilmeier&#x27;s work is an IEEE Milestone.
In the late 1960s, pioneering work on liquid crystals was undertaken by the UK&#x27;s Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, England. The team at RRE supported ongoing work by George William Gray and his team at the University of Hull who ultimately discovered the cyanobiphenyl liquid crystals, which had correct stability and temperature properties for application in LCDs.

The idea of a TFT-based liquid-crystal display (LCD) was conceived by Bernard Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. Lechner, F.J. Marlowe, E.O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated the concept in 1968 with an 18x2 matrix dynamic scattering mode (DSM) LCD that used standard discrete MOSFETs.

=== 1970s ===
On December 4, 1970, the twisted nematic field effect (TN) in liquid crystals was filed for patent by Hoffmann-LaRoche in Switzerland, (Swiss patent No. 532 261 ) with Wolfgang Helfrich and Martin Schadt (then working for the Central Research Laboratories) listed as inventors. Hoffmann-La Roche licensed the invention to Swiss manufacturer Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, its joint venture partner at that time, which produced TN displays for wristwatches and other applications during the 1970s for the international markets including the Japanese electronics industry, which soon produced the first digital quartz wristwatches with TN-LCDs and numerous other products. James Fergason, while working with Sardari Arora and Alfred Saupe at Kent State University Liquid Crystal Institute, filed an identical patent in the United States on April 22, 1971. In 1971, the company of Fergason, ILIXCO (now LXD Incorporated), produced LCDs based on the TN-effect, which soon superseded the poor-quality DSM types due to improvements of lower operating voltages and lower power consumption. Tetsuro Hama and Izuhiko Nishimura of Seiko received a US patent dated February 1971, for an electronic wristwatch incorporating a TN-LCD. In 1972, the first wristwatch with TN-LCD was launched on the market: The Gruen Teletime which was a four digit display watch.

In 1972, the concept of the active-matrix thin-film transistor (TFT) liquid-crystal display panel was prototyped in the United States by T. Peter Brody&#x27;s team at Westinghouse, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1973, Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories demonstrated the first thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). , all modern high-resolution and high-quality electronic visual display devices use TFT-based active matrix displays. Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AM LCD) in 1974, and then Brody coined the term &quot;active matrix&quot; in 1975.

In 1972 North American Rockwell Microelectronics Corp introduced the use of DSM LCDs for calculators for marketing by Lloyds Electronics Inc, though these required an internal light source for illumination. Sharp Corporation followed with DSM LCDs for pocket-sized calculators in 1973 and then mass-produced TN LCDs for watches in 1975. Other Japanese companies soon took a leading position in the wristwatch market, like Seiko and its first 6-digit TN-LCD quartz wristwatch, and Casio&#x27;s &#x27;Casiotron&#x27;. Color LCDs based on &quot;Guest-Host&quot; interaction were invented by a team at RCA in 1968. A particular type of such a color LCD was developed by Japan&#x27;s Sharp Corporation in the 1970s, receiving patents for their inventions, such as a patent by Shinji Kato and Takaaki Miyazaki in May 1975, and then improved by Fumiaki Funada and Masataka Matsuura in December 1975. TFT LCDs similar to the prototypes developed by a Westinghouse team in 1972 were patented in 1976 by a team at Sharp consisting of Fumiaki Funada, Masataka Matsuura, and Tomio Wada, then improved in 1977 by a Sharp team consisting of Kohei Kishi, Hirosaku Nonomura, Keiichiro Shimizu, and Tomio Wada. However, these TFT-LCDs were not yet ready for use in products, as problems with the materials for the TFTs were not yet solved.

===1980s===
In 1983, researchers at Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie (BBC) Research Center, Switzerland, invented the &quot;super-twisted nematic (STN) structure&quot; for passive matrix-addressed LCDs. H. Amstutz et al. were listed as inventors in the corresponding patent applications filed in Switzerland on July 7, 1983, and October 28, 1983. Patents were granted in Switzerland CH 665491, Europe EP 0131216, and many more countries. In 1980, Brown Boveri started a 50/50 joint venture with the Dutch Philips company, called Videlec. Philips had the required know-how to design and build integrated circuits for the control of large LCD panels. In addition, Philips had better access to markets for electronic components and intended to use LCDs in new product generations of hi-fi, video equipment and telephones. In 1984, Philips researchers Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan invented a video speed-drive scheme that solved the slow response time of STN-LCDs, enabling high-resolution, high-quality, and smooth-moving video images on STN-LCDs. In 1985, Philips inventors Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan solved the problem of driving high-resolution STN-LCDs using low-voltage (CMOS-based) drive electronics, allowing the application of high-quality (high resolution and video speed) LCD panels in battery-operated portable products like notebook computers and mobile phones. In 1985, Philips acquired 100% of the Videlec AG company based in Switzerland. Afterwards, Philips moved the Videlec production lines to the Netherlands. Years later, Philips successfully produced and marketed complete modules (consisting of the LCD screen, microphone, speakers etc.) in high-volume production for the booming mobile phone industry.

The first color LCD televisions were developed as handheld televisions in Japan. In 1980, Hattori Seiko&#x27;s R&amp;D group began development on color LCD pocket televisions. In 1982, Seiko Epson released the first LCD television, the Epson TV Watch, a wristwatch equipped with a small active-matrix LCD television. Sharp Corporation introduced dot matrix TN-LCD in 1983. In 1984, Epson released the ET-10, the first full-color, pocket LCD television. The same year, Citizen Watch, introduced the Citizen Pocket TV, a 2.7-inch color LCD TV, with the first commercial TFT LCD. In 1988, Sharp demonstrated a 14-inch, active-matrix, full-color, full-motion TFT-LCD. This led to Japan launching an LCD industry, which developed large-size LCDs, including TFT computer monitors and LCD televisions. Epson developed the 3LCD projection technology in the 1980s, and licensed it for use in projectors in 1988. Epson&#x27;s VPJ-700, released in January 1989, was the world&#x27;s first compact, full-color LCD projector.

===1990s===
In 1990, under different titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to &quot;twisted nematic field effect LCDs&quot; (TN- and STN-LCDs). One approach was to use interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To take full advantage of the properties of this &quot;In Plane Switching (IPS) technology&quot;, further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur &quot;et al.&quot; and patented in various countries. The Fraunhofer Institute ISE in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi worked out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. The first wall-mountable LCD TV was introduced by Sharp Corporation in 1992.

Hitachi also improved the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (&quot;Super IPS&quot;). NEC and Hitachi became early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In the late 1990s, the LCD industry began shifting away from Japan, towards South Korea and Taiwan, and later on towards China.

=== 2000s ===
In this period, Taiwanese, Japanese, and Korean manufacturers were the dominant companies in LCD manufacturing. From 2001 to 2006, Samsung and five other major companies held 53 meetings in Taiwan and South Korea to fix prices in the LCD industry. These six companies were fined 1.3 billion dollars by the United States, 650 million Euro by the European Union, and 350 million RMB by China&#x27;s National Development and Reform Commission.

In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200 million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank.

=== 2010s ===
In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560 × 1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155 mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display. The 2010s also saw the wide adoption of TGP (Tracking Gate-line in Pixel), which moves the driving circuitry from the borders of the display to in between the pixels, allowing for narrow bezels.

In 2016, Panasonic developed IPS LCDs with a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, rivaling OLEDs. This technology was later put into mass production as dual layer, dual panel or LMCL (Light Modulating Cell Layer) LCDs. The technology uses 2 liquid crystal layers instead of one, and may be used along with a mini-LED backlight and quantum dot sheets.

LCDs with quantum dot enhancement film or quantum dot color filters were introduced from 2015 to 2018. Quantum dots receive blue light from a backlight and convert it to light that allows LCD panels to offer better color reproduction. Quantum dot color filters are manufactured using photoresists containing quantum dots instead of colored pigments, and the quantum dots can have a special structure to improve their application onto the color filter. Quantum dot color filters offer superior light transmission over quantum dot enhancement films.

=== 2020s ===
In the 2020s, China became the largest manufacturer of LCDs and Chinese firms had a 40% share of the global market. Chinese firms that increased their production to high levels included BOE Technology, TCL-CSOT, TIANMA, and Visionox. Local governments had a significant role in this growth, including as a result of their investments in LCD manufacturers via state-owned investment companies. China had previously imported significant amounts of LCDs, and the growth of its LCD industry decreased prices for other consumer products that use LCDs and led to growth in other sectors like mobile phones.

==Illumination==
LCDs do not produce light on their own, so they require external light to produce a visible image. In a transmissive type of LCD, the light source is provided at the back of the glass stack and is called a backlight. Active-matrix LCDs are almost always backlit. Passive LCDs may be backlit but many are reflective as they use a reflective surface or film at the back of the glass stack to utilize ambient light. Transflective LCDs combine the features of a backlit transmissive display and a reflective display.

The common implementations of LCD backlight technology are:
* WLED array: The LCD panel is lit by a full array of white LEDs placed behind a diffuser behind the panel. LCDs that use this implementation will usually have the ability to dim or completely turn off the LEDs in the dark areas of the image being displayed, effectively increasing the contrast ratio of the display. The precision with which this can be done will depend on the number of dimming zones of the display. The more dimming zones, the more precise the dimming, with less obvious blooming artifacts which are visible as dark grey patches surrounded by the unlit areas of the LCD. As of 2012, this design gets most of its use from upscale, larger-screen LCD televisions.
* CCFL: The LCD panel is lit either by two cold cathode fluorescent lamps placed at opposite edges of the display or an array of parallel CCFLs behind larger displays. A diffuser (made of PMMA acrylic plastic, also known as a wave or light guide/guiding plate) then spreads the light out evenly across the whole display. For many years, this technology had been used almost exclusively. Unlike white LEDs, most CCFLs have an even-white spectral output resulting in better color gamut for the display. However, CCFLs are less energy efficient than LEDs and require a somewhat costly inverter to convert whatever DC voltage the device uses (usually 5 or 12 V) to ≈1000 V needed to light a CCFL. The thickness of the inverter transformers also limits how thin the display can be made.
* EL-WLED: The LCD panel is lit by a row of white LEDs placed at one or more edges of the screen. A light diffuser (light guide plate, LGP) is then used to spread the light evenly across the whole display, similarly to edge-lit CCFL LCD backlights. The diffuser is made out of either PMMA plastic or special glass, PMMA is used in most cases because it is rugged, while special glass is used when the thickness of the LCD is of primary concern, because it doesn&#x27;t expand as much when heated or exposed to moisture, which allows LCDs to be just 5mm thick. Quantum dots may be placed on top of the diffuser as a quantum dot enhancement film (QDEF, in which case they need a layer to be protected from heat and humidity) or on the color filter of the LCD, replacing the resists that are normally used. this design is the most popular one in desktop computer monitors. It allows for the thinnest displays. Some LCD monitors using this technology have a feature called dynamic contrast, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan Using PWM (pulse-width modulation, a technology where the intensity of the LEDs are kept constant, but the brightness adjustment is achieved by varying a time interval of flashing these constant light intensity light sources), the backlight is dimmed to the brightest color that appears on the screen while simultaneously boosting the LCD contrast to the maximum achievable levels, allowing the 1000:1 contrast ratio of the LCD panel to be scaled to different light intensities, resulting in the &quot;30000:1&quot; contrast ratios seen in the advertising on some of these monitors. Since computer screen images usually have full white somewhere in the image, the backlight will usually be at full intensity, making this &quot;feature&quot; mostly a marketing gimmick for computer monitors, however for TV screens it drastically increases the perceived contrast ratio and dynamic range, improves the viewing angle dependency and drastically reducing the power consumption of conventional LCD televisions.
* RGB-LED array: Similar to the WLED array, except the panel is lit by an array of RGB LEDs. While displays lit with white LEDs usually have a poorer color gamut than CCFL lit displays, panels lit with RGB LEDs have very wide color gamuts. This implementation is most popular on professional graphics editing LCDs. As of 2012, LCDs in this category usually cost more than $1000. As of 2016 the cost of this category has drastically reduced and such LCD televisions obtained same price levels as the former 28&quot; (71 cm) CRT based categories.
* Monochrome LEDs: such as red, green, yellow or blue LEDs are used in the small passive monochrome LCDs typically used in clocks, watches and small appliances. Blue LEDs can be used in LCDs with quantum dot enhancement film or quantum dot color filters.
* Mini-LED: Backlighting with Mini-LEDs can support over a thousand Full-area Local Area Dimming (FLAD) zones. This allows deeper blacks and higher contrast ratio.

Today, most LCD screens are being designed with an LED backlight instead of the traditional CCFL backlight, while that backlight is dynamically controlled with the video information (dynamic backlight control). The combination with the dynamic backlight control, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan, simultaneously increases the dynamic range of the display system (also marketed as &quot;HDR&quot;, &quot;high dynamic range television&quot; or &quot;FLAD&quot;, &quot;full-area local area dimming&quot;).

The LCD backlight systems are made highly efficient by applying optical films such as prismatic structure (prism sheet) to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. Improved versions of the prism sheet have a wavy rather than a prismatic structure, and introduce waves laterally into the structure of the sheet while also varying the height of the waves, directing even more light towards the screen and reducing aliasing or moiré between the structure of the prism sheet and the subpixels of the LCD. A wavy structure is easier to mass-produce than a prismatic one using conventional diamond machine tools, which are used to make the rollers used to imprint the wavy structure into plastic sheets, thus producing prism sheets. A diffuser sheet is placed on both sides of the prism sheet to distribute the light of the backlight uniformly, while a mirror is placed behind the light guide plate to direct all light forwards. The prism sheet with its diffuser sheets are placed on top of the light guide plate. The DBEF polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light.

DBEF polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) were invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today&#x27;s LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.

==Connection to other circuits==
A standard television receiver screen, a modern LCD panel, has over six million pixels, and they are all individually powered by a wire network embedded in the screen. The fine wires, or pathways, form a grid with vertical wires across the whole screen on one side of the screen and horizontal wires across the whole screen on the other side of the screen. To this grid each pixel has a positive connection on one side and a negative connection on the other side. So the total amount of wires needed for a 1080p display is 3 x 1920 going vertically and 1080 going horizontally for a total of 6840 wires horizontally and vertically. That&#x27;s three for red, green and blue and 1920 columns of pixels for each color for a total of 5760 wires going vertically and 1080 rows of wires going horizontally. For a panel that is 28.8 inches (73 centimeters) wide, that means a wire density of 200 wires per inch along the horizontal edge.

The LCD panel is powered by LCD drivers that are carefully matched up with the edge of the LCD panel at the factory level. The drivers may be installed using several methods, the most common of which are COG (Chip-On-Glass) and TAB (Tape-automated bonding) These same principles apply also for smartphone screens that are much smaller than TV screens. LCD panels typically use thinly-coated metallic conductive pathways on a glass substrate to form the cell circuitry to operate the panel. It is usually not possible to use soldering techniques to directly connect the panel to a separate copper-etched circuit board. Instead, interfacing is accomplished using anisotropic conductive film or, for lower densities, elastomeric connectors.

==Passive-matrix==
Monochrome and later color passive-matrix LCDs were standard in most early laptops (although a few used plasma displays) and the original Nintendo Game Boy until the mid-1990s, when color active-matrix became standard on all laptops. The commercially unsuccessful Macintosh Portable (released in 1989) was one of the first to use an active-matrix display (though still monochrome). Passive-matrix LCDs are still used in the 2010s for applications less demanding than laptop computers and TVs, such as inexpensive calculators. In particular, these are used on portable devices where less information content needs to be displayed, lowest power consumption (no backlight) and low cost are desired or readability in direct sunlight is needed.

Displays having a passive-matrix structure use &quot;super-twisted nematic&quot; STN (invented by Brown Boveri Research Center, Baden, Switzerland, in 1983; scientific details were published) or double-layer STN (DSTN) technology (the latter of which addresses a color-shifting problem with the former), and color-STN (CSTN), in which color is added by using an internal color filter. STN LCDs have been optimized for passive-matrix addressing. They exhibit a sharper threshold of the contrast-vs-voltage characteristic than the original TN LCDs. This is important, because pixels are subjected to partial voltages even while not selected. Crosstalk between activated and non-activated pixels has to be handled properly by keeping the RMS voltage of non-activated pixels below the threshold voltage as discovered by Peter J. Wild in 1972, while activated pixels are subjected to voltages above threshold (the voltages according to the &quot;Alt &amp; Pleshko&quot; drive scheme). Driving such STN displays according to the Alt &amp; Pleshko drive scheme require very high line addressing voltages. Welzen and de Vaan invented an alternative drive scheme (a non &quot;Alt &amp; Pleshko&quot; drive scheme) requiring much lower voltages, such that the STN display could be driven using low voltage CMOS technologies. White-on-blue LCDs are STN and can use a blue polarizer, or birefringence which gives them their distinctive appearance.

STN LCDs have to be continuously refreshed by alternating pulsed voltages of one polarity during one frame and pulses of opposite polarity during the next frame. Individual pixels are addressed by the corresponding row and column circuits. This type of display is called &quot;passive-matrix addressed&quot;, because the pixel must retain its state between refreshes without the benefit of a steady electrical charge. As the number of pixels (and, correspondingly, columns and rows) increases, this type of display becomes less feasible. Slow response times and poor contrast are typical of passive-matrix addressed LCDs with too many pixels and driven according to the &quot;Alt &amp; Pleshko&quot; drive scheme. Welzen and de Vaan also invented a non RMS drive scheme enabling to drive STN displays with video rates and enabling to show smooth moving video images on an STN display. Citizen, among others, licensed these patents and successfully introduced several STN based LCD pocket televisions on the market.

Bistable LCDs do not require continuous refreshing. Rewriting is only required for picture information changes. In 1984 HA van Sprang and AJSM de Vaan invented an STN type display that could be operated in a bistable mode, enabling extremely high resolution images up to 4000 lines or more using only low voltages. Since a pixel may be either in an on-state or in an off state at the moment new information needs to be written to that particular pixel, the addressing method of these bistable displays is rather complex, a reason why these displays did not make it to the market. That changed when in the 2010 &quot;zero-power&quot; (bistable) LCDs became available. Potentially, passive-matrix addressing can be used with devices if their write/erase characteristics are suitable, which was the case for ebooks which need to show still pictures only. After a page is written to the display, the display may be cut from the power while retaining readable images. This has the advantage that such ebooks may be operated for long periods of time powered by only a small battery.

High-resolution color displays, such as modern LCD computer monitors and televisions, use an active-matrix structure. A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) is added to the electrodes in contact with the LC layer. Each pixel has its own dedicated transistor, allowing each column line to access one pixel. When a row line is selected, all of the column lines are connected to a row of pixels and voltages corresponding to the picture information are driven onto all of the column lines. The row line is then deactivated and the next row line is selected. All of the row lines are selected in sequence during a refresh operation. Active-matrix addressed displays look brighter and sharper than passive-matrix addressed displays of the same size, and generally have quicker response times, producing much better images. Sharp produces bistable reflective LCDs with a 1-bit SRAM cell per pixel that only requires small amounts of power to maintain an image.

Segment LCDs can also have color by using Field Sequential Color (FSC LCD). This kind of displays have a high speed passive segment LCD panel with an RGB backlight. The backlight quickly changes color, making it appear white to the naked eye. The LCD panel is synchronized with the backlight. For example, to make a segment appear red, the segment is only turned ON when the backlight is red, and to make a segment appear magenta, the segment is turned ON when the backlight is blue, and it continues to be ON while the backlight becomes red, and it turns OFF when the backlight becomes green. To make a segment appear black, the segment is always turned ON. An FSC LCD divides a color image into 3 images (one Red, one Green and one Blue) and it displays them in order. Due to persistence of vision, the 3 monochromatic images appear as one color image. An FSC LCD needs an LCD panel with a refresh rate of 180 Hz, and the response time is reduced to just 5 milliseconds when compared with normal STN LCD panels which have a response time of 16 milliseconds. FSC LCDs contain a Chip-On-Glass driver IC can also be used with a capacitive touchscreen. This technique can also be applied in displays meant to show images, as it can offer higher light transmission and thus potential for reduced power consumption in the backlight due to omission of color filters in LCDs.

Samsung introduced UFB (Ultra Fine &amp; Bright) displays back in 2002, utilized the super-birefringent effect. It has the luminance, color gamut, and most of the contrast of a TFT-LCD, but only consumes as much power as an STN display, according to Samsung. It was being used in a variety of Samsung cellular-telephone models produced until late 2006, when Samsung stopped producing UFB displays. UFB displays were also used in certain models of LG mobile phones.

==Active-matrix technologies==

===Twisted nematic (TN)===
Twisted nematic displays contain liquid crystals that twist and untwist at varying degrees to allow light to pass through. When no voltage is applied to a TN liquid crystal cell, polarized light passes through the 90-degrees twisted LC layer. In proportion to the voltage applied, the liquid crystals untwist changing the polarization and blocking the light&#x27;s path. By properly adjusting the level of the voltage almost any gray level or transmission can be achieved.

===In-plane switching (IPS)===

In-plane switching (IPS) is an LCD technology that aligns the liquid crystals in a plane parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation. This requires two transistors for each pixel instead of the single transistor needed for a standard thin-film transistor (TFT) display. IPS technology is used in everything from televisions, computer monitors, and even wearable devices, especially almost all LCD smartphone panels are IPS/FFS mode. IPS displays belong to the LCD panel family screen types. The other two types are VA and TN. Before LG Enhanced IPS was introduced in 2001 by Hitachi as 17&quot; monitor in Market, the additional transistors resulted in blocking more transmission area, thus requiring a brighter backlight and consuming more power, making this type of display less desirable for notebook computers. Panasonic Himeji G8.5 was using an enhanced version of IPS, also LG Display in Korea, then currently the world biggest LCD panel manufacture BOE in China is also IPS/FFS mode TV panel.

====Super In-plane switching (S-IPS)====
Super-IPS was later introduced after in-plane switching with even better response times and color reproduction.

=== M+ or RGBW controversy ===
In 2015 LG Display announced the implementation of a new technology called M+ which is the addition of white subpixel along with the regular RGB dots in their IPS panel technology.

Most of the new M+ technology was employed on 4K TV sets which led to a controversy after tests showed that the addition of a white sub pixel replacing the traditional RGB structure had also been accompanied by a reduction in resolution by around 25%. This meant that a &quot;4K&quot; M+ TV would not display the full UHD TV standard. The media and internet users called them &quot;RGBW&quot; TVs because of the white sub pixel. Although LG Display has developed this technology for use in notebook display, outdoor and smartphones, it became more popular in the TV market because of the announced &quot;4K UHD&quot; resolution but still being incapable of achieving true UHD resolution defined by the CTA as 3840x2160 active pixels with 8-bit color. This negatively impacted the rendering of text, making it a bit fuzzier, which was especially noticeable when a TV is used as a PC monitor.

===IPS in comparison to AMOLED===
In 2011, LG claimed the smartphone LG Optimus Black (IPS LCD (LCD NOVA)) has the brightness up to 700 nits, while the competitor has only IPS LCD with 518 nits and double an active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) display with 305 nits. LG also claimed the NOVA display to be 50 percent more efficient than regular LCDs and to consume only 50 percent of the power of AMOLED displays when producing white on screen. When it comes to contrast ratio, AMOLED display still performs best due to its underlying technology, where the black levels are displayed as pitch black and not as dark gray. On August 24, 2011, Nokia announced the Nokia 701 and also made the claim of the world&#x27;s brightest display at 1000 nits. The screen also had Nokia&#x27;s Clearblack layer, improving the contrast ratio and bringing it closer to that of the AMOLED screens.

===Advanced fringe field switching (AFFS)===
Known as fringe field switching (FFS) until 2003, advanced fringe field switching is similar to IPS or S-IPS offering superior performance and color gamut with high luminosity. AFFS was developed by Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd, Korea (formally Hyundai Electronics, LCD Task Force). AFFS-applied notebook applications minimize color distortion while maintaining a wider viewing angle for a professional display. Color shift and deviation caused by light leakage is corrected by optimizing the white gamut which also enhances white/gray reproduction. In 2004, Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd licensed AFFS to Japan&#x27;s Hitachi Displays. Hitachi is using AFFS to manufacture high-end panels. In 2006, HYDIS licensed AFFS to Sanyo Epson Imaging Devices Corporation. Shortly thereafter, Hydis introduced a high-transmittance evolution of the AFFS display, called HFFS (FFS+). Hydis introduced AFFS+ with improved outdoor readability in 2007. AFFS panels are mostly utilized in the cockpits of latest commercial aircraft displays. However, it is no longer produced as of February 2015.

===Vertical alignment (VA)===
Vertical-alignment displays are a form of LCDs in which the liquid crystals naturally align vertically to the glass substrates. When no voltage is applied, the liquid crystals remain perpendicular to the substrate, creating a black display between crossed polarizers. When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals shift to a tilted position, allowing light to pass through and create a gray-scale display depending on the amount of tilt generated by the electric field. It has a deeper-black background, a higher contrast ratio, a wider viewing angle, and better image quality at extreme temperatures than traditional twisted-nematic displays. Compared to IPS, the black levels are still deeper, allowing for a higher contrast ratio, but the viewing angle is narrower, with color and especially contrast shift being more apparent, and the cost of VA is lower than IPS (but higher than TN).

===Blue phase mode===
Blue phase mode LCDs have been shown as engineering samples early in 2008, but they are not in mass-production. The physics of blue phase mode LCDs suggest that very short switching times (≈1 ms) can be achieved, so time sequential color control can possibly be realized and expensive color filters would be obsolete.

==Quality control==
Some LCD panels have defective transistors, causing permanently lit or unlit pixels which are commonly referred to as stuck pixels or dead pixels respectively. Unlike integrated circuits (ICs), LCD panels with a few defective transistors are usually still usable. Manufacturers&#x27; policies for the acceptable number of defective pixels vary greatly. At one point, Samsung held a zero-tolerance policy for LCD monitors sold in Korea. Samsung adheres to the less restrictive ISO 13406-2 standard. Other companies have been known to tolerate as many as 11 dead pixels in their policies.

Dead pixel policies are often hotly debated between manufacturers and customers. To regulate the acceptability of defects and to protect the end user, ISO released the ISO 13406-2 standard, which was made obsolete in 2008 with the release of ISO 9241, specifically ISO-9241-302, 303, 305, 307:2008 pixel defects. However, not every LCD manufacturer conforms to the ISO standard and the ISO standard is quite often interpreted in different ways. LCD panels are more likely to have defects than most ICs due to their larger size.

Many manufacturers would replace a product even with one defective pixel. Even where such guarantees do not exist, the location of defective pixels is important. A display with only a few defective pixels may be unacceptable if the defective pixels are near each other. LCD panels also commonly have a defect known as &quot;clouding&quot;, &quot;dirty screen effect&quot;, or, less commonly, &quot;mura&quot;, which involves uneven patches of luminance on the panel. It is most visible in dark or black areas of displayed scenes. most premium branded computer LCD panel manufacturers specify their products as having zero defects.

==&quot;Zero-power&quot; (bistable) displays==
The zenithal bistable device (ZBD), developed by Qinetiq (formerly DERA), can retain an image without power. The crystals may exist in one of two stable orientations (&quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot;) and power is only required to change the image. ZBD Displays is a spin-off company from QinetiQ who manufactured both grayscale and color ZBD devices. Kent Displays has also developed a &quot;no-power&quot; display that uses polymer stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal (ChLCD). In 2009 Kent demonstrated the use of a ChLCD to cover the entire surface of a mobile phone, allowing it to change colors, and keep that color even when power is removed.

In 2004, researchers at the University of Oxford demonstrated two new types of zero-power bistable LCDs based on Zenithal bistable techniques. Several bistable technologies, like the 360° BTN and the bistable cholesteric, depend mainly on the bulk properties of the liquid crystal (LC) and use standard strong anchoring, with alignment films and LC mixtures similar to the traditional monostable materials. Other bistable technologies, &quot;e.g.&quot;, BiNem technology, are based mainly on the surface properties and need specific weak anchoring materials.

==Specifications==
* Resolution The resolution of an LCD is expressed by the number of columns and rows of pixels (e.g., 1024×768). Each pixel is usually composed of 3 sub-pixels, a red, a green, and a blue one. This had been one of the few features of LCD performance that remained uniform among different designs. However, there are newer designs that share sub-pixels among pixels and add Quattron which attempt to efficiently increase the perceived resolution of a display without increasing the actual resolution, to mixed results.
* Spatial performance: For a computer monitor or some other display that is being viewed from a very close distance, resolution is often expressed in terms of dot pitch or pixels per inch, which is consistent with the printing industry. Display density varies per application, with televisions generally having a low density for long-distance viewing and portable devices having a high density for close-range detail. The Viewing Angle of an LCD may be important depending on the display and its usage, the limitations of certain display technologies mean the display only displays accurately at certain angles.
* Temporal performance: the temporal resolution of an LCD is how well it can display changing images, or the accuracy and the number of times per second the display draws the data it is being given. LCD pixels do not flash on/off between frames, so LCD monitors exhibit no refresh-induced flicker no matter how low the refresh rate. But a lower refresh rate can mean visual artefacts like ghosting or smearing, especially with fast moving images. Individual pixel response time is also important, as all displays have some inherent latency in displaying an image which can be large enough to create visual artifacts if the displayed image changes rapidly.
* Color performance: There are multiple terms to describe different aspects of color performance of a display. Color gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed, and color depth, which is the fineness with which the color range is divided. Color gamut is a relatively straight forward feature, but it is rarely discussed in marketing materials except at the professional level. Having a color range that exceeds the content being shown on the screen has no benefits, so displays are only made to perform within or below the range of a certain specification. There are additional aspects to LCD color and color management, such as white point and gamma correction, which describe what color white is and how the other colors are displayed relative to white.
* Brightness and contrast ratio: Contrast ratio is the ratio of the brightness of a full-on pixel to a full-off pixel. The LCD itself is only a light valve and does not generate light; the light comes from a backlight that is either fluorescent or a set of LEDs. Brightness is usually stated as the maximum light output of the LCD, which can vary greatly based on the transparency of the LCD and the brightness of the backlight. Brighter backlight allows stronger contrast and higher dynamic range (HDR displays are graded in peak luminance), but there is always a trade-off between brightness and power consumption.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Some of these issues relate to full-screen displays, others to small displays as on watches, etc. Many of the comparisons are with CRT displays.

===Advantages===
* Very compact, thin and light, especially in comparison with CRT displays.
* Low power consumption. Depending on the set display brightness and content being displayed, the older CCFT backlit models typically use less than half of the power a CRT monitor of the same size viewing area would use, and the modern LED backlit models typically use 10–25% of the power a CRT monitor would use.
* Little heat emitted during operation, due to low power consumption.
* No geometric distortion.
* The possible ability to have little or no flicker depending on backlight technology.
* Usually no refresh-rate flicker, because the LCD pixels hold their state between refreshes (which are usually done at 200 Hz or faster, regardless of the input refresh rate).
* Sharp image with no bleeding or smearing when operated at native resolution.
* Emits almost no undesirable electromagnetic radiation (in the extremely low frequency range), unlike a CRT monitor.
* Can be made in almost any size or shape.
* No theoretical resolution limit. When multiple LCD panels are used together to create a single canvas, each additional panel increases the total resolution of the display, which is commonly called stacked resolution.
* Can be made in large sizes of over 80-inch (2 m) diagonal.
* LCDs can be made transparent and flexible, but they cannot emit light without a backlight like OLED and microLED, which are other technologies that can also be made flexible and transparent.
* Masking effect: the LCD grid can mask the effects of spatial and grayscale quantization, creating the illusion of higher image quality.
* Unaffected by magnetic fields, including the Earth&#x27;s, unlike most color CRTs. 
* As an inherently digital device, the LCD can natively display digital data from a DVI or HDMI connection without requiring conversion to analog. Some LCD panels have native fiber-optic inputs in addition to DVI and HDMI.
* Many LCD monitors are powered by a 12 V power supply, and if built into a computer can be powered by its 12 V power supply.
* Can be made with very narrow frame borders, allowing multiple LCD screens to be arrayed side by side to make up what looks like one big screen.

===Disadvantages===
* Limited viewing angle in some older or cheaper monitors, causing color, saturation, contrast and brightness to vary with user position, even within the intended viewing angle. Special films can be used to increase the viewing angles of LCDs.
* Uneven backlighting in some monitors (more common in IPS-types and older TNs), causing brightness distortion, especially toward the edges (&quot;backlight bleed&quot;).
* Black levels may not be as dark as required because individual liquid crystals cannot completely block all of the backlight from passing through.
* Display motion blur on moving objects caused by slow response times (&gt;8 ms) and eye-tracking on a sample-and-hold display, unless a strobing backlight is used. However, this strobing can cause eye strain, as is noted next:
* most implementations of LCD backlighting use pulse-width modulation (PWM) to dim the display, which makes the screen flicker more acutely (this does not mean visibly) than a CRT monitor at 85 Hz refresh rate would (this is because the entire screen is strobing on and off rather than a CRT&#x27;s phosphor sustained dot which continually scans across the display, leaving some part of the display always lit), causing severe eye-strain for some people. Unfortunately, many of these people don&#x27;t know that their eye-strain is being caused by the invisible strobe effect of PWM. This problem is worse on many LED-backlit monitors, because the LEDs switch on and off faster than a CCFL lamp.
* Only one native resolution. Displaying any other resolution either requires a video scaler, causing blurriness and jagged edges, or running the display at native resolution using 1:1 pixel mapping, causing the image either not to fill the screen (letterboxed display), or to run off the one or more edges of the screen.
* Fixed bit depth (also called color depth). Many cheaper LCDs are only able to display 262144 (218) colors. 8-bit S-IPS panels can display 16 million (224) colors and have significantly better black level, but are expensive and have slower response time.
* Input lag, because the LCD&#x27;s A/D converter waits for each frame to be completely been output before drawing it to the LCD panel. Many LCD monitors do post-processing before displaying the image in an attempt to compensate for poor color fidelity, which adds an additional lag. Further, a video scaler must be used when displaying non-native resolutions, which adds yet more time lag. Scaling and post processing are usually done in a single chip on modern monitors, but each function that chip performs adds some delay. Some displays have a video gaming mode which disables all or most processing to reduce perceivable input lag.
* Dead or stuck pixels may occur during manufacturing or after a period of use. A stuck pixel will glow with color even on an all-black screen, while a dead one will always remain black.
* Subject to burn-in effect, although the cause differs from CRT and the effect may not be permanent, a static image can cause burn-in in a matter of hours in badly designed displays.
* In a constant-on situation, thermalization may occur in case of bad thermal management, in which part of the screen has overheated and looks discolored compared to the rest of the screen.
* Loss of brightness and much slower response times in low temperature environments. In sub-zero environments, LCD screens may cease to function without the use of supplemental heating.
* Loss of contrast in high temperature environments.

==Chemicals used==
Several different families of liquid crystals are used in liquid crystal displays. The molecules used have to be anisotropic, and to exhibit mutual attraction. Polarizable rod-shaped molecules (biphenyls, terphenyls, etc.) are common. A common form is a pair of aromatic benzene rings, with a nonpolar moiety (pentyl, heptyl, octyl, or alkyl oxy group) on one end and polar (nitrile, halogen) on the other. Sometimes the benzene rings are separated with an acetylene group, ethylene, CH=N, CH=NO, N=N, N=NO, or ester group. In practice, eutectic mixtures of several chemicals are used, to achieve wider temperature operating range (−10..+60 °C for low-end and −20..+100 °C for high-performance displays). For example, the E7 mixture is composed of three biphenyls and one terphenyl: 39 wt.% of 4&#x27;-pentyl[1,1&#x27;-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 24..35 °C), 36 wt.% of 4&#x27;-heptyl[1,1&#x27;-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 30..43 °C), 16 wt.% of 4&#x27;-octoxy[1,1&#x27;-biphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 54..80 °C), and 9 wt.% of 4&quot;-pentyl[1,1&#x27;:4&#x27;,1&quot;-terphenyl]-4-carbonitrile (nematic range 131..240 °C).

===Environmental impact===
The production of LCD screens uses nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) as an etching fluid during the production of the thin-film components. NF3 is a potent greenhouse gas, and its relatively long half-life may make it a potentially harmful contributor to global warming. A report in &quot;Geophysical Research Letters&quot; suggested that its effects were theoretically much greater than better-known sources of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide. As NF3 was not in widespread use at the time, it was not made part of the Kyoto Protocol and was deemed &quot;the missing greenhouse gas&quot;. NF3 was added to the Kyoto Protocol for the second compliance period during the Doha Round.

Critics of the report point out that it assumes that all of the NF3 produced would be released to the atmosphere. In reality, the vast majority of NF3 is broken down during the cleaning processes; two earlier studies found that only 2 to 3% of the gas escapes destruction after its use. Furthermore, the report failed to compare NF3&#x27;s effects with what it replaced, perfluorocarbon, another powerful greenhouse gas, of which anywhere from 30 to 70% escapes to the atmosphere in typical use.

<text>Latency, from a general point of view, is a time delay between the cause and the effect of some physical change in the system being observed. Lag, as it is known in gaming circles, refers to the latency between the input to a simulation and the visual or auditory response, often occurring because of network delay in online games. The original meaning of “latency”, as used widely in psychology, medicine and most other disciplines, derives from “latent”, a word of Latin origin meaning “hidden” .  Its different and relatively recent meaning (this topic) of “lateness” or “delay” appears to derive from its superficial similarity to the word “late”, from the old English “laet”.

Latency is physically a consequence of the limited velocity at which any physical interaction can propagate. The magnitude of this velocity is always less than or equal to the speed of light. Therefore, every physical system with any physical separation (distance) between cause and effect will experience some sort of latency, regardless of the nature of the stimulation to which it has been exposed.

The precise definition of latency depends on the system being observed or the nature of the simulation. In communications, the lower limit of latency is determined by the medium being used to transfer information. In reliable two-way communication systems, latency limits the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted, as there is often a limit on the amount of information that is in-flight at any given moment. Perceptible latency has a strong effect on user satisfaction and usability in the field of human–machine interaction.

==Communications==

Online games are sensitive to latency (lag), since fast response times to new events occurring during a game session are rewarded while slow response times may carry penalties. Due to a delay in transmission of game events, a player with a high latency internet connection may show slow responses in spite of appropriate reaction time. This gives players with low-latency connections a technical advantage.

=== Capital markets ===
Joel Hasbrouck and Gideon Saar (2011) measure latency to execute financial transactions based on three components: the time it takes for information to reach the trader, execution of the trader&#x27;s algorithms to analyze the information and decide a course of action, and the generated action to reach the exchange and get implemented. Hasbrouck and Saar contrast this with the way in which latencies are measured by many trading venues that use much more narrow definitions, such as the processing delay measured from the entry of the order (at the vendor&#x27;s computer) to the transmission of an acknowledgment (from the vendor&#x27;s computer). Trading using computers has developed to the point where millisecond improvements in network speeds offer a competitive advantage for financial institutions.

===Packet-switched networks===
Network latency in a packet-switched network is measured as either one-way (the time from the source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or round-trip delay time (the one-way latency from the source to the destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source). Round-trip latency is more often quoted, because it can be measured from a single point. Many software platforms provide a service called ping that can be used to measure round-trip latency. Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) &quot;echo request&quot; which causes the recipient to send the received packet as an immediate response, thus it provides a rough way of measuring round-trip delay time. Ping cannot perform accurate measurements, principally because ICMP is intended only for diagnostic or control purposes, and differs from real communication protocols such as TCP. Furthermore, routers and internet service providers might apply different traffic shaping policies to different protocols. For more accurate measurements it is better to use specific software, for example: hping, Netperf or Iperf.

However, in a non-trivial network, a typical packet will be forwarded over multiple links and gateways, each of which will not begin to forward the packet until it has been completely received. In such a network, the minimal latency is the sum of the transmission delay of each link, plus the forwarding latency of each gateway. In practice, minimal latency also includes queuing and processing delays. Queuing delay occurs when a gateway receives multiple packets from different sources heading toward the same destination. Since typically only one packet can be transmitted at a time, some of the packets must queue for transmission, incurring additional delay. Processing delays are incurred while a gateway determines what to do with a newly received packet. Bufferbloat can also cause increased latency that is an order of magnitude or more. The combination of propagation, serialization, queuing, and processing delays often produces a complex and variable network latency profile.

Latency limits total throughput in reliable two-way communication systems as described by the bandwidth-delay product.

===Fiber optics===
Latency in optical fiber is largely a function of the speed of light. This would equate to a latency of 3.33 μs for every kilometer of path length. The index of refraction of most fiber optic cables is about 1.5, meaning that light travels about 1.5 times as fast in a vacuum as it does in the cable. This works out to about 5.0 μs of latency for every kilometer. In shorter metro networks, higher latency can be experienced due to extra distance in building risers and cross-connects. To calculate the latency of a connection, one has to know the distance traveled by the fiber, which is rarely a straight line, since it has to traverse geographic contours and obstacles, such as roads and railway tracks, as well as other rights-of-way.

Due to imperfections in the fiber, light degrades as it is transmitted through it. For distances of greater than 100 kilometers, amplifiers or regenerators are deployed. Latency introduced by these components needs to be taken into account.

===Satellite transmission===
Satellites in geostationary orbits are far enough away from Earth that communication latency becomes significant – about a quarter of a second for a trip from one ground-based transmitter to the satellite and back to another ground-based transmitter; close to half a second for two-way communication from one Earth station to another and then back to the first. Low Earth orbit is sometimes used to cut this delay, at the expense of more complicated satellite tracking on the ground and requiring more satellites in the satellite constellation to ensure continuous coverage.

==Audio==
Audio latency is the delay between when an audio signal enters and when it emerges from a system. Potential contributors to latency in an audio system include analog-to-digital conversion, buffering, digital signal processing, transmission time, digital-to-analog conversion and the speed of sound in air.

==Video==
Video latency refers to the degree of delay between the time a transfer of a video stream is requested and the actual time that transfer begins. Networks that exhibit relatively small delays are known as low-latency networks, while their counterparts are known as high-latency networks.

==Workflow==
Any individual workflow within a system of workflows can be subject to some type of operational latency. It may even be the case that an individual system may have more than one type of latency, depending on the type of participant or goal-seeking behavior. This is best illustrated by the following two examples involving air travel.

From the point of view of a passenger, latency can be described as follows. Suppose John Doe flies from London to New York. The latency of his trip is the time it takes him to go from his house in England to the hotel he is staying at in New York. This is independent of the throughput of the London-New York air link – whether there were 100 passengers a day making the trip or 10000, the latency of the trip would remain the same.

From the point of view of flight operations personnel, latency can be entirely different. Consider the staff at the London and New York airports. Only a limited number of planes are able to make the transatlantic journey, so when one lands they must prepare it for the return trip as quickly as possible. It might take, for example:
*35 minutes to clean a plane
*15 minutes to refuel a plane
*10 minutes to load the passengers
*30 minutes to load the cargo

Assuming the above are done consecutively, minimum plane turnaround time is:
:35 + 15 + 10 + 30 = 90

However, cleaning, refueling and loading the cargo can be done at the same time. Passengers can only be loaded after cleaning is complete. The reduced latency, then, is:
:35 + 10 = 45
:15
:30
:Minimum latency = 45

The people involved in the turnaround are interested only in the time it takes for their individual tasks. When all of the tasks are done at the same time, however, it is possible to reduce the latency to the length of the longest task. If some steps have prerequisites, it becomes more difficult to perform all steps in parallel. In the example above, the requirement to clean the plane before loading passengers results in a minimum latency longer than any single task.

==Mechanics==
Any mechanical process encounters limitations modeled by Newtonian physics. The behavior of disk drives provides an example of mechanical latency. Here, it is the time seek time for the actuator arm to be positioned above the appropriate track and then rotational latency for the data encoded on a platter to rotate from its current position to a position under the disk read-and-write head.

==Computer hardware and software systems==
Computers run instructions in the context of a process. In the context of computer multitasking, the execution of the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing. In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding. For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card&#x27;s voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000 Hz. The operating system schedules the process for each transition (high-low or low-high) based on a hardware clock such as the High Precision Event Timer. The latency is the delay between the events generated by the hardware clock and the actual transitions of voltage from high to low or low to high.

Many desktop operating systems have performance limitations that create additional latency. The problem may be mitigated with real-time extensions and patches such as PREEMPT RT.

On embedded systems, the real-time execution of instructions is often supported by a real-time operating system.

Note that in software systems, benchmarking against &quot;average&quot; and &quot;median&quot; latency can be misleading because few outlier numbers can distort them. Instead, software architects and software developers should use &quot;99th percentile&quot;.

==Simulations==
In simulation applications, latency refers to the time delay, often measured in milliseconds, between initial input and output clearly discernible to the simulator trainee or simulator subject. Latency is sometimes also called &quot;transport delay&quot;. Some authorities distinguish between latency and transport delay by using the term &quot;latency&quot; in the sense of the extra time delay of a system over and above the reaction time of the vehicle being simulated, but this requires detailed knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and can be controversial.

In simulators with both visual and motion systems, it is particularly important that the latency of the motion system not be greater than of the visual system, or symptoms of simulator sickness may result. This is because, in the real world, motion cues are those of acceleration and are quickly transmitted to the brain, typically in less than 50 milliseconds; this is followed some milliseconds later by a perception of change in the visual scene. The visual scene change is essentially one of change of perspective or displacement of objects such as the horizon, which takes some time to build up to discernible amounts after the initial acceleration which caused the displacement. A simulator should, therefore, reflect the real-world situation by ensuring that the motion latency is equal to or less than that of the visual system and not the other way round.

<text>The history of public transport authorities in London details the various organisations that have been responsible for the public transport network in and around London, England - including buses, coaches, trams, trolleybuses, Docklands Light Railway, and the London Underground.

From 1933 until 2000, these bodies used the London Transport brand. The period began with the creation of the London Passenger Transport Board, which covered the County of London and adjacent counties within a 30-mile (48-km) radius. This area later came under the control of the London Transport Executive and then the London Transport Board. The area of responsibility was reduced to that of the Greater London administrative area in 1970 when the Greater London Council, and then London Regional Transport took over responsibility.

Since 2000, the Greater London Authority has been the transport authority and the executive agency has been called Transport for London; ending the 67-year use of the &quot;London Transport&quot; name.

==Background==
Prior to 1933, the ownership and management of the transport system in London was distributed among a large number of independent and separate organisations. The Underground railway system had been developed and was owned by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and the Metropolitan Railway. Tram and Trolleybus networks were owned by various local authorities and public companies and buses were owned by numerous companies. Many of these services were in competition with one another leading to wasteful duplication. The London County Council managed tram operations within the County of London, but its responsibility did not extend to the bus or tram routes that ran outside its area; or to the railways, which also extended into neighbouring counties. A Royal Commission on London Government in the 1920s did not permit the London County Council to extend its area of responsibility and an ad hoc London Traffic Area was created to regulate motor traffic in the wider London region. In the 1930s another ad hoc solution was sought to improve the control and coordination of public transport.

==London&#x27;s transport authorities==

===1933-1948: London Passenger Transport Board===
The London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was the transport authority from 1 July 1933 to 31 December 1947. It unified services in the London area for the first time. The London Passenger Transport Act 1933 removed responsibility for of tram route from the London County Council, three county boroughs and a number of other local authorities in the Greater London area. It brought the UERL lines under the same control, and took over supervision of buses from the Metropolitan Police. The area of responsibility of the LPTB was far greater than the current Greater London boundaries and was known as the London Passenger Transport Area. The period saw massive expansion of the tube network and was directly responsible for the expansion of the suburbs. The extensive New Works Programme was halted by World War II, with some projects abandoned and others completed after the end of hostilities. The &#x27;roundel symbol&#x27; designed in 1918 was adopted by London Passenger Transport Board and the London Transport brand and architectural style was perfected during this period. The iconic tube map designed in 1931, was published in 1933.

===1948-1963: London Transport Executive===

The London Transport Executive (LTE) was the transport authority from 1 January 1948 to 31 December 1962. London Transport was taken into public ownership and became part of the British Transport Commission, which brought London Transport and British Railways under the same control for the first and last time. The period saw the start of direct recruitment from the Caribbean and the repair and replacement of stock and stations damaged during the war as well as completion of delayed projects such as the Central line eastern extension. The AEC Routemaster bus was introduced in 1956. Trams were withdrawn in 1952 and trolleybuses in 1962.

===1963-1970: London Transport Board===

The London Transport Board was the transport authority from 1 January 1963 to 31 December 1969 It reported directly to the Minister of Transport, ending its direct association with the management of British Railways. During this period many of Britain&#x27;s unprofitable railways were closed down, as most routes in the capital were widely used the Beeching Axe had little effect. However, during this period there was little investment in public transport and the motor car increased in popularity. During this period, the Victoria line was opened - although work had started in the early 1960s - and the AEC Merlin single-deck bus was introduced.

===1970-1984: London Transport Executive===
The Greater London Council was the transport authority from 1 January 1970 to 28 June 1984 and the executive agency was called the London Transport Executive. The legislation creating the Greater London Council (GLC) was already passed in 1963 when the London Transport Board was created. However, control did not pass to the new authority until 1 January 1970. The GLC broadly controlled only those services within the boundaries of Greater London. The (green painted) country buses and Green Line Coaches had been passed in 1969 to a new company, London Country Bus Services, which in 1970 became part of the National Bus Company. The period is perhaps the most controversial in London&#x27;s transport history and there was a severe lack of funding from central government and staff shortages.

The inter-modal zonal ticketing system currently used by Transport for London originated in this period. Following the Greater London Council election in 1981, the incoming Labour administration simplified fares in Greater London by introducing four new bus fare zones and two central London Underground zones, named &quot;City&quot; and &quot;West End&quot;, where flat fares applied for the first time. This was accompanied by a cut in prices of about a third and was marketed as the &quot;Fares Fair&quot; campaign. Following successful legal action against it, on 21 March 1982 London Buses fares were subsequently doubled and London Underground fares increased by 91%. The two central area zones were retained and the fares to all other stations were restructured to be graduated at three-mile intervals. In 1983, a third revision of fares was undertaken, and a new inter-modal Travelcard season ticket was launched covering five new numbered zones; representing an overall cut in prices of around 25%. The &quot;One Day Travelcard&quot; was launched in 1984 and on weekdays was only sold for travel after 09.30.

===1984-2000: London Regional Transport===

London Regional Transport was the transport authority from 29 June 1984 to 2 July 2000. The GLC was abolished in 1986 with responsibility for public transport removed two years earlier in 1984. The new authority, London Regional Transport (LRT), again came under direct state control, reporting to the Secretary of State for Transport. The London Regional Transport Act contained provision for setting up subsidiary companies to run the Underground and bus services and in 1985 London Underground Limited (LUL), a wholly owned subsidiary of London Regional Transport, was set up to manage the tube network. In 1988 ten individual line business units were created to manage the network. London Buses Limited was constituted to progress the privatisation of London bus services. London Transport was converted to a route operating contract tendering authority, and the former bus operating interests and assets of London Transport were split into 12 business units under the banner &quot;London Buses&quot;. The 12 units competed for contracts with private operators from 1984, and were all sold off by 1994/5 becoming private operators themselves.

Further amendments to the fare system were made during this period, including inclusion of the separately managed British Rail services. In January 1985 the &quot;Capitalcard&quot; season ticket was launched, offering validity on British Rail as well as London Underground and London Buses. It was priced around 10-15% higher than the Travelcard. In June 1986 the &quot;One Day Capitalcard&quot; was launched. The Capitalcard brand ended in January 1989 when the Travelcard gained validity on British Rail. In January 1991 Zone 5 was split to create a new Zone 6. The Docklands Light Railway was opened on 31 August 1987 and was included in the zonal Travelcard ticketing scheme.

===2000 onwards: Transport for London===
The Greater London Authority, a replacement authority for the GLC, was set up in 2000 with a transport executive called Transport for London (TfL) that took control from 3 July 2000. It is the first London transport authority since 1933 not to be commonly called &quot;London Transport&quot;. Unlike previous transport bodies, TfL gained responsibility for a wide variety of other transportation functions - including management of major roads in London, walking &amp; cycling as well as taxi and private hire licensing. The London Underground did not pass to TfL until after a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) agreement for maintenance was completed in 2003. In 2017, TfL became the longest running transportation body in London - following London Regional Transport.

<doc id="17939" wikidata="Q9128" url="?curid=17939" title="Light">
<text>Light, visible light, or visible radiation is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies), called collectively &quot;optical radiation&quot;.

In physics, the term &quot;light&quot; may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum, and polarization. Its speed in vacuum, , is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.

The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.

==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==

Generally, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is classified by wavelength into radio waves, microwaves, infrared, the visible spectrum that we perceive as light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. The designation &quot;radiation&quot; excludes static electric, magnetic and near fields.

The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.

EMR in the visible light region consists of quanta (called photons) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.

There exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. Infrared sensing in snakes depends on a kind of natural thermal imaging, in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.

Above the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 nm and the internal lens below 400 nm. Furthermore, the rods and cones located in the retina of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360 nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.

Various sources define visible light as narrowly as 420–680 nm to as broadly as 380–800 nm. Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1,050 nm; children and young adults may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about 310–313 nm.

Plant growth is also affected by the colour spectrum of light, a process known as photomorphogenesis.

== Speed of light ==
The speed of light in vacuum is defined to be exactly (approximately 186,282 miles per second). The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.

Different physicists have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by Ole Rømer, a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a telescope, Rømer observed the motions of Jupiter and one of its moons, Io. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io&#x27;s orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth&#x27;s orbit. However, its size was not known at that time. If Rømer had known the diameter of the Earth&#x27;s orbit, he would have calculated a speed of .

Another more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating cog wheel was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin. Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as .

Léon Foucault carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of in 1862. Albert A. Michelson conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault&#x27;s methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from Mount Wilson to Mount San Antonio in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of .

The effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary matter, is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.

Two independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a &quot;complete standstill&quot; by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the other at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being &quot;stopped&quot; in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had &quot;stopped&quot;, it had ceased to be light.

==Optics==

The study of light and the interaction of light and matter is termed &quot;optics&quot;. The observation and study of optical phenomena such as rainbows and the aurora borealis offer many clues as to the nature of light.

A transparent object allows light to transmit or pass through. Conversely, an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead reflecting or absorbing the light it receives. Most objects do not reflect or transmit light specularly and to some degree scatters the incoming light, which is called glossiness. Surface scatterance is caused by the surface roughness of the reflecting surfaces, and internal scatterance is caused by the difference of refractive index between the particles and medium inside the object. Like transparent objects, translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but translucent objects also scatter certain wavelength of light via internal scatterance.

===Refraction===

Refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by Snell&#x27;s Law:

:formula_1

where θ1 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the first medium, θ2 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium and n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction, &quot;n&quot; = 1 in a vacuum and &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 in a transparent substance.

When a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not orthogonal (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as refraction.

The refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. Magnifying glasses, spectacles, contact lenses, microscopes and refracting telescopes are all examples of this manipulation.

==Light sources== 

There are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of black-body radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around . Solar radiation peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units, and roughly 44% of the radiation that reaches the ground is visible. Another example is incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.

The peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one and finally a blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal is heated to &quot;red hot&quot; or &quot;white hot&quot;. Blue-white thermal emission is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour in a gas flame or a welder&#x27;s torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals emitting a wavelength band around 425 nm and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).

Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces &quot;emission lines&quot; in the spectrum of each atom. Emission can be spontaneous, as in light-emitting diodes, gas discharge lamps (such as neon lamps and neon signs, mercury-vapor lamps, etc.) and flames (light from the hot gas itself—so, for example, sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be stimulated, as in a laser or a microwave maser.

Deceleration of a free charged particle, such as an electron, can produce visible radiation: cyclotron radiation, synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.

Certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as fluorescence. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as phosphorescence. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. Cathodoluminescence is one example. This mechanism is used in cathode-ray tube television sets and computer monitors.

Certain other mechanisms can produce light:
* Electroluminescence
* Scintillation
* Sonoluminescence
* Triboluminescence

When the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:
* Particle–antiparticle annihilation
* Radioactive decay

==Measurement==
Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units: radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception. Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify Illumination (lighting) intended for human use.

The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555 nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m2) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how &quot;bright&quot; a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly, photocells and charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to respond to some infrared, ultraviolet or both.

==Light pressure==

Light exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell&#x27;s equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by &quot;c&quot;, the speed of light. Due to the magnitude of &quot;c&quot;, the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects. For example, a one-milliwatt laser pointer exerts a force of about 3.3 piconewtons on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a U.S. penny with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers. However, in nanometre-scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research. At larger scales, light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster, acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill. The possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.

Although the motion of the Crookes radiometer was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum. This should not be confused with the Nichols radiometer, in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not enough for full rotation against friction) &quot;is&quot; directly caused by light pressure.
As a consequence of light pressure, Einstein in 1909 predicted the existence of &quot;radiation friction&quot; which would oppose the movement of matter. He wrote, &quot;radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant &#x27;radiation friction&#x27; in brief.&quot;

Usually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion. However, for example in evanescent waves momentum is transverse to direction of propagation.

==Historical theories about light, in chronological order==

===Classical Greece and Hellenism===
In the fifth century BC, Empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that goddess Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun.

In about 300 BC, Euclid wrote &quot;Optica&quot;, in which he studied the properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes one&#x27;s eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem.

In 55 BC, Lucretius, a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek atomists, wrote that &quot;The light &amp; heat of the sun; these are composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove.&quot; (from &quot;On the nature of the Universe&quot;). Despite being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius&#x27;s views were not generally accepted. Ptolemy (c. second century) wrote about the refraction of light in his book &quot;Optics&quot;.

===Classical India===
In ancient India, the Hindu schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika, from around the early centuries AD developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental &quot;subtle&quot; elements (&quot;tanmatra&quot;) out of which emerge the gross elements. The atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.
The &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; refers to sunlight as &quot;the seven rays of the sun&quot;.

The Indian Buddhists, such as Dignāga in the fifth century and Dharmakirti in the seventh century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.

===Descartes===
René Descartes (1596–1650) held that light was a mechanical property of the luminous body, rejecting the &quot;forms&quot; of Ibn al-Haytham and Witelo as well as the &quot;species&quot; of Roger Bacon, Robert Grosseteste and Johannes Kepler. In 1637 he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves. Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.

Descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes&#x27;s theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.

===Particle theory===
Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s. Isaac Newton studied Gassendi&#x27;s work at an early age and preferred his view to Descartes&#x27;s theory of the &quot;plenum&quot;. He stated in his &quot;Hypothesis of Light&quot; of 1675 that light was composed of corpuscles (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton&#x27;s arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of light (which had been observed by Francesco Grimaldi) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether.

Newton&#x27;s theory could be used to predict the reflection of light, but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his &quot;Opticks&quot; of 1704. His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the eighteenth century. The particle theory of light led Pierre-Simon Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a black hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton&#x27;s essay on light appears in &quot;The large scale structure of space-time&quot;, by Stephen Hawking and George F. R. Ellis.

The fact that light could be polarized was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. Étienne-Louis Malus in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.

=== Wave theory ===
To explain the origin of colours, Robert Hooke (1635–1703) developed a &quot;pulse theory&quot; and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work &quot;Micrographia&quot; (&quot;Observation IX&quot;). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light&#x27;s vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678 and published it in his &quot;Treatise on Light&quot; in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous aether. As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium. Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler. He argued in &quot;Nova theoria lucis et colorum&quot; (1746) that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory.

The wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by Thomas Young). Young showed by means of a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves. He first publicly stated his &#x27;general law&#x27; of interference in January 1802, in his book &quot;A Syllabus of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental Philosophy&quot;:But the general law, by which all these appearances are governed, may be very easily deduced from the interference of two coincident undulations, which either cooperate, or destroy each other, in the same manner as two musical notes produce an alternate intension and remission, in the beating of an imperfect unison.He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of three-coloured receptors in the eye. 

In 1816 André-Marie Ampère gave Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a transverse wave. Later, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it to the Académie des Sciences in 1817. Siméon Denis Poisson added to Fresnel&#x27;s mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory. By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.

The weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the Michelson–Morley experiment.

Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the speed of light could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was Léon Foucault, in 1850. His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned (only to partly re-emerge in the twentieth century as photons in quantum theory).

===Electromagnetic theory===

In 1845, Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric, an effect now known as Faraday rotation. This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines. Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.

Faraday&#x27;s work inspired James Clerk Maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in &quot;On Physical Lines of Force&quot;. In 1873, he published &quot;A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Soon after, Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell&#x27;s theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference. Maxwell&#x27;s theory and Hertz&#x27;s experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications.

In the quantum theory, photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell&#x27;s classical theory could not (such as spectral lines).

===Quantum theory===
In 1900 Max Planck, attempting to explain black-body radiation, suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these &quot;lumps&quot; of light energy &quot;quanta&quot; (from a Latin word for &quot;how much&quot;). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a &quot;real&quot; existence. In 1923 Arthur Holly Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called Compton scattering) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 Gilbert N. Lewis named these light quanta particles photons.

Eventually quantum mechanics came to picture light as (in some sense) &quot;both&quot; a particle and a wave, and (in another sense) as a phenomenon which is &quot;neither&quot; a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, under some approximations light can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles) and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (waves).

As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.

In 1924–1925, Satyendra Nath Bose showed that light followed different statistics from that of classical particles. With Einstein, they generalized this result for a whole set of integer spin particles called bosons (after Bose) that follow Bose–Einstein statistics. The photon is a massless boson of spin 1.

In 1927, Paul Dirac quantized the electromagnetic field. Pascual Jordan and Vladimir Fock generalized this process to treat many-body systems as excitations of quantum fields, a process with the misnomer of second quantization. And at the end of the 1940s a full theory of quantum electrodynamics was developed using quantum fields based on the works of Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, Freeman Dyson, and Shinichiro Tomonaga.

=== Quantum optics ===

John R. Klauder, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light (see degree of coherence). This led to the introduction of the coherent state as a concept which addressed variations between laser light, thermal light, exotic squeezed states, etc. as it became understood that light cannot be fully described just referring to the electromagnetic fields describing the waves in the classical picture. In 1977, H. Jeff Kimble et al. demonstrated a single atom emitting one photon at a time, further compelling evidence that light consists of photons. Previously unknown quantum states of light with characteristics unlike classical states, such as squeezed light were subsequently discovered.

Development of short and ultrashort laser pulses—created by Q switching and modelocking techniques—opened the way to the study of what became known as ultrafast processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. Raman spectroscopy) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an optical trap or optical tweezers by laser beam. This, along with Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling, was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose–Einstein condensation.

Other remarkable results are the demonstration of quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, and quantum logic gates. The latter are of much interest in quantum information theory, a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical computer science.

==Use for light on Earth==
Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide themselves from prey.

<text>Lipids are a broad group of organic compounds which include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E and K), monoglycerides, diglycerides, phospholipids, and others. The functions of lipids include storing energy, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes. Lipids have applications in the cosmetic and food industries, and in nanotechnology.

Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or &quot;building-blocks&quot;: ketoacyl and isoprene groups. Using this approach, lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits).

Although the term &quot;lipid&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), as well as other sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.

==History==
In 1815, Henri Braconnot classified lipids (&quot;graisses&quot;) in two categories, &quot;suifs&quot; (solid greases or tallow) and &quot;huiles&quot; (fluid oils). In 1823, Michel Eugène Chevreul developed a more detailed classification, including oils, greases, tallow, waxes, resins, balsams and volatile oils (or essential oils).

The first synthetic triglyceride was reported by Théophile-Jules Pelouze in 1844, when he produced tributyrin by treating butyric acid with glycerin in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid. Several years later, Marcellin Berthelot, one of Pelouze&#x27;s students, synthesized tristearin and tripalmitin by reaction of the analogous fatty acids with glycerin in the presence of gaseous hydrogen chloride at high temperature.

In 1827, William Prout recognized fat (&quot;oily&quot; alimentary matters), along with protein (&quot;albuminous&quot;) and carbohydrate (&quot;saccharine&quot;), as an important nutrient for humans and animals.

For a century, chemists regarded &quot;fats&quot; as only simple lipids made of fatty acids and glycerol (glycerides), but new forms were described later. Theodore Gobley (1847) discovered phospholipids in mammalian brain and hen egg, called by him as &quot;lecithins&quot;. Thudichum discovered in human brain some phospholipids (cephalin), glycolipids (cerebroside) and sphingolipids (sphingomyelin).

The terms lipoid, lipin, lipide and lipid have been used with varied meanings from author to author. In 1912, Rosenbloom and Gies proposed the substitution of &quot;lipoid&quot; by &quot;lipin&quot;. In 1920, Bloor introduced a new classification for &quot;lipoids&quot;: simple lipoids (greases and waxes), compound lipoids (phospholipoids and glycolipoids), and the derived lipoids (fatty acids, alcohols, sterols).

The word &quot;lipide&quot;, which stems etymologically from Greek λίπος, &quot;lipos&quot; &#x27;fat&#x27;, was introduced in 1923 by the French pharmacologist Gabriel Bertrand. Bertrand included in the concept not only the traditional fats (glycerides), but also the &quot;lipoids&quot;, with a complex constitution. The word &quot;lipide&quot; was unanimously approved by the international commission of the &quot;Société de Chimie Biologique&quot; during the plenary session on July 3, 1923. The word &quot;lipide&quot; was later anglicized as &quot;lipid&quot; because of its pronunciation (&#x27;lɪpɪd). In French, the suffix &quot;-ide&quot;, from Ancient Greek -ίδης (meaning &#x27;son of&#x27; or &#x27;descendant of&#x27;), is always pronounced (ɪd).

In 1947, T. P. Hilditch defined &quot;simple lipids&quot; as greases and waxes (true waxes, sterols, alcohols).

== Categories ==
Lipids have been classified into eight categories by the Lipid MAPS consortium as follows:

===Fatty acyls===


Fatty acyls, a generic term for describing fatty acids, their conjugates and derivatives, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;trans&quot; geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule&#x27;s configuration. &quot;Cis&quot;-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon &quot;linolenic acid&quot;, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant &quot;thylakoid membranes&quot;, render these membranes highly &quot;fluid&quot; despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the &quot;cis&quot; configuration, although the &quot;trans&quot; form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.

Examples of biologically important fatty acids include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid is also important in biological systems, particularly with respect to sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.

===Glycerolipids===
Glycerolipids are composed of mono-, di-, and tri-substituted glycerols, the best-known being the fatty acid triesters of glycerol, called triglycerides. The word &quot;triacylglycerol&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;triglyceride&quot;. In these compounds, the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are each esterified, typically by different fatty acids. Because they function as an energy store, these lipids comprise the bulk of storage fat in animal tissues. The hydrolysis of the ester bonds of triglycerides and the release of glycerol and fatty acids from adipose tissue are the initial steps in metabolizing fat.

Additional subclasses of glycerolipids are represented by glycosylglycerols, which are characterized by the presence of one or more sugar residues attached to glycerol via a glycosidic linkage. Examples of structures in this category are the digalactosyldiacylglycerols found in plant membranes and seminolipid from mammalian sperm cells.

===Glycerophospholipids===

Glycerophospholipids, usually referred to as phospholipids (though sphingomyelins are also classified as phospholipids), are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, as well as being involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based on the nature of the polar headgroup at the &quot;sn&quot;-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the &quot;sn&quot;-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.

Examples of glycerophospholipids found in biological membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to serving as a primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, one or both of these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.

===Sphingolipids===

Sphingolipids are a complicated family of compounds that share a common structural feature, a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; from the amino acid serine and a long-chain fatty acyl CoA, then converted into ceramides, phosphosphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and other compounds. The major sphingoid base of mammals is commonly referred to as sphingosine. Ceramides (N-acyl-sphingoid bases) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide-linked fatty acid. The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono-unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms.

The major phosphosphingolipids of mammals are sphingomyelins (ceramide phosphocholines), whereas insects contain mainly ceramide phosphoethanolamines and fungi have phytoceramide phosphoinositols and mannose-containing headgroups. The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of molecules composed of one or more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base. Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as cerebrosides and gangliosides.

===Sterols===
Sterols, such as cholesterol and its derivatives, are an important component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.

Sterols are steroids in which one of the hydrogen atoms is substituted with a hydroxyl group, at position 3 in the carbon chain. They have in common with steroids the same fused four-ring core structure. Steroids have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure.

===Prenols===

Prenol lipids are synthesized from the five-carbon-unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, which are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, diphosphates, etc.) are formed by the successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these terpene units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, as well as the ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated, whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced.

===Saccharolipids===
Saccharolipids describe compounds in which fatty acids are linked to a sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the Lipid A component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipid A molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized with as many as seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in &quot;E. coli&quot; is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.

===Polyketides===
Polyketides are synthesized by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise many secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.

==Biological functions==

===Component of biological membranes===
Eukaryotic cells feature the compartmentalized membrane-bound organelles that carry out different biological functions. The glycerophospholipids are the main structural component of biological membranes, as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles; in animal cells, the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid-derived &quot;tails&quot; by ester linkages and to one &quot;head&quot; group by a phosphate ester linkage. While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes, other non-glyceride lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols (mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes) are also found in biological membranes. In plants and algae, the galactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are among the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae and certain bacteria.

Plant thylakoid membranes have the largest lipid component of a non-bilayer forming monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG), and little phospholipids; despite this unique lipid composition, chloroplast thylakoid membranes have been shown to contain a dynamic lipid-bilayer matrix as revealed by magnetic resonance and electron microscope studies.

A biological membrane is a form of lamellar phase lipid bilayer. The formation of lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment. This is known as the hydrophobic effect. In an aqueous system, the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar, aqueous environment, while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together, forming a vesicle; depending on the concentration of the lipid, this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles, liposomes, or lipid bilayers. Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile (lipid) behavior. Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics. Micelles and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect. When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment, the polar molecules (i.e., water in an aqueous solution) become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic substance, since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile. So in an aqueous environment, the water molecules form an ordered &quot;clathrate&quot; cage around the dissolved lipophilic molecule.

The formation of lipids into protocell membranes represents a key step in models of abiogenesis, the origin of life.

===Energy storage===
Triglycerides, stored in adipose tissue, are a major form of energy storage both in animals and plants. They are a major source of energy in aerobic respiration. The complete oxidation of fatty acids releases about 38 kJ/g (9 kcal/g), compared with only 17 kJ/g (4 kcal/g) for the oxidative breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins. The adipocyte, or fat cell, is designed for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals, with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone-sensitive enzyme lipase. Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use triglycerides to fuel their flights.

===Signaling===
Evidence has emerged showing that lipid signaling is a vital part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.

===Other functions===
The &quot;fat-soluble&quot; vitamins (A, D, E and K) – which are isoprene-based lipids – are essential nutrients stored in the liver and fatty tissues, with a diverse range of functions. Acyl-carnitines are involved in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids in and out of mitochondria, where they undergo beta oxidation. Polyprenols and their phosphorylated derivatives also play important transport roles, in this case the transport of oligosaccharides across membranes. Polyprenol phosphate sugars and polyprenol diphosphate sugars function in extra-cytoplasmic glycosylation reactions, in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis (for instance, peptidoglycan polymerization in bacteria), and in eukaryotic protein N-glycosylation. Cardiolipins are a subclass of glycerophospholipids containing four acyl chains and three glycerol groups that are particularly abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane. They are believed to activate enzymes involved with oxidative phosphorylation. Lipids also form the basis of steroid hormones.

==Metabolism==
The major dietary lipids for humans and other animals are animal and plant triglycerides, sterols, and membrane phospholipids. The process of lipid metabolism synthesizes and degrades the lipid stores and produces the structural and functional lipids characteristic of individual tissues.

===Biosynthesis===
In animals, when there is an oversupply of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called lipogenesis. Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.

The synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is introduced into the fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of stearic acid by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid as well as the triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.

Triglyceride synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl-CoAs are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerol.

Terpenes and isoprenoids, including the carotenoids, are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.

===Degradation===
Beta oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl-CoA. For the most part, fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to, but not identical with, a reversal of the process of fatty acid synthesis. That is, two-carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation, hydration, and oxidation to form a beta-keto acid, which is split by thiolysis. The acetyl-CoA is then ultimately converted into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), CO2, and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl-CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if there is little or no glucose available. The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP. Unsaturated and odd-chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation.

==Nutrition and health==
Most of the fat found in food is in the form of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is necessary to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants and in some seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Many studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses (such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia).

In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fats that are good for one may be turned into trans fats by improper cooking methods that result in overcooking the lipids.

A few studies have suggested that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity. and diabetes; Others, including the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses&#x27; Health Study, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the department of nutrition at the T. H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University, summarizes the current evidence on the effect of dietary fat: &quot;Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn&#x27;t really linked with weight or disease.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, a Lie algebra (pronounced ) is a vector space formula_1 together with an operation called the Lie bracket, an alternating bilinear map formula_2, that satisfies the Jacobi identity. In other words, a Lie algebra is an algebra over a field for which the multiplication operation (called the Lie bracket) is alternating and satisfies the Jacobi identity. The Lie bracket of two vectors formula_3 and formula_4 is denoted formula_5. A Lie algebra is typically a non-associative algebra. However, every associative algebra gives rise to a Lie algebra, consisting of the same vector space with the commutator Lie bracket, formula_6.

Lie algebras are closely related to Lie groups, which are groups that are also smooth manifolds: every Lie group gives rise to a Lie algebra, which is the tangent space at the identity. (In this case, the Lie bracket measures the failure of commutativity for the Lie group.) Conversely, to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra over the real or complex numbers, there is a corresponding connected Lie group, unique up to covering spaces (Lie&#x27;s third theorem). This correspondence allows one to study the structure and classification of Lie groups in terms of Lie algebras, which are simpler objects of linear algebra.

In more detail: for any Lie group, the multiplication operation near the identity element 1 is commutative to first order. In other words, every Lie group &quot;G&quot; is (to first order) approximately a real vector space, namely the tangent space formula_7 to &quot;G&quot; at the identity. To second order, the group operation may be non-commutative, and the second-order terms describing the non-commutativity of &quot;G&quot; near the identity give formula_7 the structure of a Lie algebra. It is a remarkable fact that these second-order terms (the Lie algebra) completely determine the group structure of &quot;G&quot; near the identity. They even determine &quot;G&quot; globally, up to covering spaces.

In physics, Lie groups appear as symmetry groups of physical systems, and their Lie algebras (tangent vectors near the identity) may be thought of as infinitesimal symmetry motions. Thus Lie algebras and their representations are used extensively in physics, notably in quantum mechanics and particle physics.

An elementary example (not directly coming from an associative algebra) is the 3-dimensional space formula_9 with Lie bracket defined by the cross product formula_10 This is skew-symmetric since formula_11, and instead of associativity it satisfies the Jacobi identity:
:formula_12
This is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of rotations of space, and each vector formula_13 may be pictured as an infinitesimal rotation around the axis formula_14, with angular speed equal to the magnitude
of formula_14. The Lie bracket is a measure of the non-commutativity between two rotations. Since a rotation commutes with itself, one has the alternating property formula_16.

== History ==
Lie algebras were introduced to study the concept of infinitesimal transformations by Sophus Lie in the 1870s, and independently discovered by Wilhelm Killing in the 1880s. The name &quot;Lie algebra&quot; was given by Hermann Weyl in the 1930s; in older texts, the term &quot;infinitesimal group&quot; was used.

==Definition of a Lie algebra==
A Lie algebra is a vector space formula_17 over a field formula_18 together with a binary operation formula_19 called the Lie bracket, satisfying the following axioms:

* &quot;Bilinearity&quot;,
::formula_20
::formula_21
:for all scalars formula_22 in formula_18 and all elements formula_24 in formula_7.

* The &quot;Alternating&quot; property,
::formula_26
:for all formula_3 in formula_7.

* The &quot;Jacobi identity&quot;,
:: formula_29
:for all formula_24 in formula_7.

Given a Lie group, the Jacobi identity for its Lie algebra follows from the associativity of the group operation.

Using bilinearity to expand the Lie bracket formula_32 and using the alternating property shows that formula_33 for all formula_34 in formula_7. Thus bilinearity and the alternating property together imply
* Anticommutativity,
:: formula_36
:for all formula_34 in formula_7. If the field does not have characteristic 2, then anticommutativity implies the alternating property, since it implies formula_39

It is customary to denote a Lie algebra by a lower-case fraktur letter such as formula_40. If a Lie algebra is associated with a Lie group, then the algebra is denoted by the fraktur version of the group&#x27;s name: for example, the Lie algebra of SU(&quot;n&quot;) is formula_41.

===Generators and dimension===
The &quot;dimension&quot; of a Lie algebra over a field means its dimension as a vector space. In physics, a vector space basis of the Lie algebra of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; may be called a set of &quot;generators&quot; for &quot;G&quot;. (They are &quot;infinitesimal generators&quot; for &quot;G&quot;, so to speak.) In mathematics, a set &quot;S&quot; of &quot;generators&quot; for a Lie algebra formula_7 means a subset of formula_7 such that any Lie subalgebra (as defined below) that contains &quot;S&quot; must be all of formula_7. Equivalently, formula_7 is spanned (as a vector space) by all iterated brackets of elements of &quot;S&quot;.

== Basic examples ==
===Abelian Lie algebras===
Any vector space formula_46 endowed with the identically zero Lie bracket becomes a Lie algebra. Such a Lie algebra is called abelian. Every one-dimensional Lie algebra is abelian, by the alternating property of the Lie bracket.

=== The Lie algebra of matrices ===
* On an associative algebra formula_47 over a field formula_18 with multiplication written as formula_49, a Lie bracket may be defined by the commutator formula_50. With this bracket, formula_47 is a Lie algebra. (The Jacobi identity follows from the associativity of the multiplication on formula_47.) 
* The endomorphism ring of an formula_18-vector space formula_46 with the above Lie bracket is denoted formula_55.
*For a field &quot;F&quot; and a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the space of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; matrices over &quot;F&quot;, denoted formula_56 or formula_57, is a Lie algebra with bracket given by the commutator of matrices: formula_58. This is a special case of the previous example; it is a key example of a Lie algebra. It is called the general linear Lie algebra.

:When &quot;F&quot; is the real numbers, formula_59 is the Lie algebra of the general linear group formula_60, the group of invertible &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot; real matrices (or equivalently, matrices with nonzero determinant), where the group operation is matrix multiplication. Likewise, formula_61 is the Lie algebra of the complex Lie group formula_62. The Lie bracket on formula_63 describes the failure of commutativity for matrix multiplication, or equivalently for the composition of linear maps. For any field &quot;F&quot;, formula_64 can be viewed as the Lie algebra of the algebraic group formula_65 over &quot;F&quot;.

==Definitions==
=== Subalgebras, ideals and homomorphisms ===
The Lie bracket is not required to be associative, meaning that formula_66 need not be equal to formula_67. Nonetheless, much of the terminology for associative rings and algebras (and also for groups) has analogs for Lie algebras. A Lie subalgebra is a linear subspace formula_68 which is closed under the Lie bracket. An ideal formula_69 is a linear subspace that satisfies the stronger condition:
:formula_70

In the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, subgroups correspond to Lie subalgebras, and normal subgroups correspond to ideals.

A Lie algebra homomorphism is a linear map compatible with the respective Lie brackets:
:formula_71
An isomorphism of Lie algebras is a bijective homomorphism.

As with normal subgroups in groups, ideals in Lie algebras are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms. Given a Lie algebra formula_7 and an ideal formula_73 in it, the &quot;quotient Lie algebra&quot; formula_74 is defined, with a surjective homomorphism formula_75 of Lie algebras. The first isomorphism theorem holds for Lie algebras: for any homomorphism formula_76 of Lie algebras, the image of formula_77 is a Lie subalgebra of formula_78 that is isomorphic to formula_79.

For the Lie algebra of a Lie group, the Lie bracket is a kind of infinitesimal commutator. As a result, for any Lie algebra, two elements formula_80 are said to &quot;commute&quot; if their bracket vanishes: formula_81.

The centralizer subalgebra of a subset formula_82 is the set of elements commuting with &quot;formula_83&quot;: that is, formula_84. The centralizer of formula_7 itself is the &quot;center&quot; formula_86. Similarly, for a subspace &quot;S&quot;, the normalizer subalgebra of &quot;formula_83&quot; is formula_88. If formula_83 is a Lie subalgebra, formula_90 is the largest subalgebra such that formula_83 is an ideal of formula_90.

==== Example ====
The subspace formula_93 of diagonal matrices in formula_64 is an abelian Lie subalgebra. (It is a Cartan subalgebra of formula_95, analogous to a maximal torus in the theory of compact Lie groups.) Here formula_93 is not an ideal in formula_95 for formula_98. For example, when formula_99, this follows from the calculation:
formula_100
(which is not always in formula_101).

Every one-dimensional linear subspace of a Lie algebra formula_7 is an abelian Lie subalgebra, but it need not be an ideal.

=== Product and semidirect product ===
For two Lie algebras formula_7 and formula_104, the &quot;product&quot; Lie algebra is the vector space formula_105 consisting of all ordered pairs formula_106, with Lie bracket
:formula_107
This is the product in the category of Lie algebras. Note that the copies of formula_1 and formula_109 in formula_105 commute with each other: formula_111

Let formula_7 be a Lie algebra and formula_113 an ideal of formula_7. If the canonical map formula_115 splits (i.e., admits a section formula_116, as a homomorphism of Lie algebras), then formula_7 is said to be a semidirect product of formula_113 and formula_74, formula_120. See also semidirect sum of Lie algebras.

=== Derivations ===
For an algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot;, a &quot;derivation&quot; of &quot;A&quot; over &quot;F&quot; is a linear map formula_121 that satisfies the Leibniz rule
:formula_122
for all formula_123. (The definition makes sense for a possibly non-associative algebra.) Given two derivations formula_124 and formula_125, their commutator formula_126 is again a derivation. This operation makes the space formula_127 of all derivations of &quot;A&quot; over &quot;F&quot; into a Lie algebra.

Informally speaking, the space of derivations of &quot;A&quot; is the Lie algebra of the automorphism group of &quot;A&quot;. (This is literally true when the automorphism group is a Lie group, for example when &quot;F&quot; is the real numbers and &quot;A&quot; has finite dimension as a vector space.) For this reason, spaces of derivations are a natural way to construct Lie algebras: they are the &quot;infinitesimal automorphisms&quot; of &quot;A&quot;. Indeed, writing out the condition that
:formula_128
(where 1 denotes the identity map on &quot;A&quot;) gives exactly the definition of &quot;D&quot; being a derivation.

Example: the Lie algebra of vector fields. Let &quot;A&quot; be the ring formula_129 of smooth functions on a smooth manifold &quot;X&quot;. Then a derivation of &quot;A&quot; over formula_130 is equivalent to a vector field on &quot;X&quot;. (A vector field &quot;v&quot; gives a derivation of the space of smooth functions by differentiating functions in the direction of &quot;v&quot;.) This makes the space formula_131 of vector fields into a Lie algebra (see Lie bracket of vector fields). Informally speaking, formula_131 is the Lie algebra of the diffeomorphism group of &quot;X&quot;. So the Lie bracket of vector fields describes the non-commutativity of the diffeomorphism group. An action of a Lie group &quot;G&quot; on a manifold &quot;X&quot; determines a homomorphism of Lie algebras formula_133. (An example is illustrated below.)

A Lie algebra can be viewed as a non-associative algebra, and so each Lie algebra formula_7 over a field &quot;F&quot; determines its Lie algebra of derivations, formula_135. That is, a derivation of formula_7 is a linear map formula_137 such that
:formula_138.
The &quot;inner derivation&quot; associated to any formula_139 is the adjoint mapping formula_140 defined by formula_141. (This is a derivation as a consequence of the Jacobi identity.) That gives a homomorphism of Lie algebras, formula_142. The image formula_143 is an ideal in formula_135, and the Lie algebra of &quot;outer derivations&quot; is defined as the quotient Lie algebra, formula_145. (This is exactly analogous to the outer automorphism group of a group.) For a semisimple Lie algebra (defined below) over a field of characteristic zero, every derivation is inner. This is related to the theorem that the outer automorphism group of a semisimple Lie group is finite.

In contrast, an abelian Lie algebra has many outer derivations. Namely, for a vector space formula_46 with Lie bracket zero, the Lie algebra formula_147 can be identified with formula_55.

== Examples ==
=== Matrix Lie algebras ===
A matrix group is a Lie group consisting of invertible matrices, formula_149, where the group operation of &quot;G&quot; is matrix multiplication. The corresponding Lie algebra formula_1 is the space of matrices which are tangent vectors to &quot;G&quot; inside the linear space formula_151: this consists of derivatives of smooth curves in &quot;G&quot; at the identity matrix formula_152:
:formula_153
The Lie bracket of formula_7 is given by the commutator of matrices, formula_58. Given a Lie algebra formula_156, one can recover the Lie group as the subgroup generated by the matrix exponential of elements of formula_7. (To be precise, this gives the identity component of &quot;G&quot;, if &quot;G&quot; is not connected.) Here the exponential mapping formula_158 is defined by formula_159, which converges for every matrix formula_160.

The same comments apply to complex Lie subgroups of formula_161 and the complex matrix exponential, formula_162 (defined by the same formula).

Here are some matrix Lie groups and their Lie algebras.

* For a positive integer &quot;n&quot;, the special linear group formula_163 consists of all real matrices with determinant 1. This is the group of linear maps from formula_164 to itself that preserve volume and orientation. More abstractly, formula_163 is the commutator subgroup of the general linear group formula_166. Its Lie algebra formula_167 consists of all real matrices with trace 0. Similarly, one can define the analogous complex Lie group formula_168 and its Lie algebra formula_169.
* The orthogonal group formula_170 plays a basic role in geometry: it is the group of linear maps from formula_164 to itself that preserve the length of vectors. For example, rotations and reflections belong to formula_170. Equivalently, this is the group of &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot; orthogonal matrices, meaning that formula_173, where formula_174 denotes the transpose of a matrix. The orthogonal group has two connected components; the identity component is called the &quot;special orthogonal group&quot; formula_175, consisting of the orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. Both groups have the same Lie algebra formula_176, the subspace of skew-symmetric matrices in formula_59 (formula_178). See also infinitesimal rotations with skew-symmetric matrices.
:The complex orthogonal group formula_179, its identity component formula_180, and the Lie algebra formula_181 are given by the same formulas applied to &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot; complex matrices. Equivalently, formula_179 is the subgroup of formula_62 that preserves the standard symmetric bilinear form on formula_184.
* The unitary group formula_185 is the subgroup of formula_62 that preserves the length of vectors in formula_184 (with respect to the standard Hermitian inner product). Equivalently, this is the group of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; unitary matrices (satisfying formula_188, where formula_189 denotes the conjugate transpose of a matrix). Its Lie algebra formula_190 consists of the skew-hermitian matrices in formula_61 (formula_192). This is a Lie algebra over formula_130, not over formula_194. (Indeed, &quot;i&quot; times a skew-hermitian matrix is hermitian, rather than skew-hermitian.) Likewise, the unitary group formula_185 is a real Lie subgroup of the complex Lie group formula_62. For example, formula_197 is the circle group, and its Lie algebra (from this point of view) is formula_198.
* The special unitary group formula_199 is the subgroup of matrices with determinant 1 in formula_185. Its Lie algebra formula_41 consists of the skew-hermitian matrices with trace zero.
*The symplectic group formula_202 is the subgroup of formula_203 that preserves the standard alternating bilinear form on formula_204. Its Lie algebra is the symplectic Lie algebra formula_205.
*The classical Lie algebras are those listed above, along with variants over any field.

=== Two dimensions ===
Some Lie algebras of low dimension are described here. See the classification of low-dimensional real Lie algebras for further examples.

* There is a unique nonabelian Lie algebra formula_7 of dimension 2 over any field &quot;F&quot;, up to isomorphism. Here formula_7 has a basis formula_208 for which the bracket is given by formula_209. (This determines the Lie bracket completely, because the axioms imply that formula_210 and formula_211.) Over the real numbers, formula_7 can be viewed as the Lie algebra of the Lie group formula_213 of affine transformations of the real line, formula_214.

:The affine group &quot;G&quot; can be identified with the group of matrices
::formula_215
:under matrix multiplication, with formula_216, formula_217. Its Lie algebra is the Lie subalgebra formula_7 of formula_219 consisting of all matrices
::formula_220
:In these terms, the basis above for formula_7 is given by the matrices
::formula_222

:For any field formula_18, the 1-dimensional subspace formula_224 is an ideal in the 2-dimensional Lie algebra formula_7, by the formula formula_226. Both of the Lie algebras formula_224 and formula_228 are abelian (because 1-dimensional). In this sense, formula_7 can be broken into abelian &quot;pieces&quot;, meaning that it is solvable (though not nilpotent), in the terminology below.

=== Three dimensions ===
* The Heisenberg algebra formula_230 over a field &quot;F&quot; is the three-dimensional Lie algebra with a basis formula_231 such that
::formula_232.
:It can be viewed as the Lie algebra of 3×3 strictly upper-triangular matrices, with the commutator Lie bracket and the basis
::formula_233

:Over the real numbers, formula_234 is the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group formula_235, that is, the group of matrices
::formula_236
:under matrix multiplication.

:For any field &quot;F&quot;, the center of formula_230 is the 1-dimensional ideal formula_238, and the quotient formula_239 is abelian, isomorphic to formula_240. In the terminology below, it follows that formula_230 is nilpotent (though not abelian).

* The Lie algebra formula_242 of the rotation group SO(3) is the space of skew-symmetric 3 x 3 matrices over formula_130. A basis is given by the three matrices
::formula_244
:The commutation relations among these generators are
::formula_245
::formula_246
::formula_247

:The cross product of vectors in formula_248 is given by the same formula in terms of the standard basis; so that Lie algebra is isomorphic to formula_242. Also, formula_242 is equivalent to the Spin (physics) angular-momentum component operators for spin-1 particles in quantum mechanics.

:The Lie algebra formula_242 cannot be broken into pieces in the way that the previous examples can: it is &quot;simple&quot;, meaning that it is not abelian and its only ideals are 0 and all of formula_242.

* Another simple Lie algebra of dimension 3, in this case over formula_194, is the space formula_254 of 2 x 2 matrices of trace zero. A basis is given by the three matrices
:formula_255

:The Lie bracket is given by:
::formula_256
::formula_257
::formula_258

:Using these formulas, one can show that the Lie algebra formula_254 is simple, and classify its finite-dimensional representations (defined below). In the terminology of quantum mechanics, one can think of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; as raising and lowering operators. Indeed, for any representation of formula_254, the relations above imply that &quot;E&quot; maps the &quot;c&quot;-eigenspace of &quot;H&quot; (for a complex number &quot;c&quot;) into the formula_261-eigenspace, while &quot;F&quot; maps the &quot;c&quot;-eigenspace into the formula_262-eigenspace.

:The Lie algebra formula_254 is isomorphic to the complexification of formula_242, meaning the tensor product formula_265. The formulas for the Lie bracket are easier to analyze in the case of formula_254. As a result, it is common to analyze complex representations of the group formula_267 by relating them to representations of the Lie algebra formula_254.

=== Infinite dimensions ===
* The Lie algebra of vector fields on a smooth manifold of positive dimension is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra over formula_130.
* The Kac–Moody algebras are a large class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, say over formula_194, with structure much like that of the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras (such as formula_271).
* The Moyal algebra is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra that contains all the classical Lie algebras as subalgebras.
* The Virasoro algebra is important in string theory.
* The functor that takes a Lie algebra over a field &quot;F&quot; to the underlying vector space has a left adjoint formula_272, called the &quot;free Lie algebra&quot; on a vector space &quot;V&quot;. It is spanned by all iterated Lie brackets of elements of &quot;V&quot;, modulo only the relations coming from the definition of a Lie algebra. The free Lie algebra formula_273 is infinite-dimensional for &quot;V&quot; of dimension at least 2.

== Representations ==
===Definitions===
Given a vector space &quot;V&quot;, let formula_55 denote the Lie algebra consisting of all linear maps from &quot;V&quot; to itself, with bracket given by formula_58. A &quot;representation&quot; of a Lie algebra formula_7 on &quot;V&quot; is a Lie algebra homomorphism
:formula_277
That is, formula_278 sends each element of formula_7 to a linear map from &quot;V&quot; to itself, in such a way that the Lie bracket on formula_7 corresponds to the commutator of linear maps.

A representation is said to be &quot;faithful&quot; if its kernel is zero. Ado&#x27;s theorem states that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero has a faithful representation on a finite-dimensional vector space. Kenkichi Iwasawa extended this result to finite-dimensional Lie algebras over a field of any characteristic. Equivalently, every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field &quot;F&quot; is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of formula_64 for some positive integer &quot;n&quot;.

===Adjoint representation===
For any Lie algebra formula_7, the adjoint representation is the representation
:formula_283
given by formula_284. (This is a representation of formula_7 by the Jacobi identity.)

===Goals of representation theory===
One important aspect of the study of Lie algebras (especially semisimple Lie algebras, as defined below) is the study of their representations. Although Ado&#x27;s theorem is an important result, the primary goal of representation theory is not to find a faithful representation of a given Lie algebra formula_7. Indeed, in the semisimple case, the adjoint representation is already faithful. Rather, the goal is to understand all possible representations of formula_7. For a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, Weyl&#x27;s theorem says that every finite-dimensional representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations (those with no nontrivial invariant subspaces). The finite-dimensional irreducible representations are well understood from several points of view; see the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras and the Weyl character formula.

===Universal enveloping algebra===

The functor that takes an associative algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot; to &quot;A&quot; as a Lie algebra (by formula_288) has a left adjoint formula_289, called the universal enveloping algebra. To construct this: given a Lie algebra formula_7 over &quot;F&quot;, let
:formula_291
be the tensor algebra on formula_7, also called the free associative algebra on the vector space formula_7. Here formula_294 denotes the tensor product of &quot;F&quot;-vector spaces. Let &quot;I&quot; be the two-sided ideal in formula_295 generated by the elements formula_296 for formula_297; then the universal enveloping algebra is the quotient ring formula_298. It satisfies the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem: if formula_299 is a basis for formula_7 as an &quot;F&quot;-vector space, then a basis for formula_301 is given by all ordered products formula_302 with formula_303 natural numbers. In particular, the map formula_304 is injective.

Representations of formula_7 are equivalent to modules over the universal enveloping algebra. The fact that formula_304 is injective implies that every Lie algebra (possibly of infinite dimension) has a faithful representation (of infinite dimension), namely its representation on formula_301. This also shows that every Lie algebra is contained in the Lie algebra associated to some associative algebra.

===Representation theory in physics===
The representation theory of Lie algebras plays an important role in various parts of theoretical physics. There, one considers operators on the space of states that satisfy certain natural commutation relations. These commutation relations typically come from a symmetry of the problem—specifically, they are the relations of the Lie algebra of the relevant symmetry group. An example is the angular momentum operators, whose commutation relations are those of the Lie algebra formula_242 of the rotation group formula_267. Typically, the space of states is far from being irreducible under the pertinent operators, but
one can attempt to decompose it into irreducible pieces. In doing so, one needs to know the irreducible representations of the given Lie algebra. In the study of the hydrogen atom, for example, quantum mechanics textbooks classify (more or less explicitly) the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra formula_242.

== Structure theory and classification ==
Lie algebras can be classified to some extent. This is a powerful approach to the classification of Lie groups.

=== Abelian, nilpotent, and solvable ===
Analogously to abelian, nilpotent, and solvable groups, one can define abelian, nilpotent, and solvable Lie algebras.

A Lie algebra formula_7 is &quot;abelian&quot; if the Lie bracket vanishes; that is, [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;] = 0 for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in formula_7. In particular, the Lie algebra of an abelian Lie group (such as the group formula_164 under addition or the torus group formula_314) is abelian. Every finite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra over a field formula_18 is isomorphic to formula_316 for some formula_317, meaning an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space with Lie bracket zero.

A more general class of Lie algebras is defined by the vanishing of all commutators of given length. First, the &quot;commutator subalgebra&quot; (or &quot;derived subalgebra&quot;) of a Lie algebra formula_7 is formula_319, meaning the linear subspace spanned by all brackets formula_5 with formula_321. The commutator subalgebra is an ideal in formula_7, in fact the smallest ideal such that the quotient Lie algebra is abelian. It is analogous to the commutator subgroup of a group.

A Lie algebra formula_7 is &quot;nilpotent&quot; if the lower central series
:formula_324
becomes zero after finitely many steps. Equivalently, formula_7 is nilpotent if there is a finite sequence of ideals in formula_7,
:formula_327
such that formula_328 is central in formula_329 for each &quot;j&quot;. By Engel&#x27;s theorem, a Lie algebra over any field is nilpotent if and only if for every &quot;u&quot; in formula_7 the adjoint endomorphism
:formula_331
is nilpotent.

More generally, a Lie algebra formula_7 is said to be &quot;solvable&quot; if the derived series:
:formula_333
becomes zero after finitely many steps. Equivalently, formula_7 is solvable if there is a finite sequence of Lie subalgebras,
:formula_335
such that formula_336 is an ideal in formula_337 with formula_338 abelian for each &quot;j&quot;.

Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field has a unique maximal solvable ideal, called its radical. Under the Lie correspondence, nilpotent (respectively, solvable) Lie groups correspond to nilpotent (respectively, solvable) Lie algebras over formula_130.

For example, for a positive integer &quot;n&quot; and a field &quot;F&quot; of characteristic zero, the radical of formula_64 is its center, the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by the identity matrix. An example of a solvable Lie algebra is the space formula_341 of upper-triangular matrices in formula_95; this is not nilpotent when formula_98. An example of a nilpotent Lie algebra is the space formula_344 of strictly upper-triangular matrices in formula_95; 
this is not abelian when formula_346.

=== Simple and semisimple ===

A Lie algebra formula_7 is called &quot;simple&quot; if it is not abelian and the only ideals in formula_7 are 0 and formula_7. (In particular, a one-dimensional—necessarily abelian—Lie algebra formula_7 is by definition not simple, even though its only ideals are 0 and formula_7.) A finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_7 is called &quot;semisimple&quot; if the only solvable ideal in formula_7 is 0. In characteristic zero, a Lie algebra formula_7 is semisimple if and only if it is isomorphic to a product of simple Lie algebras, formula_355.

For example, the Lie algebra formula_356 is simple for every formula_98 and every field &quot;F&quot; of characteristic zero (or just of characteristic not dividing &quot;n&quot;). The Lie algebra formula_41 over formula_130 is simple for every formula_98. The Lie algebra formula_176 over formula_130 is simple if formula_363 or formula_364. (There are &quot;exceptional isomorphisms&quot; formula_365 and formula_366.)

The concept of semisimplicity for Lie algebras is closely related with the complete reducibility (semisimplicity) of their representations. When the ground field &quot;F&quot; has characteristic zero, every finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra is semisimple (that is, a direct sum of irreducible representations).

A finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero is called reductive if its adjoint representation is semisimple. Every reductive Lie algebra is isomorphic to the product of an abelian Lie algebra and a semisimple Lie algebra.

For example, formula_64 is reductive for &quot;F&quot; of characteristic zero: for formula_98, it is isomorphic to the product
:formula_369
where &quot;F&quot; denotes the center of formula_64, the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by the identity matrix. Since the special linear Lie algebra formula_356 is simple, formula_64 contains few ideals: only 0, the center &quot;F&quot;, formula_356, and all of formula_64.

=== Cartan&#x27;s criterion ===
Cartan&#x27;s criterion (by Élie Cartan) gives conditions for a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of characteristic zero to be solvable or semisimple. It is expressed in terms of the Killing form, the symmetric bilinear form on formula_7 defined by
:formula_376
where tr denotes the trace of a linear operator. Namely: a Lie algebra formula_7 is semisimple if and only if the Killing form is nondegenerate. A Lie algebra formula_7 is solvable if and only if formula_379

=== Classification ===
The Levi decomposition asserts that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero is a semidirect product of its solvable radical and a semisimple Lie algebra. Moreover, a semisimple Lie algebra in characteristic zero is a product of simple Lie algebras, as mentioned above. This focuses attention on the problem of classifying the simple Lie algebras.

The simple Lie algebras of finite dimension over an algebraically closed field &quot;F&quot; of characteristic zero were classified by Killing and Cartan in the 1880s and 1890s, using root systems. Namely, every simple Lie algebra is of type A&quot;n&quot;, B&quot;n&quot;, C&quot;n&quot;, D&quot;n&quot;, E6, E7, E8, F4, or G2. Here the simple Lie algebra of type A&quot;n&quot; is formula_380, B&quot;n&quot; is formula_381, C&quot;n&quot; is formula_382, and D&quot;n&quot; is formula_383. The other five are known as the exceptional Lie algebras.

The classification of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over formula_130 is more complicated, but it was also solved by Cartan (see simple Lie group for an equivalent classification). One can analyze a Lie algebra formula_7 over formula_130 by considering its complexification formula_387.

In the years leading up to 2004, the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic formula_388 were classified by Richard Earl Block, Robert Lee Wilson, Alexander Premet, and Helmut Strade. (See restricted Lie algebra#Classification of simple Lie algebras.) It turns out that there are many more simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic than in characteristic zero.

== Relation to Lie groups ==
Although Lie algebras can be studied in their own right, historically they arose as a means to study Lie groups.

The relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebras can be summarized as follows. Each Lie group determines a Lie algebra over formula_130 (concretely, the tangent space at the identity). Conversely, for every finite-dimensional Lie algebra formula_1, there is a connected Lie group formula_391 with Lie algebra formula_1. This is Lie&#x27;s third theorem; see the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula. This Lie group is not determined uniquely; however, any two Lie groups with the same Lie algebra are &quot;locally isomorphic&quot;, and more strongly, they have the same universal cover. For instance, the special orthogonal group SO(3) and the special unitary group SU(2) have isomorphic Lie algebras, but SU(2) is a simply connected double cover of SO(3).

For &quot;simply connected&quot; Lie groups, there is a complete correspondence: taking the Lie algebra gives an equivalence of categories from simply connected Lie groups to Lie algebras of finite dimension over formula_130.

The correspondence between Lie algebras and Lie groups is used in several ways, including in the classification of Lie groups and the representation theory of Lie groups. For finite-dimensional representations, there is an equivalence of categories between representations of a real Lie algebra and representations of the corresponding simply connected Lie group. This simplifies the representation theory of Lie groups: it is often easier to classify the representations of a Lie algebra, using linear algebra.

Every connected Lie group is isomorphic to its universal cover modulo a discrete central subgroup. So classifying Lie groups becomes simply a matter of counting the discrete subgroups of the center, once the Lie algebra is known. For example, the real semisimple Lie algebras were classified by Cartan, and so the classification of semisimple Lie groups is well understood.

For infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, Lie theory works less well. The exponential map need not be a local homeomorphism (for example, in the diffeomorphism group of the circle, there are diffeomorphisms arbitrarily close to the identity that are not in the image of the exponential map). Moreover, in terms of the existing notions of infinite-dimensional Lie groups, some infinite-dimensional Lie algebras do not come from any group.

Lie theory also does not work so neatly for infinite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional group. Even for the additive group formula_394, an infinite-dimensional representation of formula_391 can usually not be differentiated to produce a representation of its Lie algebra on the same space, or vice versa. The theory of Harish-Chandra modules is a more subtle relation between infinite-dimensional representations for groups and Lie algebras.

== Real form and complexification ==
Given a complex Lie algebra formula_1, a real Lie algebra formula_397 is said to be a &quot;real form&quot; of formula_1 if the complexification formula_399 is isomorphic to formula_7. A real form need not be unique; for example, formula_254 has two real forms up to isomorphism, formula_402 and formula_403.

Given a semisimple complex Lie algebra formula_1, a &quot;split form&quot; of it is a real form that splits; i.e., it has a Cartan subalgebra which acts via an adjoint representation with real eigenvalues. A split form exists and is unique (up to isomorphism). A &quot;compact form&quot; is a real form that is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group. A compact form exists and is also unique up to isomorphism.

== Lie algebra with additional structures ==
A Lie algebra may be equipped with additional structures that are compatible with the Lie bracket. For example, a graded Lie algebra is a Lie algebra (or more generally a Lie superalgebra) with a compatible grading. A differential graded Lie algebra also comes with a differential, making the underlying vector space a chain complex.

For example, the homotopy groups of a simply connected topological space form a graded Lie algebra, using the Whitehead product. In a related construction, Daniel Quillen used differential graded Lie algebras over the rational numbers formula_405 to describe rational homotopy theory in algebraic terms.

== Lie ring ==
The definition of a Lie algebra over a field extends to define a Lie algebra over any commutative ring &quot;R&quot;. Namely, a Lie algebra formula_7 over &quot;R&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module with an alternating &quot;R&quot;-bilinear map formula_407 that satisfies the Jacobi identity. A Lie algebra over the ring formula_408 of integers is sometimes called a Lie ring. (This is not directly related to the notion of a Lie group.)

Lie rings are used in the study of finite p-groups (for a prime number &quot;p&quot;) through the &quot;Lazard correspondence&quot;. The lower central factors of a finite &quot;p&quot;-group are finite abelian &quot;p&quot;-groups. The direct sum of the lower central factors is given the structure of a Lie ring by defining the bracket to be the commutator of two coset representatives; see the example below.

p-adic Lie groups are related to Lie algebras over the field formula_409 of p-adic numbers as well as over the ring formula_410 of p-adic integers. Part of Claude Chevalley&#x27;s construction of the finite groups of Lie type involves showing that a simple Lie algebra over the complex numbers comes from a Lie algebra over the integers, and then (with more care) a group scheme over the integers.

=== Examples ===
* Here is a construction of Lie rings arising from the study of abstract groups. For elements formula_34 of a group, define the commutator formula_412. Let formula_413 be a &quot;filtration&quot; of a group formula_391, that is, a chain of subgroups such that formula_415 is contained in formula_416 for all formula_417. (For the Lazard correspondence, one takes the filtration to be the lower central series of &quot;G&quot;.) Then
:: formula_418
:is a Lie ring, with addition given by the group multiplication (which is abelian on each quotient group formula_419), and with Lie bracket formula_420 given by commutators in the group:
:: formula_421

:For example, the Lie ring associated to the lower central series on the dihedral group of order 8 is the Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension 3 over the field formula_422.

==Definition using category-theoretic notation==
The definition of a Lie algebra can be reformulated more abstractly in the language of category theory. Namely, one can define a Lie algebra in terms of linear maps—that is, morphisms in the category of vector spaces—without considering individual elements. (In this section, the field over which the algebra is defined is assumed to be of characteristic different from 2.)

For the category-theoretic definition of Lie algebras, two braiding isomorphisms are needed. If is a vector space, the &quot;interchange isomorphism&quot; formula_423 is defined by
:formula_424
The &quot;cyclic-permutation braiding&quot; formula_425 is defined as
:formula_426
where formula_427 is the identity morphism. Equivalently, formula_428 is defined by
:formula_429

With this notation, a Lie algebra can be defined as an object formula_47 in the category of vector spaces together with a morphism
:formula_431
that satisfies the two morphism equalities
:formula_432
and
:formula_433
