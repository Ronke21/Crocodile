<text>John Samuel Hagelin (; born June 9, 1954) is a physicist and the leader of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement in the United States. He is president of Maharishi International University (MIU), formerly Maharishi University of Management (MUM), in Fairfield, Iowa, and honorary chair of its board of trustees. The university was established in 1973 by the TM movement&#x27;s founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, to deliver a &quot;consciousness-based education&quot;. Hagelin&#x27;s work and research connected to TM has attracted criticism from former colleagues and fellow scientists.

In 1981, Hagelin graduated with a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University and then did several months of post-doctoral research at CERN. He went on to do post-doctoral work at the SLAC. In 1984, he became a professor of physics at Maharishi International University (MIU), and later became the university&#x27;s president. Hagelin postulates that his extended version of unified field theory is identified with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s &quot;unified field of consciousness&quot;, a view that was rejected by &quot;virtually every theoretical physicist in the world&quot; in 2006.

Hagelin stood as a candidate for President of the United States for the Natural Law Party, a party founded by the TM movement, in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 elections. He is the author of &quot;Manual for a Perfect Government&quot; (1998), which sets out how to apply &quot;natural law&quot; to matters of governance. Hagelin is also the president of the David Lynch Foundation, which promotes TM.

==Early life and education==
Hagelin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the second of four sons, to Mary Lee Hagelin (), a schoolteacher, and Carl William Hagelin, a businessman. He was raised in Connecticut and won a scholarship to the Taft School for boys in Watertown. In July 1970, while at Taft, he was involved in a motorcycle crash that led to a long stayin a body castin the school infirmary. During his time there, he began reading about quantum mechanics but was also introduced to TM by a practitioner, Rick Archer, who had been invited to the school to talk about the meditation form.

After Taft, Hagelin attended Dartmouth College. At the end of his freshman year, he studied TM in Vittel, France, and returned as a qualified TM teacher. In 1975, he obtained his A.B. in physics with highest honors (&quot;summa cum laude&quot;) from Dartmouth. He went on to study physics at Harvard University under Howard Georgi, earning a master&#x27;s degree in 1976 and a Ph.D. in 1981. By the time he had received his Ph.D., he had published several papers on particle theory.

==Career==
===Academic positions===

In 1981, Hagelin became a postdoctoral researcher for a few months at the European Center for Particle Physics (CERN) in Switzerland, and in 1982, he moved to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California. He left SLAC in 1983, reportedly because of personal problems. A year later, he joined Maharishi International University (MIU) as chair of the physics department. Two of Hagelin&#x27;s previous collaborators, Dimitri Nanopoulos and John Ellis, were uncomfortable with his move to MIU, but they continued to work with him. While at MIU, Hagelin received funding from the National Science Foundation.

Hagelin became a trustee of MUM and, in 2016, its president. It was intended that he become president of Maharishi Central University, which was under construction in Smith Center, Kansas, until early 2008, when, according to Hagelin, the project was put on hold while the TM organization dealt with the death of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

===Kilby International Award===
In 1992, Hagelin received a Kilby International Award from the North Dallas Chamber of Commerce &quot;for his promising work in particle physics in the development of supersymmetric grand unified field theory&quot;. According to a member of the selection committee, Hagelin&#x27;s nomination was proposed by another selection-committee member who was a fellow TM practitioner. Chris Anderson, in a 1992 &quot;Nature&quot; article about Hagelin&#x27;s first presidential campaign, questioned the value of the award.

===Theoretical physics===
During his time at CERN, SLAC and MUM, Hagelin worked on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model and grand unification theories. His work on the flipped SU(5) heterotic superstring theory is considered one of the more successful unified field theories, or &quot;theories of everything&quot;, and was highlighted in 1991 in a cover story in &quot;Discover&quot; magazine.

From 1979 to 1996, Hagelin published over 70 papers about particle physics, electroweak unification, grand unification, supersymmetry and cosmology, most of them in academic scientific journals. He co-authored a 1983 paper in &quot;Physics Letters B&quot;, &quot;Weak symmetry breaking by radiative corrections in broken supergravity&quot;, that became one of the 103 most-cited articles in the physical sciences in 1983 and 1984. In a 2012 interview in &quot;Science Watch&quot;, co-author Keith Olive said that his work for the 1984 study was one of the areas that had given him the greatest sense of accomplishment. A 1984 paper by Hagelin and John Ellis in &quot;Nuclear Physics B&quot;, &quot;Supersymmetric relics from the big bang&quot;, had been cited over 500 times by 2007.

===Maharishi effect===
In the summer of 1993, Hagelin directed a project aimed at demonstrating what TM practitioners call the Maharishi effect, the purported ability of a large group to affect the behavior of others by practising TM. The TM movement believes that one tenth of the square root of the population of a country meditating can bring about peace. However, critics point to a lack of credible supporting evidence.

Approximately 4,000 people from 82 countries gathered in Washington, DC, and practiced TM for six hours a day from June 7 to July 30. The meditation included &quot;yogic flying&quot;, a technique taught through the TM-Sidhi program in which practitioners engage in a series of hops while seated in the lotus position. Hagelin claimed that there was a local reduction in crime due to this activity. 

According to Hagelin, the analysis was examined by an &quot;independent review board&quot;, although all members of the board were TM practitioners. Robert L. Park, research professor and former chair of the physics department at the University of Maryland, called the study a &quot;clinic in data distortion&quot;. In 1994, a science satire magazine, &quot;Annals of Improbable Research&quot;, &quot;awarded&quot; Hagelin the Ig Nobel Prize for Peace, &quot;for his experimental conclusion that 4,000 trained meditators caused an 18 percent decrease in violent crime in Washington, D.C.&quot;

In 1999, Hagelin held a press conference in Washington, D.C. to announce that the TM movement could end the Kosovo War with yogic flying. He suggested that NATO set up an elite corps of 7,000 yogic flyers at a cost of $33 million.

===Enlightened Audio Designs Corporation===
In 1990, Hagelin founded Enlightened Audio Designs Corporation (EAD) with Alastair Roxburgh. The company designed and manufactured high-end digital-to-analog converters. EAD was sold in 2001 to Alpha Digital Technologies in Oregon.

==Politics==
===Natural Law Party===

Hagelin and 12 others founded the Natural Law Party in April 1992 in Fairfeld, based on the view that problems of governance could be solved more effectively by following &quot;natural law&quot;, the organizing principle of the universe. The party platform included preventive health care, sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. Hagelin favored abortion rights without public financing, campaign-finance law reform, more restrictive gun control, and a flat tax, with no tax for families earning less than $34,000 per year. He campaigned to eradicate PACs and soft money campaign contributions and advocated safety locks on guns, school vouchers, and efforts to prevent war in the Middle East by reducing &quot;people&#x27;s tension&quot;.

The party chose Hagelin and Mike Tompkins as its presidential and vice-presidential candidates in 1992 and 1996. Hagelin received 39,212 votes from 32 states in 1992 (and 23 percent of the vote in Jefferson County, where MIU is located), and 113,659 votes from 43 states in 1996 (21 percent in Jefferson County).

Hagelin ran for president again in 2000, nominated both by the NLP and by the Perot wing of the Reform Party, which disputed the nomination of Pat Buchanan. Hagelin&#x27;s running mate was Nat Goldhaber. A dispute over the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination generated legal action between the Hagelin and Buchanan campaigns. In September 2000, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Buchanan was the official candidate of the Reform Party and hence eligible to receive federal election funds. The Reform Party convention that nominated Hagelin was declared invalid. In spite of the ruling, Hagelin remained on several state ballots as the Reform Party nominee because of the independent nature of some state affiliates; he was also the national nominee of the Natural Law Party, and in New York was the Independence Party nominee. He received 83,714 votes from 39 states. During the 2004 primary elections, Hagelin endorsed Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich, and in April that year the Executive Committee of the NLP dissolved the NLP as a national organization.

===Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy===
Hagelin is the director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy (ISTPP), an MIU think tank. According to the ISTPP&#x27;s website, he has met with members of Congress and officials at the Department of State and Department of Defense to discuss terrorism. In 1993, he helped draft a paragraph in Hillary Rodham Clinton&#x27;s 10,000-page health care plan; according to Hagelin, his was the only paragraph that addressed preventive health care. In 1998, the ISTPP testified about germ-line technologies to the DNA Advisory Committee of the National Institutes of Health; Hagelin&#x27;s report to the committee said that &quot;recombinant DNA technology is inherently risky because of the high probability of unexpected side-effects&quot;.

===Other organizations===

Hagelin established the US Peace Government (USPG) in July 2003 as an affiliate of the Global Country of World Peace and served as the latter&#x27;s minister of science and technology. According to USPG&#x27;s website, the TM movement created US Peace Government and the Global Country of World Peace to promote evidence-based, sustainable problem-solving and governance policies that align with &quot;natural law&quot;.

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi appointed Hagelin the &quot;Raja of Invincible America&quot; in November 2007. Hagelin organized the Invincible America Assembly in Fairfield in July 2006. The assembly comprised individuals practicing TM and TM-Sidhi techniques twice daily. Hagelin predicted that as the number of Yogic flyers increased towards 3500, &quot;[p]eace and prosperity will reign [in America], and violence and conflict will subside completely&quot;. In July 2007, he said that the assembly was responsible for the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching a record high of 14,022 and predicted that it would top 17,000 within a year.

Hagelin is also president of the Global Union of Scientists for Peace, an organization of scientists opposed to nuclear proliferation and war, and president of the David Lynch Foundation, which promotes TM.

==Criticism==
Hagelin and the credibility of his work have received criticism throughout the years. Hagelin&#x27;s former academic peers &quot;ostracized him&quot; for combining science with a &quot;form of Hinduism that doesn&#x27;t acknowledge its roots&quot;. Neuroscientist and meditation researcher David Vago states that all of Hagelin&#x27;s Maharishi Effect studies are &quot;correlation without causation&quot; and Dennis Roark, former chairman of the physics department at MIU, derided Hagelin&#x27;s research as &quot;crackpot science&quot;. In 1994, Hagelin was award the satirical Ig Nobel Prize for his experiment of yogic flyers and crime rate as the &quot;silliest scientific studies of the year&quot;.

===Efforts to link consciousness to the unified field===
In a 1992 news article for &quot;Nature&quot; about Hagelin&#x27;s first presidential campaign, Chris Anderson wrote that Hagelin was &quot;by all accounts a gifted scientist, well-known and respected by his colleagues&quot;, but that his effort to link the flipped SU(5) unified field theory to TM &quot;infuriates his former collaborators&quot;, who feared it might taint their own work and requests for funding. John Ellis, then director of CERN&#x27;s department of theoretical physics—who worked with Hagelin on SU(5)—reportedly asked Hagelin to stop comparing it to TM. Anderson wrote that two-page advertisements containing rows of partial differential equations had been appearing in the U.S. media, purporting to show how TM affected distant events. In his book, &quot;Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and The Search for Unity In Physical Law&quot; (2007), the physicist Peter Woit wrote that identification of a unified field of consciousness with a unified field of superstring theory was wishful thinking, and that &quot;[v]irtually every theoretical physicist in the world rejects all of this as nonsense and the work of a crackpot&quot;.

Philosopher Evan Fales and sociologist Barry Markovsky remarked that, because no such phenomena have been validated, Hagelin&#x27;s &quot;far-fetched explanation lacks purpose&quot;. They went on to say that the parallels Hagelin highlighted rest on ambiguity, obscurity and vague analogy, supported by the construction of arbitrary similarities.

Hagelin was featured in the movies &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Secret&quot; (2006). João Magueijo, professor of theoretical physics at Imperial College London, described &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot; as &quot;horrendously tedious&quot;, consisting of deliberate misrepresention of science and &quot;ludicrous extrapolations&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hagelin&#x27;s first marriage, to Margaret Hagelin, ended in divorce. He married Kara Anastasio, the former vice-chair of the Natural Law Party of Ohio, in 2010.

<text>The javelin throw is a track and field event where the javelin, a spear about in length, is thrown as far as possible. The javelin thrower gains momentum by running within a predetermined area. Javelin throwing is an event of both the men&#x27;s decathlon and the women&#x27;s heptathlon.

==History==
The javelin throw was added to the Ancient Olympic Games as part of the pentathlon in 708 BC. It included two events, one for distance and the other for accuracy in hitting a target. The javelin was thrown with the aid of a thong (&quot;ankyle&quot; in Greek) that was wound around the middle of the shaft. Athletes held the javelin by the &quot;ankyle&quot;, a leather strap around the shaft, so when they released the javelin, the unwinding of the thong gave the javelin a spiral trajectory.

Throwing javelin-like poles into targets was revived in Germany and Sweden in the early 1870s. In Sweden, these poles developed into the modern javelin, and throwing them for distance became a common event there and in Finland in the 1880s. The rules continued to evolve over the next decades; originally, javelins were thrown with no run-up, and holding them by the grip at the center of gravity was not always mandatory. Limited run-ups were introduced in the late 1890s, and soon developed into the modern unlimited run-up.

Sweden&#x27;s Eric Lemming, who threw his first world best (49.32 metres) in 1899 and ruled the event from 1902 to 1912, was the first dominant javelin thrower. When the men&#x27;s javelin was introduced as an Olympic discipline at the 1906 Intercalated Games, Lemming won by almost nine metres and broke his own world record; Sweden swept the first four places, as Finland&#x27;s best throwers were absent and the event had yet to become popular in any other country. Though challenged by younger talents, Lemming repeated as Olympic champion in 1908 and 1912; his eventual best mark (62.32 m, thrown after the 1912 Olympics) was the first javelin world record to be officially ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, most javelin competitions were two-handed; the implement was thrown with the right hand and separately with the left hand, and the best marks for each hand were added together. Competitions for the better hand only were less common, though not unknown. At the Olympics, a both-hands contest was held only once, in 1912; Finland swept the medals, ahead of Lemming. After that, this version of the javelin rapidly faded into obscurity, together with similar variations of the shot and the discus; Sweden&#x27;s Yngve Häckner, with his total of 114.28 m from 1917, was the last official both-hands world record holder.

Another early variant was the freestyle javelin, in which holding the javelin by the grip at the center of gravity was not mandatory; such a freestyle competition was held at the 1908 Olympics, but it was dropped from the program after that. Hungary&#x27;s Mór Kóczán used a freestyle end grip to break the 60-metre barrier in 1911, a year before Lemming and Julius Saaristo first did so with a regular grip.

The first known women&#x27;s javelin marks were recorded in Finland in 1909. Originally, women threw the same implement as men; a lighter, shorter javelin for women was introduced in the 1920s. Women&#x27;s javelin throw was added to the Olympic program in 1932; Mildred &quot;Babe&quot; Didrikson of the United States became the first champion.

For a long time, javelins were made of solid wood, typically birch, with a steel tip. The hollow, highly aerodynamic Held javelin, invented by American thrower Bud Held and developed and manufactured by his brother Dick, was introduced in the 1950s; the first Held javelins were also wooden with steel tips, but later models were made entirely of metal. These new javelins flew further, but were also less likely to land neatly point first; as a response to the increasingly frequent flat or ambiguously flat landings, experiments with modified javelins started in the early 1980s. The resulting designs, which made flat landings much less common and reduced the distances thrown, became official for men starting in April 1986 and for women in April 1999, and the world records (then 104.80 m by Uwe Hohn, and 80.00 m by Petra Felke) were reset. The current () men&#x27;s world record is held by Jan Železný at 98.48 m (1996); Barbora Špotáková holds the women&#x27;s world record at 72.28 m (2008).

Of the 69 Olympic medals that have been awarded in the men&#x27;s javelin, 32 have gone to competitors from Norway, Sweden or Finland. Finland is the only nation to have swept the medals at a currently recognized official Olympics, and has done so twice, in 1920 and 1932, in addition to its 1912 sweep in the two-handed javelin; in 1920 Finland swept the first four places, which is no longer possible as only three entrants per country are allowed. Finland has, however, never been nearly as successful in the women&#x27;s javelin.

The javelin throw has been part of the decathlon since the decathlon was introduced in the early 1910s; the all-around, an earlier ten-event contest of American origin, did not include the javelin throw. The javelin was also part of some (though not all) of the many early forms of women&#x27;s pentathlon and has always been included in the heptathlon after it replaced the pentathlon in 1981.

==Rules and competitions==
The size, shape, minimum weight, and center of gravity of the javelin are all defined by World Athletics rules. In international competition, men throw a javelin between in length and in weight, and women throw a javelin between in length and in weight. The javelin has a grip, about wide, made of cord and located at the javelin&#x27;s center of gravity () from the javelin tip for the men&#x27;s javelin and from the javelin tip for the women&#x27;s javelin.

Unlike the other throwing events (shot put, discus, and hammer), the technique used to throw the javelin is dictated by World Athletics rules and &quot;non-orthodox&quot; techniques are not permitted. The javelin must be held at its grip and thrown overhand, over the athlete&#x27;s shoulder or upper arm. Further, the athlete is prohibited from turning completely around or starting with their back facing the direction of the throw. This prevents athletes from attempting to spin and hurl the javelin sidearm in the style of a discus throw. This rule was put in place when a group of athletes began experimenting with a spin technique referred to as &quot;free style&quot;. On 24 October 1956, Pentti Saarikoski threw using the technique holding the end of the javelin. Officials were so afraid of the out of control nature of the technique that the practice was banned through these rule specifications.

Instead of being confined to a circle, javelin throwers have a runway wide and at least in length, ending in an radius &quot;throwing arc&quot; from which their throw is measured; athletes typically use this distance to gain momentum in a &quot;run-up&quot; to their throw. Like the other throwing events, the competitor may not leave the throwing area (the runway) until after the implement lands. The need to come to a stop behind the throwing arc limits both how close the athlete can come to the line before the release as well as the maximum speed achieved at the time of release.

The javelin is thrown towards a 28.96º circular sector that is centered on the center point of the throwing arc. The angle of the throwing sector (28.96º) provides sector boundaries that are easy to construct and lay out on a field. A throw is only legal if the tip of the javelin lands within this sector and first strikes the ground before any other part of the javelin. The distance of the throw is measured from the throwing arc to the point where the tip of the javelin landed, rounded down to the nearest centimetre.

Competition rules are similar to other throwing events: a &quot;round&quot; consists of one attempt by each competitor in turn, and competitions typically consist of three to six rounds. The competitor with the longest single legal throw (over all rounds) is the winner; in case of a tie, the competitors&#x27; second-longest throws are also considered. Competitions involving large numbers of athletes sometimes use a &quot;cut&quot; whereby all competitors compete in the first three rounds but only those who are currently among the top eight or have achieved some minimum distances are permitted to attempt to improve on their distance in additional rounds (typically three).

The javelin is almost always thrown outdoors, though it is rarely thrown indoors. The world record for men&#x27;s indoor javelin throw is 85.78 metres by Matti Närhi in 1996.

===Javelin redesigns===
On 1 April 1986, the men&#x27;s javelin () was redesigned by the governing body (the IAAF Technical Committee). They decided to change the rules for javelin design because of the increasingly frequent flat landings and the resulting discussions and protests when these attempts were declared valid or invalid by competition judges. The world record had also crept up to a potentially dangerous level, by Uwe Hohn. With throws exceeding 100 metres, it was becoming difficult to safely stage the competition within the confines of a stadium infield. The javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved forward. In addition, the surface area in front of centre of gravity was reduced, while the surface area behind the centre of gravity was increased. This had an effect similar to that produced by the feathers on an arrow. The javelin turns into the relative wind. This relative wind appears to originate from the ground as the javelin descends, thus the javelin turns to face the ground. As the javelin turns into the wind less lift is generated, reducing the flight distance by around 10% but also causing the javelin to stick in the ground more consistently. In 1999, the women&#x27;s javelin () was similarly redesigned.

Modifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were forbidden at the end of 1991 and performances made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books. Seppo Räty had achieved a world record of in 1991 with such a design, but this record was nullified.

===Weight rules by age group===
The weight of the javelin in the Under-20 category is the same as the senior level.
==Technique and training==
Unlike other throwing events, javelin allows the competitor to build speed over a considerable distance. In addition, the core and upper body strength is necessary to deliver the implement, javelin throwers benefit from the agility and athleticism typically associated with running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more physical characteristics with sprinters than with others, although they still need the skill of heavier throwing athletes.

Traditional free-weight training is often used by javelin throwers. Metal-rod exercises and resistance band exercises can be used to train a similar action to the javelin throw to increase power and intensity. Without proper strength and flexibility, throwers can become extremely injury prone, especially in the shoulder and elbow. Core stability can help in the transference of physical power and force from the ground through the body to the javelin. Stretching and sprint training are used to enhance the speed of the athlete at the point of release, and subsequently, the speed of the javelin. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 113 km/h (70 mph).

The javelin throw consists of three separate phases: the run-up, the transition, and the delivery. During each phase, the position of the javelin changes while the thrower changes his or her muscle recruitment. In the run-up phase as Luann Voza states, &quot;your arm is bent and kept close to your head, keeping the javelin in alignment with little to no arm movement&quot;. This allows the thrower&#x27;s bicep to contract, flexing the elbow. In order for the javelin to stay up high, the thrower&#x27;s deltoid flexes. In the transition phase, the thrower&#x27;s &quot;back muscles contract&quot; as &quot;the javelin is brought back in alignment with the shoulder with the thrower&#x27;s palm up&quot;. This, according to Voza, &quot;stretches your pectoral, or chest, muscles. From there, a stretch reflex, an involuntary contraction of your chest, helps bring your throwing arm forward with increased force&quot;. During the final phase, the rotation of the shoulders initiates the release, which then &quot;transfers movement through the triceps muscles, wrists and fingers to extend the throwing arm forward to release the javelin&quot;.

==Culture==

In 1994, Michael Torke composed &quot;Javelin&quot;, commissioned by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games in celebration of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s 50th anniversary season, in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.

Javelin throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors&#x27; coins. One of the recent samples is the €5 Finnish 10th IAAF World Championships in Athletics commemorative coin, minted in 2005 to commemorate the 2005 World Championships in Athletics. On the obverse of the coin, a javelin thrower is depicted. On the reverse, legs of hurdle runners with the Helsinki Olympic Stadium tower in the background can be seen.

<text>James Madison University (JMU, Madison, or James Madison) is a public research university in Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States. Founded in 1908, the institution was renamed in 1938 in honor of the fourth president of the United States, James Madison. It has since expanded from its origins as a normal school and teacher&#x27;s college into a comprehensive university. It is situated in the Shenandoah Valley, just west of Massanutten Mountain.

== History ==

Founded in 1908 as a women&#x27;s college, James Madison University was established by the Virginia General Assembly. It was originally called The State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg. In 1914, the name of the university was changed to the State Normal School for Women at Harrisonburg. Authorization to award bachelor&#x27;s degrees was granted in 1916. During this initial period of development, six buildings were constructed.

The university became the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg in 1924 and continued under that name until 1938 when it was named Madison College in honor of James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, whose Montpelier estate is located in nearby Orange, Virginia. In 1977, the university&#x27;s name was changed to James Madison University.

The first president of the university was Julian Ashby Burruss. The university opened its doors to its first student body in 1909 with an enrollment of 209 students and a faculty of fifteen. Its first twenty graduates received diplomas in 1911.

In 1919, Burruss resigned the presidency to become president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Samuel Page Duke was then chosen as the school&#x27;s second president. During Duke&#x27;s administration, nine major buildings were constructed. Duke served as president from 1919 to 1949.

In 1946, men were first enrolled as regular day students. G. Tyler Miller became the third president in 1949, following Duke&#x27;s retirement. During Miller&#x27;s administration, from 1949 to 1970, the campus was enlarged by and 19 buildings were constructed. Major curriculum changes were made and the university was authorized to grant master&#x27;s degrees in 1954.

In 1966, by the action of the Virginia General Assembly, the university became a coeducational institution. Ronald E. Carrier, JMU&#x27;s fourth president, headed the institution from 1971 to 1998. During his administration, student enrollment and the number of faculty and staff tripled, and national fraternities were seen on campus such as Tau Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Chi, and others, doctoral programs were authorized, more than 20 major campus buildings were constructed and national publications recognized JMU as one of the finest institutions of its type in America. Carrier Library is named after him.

=== 21st century ===
During the first decade of the 21st century under Linwood H. Rose (JMU&#x27;s fifth president), the university continued to expand, not only through new construction east of Interstate 81 but also on the west side of campus. In early 2005, JMU purchased the Rockingham Memorial Hospital campus just north of the main JMU campus for over $40 million. The hospital has since moved and JMU now occupies the site. In June 2005, the university expanded across South High Street by leasing, and then purchasing the former Harrisonburg High School building.

The rapid expansion of JMU&#x27;s campus has at times created tension in the city-university relationship. In 2006, the local ABC affiliate reported that the university had nearly doubled in size in the preceding 20 years, including purchases of several local properties.

The university has also experienced tension with local residents and local police when 2,500 students at an off-campus block party grew unruly in 2000. Ten years later, police equipped with riot gear used force to disperse a group of 8,000 college-aged people at the party. Several participants were airlifted to a medical center in Charlottesville for treatment. The university condemned the block party attendees&#x27; behavior.

In August 2021, the university received national criticism from conservative political commentators and university alumni after an orientation leader training video and other publications surfaced that supposedly labeled white Americans and Christians as oppressors. In a statement to Fox News, the university stood by the training, saying, &quot;The training was held to help ensure that every student guide for freshmen orientation had the tools and understanding to work with incoming students, who might have a different background than their own.&quot;

== Campus ==


JMU&#x27;s campus originally consisted of two buildings, Jackson Hall and Maury Hall, which are now known as Darcus Johnson Hall and Gabbin Hall, respectively. Today, the campus has 148 major buildings on . It has become Virginia&#x27;s second most photographed location on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter, after Kings Dominion.

The original, historic Bluestone side of campus is located on South Main Street (also known as U.S. Route 11, and historically as &quot;The Valley Pike&quot;) and is the heart of the university. Many of the buildings in the Bluestone area have been constructed out of the same stone, known as &quot;bluestone,&quot; which is a type of limestone that is locally sourced from the surrounding Shenandoah Valley.

The John C. Wells Planetarium, first opened in 1974, underwent a $1.5 million renovation in 2008.

Several new campus construction projects were included in Governor Tim Kaine&#x27;s $1.65 billion higher education bond package. Kaine&#x27;s proposal designated more than $96 million for JMU projects. Among the projects included were the construction of a new biotechnology building, Centennial Hall ($44.8 million), and the renovation and expansion of Duke Hall ($43.4 million). The proposal also included $8.6 million as the final installment payment for the purchase of Rockingham Memorial Hospital.

Beginning in 2002 JMU began receiving state and private funding to construct a state-of-the-art performing arts complex. The facility is opposite Wilson Hall across South Main Street, and visually completes the Main Quad.

=== Renaming historic halls ===
In 2020, JMU&#x27;s Board of Visitors approved the renaming of three historic buildings on the quad that were named in honor of three prominent Virginian Confederate soldiers: Ashby Hall (named after Turner Ashby), Maury Hall (named after Matthew Fontaine Maury), and Jackson Hall (named after Stonewall Jackson). They were given the temporary names of Valley Hall, Mountain Hall, and Justice Studies Hall, respectively. In 2021, the halls were approved and given new names. Mountain Hall (Maury Hall) was renamed Gabbin Hall after Drs. Joanne V. and Alexander Gabbin, professors at JMU for more than 35 years; Valley Hall (Ashby Hall) was renamed Harper Allen-Lee Hall after Doris Harper Allen and Robert Walker Lee, both notable former staff members at JMU; Justice Studies Hall (Jackson Hall) was renamed Darcus Johnson Hall after Sheary Darcus Johnson, the first black student to graduate from JMU.

In late 2021, the ISAT/CS building was renamed King Hall in honor of Charles W. King; longtime Senior Vice President of the Administration and Finance Division at JMU.

== Organization and administration ==

=== Colleges ===
The College of Visual and Performing Arts includes three schools: the School of Art, Design, and Art History; the School of Music; and the School of Theatre and Dance.

In September 2010, the college opened the Forbes Center for the Performing Arts, a complex composed of two connected buildings: the Estes Center for Theatre and Dance and the Roberts Center for Music Performance. The $82 million facility was funded by a Virginia higher-education bond package.

=== Board of Visitors ===
Like all public universities in Virginia, James Madison is governed by a Board of Visitors appointed by the Governor of Virginia. In addition to the 15 members appointed by the governor, the speaker of the Faculty Senate and an elected student representative serve as representatives for the faculty and the student body respectively. The appointed members serve for a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms, while the student representative is limited to two one-year terms. The faculty representative serves for as long as he or she remains the speaker of the JMU Faculty Senate. Some appointed members of note include former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and former first lady of Virginia, Susan Allen.

=== President ===
Charlie King currently serves as interim president. He will serve until June 30, 2025, or until a new president is selected. Jonathan Alger previously served as the university&#x27;s sixth president until he became the president of American University on July 1, 2024.

== Academics ==
James Madison University is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High Research Activity&quot;. It offers 139-degree programs on the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, educational specialist, and doctoral levels. It comprises seven colleges and 78 academic programs, including the College of Arts and Letters; the College of Business; the College of Education; the College of Health and Behavioral Studies; the College of Integrated Science and Engineering; the College of Science and Mathematics; the College of Visual and Performing Arts; and The Graduate School.

On October 2, 2009, JMU was granted a chapter by the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
The 2024 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked JMU the No. 124 among national universities. In the 2018 &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; college rankings, JMU ranked eighth among master&#x27;s universities nationwide. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research, and service.

In 2013, &quot;BloombergBusiness&quot; ranked JMU 15th among all undergraduate business schools in the country for return on investment. In 2014 it ranked JMU&#x27;s College of Business 40th among undergraduate business programs in the U.S. &quot;Kiplinger&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2015 &quot;100 Best Values in Public Colleges&quot; ranked JMU 21st in value in the nation among public colleges and universities.

== Student life ==

The &quot;Princeton Review&quot; recognized James Madison as one of 81 schools in America &quot;with a conscience&quot;, and in 2006 ranked JMU second in the nation behind only the University of Virginia in the number of Peace Corps volunteers it sent from its student body among &quot;medium-sized&quot; universities. And in 2010, the food at JMU was ranked third in the United States. In 2011 the student body was ranked 20th &quot;happiest in the entire nation&quot; by &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. These rankings take into consideration the surrounding area&#x27;s activities, academics, as well as the social scene on campus.

The school has 35 residence halls, ten of which serve as sorority houses. While most residence halls are only for housing, several halls also provide auxiliary services like computer labs and study lounges. All freshmen must live on campus, and a large portion of JMU&#x27;s on-campus housing is set aside for incoming students. Consequently, most upperclassmen and graduate students live off campus. Continuing students who wish to live on campus must re-apply for housing each year. While occasional exceptions are granted, generally freshmen are not granted on-campus parking permits.

=== &quot;The Breeze&quot; ===
&quot;The Breeze&quot; is a student-run newspaper serving JMU since 1922. Published every Thursday, &quot;The Breeze&quot; provides news and information to the university community, covering topics such as sports, culture, and business. &quot;The Breeze&quot; has won numerous awards, including a 2012 Online Pacemaker Award, 2012 VPA award for Best in Show for a Non-Daily News Presentation, and a 2012 VPA sweepstakes award.

=== Clubs and organizations ===
James Madison University has over 400 clubs and organizations for students.

There are 10 front-end budgeted groups on campus, including the Black Student Alliance (BSA), Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC), Latinx Student Alliance (LSA), Madison Equality, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Panhellenic, SafeRides, Student Ambassadors (SA), Student Government Association (SGA), and University Program Board (UPB). The funds allocated to these organization are voted on by the SGA, with the exception to the SGA budget which is approved separately by the administration. Some FEB organizations are more active than others, causing debate about their status from year-to-year.

The JMU Student Government Association (SGA) was founded in 1915 and stood as the first organization on campus. SGA consists of two governing bodies, the Executive Council and the Student Senate. SGA has initiated many of the university&#x27;s traditional events and programs, such as Homecoming&#x27;s Purple Out, Mr. and Ms. Madison, Ring Premiere, the Annual Tree Lighting, the Big Event, and SafeRides. They also vote on Front End Budgeted (FEB) organizational budgets each year and allocate contingency funds. Founded in 2003, SafeRides originated as a program run by the SGA. Inspired by a program at Texas A&amp;M, the organization is a student-led non-profit: unpaid students drive students home at night at no charge. By 2022, they had given more than 100,000 rides.

The JMU Student Ambassadors work alongside the Admissions Office to offer student-led tours for prospective students. Formerly, the Ambassadors were also associated with the Alumni Office until the GOLD Network was established. Ambassadors are volunteers and are not paid.

The JMU Speech Team has received awards. JMU Forensics is the only program in the nation directed by two recipients of AFA&#x27;s most respected coaching awards: Distinguished Service and Outstanding New Coach.

JMU has the largest InterVarsity Christian Fellowship organization in the country.

=== Greek life ===
James Madison University is home to over two dozen social fraternity and sorority chapters. A monument dedicated to the members of the Inter-Cultural Greek Council was built in 2022 by the institution&#x27;s Student Success Center and dubbed &quot;The Yard&quot; in honor of the social justice and community service committed by the organizations.

=== Music ===
James Madison University has the largest collegiate marching band in the nation, with 540 members as of Fall 2022. Nicknamed &quot;Virginia&#x27;s Finest&quot;, the Marching Royal Dukes have performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, the NFC title game between Washington and Dallas in 1983, and the Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1988 and 1991. The band has made four appearances in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, first in 2001, again in 2008, 2013, and most recently in 2018. In the past decade, the band has performed in Europe during winter break; they appeared in Athens, Dublin, Monaco, London, and Rome.

The JMU Brass Band is one of only a few collegiate brass bands in the United States. Formed in the fall of 2000, the band has twice been named the North American Brass Band Association (NABBA) Honors Section Champion (2004, 2005), and is the 2024 Championship Section Champion.

JMU is home to ten a cappella ensembles: four all-female, three all-male, and three co-educational groups. They are nationally recognized, with many of them featured on the Best of College A Cappella (BOCA) yearly compilation albums. Several of the groups, such as Note-oriety and The Overtones, have gone &quot;viral&quot; for their music videos, &quot;Pretty Hurts&quot; and &quot;Say Love&quot;, respectively. Note-oriety also performed at the White House in 2019.

=== Club sports ===
The JMU men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s club soccer teams are two of the most decorated club organizations in JMU school history.

The JMU men&#x27;s ultimate team, the Flying Hellfish, was founded in 1997. The team is named after the Simpsons episode 22, season 7, &quot;Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in &#x27;The Curse of the Flying Hellfish&#x27;&quot; Since 2005, the team has hosted an annual tournament known as &quot;The Hellfish Bonanza,&quot; which attracts between 12 and 16 teams from across the east coast. Several current and former Hellfish play Ultimate professionally for Major League Ultimate&#x27;s Washington DC Current and the American Ultimate Disc League&#x27;s DC Breeze.

== Athletics ==

James Madison University&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Dukes. An English bulldog, with a crown and cape, and Duke Dog, a gray canine costume in a purple cape and crown, serve as the school&#x27;s mascot. The &quot;Dukes&quot; nickname is in honor of Samuel Page Duke, the university&#x27;s second president. The school colors are royal purple and gold. Madison competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I in the Sun Belt Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference.

Beginning in July 2022, the football program began competing in the NCAA&#x27;s Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) as part of the Sun Belt Conference. Before that, the team participated in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and within the Colonial Athletic Association.

Over 546 varsity athletes compete in football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s swimming and diving, women&#x27;s volleyball, baseball, women&#x27;s lacrosse, field hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s cross country and track and field, and softball. James Madison has won five national championships in football (2), field hockey, women&#x27;s lacrosse, and archery, giving the Dukes the second-most national titles by a college or university in Virginia.

James Madison University invested heavily in new athletic facilities throughout the tenure of President Linwood Rose. JMU built a new multimillion-dollar baseball and softball field complex that opened in 2010. Additionally, after the last football game of 2009, the university began an expansion of Bridgeforth Stadium that increased seating capacity to approximately 25,000. Construction was completed in time for the 2011 football season.

=== Basketball ===
In 2013, James Madison University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team won the CAA championship title for the first time since 1994. The Dukes then won their first NCAA tournament game in 30 years, defeating Long Island University-Brooklyn. The Dukes fell to Indiana in the second round, 83–62, finishing the season with a 21–15 record.

=== Football ===
JMU football won the NCAA Division I-AA national title in 2004, with a 13–2 record, and in 2016 with a 14–1 record going undefeated in the FCS. The 2004 squad was the only team in history to win the title after playing four straight road playoff games. Since 2004, the JMU football team has appeared in the playoffs in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.

<doc id="16082" wikidata="Q5687" url="?curid=16082" title="Jericho">
<text>Jericho ( ; , ; ) is a city in the West Bank, Palestine; it is the administrative seat of the Jericho Governorate of Palestine. Jericho is located in the Jordan Valley, with the Jordan River to the east and Jerusalem to the west. In 2017, it had a population of 20,907.

From the end of the era of Mandatory Palestine, the city was annexed and ruled by Jordan from 1949 to 1967 and, with the rest of the West Bank, has been subject to Israeli occupation since 1967; administrative control was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 1994.

Jericho is among the oldest cities in the world, and it is also the city with the oldest known defensive wall. Archaeologists have unearthed the remains of more than 20 successive settlements in Jericho, the first of which dates back 11,000 years (to 9000 BCE), almost to the very beginning of the Holocene epoch of the Earth&#x27;s history. Copious springs in and around the city have attracted human habitation for thousands of years. Jericho is described in the Bible as the &quot;city of palm trees&quot;.

In 2023, the archaeological site in the center of the city, known as Tell es-Sultan / Old Jericho, was inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s list as a World Heritage Site in the State of Palestine, and described as the &quot;oldest fortified city in the world&quot;.

==Etymology==
Jericho&#x27;s name in Modern Hebrew, , is generally thought to derive from the Canaanite word &quot;rēḥ&quot; , but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word &quot;Yaraḥ&quot; or the name of the lunar deity Yarikh, for whom the city was an early centre of worship.

Jericho&#x27;s Arabic name, , means and also has its roots in Canaanite &quot;Reaẖ&quot;.

==History and archaeology==

The first excavations of the site were carried out by Charles Warren in 1868. Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-&#x27;Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and John Garstang excavated between 1930 and 1936. Kathleen Kenyon worked there between 1952 and 1958, followed by Lorenzo Nigro and Nicolò Marchetti in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot; University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015. The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of &#x27;Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.

===Stone Age: Tell es-Sultan and spring===
The earliest excavated settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan&#x27;s Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both Arabic and Hebrew, &quot;tell&quot; means &quot;mound&quot; – consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and Anatolia. Jericho is the type site for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) periods.

====Natufian hunter-gatherers, ====
Epipaleolithic construction at the site appears to predate the invention of agriculture, with the construction of Natufian culture structures beginning earlier than 9000 BCE, the beginning of the Holocene epoch in geologic history.

Jericho has evidence of settlement dating back to . During the Younger Dryas period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the Ein es-Sultan spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for Natufian hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them. Around 9600 BCE, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas stadial had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.

====Pre-Pottery Neolithic, 9500–6500 BCE====

The Pre-Pottery Neolithic at Jericho is divided in Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B.

=====Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA)=====

The first permanent settlement on the site of Jericho developed near the Ein es-Sultan spring between 9,500 and 9000 BCE. As the world warmed up, a new culture based on agriculture and sedentary dwelling emerged, which archaeologists have termed &quot;Pre-Pottery Neolithic A&quot; (abbreviated as PPNA). Its cultures lacked pottery, but featured the following:
* small circular dwellings
* burial of the dead under the floor of buildings
* reliance on hunting of wild game
* cultivation of wild or domestic cereals
At Jericho, circular dwellings were built of clay and straw bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.
The Pre-Sultan ( – 7370 BCE) is sometimes called Sultanian. The site is a settlement surrounded by a massive stone wall over high and wide at the base, inside of which stood a stone tower, over high, containing an internal staircase with 22 stone steps and placed in the centre of the west side of the tell. This tower and the even older ones excavated at Tell Qaramel in Syria are the oldest towers ever to be discovered. The wall of Jericho may have served as a defence against flood-water, with the tower used for ceremonial purposes. The wall and tower were built during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period around 8000 BCE. For the tower, carbon dates published in 1981 and 1983 indicate that it was built around 8300 BCE and stayed in use until . The wall and tower would have taken a hundred men more than a hundred days to construct, thus suggesting some kind of social organization. The town contained round mud-brick houses, yet no street planning. The identity and number of the inhabitants of Jericho during the PPNA period is still under debate, with estimates going as high as 2,000–3,000, and as low as 200–300. It is known that this population had domesticated emmer wheat, barley and pulses and hunted wild animals.

=====Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)=====

The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) was a period of about 1.4 millennia, from 7220 to 5850 BCE (though carbon-14-dates are few and early). The following are PPNB cultural features:
* Expanded range of domesticated plants
* Possible domestication of sheep
* Apparent cult involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using plaster, and eyes set with shells in some cases
After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals&#x27; features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people&#x27;s homes while the bodies were buried.

The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ( and ) with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish terrazzo-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.

Kathleen Kenyon interpreted one building as a shrine. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.

The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A skull cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; cowries were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in Tell Ramad and Beisamoun as well.

Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, burins, scrapers, a few tranchet axes, obsidian, and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also querns, hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.

In the late 4th millennium BCE, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2 and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.

===Chalcolithic===
A succession of settlements followed from 4500 BCE onward.

===Early Bronze Age===
In Early Bronze I, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIA1 (EB IA, c. 3500-3200 BCE) and Sultan IIIA2 (EB IB, c. 3200-3000 BCE).

In Early Bronze II, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIIB1 (EB IIA, c. 3000-2850 BCE) and Sultan IIIB2 (EB IIB, c. 2850-2700 BCE).

In the Early Bronze IIIA ( – 2500/2450 BCE; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600 BCE.

During Early Bronze IIIB (/2450–2350 BCE; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.

In Early Bronze IV, the strategraphic layers are Sultan IIID1 (EB IVA; 2300-2200 BCE) and Sultan IIID2 (EB IVB; 2200-2000 BCE).

===Middle Bronze Age===
Jericho was continually occupied into the Middle Bronze Age; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.

During the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the Canaan region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550 BCE. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the Maryannu, a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the Mitannite state to the north. Kathleen Kenyon reported &quot;the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna&#x27;an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period&quot; and there was &quot;a massive stone revetment ... part of a complex system&quot; of defenses. Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530 BCE. Carbon dating 1573 BCE confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating 1550.

Chronology (Nigro 2016)
* Middle Bronze IA, Tell es-Sultan IVa1 (c. 2000/1950-1900 BC)
* Middle Bronze IB, Tell es-Sultan IVa2 (c. 1900-1800 BC)
* Middle Bronze IIA, Tell es-Sultan IVb1 (c. 1800-1700 BC)
* Middle Bronze IIB, Tell es-Sultan IVb2 (c. 1700-1650 BC)
* Middle Bronze IIC/III, Tell es-Sultan IVc (c. 1650-1550 BC)

===Late Bronze Age===
Decades after the destruction of the Middle Bronze Age city, it recovered again on a smaller scale during the Late Bronze Age (1450–1200 BC), with the previous Middle Bronze city wall being refurbished by adding a mudbrick wall on top of its emerging crest. Excavations have found a structure known as the &quot;Middle Building&quot; which apparently served as the residence of the city&#x27;s local rulers, then vassals of the Egyptian empire. Ultimately, the Middle Building was destroyed, although it was later reused in the early Iron Age. According to Nigro (2023), the Late Bronze IIB layers of the tell were heavily cut by levelling operations during the Iron Age, which explains the scarcity of 13th century BCE materials.
;Hebrew Bible narrative
The Hebrew Bible tells the story of the Battle of Jericho led by Joshua, leading to the fall of the Canaanite city, the first one captured by the Israelites in the Promised Land. The historicity of biblical account is not generally accepted by scholars. Italian archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro suggests that the story might have developed from local memories of the destructions suffered by the Canaanite city in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, which were later used by the biblical writers to create their narrative.

===Iron Age===
Occupation in Tell es-Sultan appears to have resumed in the 11th century BCE, with the town becoming fortified again in the 10th century. Of this new city not much more remains than a four-room house on the eastern slope. By the 7th century, Jericho had become an extensive town, but this settlement was destroyed in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in the late 6th century.

===Persian and Early Hellenistic periods===
After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century, whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the Restoration after the Babylonian captivity, left only very few remains. The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period. During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.

Jericho went from being an administrative centre of Yehud Medinata (&quot;the Province of Judah&quot;) under Persian rule to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE Jericho was under Hellenistic rule of the Seleucid Empire, when the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the Macabees. One of these forts, built at the entrance to Wadi Qelt, was later refortified by Herod the Great, who named it &quot;Kypros&quot; after his mother.

===Hasmonean and Herodian periods===
After the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or Hasmonean and Early Roman or Herodian periods was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at Tulul Abu el-&#x27;Alayiq and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area. The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of Wadi Qelt. The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group (kohanim) from the tribe of Levi, who ruled over Judea following the success of the Maccabean Revolt until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.

The rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and Mount of Temptation. They date between 100 BCE and 68 CE.

====Herodian period====
Herod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from Cleopatra, after Mark Antony had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new Herodian domain. Herod&#x27;s rule oversaw the construction of a hippodrome-theatre (&quot;Tell es-Samrat&quot;) to entertain his guests and new aqueducts to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of &quot;Tulul Abu el-Alaiq&quot; (also written &quot;ʾAlayiq&quot;). In 2008, the Israel Exploration Society published an illustrated volume of Herod&#x27;s third Jericho palace.

The murder of Aristobulus III in a swimming pool at the Hasmonean royal winter palaces, as described by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, took place during a banquet organized by Herod&#x27;s Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for Jerusalem&#x27;s aristocracy.

Herod was succeeded in Judea by his son, Herod Archelaus, who built a village in his name not far to the north, Archelaïs (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.

First-century Jericho is described in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; as follows:

====In the New Testament====
The Christian Gospels state that Jesus of Nazareth passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars (), and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices (). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

John Wesley, in his New Testament Notes on this section of Luke&#x27;s Gospel, claimed that &quot;about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple&quot;.

Smith&#x27;s &quot;Bible Names Dictionary&quot; suggests that &quot;Jericho was once more &#x27;a city of palms&#x27; when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (; ; ). Here the descendant of Rahab did not disdain the hospitality of Zacchaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan.&quot;

===Roman province===
After the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian&#x27;s armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the Bar Kochba revolt in 133.

===Byzantine period===

Accounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a Byzantine Jericho, &quot;Ericha&quot;, was built 1600 metres (1 mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including the Monastery of Saint George of Choziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Sasanian invasion of 614.

The Jericho synagogue in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70 to 50 BCE. A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century CE was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, or &quot;peace unto Israel&quot;, after the central Hebrew motto in its mosaic floor. It was controlled by Israel after the Six Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.

The Na&#x27;aran synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in similar condition.

===Early Muslim period===
Jericho, by then named &quot;Ariha&quot; in Arabic variation, became part of Jund Filastin (&quot;Military District of Palestine&quot;), part of the larger province of Bilad al-Sham. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. &#x27;Uqba (died 758) recorded that caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab exiled the Jews and Christians of Khaybar to Jericho (and Tayma).

By 659, that district had come under the control of Mu&#x27;awiya, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho. A decade later, the pilgrim Arculf visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its &quot;miserable Canaanite&quot; inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.

A palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743) and thus known as Hisham&#x27;s Palace, is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1 mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This &quot;desert castle&quot; or &quot;qasr&quot; was more likely built by Caliph Walid ibn Yazid (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction. The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen &quot;in situ&quot; today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.

Umayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the Arab caliphates of the Abbasid and Fatimid dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho&#x27;s reputation as a fertile &quot;City of the Palms&quot;. Al-Maqdisi, the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that &quot;the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all Islam. Bananas are plentiful, also dates and flowers of fragrant odor&quot;. Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.

===Crusader period===
In 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 kilometres (6 mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and were credited by 19th-century authors with introducing sugarcane production to the city, although now scholars date it to the pre-Crusader, Early Arab period. The Crusaders, however, have raised sugar production to the level of a large-scale industry. The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. &quot;sugar mills&quot;) holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin, and the town slowly went into decline.

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
In 1226, Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi said of Jericho, &quot;it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the &quot;Ghaur&quot; land is made here.&quot; In the 14th century, Abu al-Fida writes there are sulfur mines in Jericho, &quot;the only ones in Palestine&quot;.

===Ottoman period===
====16th century====
Jericho was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 Akçe was recorded, destined for the new Waqf for the Haseki Sultan Imaret of Jerusalem. The villagers processed indigo as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem. Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.

In 1596 Jericho appeared in the tax registers under the name of &quot;Riha&quot;, being in the &quot;nahiya&quot; of Al-Quds in the &quot;liwa&quot; of Al-Quds. It had a population of 51 households, all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 Akçe. All of the revenue still went to a Waqf.

====17th century====
The French traveller Laurent d&#x27;Arvieux described the city in 1659 as &quot;now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated.&quot;

====19th century====
In the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often. At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts. Edward Robinson (1838) reported 50 families, which were about 200 people, Titus Tobler (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 kuruş in tax. Abraham Samuel Herschberg (1858–1943) also reported after his 1899–1900 travels in the region of some 30 poor huts and 300 residents. At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region&#x27;s Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called &quot;Ein al-Sultan&quot;, lit. &quot;Sultan&#x27;s Spring&quot;, in Arabic and &quot;Ein Elisha&quot;, lit. &quot;Elisha Spring&quot;, in Hebrew, and springs in Wadi Qelt.

J. S. Buckingham (1786–1855) describes in his 1822 book how the male villagers of er-Riha, although nominally sedentary, engaged in Bedouin-style raiding, or &quot;ghazzu&quot;: the little land cultivation he observed was done by women and children, while men spent most of their time riding through the plains and engaging in &quot;robbery and plunder&quot;, their main and most profitable activity.

An Ottoman village list from around 1870 showed that &quot;Riha&quot;, Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men only.

The first excavation at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867.

====20th century====

The Greek Orthodox monasteries of St. George of Choziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.

===British Mandate period===
After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, Jericho came under British rule, as part of Mandatory Palestine.

According to the 1922 census of Palestine, Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants (931 Muslims, 92 Christians, and six Jews). The Christian population consisted of 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics (Melkite Catholics), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, four Copts and one Church of England.

In 1927, an earthquake struck and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died, but by the 1931 census the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants (1,512 Muslims, 170 Christians, seven Druze, and four Jews), in 347 houses.

In the 1938 statistics, Jericho lists a population of 1,996 people (including five Jews).

In the 1945 statistics, Jericho&#x27;s population was 3,010 (2,570 Muslims, 260 Christians, 170 Jews, and 10 &quot;other&quot;) and it had jurisdiction over 37,481 dunams of land. Of this, 948 dunams were used for citrus and bananas, 5,873 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 9,141 for cereals, while a total of 38 dunams were urban, built-up areas.

During World War II The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company Solel Boneh, and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.

===Jordanian period===
Jericho came under Jordanian control after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The Jericho Conference, organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed &quot;His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine&quot; and called for &quot;the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full Arab unity&quot;. In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.

In 1961, the population of Jericho was 10,166, of whom 935 were Christian, and the rest were Muslim.

===1967 and aftermath===
Jericho has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to Palestinian Authority control in accordance with the Oslo Accords. The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the Gaza–Jericho Agreement of 4 May 1994. Part of the agreement was a &quot;Protocol on Economic Relations&quot;, signed on 29 April 1994. The city is in an enclave of the Jordan Valley that is in Area A of the West Bank, while the surrounding area is designated as being in Area C under full Israeli military control. Four roadblocks encircle the enclave, restricting Jericho&#x27;s Palestinian population&#x27;s movement through the West Bank.

In response to the 2001 Second Intifada and suicide bombings, Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops. A deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.

On 14 March 2006, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, Ahmad Sa&#x27;adat, and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001.

After Hamas assaulted a neighborhood in Gaza mostly populated by the Fatah-aligned Hilles clan, in response to their attack that killed six Hamas members, the Hilles clan was relocated to Jericho on 4 August 2008.

In 2009, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs David Johnson inaugurated the Presidential Guard Training Center in Jericho, a $9.1 million training facility for Palestinian Authority security forces built with U.S. funding. In 2024, a Jericho street was named after Aaron Bushnell, a U.S. soldier who self-immolated in support of Palestine.

==Geography and environment==
Jericho is located below sea level in an oasis in Wadi Qelt in the Jordan Valley, which makes it the lowest city in the world. The nearby spring of &quot;Ein es-Sultan&quot; produces 3.8 m3 (1,000 gallons) of water per minute, irrigating some through multiple channels and feeding into the Jordan River, away.

===Important Bird Area===
A site encompassing the city of Jericho and its immediate surrounds has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black francolins, lanner falcons, lesser kestrels, and Dead Sea sparrows.

===Climate===
Annual rainfall is , mostly concentrated in the winter months and into early spring. The average temperature is in January and in July. According to the Köppen climate classification, Jericho has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;). Rich alluvial soil and abundant spring water have made Jericho an attractive place for settlement.

==Demographics==
In the first census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho&#x27;s population was 14,674. Palestinian refugees constituted 43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people. The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64. In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.

In a 1945 land and population survey by Sami Hadawi, 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews. Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The Christian community makes up around 1% of the population. A large community of black Palestinians lives in Jericho.

==Economy==
In 1994, Israel and Palestine signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule.
Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.

The Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho&#x27;s economy.

==Tourism==
In 1998, a $150 million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat. The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.

In 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.

<text>The Society of Jesus (; abbreviation: S.J. or SJ), also known as the Jesuit Order or the Jesuits ( ; ), is a religious order of clerics regular of pontifical right for men in the Catholic Church headquartered in Rome. It was founded in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola and six companions, with the approval of Pope Paul III. Today, the Society of Jesus is engaged in evangelization and apostolic ministry in 112 countries. Jesuits work in education, research, and cultural pursuits. Jesuits also conduct retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, sponsor direct social and humanitarian works, and promote ecumenical dialogue.

The Society of Jesus is consecrated under the patronage of Madonna della Strada, a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and it is led by a superior general. The headquarters of the society, its general curia, is in Rome. The historic curia of Ignatius is now part of the attached to the Church of the Gesù, the Jesuit mother church.

Members of the Society of Jesus make profession of &quot;perpetual poverty, chastity, and obedience&quot; and &quot;promise a special obedience to the sovereign pontiff in regard to the missions.&quot; A Jesuit is expected to be totally available and obedient to his superiors, accepting orders to go anywhere in the world, even if required to live in extreme conditions. Ignatius, its leading founder, was a nobleman who had a military background. The opening lines of the founding document of the Society of Jesus accordingly declare that it was founded for &quot;whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God, to strive especially for the defense and propagation of the faith, and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine&quot;. Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;God&#x27;s soldiers&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s marines&quot;, or &quot;the Company&quot;. The Society of Jesus participated in the Counter-Reformation and, later, in the implementation of the Second Vatican Council.

Jesuit missionaries established missions around the world from the 16th to the 18th century and had both successes and failures in Christianizing the native peoples. The Jesuits have always been controversial within the Catholic Church and have frequently clashed with secular governments and institutions. Beginning in 1759, the Catholic Church expelled Jesuits from most countries in Europe and from European colonies. Pope Clement XIV officially suppressed the order in 1773. In 1814, the Church lifted the suppression.

==History==
===Foundation===
Ignatius of Loyola, a Basque nobleman from the Pyrenees area of northern Spain, founded the society after discerning his spiritual vocation while recovering from a wound sustained in the Battle of Pamplona. He composed the &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; to help others follow the teachings of Jesus Christ.

On 15 August 1534, Ignatius of Loyola (born Íñigo López de Loyola), a Spaniard from the Basque city of Loyola, and six others mostly of Castilian origin, all students at the University of Paris, met in Montmartre outside Paris, in a crypt beneath the church of Saint Denis, now Saint Pierre de Montmartre, to pronounce promises of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Ignatius&#x27; six companions were: Francisco Xavier from Navarre (modern Spain), Alfonso Salmeron, Diego Laínez, Nicolás Bobadilla from Castile (modern Spain), Peter Faber from Savoy, and Simão Rodrigues from Portugal. The meeting has been commemorated in the Martyrium of Saint Denis, Montmartre. They called themselves the , and also or &quot;Friends in the Lord&quot;, because they felt &quot;they were placed together by Christ.&quot; The name &quot;company&quot; had echoes of the military (reflecting perhaps Ignatius&#x27; background as Captain in the Spanish army) as well as of discipleship (the &quot;companions&quot; of Jesus). The Spanish &quot;company&quot; would be translated into Latin as like in , a partner or comrade. From this came &quot;Society of Jesus&quot; (SJ) by which they would be known more widely.

Religious orders established in the medieval era were named after particular men: Francis of Assisi (Franciscans); Domingo de Guzmán, later canonized as Saint Dominic (Dominicans); and Augustine of Hippo (Augustinians). Ignatius of Loyola and his followers appropriated the name of Jesus for their new order, provoking resentment by other orders who considered it presumptuous. The resentment was recorded by Jesuit José de Acosta of a conversation with the Archbishop of Santo Domingo. In the words of one historian: &quot;The use of the name Jesus gave great offense. Both on the Continent and in England, it was denounced as blasphemous; petitions were sent to kings and to civil and ecclesiastical tribunals to have it changed; and even Pope Sixtus V had signed a Brief to do away with it.&quot; But nothing came of all the opposition; there were already congregations named after the Trinity and as &quot;God&#x27;s daughters&quot;.

In 1537, the seven travelled to Italy to seek papal approval for their order. Pope Paul III gave them a commendation, and permitted them to be ordained priests. These initial steps led to the official founding in 1540.

They were ordained in Venice by the bishop of Arbe (24 June). They devoted themselves to preaching and charitable work in Italy. The Italian War of 1536–1538 renewed between Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Venice, the Pope, and the Ottoman Empire, had rendered any journey to Jerusalem impossible.

Again in 1540, they presented the project to Paul III. After months of dispute, a congregation of cardinals reported favourably upon the Constitution presented, and Paul III confirmed the order through the bull (&quot;To the Government of the Church Militant&quot;), on 27 September 1540. This is the founding document of the Society of Jesus as an official Catholic religious order. Ignatius was chosen as the first Superior General. Paul III&#x27;s bull had limited the number of its members to sixty. This limitation was removed through the bull of Julius III in 1550.

In 1543, Peter Canisius entered the Company. Ignatius sent him to Messina, where he founded the first Jesuit college in Sicily.

Ignatius laid out his original vision for the new order in the &quot;Formula of the Institute of the Society of Jesus&quot;, which is &quot;the fundamental charter of the order, of which all subsequent official documents were elaborations and to which they had to conform&quot;. He ensured that his formula was contained in two papal bulls signed by Pope Paul III in 1540 and by Pope Julius III in 1550. The formula expressed the nature, spirituality, community life, and apostolate of the new religious order. Its famous opening statement echoed Ignatius&#x27; military background:



In fulfilling the mission of the &quot;Formula of the Institute of the Society&quot;, the first Jesuits concentrated on a few key activities. First, they founded schools throughout Europe. Jesuit teachers were trained in both classical studies and theology, and their schools reflected this. These schools taught with a balance of Aristotelian methods with mathematics. Second, they sent out missionaries across the globe to evangelize those peoples who had not yet heard the Gospel, founding missions in widely diverse regions such as modern-day Paraguay, Japan, Ontario, and Ethiopia. One of the original seven arrived in India already in 1541. Finally, though not initially formed for the purpose, they aimed to stop Protestantism from spreading and to preserve communion with Rome and the pope. The zeal of the Jesuits overcame the movement toward Protestantism in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and southern Germany.

Ignatius wrote the Jesuit &quot;Constitutions&quot;, adopted in 1553, which created a centralised organization and stressed acceptance of any mission to which the pope might call them. His main principle became the unofficial Jesuit motto: (&quot;For the greater glory of God&quot;). This phrase is designed to reflect the idea that any work that is not evil can be meritorious for the spiritual life if it is performed with this intention, even things normally considered of little importance.

The Society of Jesus is classified among institutes as an order of clerks regular, that is, a body of priests organized for apostolic work, and following a religious rule.

The term &quot;Jesuit&quot; (of 15th-century origin, meaning &quot;one who used too frequently or appropriated the name of Jesus&quot;) was first applied to the society in reproach (1544–1552). The term was never used by Ignatius of Loyola, but over time, members and friends of the society adopted the name with a positive meaning.

While the order is limited to men, Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal, favored the order and she is reputed to have been admitted surreptitiously under a male pseudonym.

===Early works===
The Jesuits were founded just before the Council of Trent (1545–1563) and ensuing Counter-Reformation that would introduce reforms within the Catholic Church, and so counter the Protestant Reformation throughout Catholic Europe.

Ignatius and the early Jesuits did recognize, though, that the hierarchical church was in dire need of reform. Some of their greatest struggles were against corruption, venality, and spiritual lassitude within the Catholic Church. Ignatius insisted on a high level of academic preparation for the clergy in contrast to the relatively poor education of much of the clergy of his time. The Jesuit vow against &quot;ambitioning prelacies&quot; can be seen as an effort to counteract another problem evidenced in the preceding century.

Ignatius and the Jesuits who followed him believed that the reform of the church had to begin with the conversion of an individual&#x27;s heart. One of the main tools the Jesuits have used to bring about this conversion is the Ignatian retreat, called the Spiritual Exercises. During a four-week period of silence, individuals undergo a series of directed meditations on the purpose of life and contemplations on the life of Christ. They meet regularly with a spiritual director who guides their choice of exercises and helps them to develop a more discerning love for Christ.

The retreat follows a &quot;Purgative-Illuminative-Unitive&quot; pattern in the tradition of the spirituality of John Cassian and the Desert Fathers. Ignatius&#x27; innovation was to make this style of contemplative mysticism available to all people in active life. Further, he used it as a means of rebuilding the spiritual life of the church. The Exercises became both the basis for the training of Jesuits and one of the essential ministries of the order: giving the exercises to others in what became known as &quot;retreats&quot;.

The Jesuits&#x27; contributions to the late Renaissance were significant in their roles both as a missionary order and as the first religious order to operate colleges and universities as a principal and distinct ministry. By the time of Ignatius&#x27; death in 1556, the Jesuits were already operating a network of 74 colleges on three continents. A precursor to liberal education, the Jesuit plan of studies incorporated the Classical teachings of Renaissance humanism into the Scholastic structure of Catholic thought. This method of teaching was important in the context of the Scientific Revolution, as these universities were open to teaching new scientific and mathematical methodology. Further, many important thinkers of the Scientific Revolution were educated by Jesuit universities.

In addition to the teachings of faith, the Jesuit (1599) would standardize the study of Latin, Greek, classical literature, poetry, and philosophy as well as non-European languages, sciences, and the arts. Furthermore, Jesuit schools encouraged the study of vernacular literature and rhetoric, and thereby became important centres for the training of lawyers and public officials.

The Jesuit schools played an important part in winning back to Catholicism a number of European countries which had for a time been predominantly Protestant, notably Poland and Lithuania. Today, Jesuit colleges and universities are located in over one hundred nations around the world. Under the notion that God can be encountered through created things and especially art, they encouraged the use of ceremony and decoration in Catholic ritual and devotion. Perhaps as a result of this appreciation for art, coupled with their spiritual practice of &quot;finding God in all things&quot;, many early Jesuits distinguished themselves in the visual and performing arts as well as in music. The theater was a form of expression especially prominent in Jesuit schools.

Jesuit priests often acted as confessors to kings during the early modern period. They were an important force in the Counter-Reformation and in the Catholic missions, in part because their relatively loose structure (without the requirements of living and celebration of the Liturgy of Hours in common) allowed them to be flexible and meet diverse needs arising at the time.

===Expansion of the order===
After much training and experience in theology, Jesuits went across the globe in search of converts to Christianity. Despite their dedication, they had little success in Asia, except in the Philippines. For instance, early missions in Japan resulted in the government granting the Jesuits the feudal fiefdom of Nagasaki in 1580. This was removed in 1587 due to fears over their growing influence. Jesuits did, however, have much success in Latin America. Their ascendancy in societies in the Americas accelerated during the seventeenth century, wherein Jesuits created new missions in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia; as early as 1603, there were 345 Jesuit priests in Mexico alone.
Francis Xavier, one of the original companions of Loyola, arrived in Goa (Portuguese India) in 1541 to carry out evangelical service in the Indies. In a 1545 letter to John III of Portugal, he requested an Inquisition to be installed in Goa to combat heresies like crypto-Judaism and crypto-Islam. Under Portuguese royal patronage, Jesuits thrived in Goa and until 1759 successfully expanded their activities to education and healthcare. In 1594 they founded the first Roman-style academic institution in the East, St. Paul Jesuit College in Macau, China. Founded by Alessandro Valignano, it had a great influence on the learning of Eastern languages (Chinese and Japanese) and culture by missionary Jesuits, becoming home to the first western sinologists such as Matteo Ricci. Jesuit efforts in Goa were interrupted by the expulsion of the Jesuits from Portuguese territories in 1759 by the powerful Marquis of Pombal, Secretary of State in Portugal.

The Portuguese Jesuit António de Andrade founded a mission in Western Tibet in 1624 (see also &quot;Catholic Church in Tibet&quot;). Two Jesuit missionaries, Johann Grueber and Albert Dorville, reached Lhasa, in Tibet, in 1661. The Italian Jesuit Ippolito Desideri established a new Jesuit mission in Lhasa and Central Tibet (1716–21) and gained an exceptional mastery of Tibetan language and culture, writing a long and very detailed account of the country and its religion as well as treatises in Tibetan that attempted to refute key Buddhist ideas and establish the truth of Catholic Christianity.
Jesuit missions in the Americas became controversial in Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal where they were seen as interfering with the proper colonial enterprises of the royal governments. The Jesuits were often the only force standing between the Indigenous and slavery. Together throughout South America but especially in present-day Brazil and Paraguay, they formed Indigenous Christian city-states, called &quot;reductions&quot;. These were societies set up according to an idealized theocratic model. The efforts of Jesuits like Antonio Ruiz de Montoya to protect the natives from enslavement by Spanish and Portuguese colonizers would contribute to the call for the society&#x27;s suppression. Jesuit priests such as Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta founded several towns in Brazil in the 16th century, including São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and were very influential in the pacification, religious conversion, and education of indigenous nations. They also built schools, organized people into villages, and created a writing system for the local languages of Brazil. José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega were the first Jesuits that Ignacio de Loyola sent to the Americas.
Jesuit scholars working in foreign missions were very dedicated in studying the local languages and strove to produce Latinized grammars and dictionaries. This included: Japanese (see , also known as , &quot;Vocabulary of the Japanese Language&quot;, a Japanese–Portuguese dictionary written 1603); Vietnamese (Portuguese missionaries created the Vietnamese alphabet, which was later formalized by Avignon missionary Alexandre de Rhodes with his 1651 trilingual dictionary); Tupi (the main language of Brazil); and the pioneering study of Sanskrit in the West by Jean François Pons in the 1740s.

Jesuit missionaries were active among indigenous peoples in New France in North America, many of them compiling dictionaries or glossaries of the First Nations and Native American languages they had learned. For instance, before his death in 1708, Jacques Gravier, vicar general of the Illinois Mission in the Mississippi River valley, compiled a Miami–Illinois–French dictionary, considered the most extensive among works of the missionaries. Extensive documentation was left in the form of &quot;The Jesuit Relations&quot;, published annually from 1632 until 1673.

====Britain====
Whereas Jesuits were active in Britain in the 16th century, due to the persecution of Catholics in the Elizabethan times, an English province was only established in 1623. The first pressing issue for early Jesuits in what today is the United Kingdom was to establish places for training priests. After an English College was opened in Rome (1579), a Jesuit seminary was opened at Valladolid (1589), then one in Seville (1592), which culminated in a place of study in Louvain (1614). This was the earliest foundation of what would later be called Heythrop College. Campion Hall, founded in 1896, has been a presence within Oxford University since then. 

16th and 17th-century Jesuit institutions intended to train priests were hotbeds for the persecution of Catholics in Britain, where men suspected of being Catholic priests were routinely imprisoned, tortured, and executed. Jesuits were among those killed, including the namesake of Campion Hall, as well as Brian Cansfield, Ralph Corbington, and many others. A number of them were canonized among the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.

Four Jesuit churches remain today in London alone, with three other places of worship remaining extant in England and two in Scotland.

====China====

The Jesuits first entered China through the Portuguese settlement on Macau, where they settled on Green Island and founded St. Paul&#x27;s College.

The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China. The scientific revolution brought by the Jesuits coincided with a time when scientific innovation had declined in China:

[The Jesuits] made efforts to translate western mathematical and astronomical works into Chinese and aroused the interest of Chinese scholars in these sciences. They made very extensive astronomical observation and carried out the first modern cartographic work in China. They also learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence, European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture.

For over a century, Jesuits such as Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci, Diego de Pantoja, Philippe Couplet, Michal Boym, and François Noël refined translations and disseminated Chinese knowledge, culture, history, and philosophy to Europe. Their Latin works popularized the name &quot;Confucius&quot; and had considerable influence on the Deists and other Enlightenment thinkers, some of whom were intrigued by the Jesuits&#x27; attempts to reconcile Confucian morality with Catholicism.

Upon the arrival of the Franciscans and other monastic orders, Jesuit accommodation of Chinese culture and rituals led to the long-running Chinese Rites controversy. Despite the personal testimony of the Kangxi Emperor and many Jesuit converts that Chinese veneration of ancestors and Confucius was a nonreligious token of respect, &#x27;s papal decree ruled that such behavior constituted impermissible forms of idolatry and superstition in 1704; his legate Tournon and Bishop Charles Maigrot of Fujian, tasked with presenting this finding to the Kangxi Emperor, displayed such extreme ignorance that the emperor mandated the expulsion of Christian missionaries unable to abide by the terms of Ricci&#x27;s Chinese catechism. Tournon&#x27;s summary and automatic excommunication for any violators of Clement&#x27;s decreeupheld by the 1715 bull led to the swift collapse of all the missions in China; the last Jesuits were finally expelled after 1721.

The first Jesuit school in Ireland was established at Limerick by the apostolic visitor of the Holy See, David Wolfe. Wolfe had been sent to Ireland by Pope Pius IV with the concurrence of the third Jesuit superior general, Diego Laynez. He was charged with setting up grammar schools &quot;as a remedy against the profound ignorance of the people&quot;.

Wolfe&#x27;s mission in Ireland initially concentrated on setting the sclerotic Irish Church on a sound footing, introducing the Tridentine Reforms and finding suitable men to fill vacant sees. He established a house of religious women in Limerick known as the Menabochta (&quot;poor women&quot; ) and in 1565 preparations began for establishing a school at Limerick.

At his instigation, Richard Creagh, a priest of the Diocese of Limerick, was persuaded to accept the vacant Archdiocese of Armagh, and was consecrated at Rome in 1564.

This early Limerick school, Crescent College, operated in difficult circumstances. In April 1566, William Good sent a detailed report to Rome of his activities via the Portuguese Jesuits. He informed the Jesuit superior general that he and Edmund Daniel had arrived at Limerick city two years beforehand and their situation there had been perilous. Both had arrived in the city in very bad health, but had recovered due to the kindness of the people. 

They established contact with Wolfe, but were only able to meet with him at night, as the English authorities were attempting to arrest the legate. Wolfe charged them initially with teaching to the boys of Limerick, with an emphasis on religious instruction, and Good translated the catechism from Latin into English for this purpose. They remained in the city for eight months, before moving to Kilmallock in December 1565 under the protection of the Earl of Desmond, where they lived in more comfort than the primitive conditions they experienced in the city. However they were unable to support themselves at Kilmallock and three months later they returned to the city in Easter 1566, and strangely set up their house in accommodation owned by the Lord Deputy of Ireland, which was conveyed to them by certain influential friends.

They recommenced teaching at Castle Lane, and imparting the sacraments, though their activities were restricted by the arrival of Royal Commissioners. Good reported that as he was an Englishman, English officials in the city cultivated him and he was invited to dine with them on a number of occasions, though he was warned to exercise prudence and avoid promoting the Petrine primacy and the priority of the Mass amongst the sacraments with his students and congregation, and that his sermons should emphasize obedience to secular princes if he wished to avoid arrest.

The number of scholars in their care was very small. An early example of a school play in Ireland is sent in one of Good&#x27;s reports, which was performed on the Feast of St. John in 1566. The school was conducted in one large aula, but the students were divided into distinct classes. Good gives a highly detailed report of the curriculum taught and the top class studied the first and second parts of Johannes Despauterius&#x27;s Commentarli grammatici, and read a few letters of Cicero or the dialogues of Frusius (André des Freux, SJ). The second class committed Donatus&#x27; texts in Latin to memory and read dialogues as well as works by Ēvaldus Gallus. Students in the third class learned Donatus by heart, though translated into English rather than through Latin. Young boys in the fourth class were taught to read. Progress was slow because there were too few teachers to conduct classes simultaneously.

In the spirit of Ignatius&#x27; Roman College founded 14 years before, no fee was requested from pupils, though as a result the two Jesuits lived in very poor conditions and were very overworked with teaching and administering the sacraments to the public. In late 1568 the Castle Lane School, in the presence of Daniel and Good, was attacked and looted by government agents sent by Sir Thomas Cusack during the pacification of Munster. The political and religious climate had become more uncertain in the lead up to Pope Pius V&#x27;s formal excommunication of Queen Elizabeth I, which resulted in a new wave of repression of Catholicism in England and Ireland. At the end of 1568 the Anglican Bishop of Meath, Hugh Brady, was sent to Limerick charged with a Royal Commission to seek out and expel the Jesuits. Daniel was immediately ordered to quit the city and went to Lisbon, where he resumed his studies with the Portuguese Jesuits. Good moved on to Clonmel, before establishing himself at Youghal until 1577.

In 1571, after Wolfe had been captured and imprisoned at Dublin Castle, Daniel persuaded the Portuguese Province to agree a surety for the ransom of Wolfe, who was quickly banished on release. Daniel returned to Ireland the following year, but was immediately captured and incriminating documents were found on his person, which were taken as proof of his involvement with the rebellious cousin of the Earl of Desmond, James Fitzmaurice and a Spanish plot. He was removed from Limerick, taken to Cork &quot;just as if he were a thief or noted evildoer&quot;. After being court-martialled by the Lord President of Munster, Sir John Perrot, he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered for treason and refused pardon in return for swearing the Act of Supremacy. His execution was carried out on 25 October 1572 and a report of it was sent by Fitzmaurice to the Jesuit Superior General in 1576, where he said that Daniel was &quot;cruelly killed because of me&quot;.

With Daniel dead and Wolfe dismissed, the Irish Jesuit foundation suffered a severe setback. Good is recorded as resident at Rome by 1577 and in 1586 the seizure of Earl of Desmond&#x27;s estates resulted in a new permanent Protestant plantation in Munster, making the continuation of the Limerick school impossible for a time. It was not until the early 1600s that the Jesuit mission could again re-establish itself in the city, though the Jesuits kept a low profile existence in lodgings here and there. For instance a mission led by Fr. Nicholas Leinagh re-established itself at Limerick in 1601, though the Jesuit presence in the city numbered no more than 1 or 2 at a time in the years immediately following.

In 1604, the Lord President of Munster, Sir Henry Brouncker - at Limerick, ordered all Jesuits from the city and Province, and offered £7 to anyone willing to betray a Jesuit priest to the authorities, and £5 for a seminarian. Jesuit houses and schools throughout the province, in the years thereafter, were subject to periodic crackdown and the occasional destruction of schools, imprisonment of teachers and the levying of heavy money penalties on parents are recorded in publications of the time. In 1615-17 the Royal Visitation Books, written up by Thomas Jones, the Anglican Archbishop of Dublin, records the suppression of Jesuit schools at Waterford, Limerick and Galway. Nevertheless, in spite of this occasional persecution, the Jesuits were able to exert a degree of discreet influence within the province and in Limerick. For instance in 1606, largely through their efforts, a Catholic named Christopher Holywood was elected Mayor of the city. Four years earlier the resident Jesuit had raised a sum of &quot;200 cruzados&quot; for the purpose of founding a hospital in the city, though the project was disrupted by a severe outbreak of plague and repression by the Lord President

The principal activities of the order within the city at this time were devoted to preaching, administration of the sacraments and teaching. The school opened and closed intermittently in or around the area of Castle Lane, near Lahiffy&#x27;s lane. During demolition work stones marked I.H.S., 1642 and 1609 were, in the 19th century, found inserted in a wall behind a tan yard near St Mary&#x27;s Chapel which, according to Lenihan, were thought to mark the site of an early Jesuit school and oratory. This building, at other times, had also functioned as a dance house and candle factory.

For much of the 17th century, the Limerick Jesuit foundation established a more permanent and stable presence and the Jesuit Annals record a &#x27;flourishing&#x27; school at Limerick in the 1640s. During the Confederacy the Jesuits had been able to go about their business unhindered and were invited to preach publicly from the pulpit of St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral on 4 occasions. Cardinal Giovanni Rinuccini wrote to the Jesuit general in Rome praising the work of the Rector of the Limerick College, Fr. William O&#x27;Hurley, who was aided by Fr. Thomas Burke. However just a few years later, during the Protectorate era, only 18 of the Jesuits resident in Ireland managed to avoid capture by the authorities. Lenihan records that the Limerick Crescent College in 1656 moved to a hut in the middle of a bog which was difficult for the authorities to find. This foundation was headed up by Fr. Nicholas Punch who was aided by Frs. Maurice Patrick, Piers Creagh and James Forde and the school attracted a large number of students from around the locality.

At the Restoration of Charles II, the school moved back to Castle Lane, and remained largely undisturbed for the next 40 years, until the surrender of the city to Williamite forces in 1692. In 1671, Dr. James Douley was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Limerick and during his visitation to the diocese reported to the Holy See that the Jesuits had a house and &quot;taught schools with great fruit, instructing the youth in the articles of faith and good morals.&quot; Douley also noted that this and other Catholic schools operating in the Diocese were also attended by local Protestants.

The Jesuit presence in Ireland, in the so-called Penal era after the Battle of the Boyne, ebbed and flowed. By 1700 they were only 6 or 7, recovering to 25 by 1750. Small Jesuit houses and schools existed at Athlone, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Waterford, New Ross, Wexford, and Drogheda, as well as Dublin and Galway. At Limerick there appears to have been a long hiatus following the defeat of the Jacobite forces and Begley states that Fr. Thomas O&#x27;Gorman was the first Jesuit to return to Limerick after the siege, arriving in 1728 and he took up residence in Jail Lane, near the Castle in the Englishtown. There he opened a school to &quot;impart the rudiments of the classics to the better class youth of the city.&quot; O&#x27;Gorman left in 1737 and was succeeded by Fr. John McGrath. Next came Fr. James McMahon, who was a nephew of the Primate of Armagh, Hugh MacMahon. McMahon lived at Limerick for thirteen years until his death in 1751. In 1746 Fr Joseph Morony was sent from Bordeaux to join McMahon and the others. Morony remained at the Jail Lane site teaching at what Begley states was a &quot;high class school&quot; until 1773 when he was ordered to close the school and oratory following the papal suppression of the Society of Jesus, 208 years after its foundation by Wolfe. Morony then went to live in Dublin and worked as a secular priest.

Despite the efforts of the Castle authorities and English government the Limerick school managed to survive the Protestant Reformation, the Cromwellian invasion and Williamite Wars, and subsequent Penal Laws. It was finally forced to close, not for religious or confessional reasons, but due to the political difficulties of the Jesuit Order elsewhere.

Following the restoration of the Society of Jesus in 1814, the Jesuits gradually re-established a number of their schools throughout the country, starting with foundations at Kildare and Dublin. They returned to Limerick at the invitation of the Bishop of Limerick, John Ryan, in 1859 and also re-established a school at Galway in the same year.

====Canada====

During the French colonisation of New France in the 17th century, Jesuits played an active role in North America. Samuel de Champlain established the foundations of the French colony at Québec in 1608. The native tribes that inhabited modern day Ontario, Québec, and the areas around Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay were the Montagnais, the Algonquins, and the Huron. Champlain believed that these had souls to be saved, so in 1614 he obtained the Recollects, a reform branch of the Franciscans in France, to convert the native inhabitants. In 1624 the French Recollects realized the magnitude of their task and sent a delegate to France to invite the Society of Jesus to help with this mission. The invitation was accepted, and Jesuits Jean de Brébeuf, Énemond Massé, and Charles Lalemant arrived in Quebec in 1625. Lalemant is considered to have been the first author of one of the &quot;Jesuit Relations of New France&quot;, which chronicled their evangelization during the 17th century.

The Jesuits became involved in the Huron mission in 1626 and lived among the Huron peoples. Brébeuf learned the native language and created the first Huron language dictionary. Outside conflict forced the Jesuits to leave New France in 1629 when Quebec was surrendered to the English. In 1632, Quebec was returned to the French under the Treaty of Saint Germain-en-Laye and the Jesuits returned to the Huron territory. After a series of epidemics of European-introduced diseases beginning in 1634, some Huron began to mistrust the Jesuits and accused them of being sorcerers casting spells from their books.

In 1639, Jesuit Jerome Lalemant decided that the missionaries among the Hurons needed a local residence and established Sainte-Marie near present-day Midland, Ontario, which was meant to be a replica of European society. It became the Jesuit headquarters and an important part of Canadian history. Throughout most of the 1640s the Jesuits had modest success, establishing five chapels in Huronia and baptising more than one thousand Huron out of a population which may have exceeded 20,000 before the epidemics of the 1630s. However, the Iroquois of New York, rivals of the Hurons, grew jealous of the Hurons&#x27; wealth and control of the fur trade system and attacked Huron villages in 1648. They killed missionaries and burned villages, and the Hurons scattered. Both de Brébeuf and Gabriel Lalemant were tortured and killed in the Iroquois raids; for this, they have been canonized as martyrs in the Catholic Church. 

The Jesuit Paul Ragueneau burned down Sainte-Marie instead of allowing the Iroquois the satisfaction of destroying it. By late June 1649, the French and some Christian Hurons built Sainte-Marie II on Christian Island (Isle de Saint-Joseph). However, facing starvation, lack of supplies, and constant threats of Iroquois attack, the small Sainte-Marie II was abandoned in June 1650; the remaining Christian Hurons and Jesuits departed for Quebec and Ottawa. As a result of the Iroquois raids and outbreak of disease, many missionaries, traders, and soldiers died. Today, the Huron tribe, also known as the Wyandot, have a First Nations reserve in Quebec, Canada, and three major settlements in the United States.

After the collapse of the Huron nation, the Jesuits undertook the task of converting the Iroquois, something they had attempted in 1642 with little success. In 1653 the Iroquois nation had a fallout with the Dutch. They then signed a peace treaty with the French and a mission was established. The Iroquois soon turned on the French again. In 1658, the Jesuits were having little success and were under constant threat of being tortured or killed, but continued their effort until 1687 when they abandoned their permanent posts in the Iroquois homeland.

By 1700, Jesuits turned to maintaining Quebec, Montreal, and Ottawa without establishing new posts. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, Quebec was captured by the British in 1759 and New France came under British control. The British barred the immigration of more Jesuits to New France, and by 1763, only 21 Jesuits were stationed in New France. By 1773 only 11 Jesuits remained. During the same year the British crown declared that the Society of Jesus in New France was dissolved.

The dissolution of the order left in place substantial estates and investments, amounting to an income of approximately £5,000 a year, and the Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec, later succeeded by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, assumed the task of allocating the funds to suitable recipients, chiefly schools.

The Jesuit mission in Quebec was re-established in 1842. There were a number of Jesuit colleges founded in the decades following; one of these colleges evolved into present-day Laval University.

====United States====
In the United States, the order is best known for its missions to the Native Americans in the early 17th century, its network of colleges and universities, and (in Europe before 1773) its politically conservative role in the Catholic Counter Reformation.

The Society of Jesus, in the United States, is organized into geographic provinces, each of which being headed by a provincial superior. Today, there are four Jesuit provinces operating in the United States: the USA East, USA Central and Southern, USA Midwest, and USA West Provinces. At their height, there were ten provinces. Though there had been mergers in the past, a major reorganization of the provinces began in early 21st century, with the aim of consolidating into four provinces by 2020.

====Ecuador====
The Church of the Society of Jesus (), known colloquially as , is a Jesuit church in Quito, Ecuador. It is among the best-known churches in Quito because of its large central nave, which is profusely decorated with gold leaf, gilded plaster and wood carvings. Inspired by two Roman Jesuit churches – the Chiesa del Gesù (1580) and the Chiesa di Sant&#x27;Ignazio di Loyola (1650) – is one of the most significant works of Spanish Baroque architecture in South America and Quito&#x27;s most ornate church.

Over the 160 years of its construction, the architects of incorporated elements of four architectural styles, although the Baroque is the most prominent. Mudéjar (Moorish) influence is seen in the geometrical figures on the pillars; the Churrigueresque characterizes much of the ornate decoration, especially in the interior walls; finally the Neoclassical style adorns the Chapel of Saint Mariana de Jesús (in early years a winery).

====Mexico====

The Jesuits in New Spain distinguished themselves in several ways. They had high standards for acceptance to the order and many years of training. They attracted the patronage of elite families whose sons they educated in rigorous newly founded Jesuit (&quot;colleges&quot;), including Colegio de San Pedro y San Pablo, Colegio de San Ildefonso, and the Colegio de San Francisco Javier, Tepozotlan. Those same elite families hoped that a son with a vocation to the priesthood would be accepted as a Jesuit. Jesuits were also zealous in evangelization of the indigenous, particularly on the northern frontiers.

To support their and members of the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits acquired landed estates that were run with the best-practices for generating income in that era. A number of these haciendas were donated by wealthy elites. The donation of a hacienda to the Jesuits was the spark igniting a conflict between 17th-century Bishop Don Juan de Palafox of Puebla and the Jesuit &quot;colegio&quot; in that city. Since the Jesuits resisted paying the tithe on their estates, this donation effectively took revenue out of the church hierarchy&#x27;s pockets by removing it from the tithe rolls.

Many of Jesuit haciendas were huge, with Palafox asserting that just two colleges owned 300,000 head of sheep, whose wool was transformed locally in Puebla to cloth; six sugar plantations worth a million pesos and generating an income of 100,000 pesos. The immense Jesuit hacienda of Santa Lucía produced pulque, the alcoholic drink made from fermented agave sap whose main consumers were the lower classes and Indigenous peoples in Spanish cities. Although most haciendas had a free work force of permanent or seasonal labourers, the Jesuit haciendas in Mexico had a significant number of enslaved people of African descent.

The Jesuits operated their properties as an integrated unit with the larger Jesuit order; thus revenues from haciendas funded their . Jesuits did significantly expand missions to the Indigenous in the northern frontier area and a number were martyred, but the crown supported those missions. Mendicant orders that had real estate were less economically integrated, so that some individual houses were wealthy while others struggled economically. The Franciscans, who were founded as an order embracing poverty, did not accumulate real estate, unlike the Augustinians and Dominicans in Mexico.

The Jesuits engaged in conflict with the episcopal hierarchy over the question of payment of tithes, the ten percent tax on agriculture levied on landed estates for support of the church hierarchy from bishops and cathedral chapters to parish priests. Since the Jesuits were the largest religious order holding real estate, surpassing the Dominicans and Augustinians who had accumulated significant property, this was no small matter. They argued that they were exempt, due to special pontifical privileges. Bishop De Palafox took on the Jesuits over this matter and was so soundly defeated that he was recalled to Spain, where he became the bishop of the minor Diocese of Osma.

As elsewhere in the Spanish empire, the Jesuits were expelled from Mexico in 1767. Their haciendas were sold off and their &quot;colegios&quot; and missions in Baja California were taken over by other orders. Exiled Mexican-born Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero wrote an important history of Mexico while in Italy, a basis for creole patriotism. Andrés Cavo also wrote an important text on Mexican history that Carlos María de Bustamante published in the early 19th century. An earlier Jesuit who wrote about the history of Mexico was Diego Luis de Motezuma (1619–99), a descendant of the Aztec monarchs of Tenochtitlan. Motezuma&#x27;s was completed in 1696. He &quot;aimed to show that Mexican emperors were a legitimate dynasty in the 17th-century in the European sense&quot;.

The Jesuits were allowed to return to Mexico in 1840 when General Antonio López de Santa Anna was once more president of Mexico. Their re-introduction to Mexico was &quot;to assist in the education of the poorer classes and much of their property was restored to them&quot;.

====Northern Spanish America====

The Jesuits arrived in the Viceroyalty of Peru by 1571; it was a key area of the Spanish Empire, with not only dense indigenous populations but also huge deposits of silver at Potosí. A major figure in the first wave of Jesuits was José de Acosta (1540–1600), whose book (1590) introduced Europeans to Spain&#x27;s American empire via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on 15 years in Peru and some time in New Spain (Mexico). Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the Indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting to put them in charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indigenous parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.
To minister to newly arrived African slaves, Alonso de Sandoval (1576–1651) worked at the port of Cartagena de Indias. Sandoval wrote about this ministry in (1627), describing how he and his assistant Peter Claver, later canonized, met slave transport ships in the harbour, went below decks where 300–600 slaves were chained, and gave physical aid with water, while introducing the Africans to Christianity. In his treatise, he did not condemn slavery or the ill-treatment of slaves, but sought to instruct fellow Jesuits to this ministry and describe how he catechized the slaves.

Rafael Ferrer was the first Jesuit of Quito to explore and found missions in the upper Amazon regions of South America from 1602 to 1610, which belonged to the Audiencia (high court) of Quito that was a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until it was transferred to the newly created Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717. In 1602, Ferrer began to explore the Aguarico, Napo, and Marañon rivers (Sucumbios region, in what is today Ecuador and Peru), and between 1604 and 1605 set up missions among the Cofane natives. He was martyred by an apostate native in 1610.

In 1639, the Audiencia of Quito organized an expedition to renew its exploration of the Amazon river and the Quito Jesuit (Jesuita Quiteño) Cristóbal de Acuña was a part of this expedition. The expedition disembarked from the Napo river 16 February 1639 and arrived in what is today Pará, Brazil, on the banks of the Amazon river on 12 December 1639. In 1641, Acuña published in Madrid a memoir of his expedition to the Amazon river entitled , which for academics became a fundamental reference on the Amazon region.

In 1637, the Jesuits Gaspar Cugia and Lucas de la Cueva from Quito began establishing the Mainas missions in territories on the banks of the Marañón River, around the Pongo de Manseriche region, close to the Spanish settlement of Borja. Between 1637 and 1652 there were 14 missions established along the Marañón River and its southern tributaries, the Huallaga and the Ucayali rivers. Jesuit de la Cueva and Raimundo de Santacruz opened up two new routes of communication with Quito, through the Pastaza and Napo rivers.

Between 1637 and 1715, Samuel Fritz founded 38 missions along the length of the Amazon river, between the Napo and Negro rivers, that were called the Omagua Missions. These missions were continually attacked by the Brazilian Bandeirantes beginning in the year 1705. In 1768, the only Omagua mission that was left was San Joaquin de Omaguas, since it had been moved to a new location on the Napo river away from the Bandeirantes.

In the immense territory of Maynas, the Jesuits of Quito made contact with a number of indigenous tribes which spoke 40 different languages, and founded a total of 173 Jesuit missions encompassing 150,000 inhabitants. Because of the constant epidemics (smallpox and measles) and warfare with other tribes and the Bandeirantes, the total number of Jesuit Missions were reduced to 40 by 1744. The Jesuit missions offered the Indigenous people Christianity, iron tools, and a small degree of protection from the slavers and the colonists. In exchange, the Indigenous had to submit to Jesuit discipline and adopt, at least superficially, a lifestyle foreign to their experience. The population of the missions was only sustained by frequent expeditions into the jungle by Jesuits, soldiers, and Christian Indians to capture Indigenous people and force them to return or to settle in the missions. At the time when the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish America in 1767, the Jesuits registered 36 missions run by 25 Jesuits in the Audiencia of Quito – 6 in the Napo and Aguarico Missions and 19 in the Pastaza and Iquitos Missions, with a population at 20,000 inhabitants.

====Paraguay====

The Guaraní people of eastern Paraguay and neighboring Brazil and Argentina were in crisis in the early 17th century. Recurrent epidemics of European diseases had reduced their population by up 50 percent and the forced labor of the encomiendas by the Spanish and mestizo colonists had made virtual slaves of many. Franciscan missionaries began establishing missions called reductions in the 1580s. The first Jesuits arrived in Asunción in 1588 and founded their first mission (or reduction) of San Ignacio Guazú in 1609. The objectives of the Jesuits were to make Christians of the Guaraní, impose European values and customs (which were regarded as essential to a Christian life), and isolate and protect the Guaraní from European colonists and slavers.

In addition to recurrent epidemics, the Guaraní were threatened by the slave-raiding Bandeirantes from Brazil, who captured natives and sold them as slaves to work in sugar plantations or as concubines and household servants. Having depleted native populations near São Paulo, they discovered the richly populated Jesuit missions. Initially, the missions had few defenses against the slavers and thousands of Guaraní were captured and enslaved. 

Beginning in 1631, the Jesuits moved their missions from the Guayrá province (present day Brazil and Paraguay), about southwest to the three borders region of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. About 10,000 of 30,000 Guaraní in the missions chose to accompany the Jesuits. In 1641 and 1642, armed by the Jesuits, Guaraní armies defeated the Bandeirantes and ended the worst of the slave trade in their region. From this point on the Jesuit missions enjoyed growth and prosperity, punctuated by epidemics. At the peak of their importance in 1732, the Jesuits presided over 141,000 Guaraní (including a sprinkling of other peoples) who lived in about 30 missions.

The opinions of historians differ with regard to the Jesuit missions. The missions are much-romanticized with the Guaraní portrayed as innocent children of nature and the Jesuits as their wise and benevolent guides to an earthly utopia. &quot;Proponents...highlight that the Jesuits protected the Indians from exploitation and preserved the Guaraní language and other aspects of indigenous culture.&quot; &quot;By means of religion,&quot; wrote the 18th century philosopher Jean d&#x27;Alembert, &quot;the Jesuits established a monarchical authority in Paraguay, founded solely on their powers of persuasion and on their lenient methods of government. Masters of the country, they rendered happy the people under their sway.&quot; Voltaire called the Jesuit missions &quot;a triumph of humanity&quot;.

Detractors say that &quot;the Jesuits took away the Indians&#x27; freedom, forced them to radically change their lifestyle, physically abused them, and subjected them to disease.&quot; Moreover, the missions were inefficient and their economic success &quot;depended on subsidies from the Jesuit order, special protection and privileges from the Crown, and the lack of competition&quot; The Jesuits are portrayed as &quot;exploiters&quot; who &quot;sought to create a kingdom independent of the Spanish and Portuguese Crowns.&quot;

The Comunero Revolt (1721 to 1735) was a serious protest by Spanish and mestizo Paraguayans against the Jesuit missions. The residents of Paraguay violently protested the pro-Jesuit government of Paraguay, Jesuit control of Guaraní labor, and what they regarded as unfair competition for the market for products such as yerba mate. Although the revolt ultimately failed and the missions remained intact, the Jesuits were expelled from institutions they had created in Asunción. In 1756, the Guaraní protested the relocation of seven missions, fighting (and losing) a brief war with both the Spanish and Portuguese. The Jesuits were accused of inciting the Guaraní to rebel. In 1767, Charles III of Spain (1759–88) expelled the Jesuits from the Americas. The expulsion was part of an effort in the Bourbon Reforms to assert more Spanish control over its American colonies. In total, 78 Jesuits departed from the missions leaving behind 89,000 Guaraní in 30 missions.

====Philippines====
The Jesuits were among the original five Catholic religious orders, alongside the Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans and Augustinian Recollects, who evangelized the Philippines in support of Spanish colonization. The Jesuits worked particularly hard in converting the Muslims of Mindanao and Luzon from Islam to Christianity, in which case, they were successful among the cities of Zamboanga and Manila. Zamboanga in particular was run like the Jesuit reductions in Paraguay and housed a large population of Peruvian and Latin American immigrants whereas Manila eventually became the capital of the Spanish colony. In addition to missionary work, the Jesuits compiled artifacts and chronicled the precolonial history and culture of the Philippines. Jesuit chronicler Pedro Chirino chronicled the history of the Kedatuan of Madja-as in Panay and its war against Rajah Makatunao of Sarawak as well as the histories of other Visayan kingdoms. Meanwhile, another Jesuit, Francisco Combés, chronicled the history of the Venice of the Visayas, the Kedatuan of Dapitan, its temporary conquest by the Sultanate of Ternate, its re-establishment in Mindanao and its alliance against the Sultanates of Ternate and Lanao as vassals under Christian Spain. 

The Jesuits also established the first missions in Hindu-dominated Butuan, to convert it to Christianity. The Jesuits also founded many towns, farms, haciendas, educational institutes, libraries, and an observatory in the Philippines. The Jesuits were instrumental in the sciences of medicine, botany, zoology, astronomy and seismology. They trained the Philippines&#x27; second saint, Pedro Calungsod, who was martyred in Guam alongside the Jesuit priest Diego Luis de San Vitores. 

The eventual temporary suppression of the Jesuits due their role in anti-colonial and anti-slavery revolts among the Paraguay reductions, alongside cooperation with the Recollects, allowed their vacated parishes to be put under control by the local nationalistic diocesan clergy; the martyrdom of three of them, the diocesan priests known as Gomburza, inspired José Rizal (also Jesuit-educated upon the restoration of the order), who became the Philippines&#x27; national hero. He successfully started the Philippine Revolution against Spain. 

The Jesuits largely discredited the Freemasons, who claimed responsibility for the American and French Revolutions, by reverting Jose Rizal from Freemasonry back to Catholicism. They argued that since the Philippine Revolution was inspired by the allegedly Masonic ideals behind the French and American revolutions, the French and American Freemasons themselves betrayed their own founding ideals when the American Freemasons annexed the Philippines in the Philippine-American War and the French Freemasons assented to the Treaty of Paris (1898).

In 1953, after being expelled from China by the Communists, the Jesuits relocated their organization&#x27;s nexus in Asia from China to the Philippines and brought along a sizeable Chinese diaspora. The Jesuits currently play a pivotal role in the nation-building of the Philippines with its various Ateneos and educational institutes training the country&#x27;s intellectual elites.

====Colonial Brazil====

Tomé de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, brought the first group of Jesuits to the colony. The Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tomé de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianize the indigenous peoples.

The first Jesuits, guided by Manuel da Nóbrega, Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro, Leonardo Nunes, and later José de Anchieta, established the first Jesuit missions in Salvador and in São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, the settlement that gave rise to the city of São Paulo. Nóbrega and Anchieta were instrumental in the defeat of the French colonists of France Antarctique by managing to pacify the Tamoio natives, who had previously fought the Portuguese. The Jesuits took part in the foundation of the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1565.

The success of the Jesuits in converting the Indigenous peoples is linked to their efforts to understand the native cultures, especially their languages. The first grammar of the Tupi language was compiled by José de Anchieta and printed in Coimbra in 1595. The Jesuits often gathered the natives in communities (the Jesuit reductions), where the natives worked for the community and were evangelised.

The Jesuits had frequent disputes with other colonists who wanted to enslave the natives. The action of the Jesuits saved many natives from being enslaved by Europeans, but also disturbed their ancestral way of life and inadvertently helped spread infectious diseases against which the natives had no natural defenses. Slave labor and trade were essential for the economy of Brazil and other American colonies, and the Jesuits usually did object to the enslavement of African peoples, criticized the conditions of slavery. In cases where individual Jesuit priests criticized the institution of African slavery, they were censored and sent back to Europe.

===Suppression and restoration===

The suppression of the Jesuits alienated the colonial empires from the natives they governed in the Americas and Asia, as the Jesuits were active protectors of native rights against the colonial empires. With the supression of the Order, the profitable Jesuit reductions which gave wealth and protection to natives were sequestered by royal authorities and the natives enslaved. Faced with this supression; the natives, mestizos, and creoles were galvinized into starting the Latin American Wars of Independence. The suppression of the Jesuits in Portugal, France, the Two Sicilies, Parma, and the Spanish Empire by 1767 was deeply troubling to Pope Clement XIII, the society&#x27;s defender. On 21 July 1773 his successor, Pope Clement XIV, issued the papal brief , decreeing:

The suppression was carried out on political grounds in all countries except Prussia for a time, and Russia, where Catherine the Great had forbidden its promulgation. Because millions of Catholics (including many Jesuits) lived in the Polish provinces recently part-annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, the Society was able to maintain its continuity and carry on its work all through the stormy period of suppression. Subsequently, Pope Pius VI granted formal permission for the continuation of the society in Russia and Poland, with Stanisław Czerniewicz elected superior of the province in 1782. He was followed by Gabriel Lenkiewicz, Franciszek Kareu and Gabriel Gruber until 1805, all elected locally as Temporary Vicars General. Pope Pius VII had resolved during his captivity in France to restore the Jesuits universally, and on his return to Rome he did so without much delay. On 7 August 1814, with the bull , he reversed the suppression of the society, and therewith another Polish Jesuit, Tadeusz Brzozowski, who had been elected as superior in Russia in 1805, acquired universal jurisdiction. On his death in 1820 the Jesuits were expelled from Russia by tsar Alexander I.

The period following the Restoration of the Jesuits in 1814 was marked by tremendous growth, as evidenced by the large number of Jesuit colleges and universities established during the 19th century. During this time in the United States, 22 of the society&#x27;s 28 universities were founded or taken over by the Jesuits. It has been suggested that the experience of suppression had served to heighten orthodoxy among the Jesuits. While this claim is debatable, Jesuits were generally supportive of papal authority within the church, and some members became associated with the Ultramontanist movement and the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870.

In Switzerland, the constitution was modified and Jesuits were banished in 1848, following the defeat of the Sonderbund Catholic defence alliance. The ban was lifted on 20 May 1973, when 54.9 per cent of voters accepted a referendum modifying the constitution.

=== Early 20th century ===
In the Constitution of Norway from 1814, a relic from the earlier anti-Catholic laws of Denmark–Norway, Paragraph 2, known as the Jesuit clause, originally read: &quot;The Evangelical-Lutheran religion remains the public religion of the State. Those inhabitants, who confess thereto, are bound to raise their children to the same. Jesuits and monastic orders are not permitted. Jews are still prohibited from entry to the Realm.&quot; Jews were first allowed into the realm in 1851 after the famous Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland had campaigned for this permission. Monastic orders were permitted in 1897, but the ban on Jesuits was only lifted in 1956.

Republican Spain in the 1930s passed laws banning the Jesuits on grounds that they were obedient to a power different from the state. Pope Pius XI wrote about this: &quot;It was an expression of a soul deeply hostile to God and the Catholic religion, to have disbanded the Religious Orders that had taken a vow of obedience to an authority different from the legitimate authority of the State. In this way it was sought to do away with the Society of Jesus – which can well glory in being one of the soundest auxiliaries of the &quot;Chair of Saint Peter&quot; – with the hope, perhaps, of then being able with less difficulty to overthrow in the near future, the Christian faith and morale in the heart of the Spanish nation, which gave to the Church of God the grand and glorious figure of Ignatius Loyola.&quot;

===Post-Vatican II===
The 20th century witnessed both growth and decline of the order. Following a trend within the Catholic priesthood at large, Jesuit numbers peaked in the 1950s and have declined steadily since. Meanwhile, the number of Jesuit institutions has grown considerably, due in large part to a post–Vatican II focus on the establishment of Jesuit secondary schools in inner-city areas and an increase in voluntary lay groups inspired in part by the &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot;. Among the notable Jesuits of the 20th century, John Courtney Murray was called one of the &quot;architects of the Second Vatican Council&quot; and drafted what eventually became the council&#x27;s endorsement of religious freedom, .

In Latin America, the Jesuits had significant influence in the development of liberation theology, a movement that was controversial in the Catholic community after the negative assessment of it by Pope John Paul II in 1984.

Under Superior General Pedro Arrupe, social justice and the preferential option for the poor emerged as dominant themes of the work of the Jesuits. When Arrupe was paralyzed by a stroke in 1981, Pope John Paul II, not entirely pleased with the progressive turn of the Jesuits, took the unusual step of appointing the venerable and aged Paolo Dezza for an interim to oversee &quot;the authentic renewal of the Church&quot;, instead of the progressive American priest Vincent O&#x27;Keefe whom Arrupe had preferred. In 1983 John Paul gave leave for the Jesuits to appoint a successor to Arrupe.

On 16 November 1989, six Jesuit priests (Ignacio Ellacuría, Segundo Montes, Ignacio Martín-Baró, Joaquin López y López, Juan Ramon Moreno, and Amado López), Elba Ramos their housekeeper, and Celia Marisela Ramos her daughter, were murdered by the Salvadoran military on the campus of the University of Central America in San Salvador, El Salvador, because they had been labeled as subversives by the government. The assassinations galvanized the society&#x27;s peace and justice movements, including annual protests at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States, where several of the assassins had been trained under US government sponsorship.

On 21 February 2001, the Jesuit priest Avery Dulles, an internationally known author, lecturer, and theologian, was created a cardinal of the Catholic Church by Pope John Paul II. The son of former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Avery Dulles was long known for his carefully reasoned argumentation and fidelity to the teaching office of the church. An author of 22 books and over 700 theological articles, Dulles died on 12 December 2008 at Fordham University, where he had taught for twenty years as the Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society. He was, at his passing, one of ten Jesuit cardinals in the Catholic Church.

In 2002, Boston College president and Jesuit priest William P. Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program as a means of moving the church &quot;from crisis to renewal&quot;. The initiative has provided the society with a platform for examining issues brought about by the worldwide Catholic sex abuse cases, including the priesthood, celibacy, sexuality, women&#x27;s roles, and the role of the laity.

In April 2005, Thomas J. Reese, editor of the American Jesuit weekly magazine &quot;America&quot;, resigned at the request of the society. The move was widely published in the media as the result of pressure from the Vatican, following years of criticism by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on articles touching subjects such as HIV/AIDS, religious pluralism, homosexuality, and the right of life for the unborn. Following his resignation, Reese spent a year-long sabbatical at Santa Clara University before being named a fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center in Washington, D.C., and later senior analyst for the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;. President Barack Obama appointed him to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2014 and again in 2016.

On 2 February 2006, Peter Hans Kolvenbach informed members of the Society of Jesus that, with the consent of Pope Benedict XVI, he intended to step down as superior general in 2008, the year he would turn 80.

On 22 April 2006, the Feast of Our Lady, Mother of the Society of Jesus, Pope Benedict XVI greeted thousands of Jesuits on pilgrimage to Rome, and took the opportunity to thank God &quot;for having granted to your Company the gift of men of extraordinary sanctity and of exceptional apostolic zeal such as St Ignatius of Loyola, St Francis Xavier, and Blessed Peter Faber&quot;. He said &quot;St Ignatius of Loyola was above all a man of God, who gave the first place of his life to God, to his greater glory and his greater service. He was a man of profound prayer, which found its center and its culmination in the daily Eucharistic Celebration.&quot;

In May 2006, Benedict XVI also wrote a letter to Kolvenbach on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Pope Pius XII&#x27;s encyclical , on devotion to the Sacred Heart, because the Jesuits have always been &quot;extremely active in the promotion of this essential devotion&quot;. In his 3 November 2006 visit to the Pontifical Gregorian University, Benedict XVI cited the university as &quot;one of the greatest services that the Society of Jesus carries out for the universal Church&quot;.

The 35th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus convened on 5 January 2008 and elected Adolfo Nicolás as the new superior general on 19 January 2008. In a letter to the order, Benedict XVI wrote:

In 2013, the Jesuit cardinal Jorge Bergoglio became Pope Francis. Before he became pope, he had been appointed a bishop when he was in &quot;virtual estrangement from the Jesuits&quot; since he was seen as &quot;an enemy of liberation theology&quot; and viewed by others as &quot;still far too orthodox&quot;. He was criticised for colluding with the Argentine junta, while biographers characterised him as working to save the lives of other Jesuits. As a Jesuit pope, he has stressed discernment over following rules, changing the culture of the clergy to steer away from clericalism and to move toward an ethic of service, i.e. to have the &quot;smell of sheep&quot;, staying close to the people. After his papal election, Superior General Adolfo Nicolás praised Pope Francis as a &quot;brother among brothers&quot;.

On 2 October 2016, General Congregation 36 convened in Rome, convoked by Nicolás, who had announced his intention to resign at age 80. On 14 October, the 36th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus elected Arturo Sosa, a Venezuelan, as its thirty-first superior general.

The General Congregation that elected Arturo Sosa in 2016 asked him to bring to completion the process of discerning Jesuit priorities for the time ahead. Sosa devised a plan that enlisted all Jesuits and their lay collaborators in the process of discernment over a 16-month period. Then in February 2019 he presented the results of the discernment, a list of four priorities for Jesuit ministries for the next ten years.

Pope Francis gave his approval to these priorities, saying that they were in harmony with the church&#x27;s present priorities and with the programmatic letter of his pontificate, .

==Ignatian spirituality==

The spirituality practiced by the Jesuits, called Ignatian spirituality, ultimately based on the Catholic faith and the gospels, is drawn from the &quot;Constitutions&quot;, &quot;The Letters&quot;, and &quot;Autobiography&quot;, and most specially from Ignatius&#x27; &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot;, whose purpose is &quot;to conquer oneself and to regulate one&#x27;s life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment&quot;. The &quot;Exercises&quot; culminate in a contemplation whereby one develops a facility to &quot;find God in all things&quot;.

==Formation==

The formation (training) of Jesuits seeks to prepare men spiritually, academically, and practically for the ministries they will be called to offer the church and world. Ignatius was strongly influenced by the Renaissance, and he wanted Jesuits to be able to offer whatever ministries were most needed at any given moment and, especially, to be ready to respond to missions (assignments) from the pope. Formation for priesthood normally takes between eight and fourteen years, depending on the man&#x27;s background and previous education, and final vows are taken several years after that, making Jesuit formation among the longest of any of the religious orders.

==Governance of the society==
The society is headed by a Superior General with the formal title &quot;Praepositus Generalis&quot;, Latin for &quot;provost-general&quot;, more commonly called Father General. He is elected by the General Congregation for life or until he resigns; he is confirmed by the pope and has absolute authority in running the Society. The current Superior General of the Jesuits is the Venezuelan Arturo Sosa who was elected on 14 October 2016.

The Father General is assisted by &quot;assistants&quot;, four of whom are &quot;assistants for provident care&quot; and serve as general advisors and a sort of inner council, and several other regional assistants, each of whom heads an &quot;assistancy&quot;, which is either a geographic area (for instance the North American Assistancy) or an area of ministry (for instance higher education). The assistants normally reside with Father General in Rome and along with others form an advisory council to the General. A vicar general and secretary of the society run day-to-day administration. The General is also required to have an admonitor, a confidential advisor whose task is to warn the General honestly and confidentially when he might be acting imprudently or contrary to the church&#x27;s magisterium. The central staff of the General is known as the Curia.

The society is divided into geographic areas called provinces, each of which is headed by a Provincial Superior, formally called Father Provincial, chosen by the Superior General. He has authority over all Jesuits and ministries in his area, and is assisted by a &quot;socius&quot; who acts as a sort of secretary and chief of staff. With the approval of the Superior General, the Provincial Superior appoints a novice master and a master of tertians to oversee formation, and rectors of local communities of Jesuits. For better cooperation and apostolic efficacy in each continent, the Jesuit provinces are grouped into six Jesuit Conferences worldwide.

Each Jesuit community within a province is normally headed by a rector who is assisted by a &quot;minister&quot;, from the Latin word for &quot;servant&quot;, a priest who helps oversee the community&#x27;s day-to-day needs.

The General Congregation is a meeting of all of the assistants, provincials, and additional representatives who are elected by the professed Jesuits of each province. It meets irregularly and rarely, normally to elect a new superior general and/or to take up some major policy issues for the order. The Superior General meets more regularly with smaller councils composed of just the provincials.

==Statistics==
, the Jesuits formed the largest single religious order of priests and brothers in the Catholic Church. The Jesuits have experienced a decline in numbers in recent decades. As of 2022, the society had 14,439 members (10,432 priests, 837 brothers, 2,587 scholastics, and 583 novices). This represents a 59% percent decline since the Second Vatican Council (1965), when the society had a total membership of 36,038, of which 20,301 were priests. This decline is most pronounced in Europe and the Americas, with relatively modest membership gains occurring in Asia and Africa. According to Patrick Reilly of the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, there seems to be no &quot;Pope Francis effect&quot; in counteracting the fall of vocations among the Jesuits. Twenty-eight novices took first vows in the Jesuits in the United States and Haiti in 2019. In September 2019, the superior general of the Jesuits, Arturo Sosa, estimated that by 2034 the number would decrease to about 10,000 Jesuits, with a much younger average age than in 2019, and with a shift away from Europe and into Latin America, Africa, and India. In 2008, their average age was 57.3 years: 63.4 years for priests, 29.9 years for scholastics, and 65.5 years for brothers.

The current Superior General of the Jesuits is Arturo Sosa. The society is characterized by its ministries in the fields of missionary work, human rights, social justice and, most notably, higher education. It operates colleges and universities in various countries around the world and is particularly active in the Philippines and India. In the United States the Jesuits have historical ties to 27 colleges and universities and 61 high schools. The degree to which the Jesuits are involved in the administration of each institution varies. As of September 2018, 15 of the 27 Jesuit universities in the US had non-Jesuit lay presidents. According to a 2014 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;the number of Jesuit priests who are active in everyday operations at the schools isn&#x27;t nearly as high as it once was&quot;. Worldwide it runs 322 secondary schools and 172 colleges and universities. A typical conception of the mission of a Jesuit school will often contain such concepts as proposing Christ as the model of human life, the pursuit of excellence in teaching and learning, lifelong spiritual and intellectual growth, and training men and women for others.

==Habit and dress==
Jesuits do not have an official habit. The society&#x27;s &quot;Constitutions&quot; gives the following instructions: &quot;The clothing too should have three characteristics: first, it should be proper; second, conformed to the usage of the country of residence; and third, not contradictory to the poverty we profess.&quot; (Const. 577)

The traditional Jesuit-style cassock, called a &quot;soutane&quot; is similar to a robe which is wrapped around the body and was tied with a cincture, rather than the customary buttoned front cassock worn by diocesan priests. A tuftless biretta (only diocesan clergy wore tufts) and a ferraiolo (cape) completed the look.

Today, most Jesuits in the United States wear the clerical collar and black clothing of diocesan priests while most Jesuits in Europe are dressed in civilian clothes.

==Controversies==
===Slavery===
Jesuit scholar Andrew Dial has calculated that the Jesuits owned more than 20,000 slaves worldwide in 1760, the great majority of them in the Americas. The Jesuits in some places protected the indigenous people of the Americas from slavers, notably the Guaraní in South America, but in other places they enslaved indigenous people after &quot;just wars&quot; in which indigenous people who resisted European colonization were defeated. 

The Jesuits also participated in the Atlantic slave trade, working thousands of African slaves on their large plantations scattered throughout the Americas. Antoine Lavalette, a slave-owning French Jesuit in Martinique, accumulated large debts which he was unable to pay which led to the banning of the Jesuits in France in 1764. 

In the United States, tobacco plantations utilizing African-American slave labor in Maryland and other states supported Jesuit institutions such as Georgetown University, from which were infamously sold 272 slaves in 1838. 

In the 16th century, Jesuits were also complicit in the Portuguese trade in enslaved East Asians. In other parts of Europe, slaves were probably employed in Jesuit schools and institutions. 

The Jesuits justified their ownership of slaves and participation in the slave trade as a means of converting slaves to Catholicism. &quot;Enslaved people...were a captive audience for evangelization.&quot;

===Power-seeking===
The &quot;Monita Secreta&quot; (Secret Instructions of the Jesuits), published in 1612 and in 1614 in Kraków, is alleged to have been written by Claudio Acquaviva, the fifth general of the society, but was probably written by former Jesuit Jerome Zahorowski. It purports to describe the methods to be adopted by Jesuits for the acquisition of greater power and influence for the society and for the Catholic Church. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states the book is a forgery, fabricated to ascribe a sinister reputation to the Society of Jesus.

===Political intrigue===
The Jesuits were temporarily banished from France in 1594 after a man named Jean Châtel tried to assassinate the king of France, Henri IV. Under questioning, Châtel revealed that he had been educated by the Jesuits of the Collège de Clermont. The Jesuits were accused of inspiring Châtel&#x27;s attack. Two of his former teachers were exiled and a third was hanged. The Collège de Clermont was closed, and the building was confiscated. The Jesuits were banned from France, although this ban was quickly lifted and the school eventually reopened.

In England, Henry Garnet, one of the leading English Jesuits, was hanged for misprision of treason because of his knowledge of the Gunpowder Plot (1605). The Plot was the attempted assassination of James VI and I, his family, and most of the Protestant aristocracy in a single attack, by exploding the Houses of Parliament. Another Jesuit, Oswald Tesimond, managed to escape arrest for his involvement in this plot.

===Casuistic justification===
Jesuits have been accused of using casuistry to obtain justifications for unjustifiable actions (cf. formulary controversy and , by Blaise Pascal). Hence, the Concise Oxford Dictionary of the English language lists &quot;equivocating&quot; as a secondary denotation of the word &quot;Jesuit&quot;. Modern critics of the Society of Jesus include Avro Manhattan, Alberto Rivera, and Malachi Martin, the latter being the author of &quot;The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church&quot; (1987).

===Exclusion of those of Jewish or Muslim ancestry===
Although in the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuits who were &quot;conversos&quot; (Catholic-convert Jews and Muslims and their descendants), an anti-&quot;converso&quot; faction led to the &quot;Decree de genere&quot; (1593) which proclaimed that either Jewish or Muslim ancestry, no matter how distant, was an insurmountable impediment for admission to the Society of Jesus. This new rule was contrary to the original wishes of Ignatius who &quot;said that he would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage&quot;. The 16th-century &quot;Decree de genere&quot; was repealed in 1946.
Bylaws requiring &quot;blood purity&quot; became common across Early Modern Spain and Portugal.

===Theological debates===
Within the Catholic Church, there has existed a sometimes tense relationship between Jesuits and the Holy See, due to questioning of official church teaching and papal directives, such as those on abortion, birth control, women deacons, homosexuality, and liberation theology. At the same time, Jesuits have been appointed to prominent doctrinal and theological positions in the church; under Pope Benedict XVI, Archbishop Luis Ladaria Ferrer was Secretary and later, under Pope Francis, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

===Religious persecution===
In the quest to evangelize, Jesuits persecuted people of other religions, including Hindus, Muslims and other Christians. The Goan Inquisition was one among various persecutions that Jesuits were involved in. Voltaire wrote that:

==Nazi persecution==
The Catholic Church faced persecution in Nazi Germany. Hitler was anticlerical and had particular disdain for the Jesuits. According to John Pollard, the Jesuits&#x27; &quot;ethos represented the most intransigent opposition to the philosophy of Nazism&quot;, and so the Nazis considered them as one of their most dangerous enemies. A Jesuit college in the city of Innsbruck served as a center for anti-Nazi resistance and was closed down by the Nazis in 1938. Jesuits were a target for Gestapo persecution, and many Jesuit priests were deported to death camps. Jesuits made up the largest contingent of clergy imprisoned in the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp. Vincent Lapomarda lists some 30 Jesuits as having died at Dachau. Of the total of 152 Jesuits murdered by the Nazis across Europe, 43 died in the death camps and an additional 27 died from captivity or its results.

The Superior General of Jesuits at the outbreak of war was Wlodzimierz Ledóchowski, a Pole. The Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland was particularly severe. Lapomarda wrote that Ledóchowski helped &quot;stiffen the general attitude of the Jesuits against the Nazis&quot; and that he permitted Vatican Radio to carry on its campaign against the Nazis in Poland. Vatican Radio was run by the Jesuit Filippo Soccorsi and spoke out against Nazi oppression, particularly with regard to Poland and to Vichy-French antisemitism.

Several Jesuits were prominent in the small German Resistance. Among the central membership of the Kreisau Circle of the Resistance were the Jesuit priests Augustin Rösch, Alfred Delp, and Lothar König. The Bavarian Jesuit Provincial, Augustin Rösch, ended the war on death row for his role in the July Plot to overthrow Hitler. Another non-military German Resistance group, dubbed the &quot;Frau Solf Tea Party&quot; by the Gestapo, included the Jesuit priest Friedrich Erxleben. The German Jesuit Robert Leiber acted as intermediary between Pius XII and the German Resistance.

Among the Jesuit victims of the Nazis, Germany&#x27;s Rupert Mayer has been beatified. Mayer was a Bavarian Jesuit who clashed with the Nazis as early as 1923. Continuing his critique following Hitler&#x27;s rise to power, Mayer was imprisoned in 1939 and sent to Sachsenhausen death camp. As his health declined, the Nazis feared the creation of a martyr and sent him to the Abbey of Ettal in 1940. There he continued to give sermons and lectures against the evils of the Nazi régime, until his death in 1945.

===Rescue efforts during the Holocaust===

In his history of the heroes of the Holocaust, the Jewish historian Martin Gilbert notes that in every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews, and that the Jesuits were one of the Catholic Orders that hid Jewish children in monasteries and schools to protect them from the Nazis. Fourteen Jesuit priests have been formally recognized by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, for risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust of World War II: Roger Braun (1910–1981) of France, Pierre Chaillet (1900–1972) of France, Jean-Baptist De Coster (1896–1968) of Belgium, Jean Fleury (1905–1982) of France, Emile Gessler (1891–1958) of Belgium, Jean-Baptiste Janssens (1889–1964) of Belgium, Alphonse Lambrette (1884–1970) of Belgium, Emile Planckaert (1906–2006) of France, Jacob Raile (1894–1949) of Hungary, Henri Revol (1904–1992) of France, Adam Sztark (1907–1942) of Poland, Henri Van Oostayen (1906–1945) of Belgium, Ioannes Marangas (1901–1989) of Greece, and Raffaele de Chantuz Cubbe (1904–1983) of Italy.

Several other Jesuits are known to have rescued or given refuge to Jews during that period. A plaque commemorating the 152 Jesuit priests who gave their lives during the Holocaust was installed in April 2007 at the Jesuits&#x27; Rockhurst University in Kansas City, Missouri, United States.

==In science==
Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, the teaching of science in Jesuit schools, as laid down in the &quot;Ratio atque Institutio Studiorum Societatis Iesu&quot; (&quot;The Official Plan of studies for the Society of Jesus&quot;) of 1599, was almost entirely based on the works of Aristotle.

The Jesuits, nevertheless, have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to fields from cosmology to seismology, the latter of which has been described as &quot;the Jesuit science&quot;. The Jesuits have been described as &quot;the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century&quot;. According to Jonathan Wright in his book &quot;God&#x27;s Soldiers&quot;, by the eighteenth century the Jesuits had &quot;contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes – to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics, and electricity. They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter&#x27;s surface, the Andromeda nebula, and Saturn&#x27;s rings. They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light.&quot;

The Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy. One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were &quot;regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography&quot;. The Society of Jesus introduced, according to Thomas Woods, &quot;a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible&quot;.

==Notable members==
Notable Jesuits include missionaries, educators, scientists, artists, philosophers, and a pope. Among many distinguished early Jesuits was Francis Xavier, a missionary to Asia who converted more people to Catholicism than anyone before, and Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church. José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega, founders of the city of São Paulo, Brazil, were Jesuit priests. Another famous Jesuit was Jean de Brébeuf, a French missionary who was martyred during the 17th century in what was once New France (in the portion of which, is now Ontario) in Canada.

In Spanish America, José de Acosta wrote a major work on early Peru and New Spain with important material on indigenous peoples. In South America, Peter Claver was notable for his mission to African slaves, building on the work of Alonso de Sandoval. Francisco Javier Clavijero was expelled from New Spain during the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1767 and wrote an important history of Mexico during his exile in Italy. Eusebio Kino is renowned in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (an area then called the Pimería Alta). He founded numerous missions and served as the peace-bringer between the tribes and the government of New Spain. Antonio Ruiz de Montoya was an important missionary in the Jesuit reductions of Paraguay.

Baltasar Gracián was a 17th-century Spanish Jesuit and baroque prose writer and philosopher. He was born in Belmonte, near Calatayud (Aragon). His writings, particularly &quot;El Criticón&quot; (1651–57) and &quot;Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia&quot; (&quot;The Art of Prudence&quot;, 1647) were lauded by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.

In Scotland, John Ogilvie, a Jesuit, is the nation&#x27;s only post-Reformation saint.

Gerard Manley Hopkins was one of the first English poets to use sprung verse. Anthony de Mello was a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist who became widely known for his books which introduced Westerners to the East Indian traditions of spirituality.

Dorothy Lawson was a recusant and patroness of the Society of Jesus, who met yearly at her home to discuss the mission in England after the English Reformation.

Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina was elected by conclave as Pope Francis on March 13th 2013 and is the first Jesuit to be elected pope.

The Feast of All Jesuit Saints and Blesseds is celebrated on 5 November.

==Institutions==
===Educational institutions===

Although the work of the Jesuits today embraces a wide variety of apostolates, ministries, and civil occupations, they are probably most well known for their educational work, on all continents. Since the inception of the order, Jesuits have been teachers. Besides serving on the faculty of Catholic and secular schools, the Jesuits are the Catholic religious order with the second highest number of schools which they run: 168 tertiary institutions in 40 countries and 324 secondary schools in 55 countries. (The Brothers of the Christian Schools have over 560 Lasallian educational institutions.) They also run elementary schools at which they are less likely to teach. Many of the schools are named after Francis Xavier and other prominent Jesuits.

After the Second Vatican Council, Jesuit schools had become a very controversial place of instruction as they abandoned teaching traditional Catholic education with things such as the mastery of Latin and the Baltimore Catechism. Jesuit schools replaced classic theological instruction from people like Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure to people like Karl Rahner and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin which was a very controversial move at the time.

Jesuit educational institutions aim to promote the values of Eloquentia Perfecta. This is a Jesuit tradition that focuses on cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.

===Social and development institutions===
Jesuits have become increasingly involved in works directed primarily toward social and economic development for the poor and marginalized. Included in this would be research, training, advocacy, and action for human development, as well as direct services. Most Jesuit schools have an office that fosters social awareness and social service in the classroom and through extracurricular programs, usually detailed on their websites. The Jesuits also run over 500 notable or stand-alone social or economic development centres in 56 countries around the world.

Jesuits are also known for their involvement in publications. Most Jesuit colleges and universities have their own presses which produce a variety of books, book series, textbooks, and academic publications. 

&quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot;, a periodical produced in Rome by the Jesuits, has often been used as a semi-official platform for popes and officials of the Roman Curia to float ideas for discussion or hint at future statements or positions, though authorship is limited to Jesuits. 

&quot;The Way&quot; is an international journal of contemporary Christian spirituality published by the British Jesuits.

In the United States of America, &quot;America&quot; magazine has long had a prominent place in Catholic intellectual circles Ignatius Press, founded by a Jesuit, is an independent publisher of Catholic books, most of which are of the popular academic or lay-intellectual variety. 

Manresa is a review of Ignatian spirituality published in Madrid, Spain.

In Australia, the Jesuits produce a number of magazines, including &quot;Eureka Street&quot;, &quot;Madonna&quot;, &quot;Australian Catholics&quot;, and &quot;Province Express&quot;.

In Germany, the Jesuits publish the journal and the related publication &quot;Weltweit&quot; that describes their international work (the Jesuitenmission)

In Sweden the Catholic cultural magazine &quot;Signum&quot;, edited by the Newman Institute, covers a broad spectrum of issues concerning faith, culture, research, and society. The printed version of &quot;Signum&quot; is published eight times per year.

Jan Karon was born in the Blue Ridge foothills town of Lenoir, North Carolina as Janice Meredith Wilson. She was named after the novel &quot;Janice Meredith&quot;. Before she was 4, her parents split up and left her with her maternal grandparents on a farm a few miles away in Hudson, North Carolina. 

Her mother Wanda, who was 15 at Jan&#x27;s birth, went to Charlotte. Her father, Robert Wilson, joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. At age 12, Jan moved from Hudson to Charlotte, to rejoin her mother, who had married Toby Setzer and had two more children. She dropped out of school in ninth grade at age 14, and married Robert Freeland in South Carolina, where girls her age could do so legally. Freeland, who was five years older, worked at a Charlotte tire store, while Jan worked in a clothing store. At age 15, she gave birth to her only child, Candace Freeland.

Jan and Freeland&#x27;s marriage was troubled from the beginning, and tragedy rocked it further. While Freeland was sitting in a car with one of his brothers and one or more friends, a gun was handed through the window and went off. The bullet punctured one of Robert Freeland&#x27;s lungs and chipped his spine, nearly killing him and leaving him paralyzed. Jan was distraught, the marriage suffered, and she filed for divorce.

== Career ==
Janice, age 18, was on her own with her daughter Candace. She took a receptionist job at Walter J. Klein Co., a Charlotte advertising agency. Bored with answering the phone, she submitted writing examples. Klein soon had her writing advertising copy. In her early 20s, Jan married Bill Orth, a Duke Power chemist. Orth was active with her in theater and the Unitarian Church. By the late 1960s, Jan and Orth were divorced, and she married a third time, to Arthur Karon, a clothing salesman, and became Jan Karon. Arthur moved his wife and her daughter to Berkeley, California, where they lived for three years.

In California, Karon practiced Judaism, but she did not convert from Christianity. Karon wanted to be a novelist, and tried all through the 1960s. When Karon&#x27;s third marriage ended she returned to Charlotte and again worked in advertising. By 1985, Karon had moved to Raleigh and the McKinney &amp; Silver advertising agency, where she had worked in the late 1970s. Karon and Michael Winslow, a Mckinney designer, collaborated on a tourism campaign, interviewing artisans, musicians and others for print ads aimed at showing that North Carolina had other attractions besides theme parks and big hotels. One ad featured mountain musicians under the headline, &quot;The Best Place to Hear Old English Music Is 3,000 Miles West of London.&quot; The campaign, which ran in &quot;National Geographic&quot; and other magazines, won the 1987 Kelly Award, the print advertising equivalent of the Academy Award. Karon and Winslow split a $100,000 prize.

In 1988, Karon quit her job, traded her Mercedes for a used Toyota and moved to Blowing Rock, North Carolina. In Blowing Rock, Karon began writing Father Tim stories for the &quot;Blowing Rocket&quot; newspaper. An agent circulated Karon&#x27;s fiction to publishers, but got only rejections. In 1994, Karon herself placed her work with a small religious publisher, which brought out a volume titled &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot;. Karon kept writing, and employed her marketing skills to promote her book, writing press releases and cold-calling bookstores. But the publisher offered limited distribution and little marketing muscle of its own. Two more Mitford novels appeared. Sales remained modest. Then Karon&#x27;s friend Mary Richardson, mother of Carolina Panthers&#x27; owner Jerry Richardson, showed &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; to Nancy Olson, owner of Quail Ridge Books &amp; Music in Raleigh. Olson felt there was a large audience looking for clean, well-written fiction. She sent Karon&#x27;s book to a New York agent friend, who got it to Carolyn Carlson, an editor at Viking Penguin and daughter of a Lutheran minister. Carlson faced opposition at Viking Penguin, a mainstream publisher unused to Christian fiction. But in 1996 the New York firm brought out Karon&#x27;s first three titles as paperbacks. By the late 1990s, Karon&#x27;s books were &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers.

In 2021 Karon founded The Mitford Museum in her former elementary school in Hudson, NC. The museum features family history as well as a wealth of information about her writing. Happy Endings Bookstore sells signed copies of her books along with Mitford-related items. The museum is open Wednesday-Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

== Personal life ==
In 2000, Karon left Blowing Rock and moved to Albemarle County, Virginia, where she restored a historic 1816 home and 100 acre farm, Esmont Farm, built by Dr. Charles Cocke (who served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly before the American Civil War).

<text>Franz Joseph Haydn ( ; ; 31 March 173231 May 1809) was an Austrian composer of the Classical period. He was instrumental in the development of chamber music such as the string quartet and piano trio. His contributions to musical form have led him to be called &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot; and &quot;Father of the String quartet&quot;.

Haydn arose from humble origins, the child of working people in a rural village. He established his career first by serving as a chorister at St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna, then through an arduous period as a freelance musician. Eventually he found career success, spending much of his working life as music director for the wealthy Esterházy family at their palace of Eszterháza in rural Hungary. Though he had his own orchestra there, it isolated him from other composers and trends in music so that he was, as he put it, &quot;forced to become original&quot;. During this period his music circulated widely in publication, eventually making him the most celebrated composer in Europe. With the death of his primary patron Nikolaus Esterházy in 1790, Haydn was free to travel, and augmented his fame—now as a performer before the public—in both London and Vienna. The last years of his life (1803-1809) were spent in a state of debility, unable to compose due to poor health. He died in Vienna in 1809 at the age of 77.

Haydn was a friend and mentor of Mozart, a teacher of Beethoven, and the elder brother of composer Michael Haydn.

==Life and career ==

===Early life===

Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau, Austria, a village that at that time stood on the border with Hungary. His father was Mathias Haydn, a wheelwright who also served as &quot;Marktrichter&quot;, or marketplace supervisor. Haydn&#x27;s mother Maria, née Koller, had worked as a cook in the palace of Count Harrach, the presiding aristocrat of Rohrau. Neither parent could read music; however, Mathias was an enthusiastic folk musician, who during the journeyman period of his career had taught himself to play the harp. According to Haydn&#x27;s later reminiscences, his family was extremely musical, and they frequently sang together and with their neighbours.

Haydn&#x27;s parents had noticed that their son was musically gifted and knew that in Rohrau he would have no chance to obtain serious musical training. It was for this reason that, around the time Haydn turned six, they accepted a proposal from their relative Johann Matthias Frankh, the schoolmaster and choirmaster in Hainburg, that Haydn be apprenticed to Frankh in his home to train as a musician. Haydn therefore went off with Frankh to Hainburg and he never again lived with his parents.

Life in the Frankh household was not easy for Haydn, who later remembered being frequently hungry and humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing. He began his musical training there, and could soon play both harpsichord and violin. He also sang treble parts in the church choir.

There is reason to think that Haydn&#x27;s singing impressed those who heard him, because in 1739 he was brought to the attention of Georg Reutter the Younger, the director of music in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna, who happened to be visiting Hainburg and was looking for new choirboys. Haydn passed his audition with Reutter, and after several months of further training moved to Vienna (1740), where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister.

Haydn lived in the Kapellhaus next to the cathedral, along with Reutter, Reutter&#x27;s family, and the other four choirboys, which after 1745 included his younger brother Michael. The choirboys were instructed in Latin and other school subjects as well as voice, violin, and keyboard. Reutter was of little help to Haydn in the areas of music theory and composition, giving him only two lessons in his entire time as a chorister. However, since St. Stephen&#x27;s was one of the leading musical centres in Europe, Haydn learned a great deal simply by serving as a professional musician there.

Like Frankh before him, Reutter did not always bother to make sure Haydn was properly fed. As he later told his biographer Albert Christoph Dies, Haydn was motivated to sing well, in hopes of gaining more invitations to perform before aristocratic audiences, where the singers were usually served refreshments.

=== Struggles as a freelancer ===
By 1749, Haydn had matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts. Empress Maria Theresa herself complained to Reutter about his singing, calling it &quot;crowing&quot;. One day, Haydn carried out a prank, snipping off the pigtail of a fellow chorister. This was enough for Reutter: Haydn was first caned, then summarily dismissed and sent into the streets. He had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend, Johann Michael Spangler, who shared his family&#x27;s crowded garret room with Haydn for a few months. Haydn immediately began his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician.
Haydn struggled at first, working at many different jobs: as a music teacher, as a street serenader, and eventually, in 1752, as valet-accompanist for the Italian composer Nicola Porpora, from whom he later said he learned &quot;the true fundamentals of composition&quot;. He was also briefly in Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz&#x27;s employ, playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz.

While a chorister, Haydn had not received any systematic training in music theory and composition. As a remedy, he worked his way through the counterpoint exercises in the text &quot;Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; by Johann Joseph Fux and carefully studied the work of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, whom he later acknowledged as an important influence. He said of CPE Bach&#x27;s first six keyboard sonatas, &quot;I did not leave my clavier till I played them through, and whoever knows me thoroughly must discover that I owe a great deal to Emanuel Bach, that I understood him and have studied him with diligence.&quot; According to Griesinger and Dies, in the 1750s Haydn studied an encyclopedic treatise by Johann Mattheson, a German composer.

As his skills increased, Haydn began to acquire a public reputation, first as the composer of an opera, &quot;Der krumme Teufel&quot;, &quot;The Limping Devil&quot;, written for the comic actor Joseph Felix von Kurz, whose stage name was &quot;Bernardon&quot;. The work was premiered successfully in 1753, but was soon closed down by the censors due to &quot;offensive remarks&quot;. Haydn also noticed, apparently without annoyance, that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops. Between 1754 and 1756 Haydn also worked freelance for the court in Vienna. He was among several musicians who were paid for services as supplementary musicians at balls given for the imperial children during carnival season, and as supplementary singers in the imperial chapel (the &quot;Hofkapelle&quot;) in Lent and Holy Week.

With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer in his day. Countess Thun, having seen one of Haydn&#x27;s compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher. In 1756, Baron Carl Josef Fürnberg employed Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote his first string quartets. Their enthusiastic reception encouraged Haydn to write more. Fürnberg later recommended Haydn to Count Morzin, who, in 1757, became his first full-time employer. 

===Years as Kapellmeister===

Haydn&#x27;s job title under Count Morzin was &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;, that is, music director. Like many aristocrats of the Austrian Empire at the time, the Count kept his own small orchestra, which Haydn led and composed for. His salary was a respectable 200 florins a year, plus free board and lodging. The Count lived the typical aristocractic lifestyle: winters in fashionable Vienna, but in summer escaping the heat and dust of the city for the ancestral estate in the country; this was at Unterlukawitz, now in the Czech Republic. Haydn and his musicians served their employer wherever he happened to be living. For Count Morzin Haydn wrote his first symphonies (perhaps about 10-20; the number is unknown). Philip Downs comments on these first symphonies: &quot;the seeds of the future are there, his works already exhibit a richness and profusion of material, and a disciplined yet varied expression.&quot; 
In 1760, with the security of a Kapellmeister position, Haydn married. His wife was the former Maria Anna Theresia Keller (1729–1800), the sister of Therese (b. 1733), with whom Haydn had previously been in love. Haydn and his wife had an unhappy marriage, from which the laws of the time permitted no escape. They produced no children, and both took lovers.

Count Morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment, but Haydn was quickly offered a similar job (1761) by Prince Paul Anton, head of the immensely wealthy Esterházy family. Haydn&#x27;s job title was only Vice-Kapellmeister, but he was immediately placed in charge of most of the Esterházy musical establishment, with the old Kapellmeister Gregor Werner retaining authority only for church music. When Werner died in 1766, Haydn was elevated to full Kapellmeister.

As a &quot;house officer&quot; in the Esterházy establishment, Haydn wore livery and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces, most importantly the family&#x27;s ancestral seat Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt and later on Esterháza, a grand new palace built in rural Hungary in the 1760s. Haydn had a huge range of responsibilities, including composition, running the orchestra, playing chamber music for and with his patrons, and eventually the mounting of operatic productions. Despite this backbreaking workload, the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for Haydn. The Esterházy princes (Paul Anton, then from 1762 to 1790 Nikolaus I) were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra. During the nearly thirty years that Haydn worked at the Esterházy court, he produced a flood of compositions, and his musical style continued to develop.

Much of Haydn&#x27;s activity at the time followed the musical taste of his patron Prince Nikolaus. In about 1765, the prince obtained and began to learn to play the baryton, an uncommon musical instrument similar to the bass viol, but with a set of plucked sympathetic strings. Haydn was commanded to provide music for the prince to play, and over the next ten years produced about 200 works for this instrument in various ensembles, the most notable of which are the 126 baryton trios. Around 1775, the prince abandoned the baryton and took up a new hobby: opera productions, previously a sporadic event for special occasions, became the focus of musical life at court, and the opera theatre the prince had built at Esterháza came to host a major season, with multiple productions each year. Haydn served as company director, recruiting and training the singers and preparing and leading the performances. He wrote several of the operas performed and wrote substitution arias to insert into the operas of other composers.

1779 was a watershed year for Haydn, as his contract was renegotiated: whereas previously all his compositions were the property of the Esterházy family, he now was permitted to write for others and sell his work to publishers. Haydn soon shifted his emphasis in composition to reflect this (fewer operas, and more quartets and symphonies) and he negotiated with multiple publishers, both Austrian and foreign. His new employment contract &quot;acted as a catalyst in the next stage in Haydn&#x27;s career, the achievement of international popularity. By 1790 Haydn was in the paradoxical position ... of being Europe&#x27;s leading composer, but someone who spent his time as a duty-bound Kapellmeister in a remote palace in the Hungarian countryside.&quot; The new publication campaign resulted in the composition of a great number of new string quartets (the six-quartet sets of Op. 33, 50, 54/55, and 64). Haydn also composed in response to commissions from abroad: the Paris symphonies (1785–1786) and the original orchestral version of &quot;The Seven Last Words of Christ&quot; (1786), a commission from Cádiz, Spain.

The remoteness of Eszterháza, which was farther from Vienna than Eisenstadt, led Haydn gradually to feel more isolated and lonely. He longed to visit Vienna because of his friendships there. Of these, a particularly important one was with Maria Anna von Genzinger (1754–1793), the wife of Prince Nikolaus&#x27;s personal physician in Vienna, who began a close, platonic relationship with the composer in 1789. Haydn wrote to Mrs. Genzinger often, expressing his loneliness at Esterháza and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in Vienna. Later on, Haydn wrote to her frequently from London. Her premature death in 1793 was a blow to Haydn, and his F minor variations for piano, Hob. XVII:6, may have been written in response to her death.

Another friend in Vienna was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whom Haydn had met sometime around 1784. According to later testimony by Michael Kelly and others, the two composers occasionally played in string quartets with Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf (second violin) and Johann Baptist Wanhal (cello) for small gatherings attended by Giovanni Paisiello and Giovanni Battista Casti. Impressed by Mozart&#x27;s work, Haydn praised it unstintingly to others. Mozart returned the esteem in his &quot;Haydn&quot; quartets. In 1785 Haydn was admitted to the same Masonic lodge as Mozart, the &quot;Zur wahren Eintracht&quot; in Vienna.

=== London journeys ===

In 1790, Prince Nikolaus died and was succeeded as prince by his son Anton. Following a trend of the time, Anton sought to economize by dismissing most of the court musicians. Haydn retained a nominal appointment with Anton, at a reduced salary of 400 florins, as well as a 1000-florin pension from Nikolaus. Since Anton had little need of Haydn&#x27;s services, he was willing to let him travel, and the composer accepted a lucrative offer from Johann Peter Salomon, a German violinist and impresario, to visit England and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra.

The choice was a sensible one because Haydn was already a very popular composer there. Since the death of Johann Christian Bach in 1782, Haydn&#x27;s music had dominated the concert scene in London; &quot;hardly a concert did not feature a work by him&quot;. Haydn&#x27;s work was widely distributed by publishers in London, including Forster (who had their own contract with Haydn) and Longman &amp; Broderip (who served as an agent in England for Haydn&#x27;s Vienna publisher Artaria). Efforts to bring Haydn to London had been made since 1782, though Haydn&#x27;s loyalty to Prince Nikolaus had prevented him from accepting.

After fond farewells from Mozart and other friends, Haydn departed from Vienna with Salomon on 15 December 1790, arriving in Calais in time to cross the English Channel on New Year&#x27;s Day of 1791. It was the first time that the 58-year-old composer had seen the sea. Arriving in London, Haydn stayed with Salomon in Great Pulteney Street (London, near Piccadilly Circus) working in a borrowed studio at the Broadwood piano firm nearby.

It was the start of a very auspicious period for Haydn: both the 1791–1792 journey, along with a repeat visit in 1794–1795, were greatly successful. Audiences flocked to Haydn&#x27;s concerts; he augmented his fame and made large profits, thus becoming financially secure. Charles Burney reviewed the first concert thus: &quot;Haydn himself presided at the piano-forte; and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience, as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in England.&quot; Haydn made many new friends and, for a time, was involved in a romantic relationship with Rebecca Schroeter.
Musically, Haydn&#x27;s visits to England generated some of his best-known work, including the &quot;Surprise&quot;, &quot;Military&quot;, &quot;Drumroll&quot; and &quot;London&quot; symphonies; the &quot;Rider&quot; quartet; and the &quot;Gypsy Rondo&quot; piano trio. The great success of the overall enterprise does not mean that the journeys were free of trouble. Notably, his first project, the commissioned opera &quot;L&#x27;anima del filosofo&quot; was duly written during the early stages of the trip, but the opera&#x27;s impresario John Gallini was unable to obtain a license to permit opera performances in the theatre he directed, the King&#x27;s Theatre. Haydn was well paid for the opera (£300) but much time was wasted. Thus only two new symphonies, no. 95 and no. 96 &quot;Miracle&quot;, could be premiered in the 12 concerts of Salomon&#x27;s spring concert series in 1791. Another problem arose from the jealously competitive efforts of a senior, rival orchestra, the Professional Concerts, who recruited Haydn&#x27;s old pupil Ignaz Pleyel as a rival visiting composer; the two composers, refusing to play along with the concocted rivalry, dined together and put each other&#x27;s symphonies on their concert programs.

The end of Salomon&#x27;s series in June gave Haydn a rare period of relative leisure. He spent some of the time in the country (Hertingfordbury), but also had time to travel, notably to Oxford, where he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university. The symphony performed for the occasion, no. 92 has since come to be known as the &quot;Oxford Symphony&quot;, although it had been written two years before, in 1789. Four further new symphonies (Nos. 93, 94, 97 and 98) were performed in early 1792.
While travelling to London in 1790, Haydn met the young Ludwig van Beethoven in his native city of Bonn. On Haydn&#x27;s return, Beethoven came to Vienna and was Haydn&#x27;s pupil up until the second London journey. Haydn took Beethoven with him to Eisenstadt for the summer, where Haydn had little to do, and taught Beethoven some counterpoint. While in Vienna, Haydn purchased a house for himself and his wife in the suburbs and started remodelling it. He also arranged for the performance of some of his London symphonies in local concerts.

By the time he arrived on his second journey to England (1794–1795), Haydn had become a familiar figure on the London concert scene. The 1794 season was dominated by Salomon&#x27;s ensemble, as the Professional Concerts had abandoned their efforts. The concerts included the premieres of the 99th, 100th, and 101st symphonies. In 1795, Salomon had abandoned his own series, citing difficulty in obtaining &quot;vocal performers of the first rank from abroad&quot;, and Haydn joined forces with the Opera Concerts, headed by the violinist Giovanni Battista Viotti. These were the venues of the last three symphonies, 102, 103, and 104. The final benefit concert for Haydn (&quot;Dr. Haydn&#x27;s night&quot;) at the end of the 1795 season was a great success and was perhaps the peak of his English career. Haydn&#x27;s biographer Griesinger wrote that Haydn &quot;considered the days spent in England the happiest of his life. He was everywhere appreciated there; it opened a new world to him&quot;.

Haydn returned to Vienna in 1795. Prince Anton had died, and his successor Nikolaus II proposed that the Esterházy musical establishment be revived with Haydn serving again as Kapellmeister. Haydn took up the position on a part-time basis. He spent his summers with the Esterházys in Eisenstadt, and over the course of several years wrote six masses for them including the Lord Nelson mass in 1798.
By this time Haydn had become a public figure in Vienna. He spent most of his time in his home, a large house in the suburb of Windmühle, and wrote works for public performance. In collaboration with his librettist and mentor Gottfried van Swieten, and with funding from van Swieten&#x27;s Gesellschaft der Associierten, he composed his two great oratorios, &quot;The Creation&quot; (1798) and &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1801). Both were enthusiastically received. Haydn frequently appeared before the public, often leading performances of &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot; for charity benefits, including Tonkünstler-Societät programs with massed musical forces. He also composed instrumental music: the popular &quot;Trumpet Concerto&quot;, and the last nine in his long series of string quartets, including the &quot;Fifths&quot;, &quot;Emperor&quot;, and &quot;Sunrise&quot;. Directly inspired by hearing audiences sing God Save the King in London, in 1797 Haydn wrote a patriotic &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Hymn&quot; &quot;&quot;, (&quot;God Save Emperor Francis&quot;). This achieved great success and became &quot;the enduring emblem of Austrian identity right up to the First World War&quot; (Jones). The melody was used for von Fallersleben&#x27;s (1841), whose third stanza is today the national anthem of Germany. 

During the later years of this successful period, Haydn faced incipient old age and fluctuating health, and he had to struggle to complete his final works. His last major work, from 1802, was the sixth mass for the Esterházys, the &quot;Harmoniemesse&quot;.

===Retirement, illness, and death===
By the end of 1803, Haydn&#x27;s condition had declined to the point that he became physically unable to compose. He suffered from weakness, dizziness, inability to concentrate and painfully swollen legs. Since diagnosis was uncertain in Haydn&#x27;s time, it is unlikely that the precise illness can ever be identified, though Jones suggests arteriosclerosis. The illness was especially hard for Haydn because the flow of fresh musical ideas continued unabated, although he could no longer work them out as compositions. His biographer Dies reported Haydn saying in 1806:


The winding down of Haydn&#x27;s career was gradual. The Esterházy family kept him on as Kapellmeister to the very end (much as they had with his predecessor Werner long before), but they appointed new staff to lead their musical establishment: Johann Michael Fuchs in 1802 as Vice-Kapellmeister and Johann Nepomuk Hummel as Konzertmeister in 1804. Haydn&#x27;s last summer in Eisenstadt was in 1803, and his last appearance before the public as a conductor was a charity performance of &quot;The Seven Last Words&quot; on 26 December 1803. As debility set in, he made largely futile efforts at composition, attempting to revise a rediscovered &quot;Missa brevis&quot; from his teenage years and complete his final string quartet. The former project was abandoned for good in 1805, and the quartet was published with just two movements.

Haydn was well cared for by his servants, and he received many visitors and public honours during his last years, but they could not have been very happy years for him. During his illness, Haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing his &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Hymn&quot;. A final triumph occurred on 27 March 1808 when a performance of &quot;The Creation&quot; was organized in his honour. The very frail composer was brought into the hall on an armchair to the sound of trumpets and drums and was greeted by Beethoven, Salieri (who led the performance) and by other musicians and members of the aristocracy. Haydn was both moved and exhausted by the experience and had to depart at intermission.
Haydn lived on for 14 more months. His final days were hardly serene, as in May 1809 the French army under Napoleon launched an attack on Vienna and on 10 May bombarded his neighbourhood. According to Griesinger, &quot;Four case shots fell, rattling the windows and doors of his house. He called out in a loud voice to his alarmed and frightened people, &#x27;Don&#x27;t be afraid, children, where Haydn is, no harm can reach you!&#x27;. But the spirit was stronger than the flesh, for he had hardly uttered the brave words when his whole body began to tremble.&quot; More bombardments followed until the city fell to the French on 13 May. Haydn, was, however, deeply moved and appreciative when on 17 May a French cavalry officer named Sulémy came to pay his respects and sang, skillfully, an aria from &quot;The Creation&quot;.

On 26 May Haydn played his &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Hymn&quot; with unusual gusto three times; the same evening he collapsed and was taken to what proved to be his deathbed. He died peacefully in his own home at 12:40 a.m. on 31 May 1809, aged 77. On 15 June, a memorial service was held in the Schottenkirche at which Mozart&#x27;s Requiem was performed. Haydn&#x27;s remains were interred in the local Hundsturm cemetery until 1820 when they were moved to Eisenstadt by Prince Nikolaus. His head took a different journey; it was stolen by phrenologists shortly after burial, and the skull was reunited with the other remains only in 1954, now interred in a tomb in the north tower of the Bergkirche.

==Character and appearance==

James Webster writes of Haydn&#x27;s public character thus: &quot;Haydn&#x27;s public life exemplified the Enlightenment ideal of the &quot;honnête homme&quot; (&quot;honest man&quot;): the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other. His modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged. These traits were not only prerequisites to his success as Kapellmeister, entrepreneur and public figure, but also aided the favourable reception of his music.&quot; Haydn was especially respected by the Esterházy court musicians whom he supervised, as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians&#x27; interests with their employer; see Papa Haydn and the tale of the &quot;Farewell&quot; Symphony. Haydn had a robust sense of humour, evident in his love of practical jokes and often apparent in his music, and he had many friends. For much of his life he benefited from a &quot;happy and naturally cheerful temperament&quot;, but in his later life, there is evidence for periods of depression, notably in the correspondence with Mrs. Genzinger and in Dies&#x27;s biography, based on visits made in Haydn&#x27;s old age.

Haydn was a devout Catholic who often turned to his rosary when he had trouble composing, a practice that he usually found to be effective. He normally began the manuscript of each composition with [in the name of the Lord] and ended with [praise be to God]. He retained this practice even in his secular works; he frequently only uses the initials &quot;L. D.&quot;, &quot;S. D. G.&quot; , or and sometimes adds, &quot;et om si ( – and all saints)

Haydn&#x27;s early years of poverty and awareness of the financial precariousness of musical life made him astute and even sharp in his business dealings. Some contemporaries (usually, it has to be said, wealthy ones) were surprised and even shocked at this. Webster writes: &quot;As regards money, Haydn…always attempted to maximize his income, whether by negotiating the right to sell his music outside the Esterházy court, driving hard bargains with publishers or selling his works three and four times over [to publishers in different countries]; he regularly engaged in &#x27;sharp practice&#x27;&quot; which nowadays might be regarded as plain fraud. But those were days when copyright was in its infancy, and the pirating of musical works was common. Publishers had few qualms about attaching Haydn&#x27;s name to popular works by lesser composers, an arrangement that effectively robbed the lesser musician of livelihood. Webster notes that Haydn&#x27;s ruthlessness in business might be viewed more sympathetically in light of his struggles with poverty during his years as a freelancer—and that outside the world of business, in his dealings, for example, with relatives, musicians and servants, and in volunteering his services for charitable concerts, Haydn was a generous man – e.g., offering to teach the two infant sons of Mozart for free after their father&#x27;s death. When Haydn died he was certainly comfortably off, but by middle class rather than aristocratic standards.

Haydn was short in stature, perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth. He was not handsome, and like many in his day he was a survivor of smallpox; his face was pitted with the scars of this disease. His biographer Dies wrote: &quot;he couldn&#x27;t understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman. &#x27;They couldn&#x27;t have been led to it by my beauty.

Haydn generally enjoyed good health, but he suffered from nasal polyps during much of his adult life, an agonizing and debilitating condition that at times prevented him from writing music.

==Music==

For a full listing of Haydn&#x27;s compositions, see List of compositions by Joseph Haydn.

James Webster summarizes Haydn&#x27;s role in the history of classical music as follows:

=== Structure ===

A central characteristic of Haydn&#x27;s music is the development of larger structures out of very short, simple musical motifs, often derived from standard accompanying figures. The music is often quite formally concentrated, and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly. W. Dean Sutcliffe mentions this in a criticism of contemporary Haydn performance practice: 
[Haydn&#x27;s] music sometime seems to &#x27;live on its nerves&#x27; ... It is above all in this respect that Haydn performances often fail, whereby most interpreters lack the mental agility to deal with the ever-changing &#x27;physiognomy&#x27; of Haydn&#x27;s music, subsiding instead into an ease of manner and a concern for broader effects that they have acquired in their playing of Mozart.
Haydn&#x27;s work was central to the development of what came to be called sonata form. His practice, however, differed in some ways from that of Mozart and Beethoven, his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition. Haydn was particularly fond of the so-called monothematic exposition, in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme. Haydn also differs from Mozart and Beethoven in his recapitulation sections, where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive thematic development. Of these &quot;rearranged recapitulations&quot;, Rosemary Hughes writes
 Having begun to &#x27;develop&#x27;, he could not stop; his recapitulations begin to take on irregular contours, sometimes sharply condensed, sometimes surprisingly expanded, losing their first tame symmetry to regain a balance of a far higher and more satisfying order.
Haydn&#x27;s formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the fugue into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic (see sonata rondo form). Haydn was also the principal exponent of the double variation form—variations on two alternating themes, which are often major- and minor-mode versions of each other.

=== Character ===

The Haydn scholar Karl Geiringer has emphasized the sheer joyfulness of much of Haydn&#x27;s music:
Out of Haydn&#x27;s love for the beauties of our world grew the gaiety and affirmative spirit apparent throughout all his creative periods ... Even in his advanced age, this gaiety did not entirely desert him. Nurtured by ... a victorious optimism maintained through all the vicissitudes of a long and arduous life, this radiant joyfulness again and again manifested itself, and Haydn considered it his mission to let his fellow beings share in this unique gift.
The sense of bliss often evident in Haydn&#x27;s music was also noticed by Charles Rosen, who (describing a theme in the piano trio Hob. XV:13), wrote of 
Haydn&#x27;s ability to create an emotion that was completely his own and that no other composer could duplicate -- a feeling of ecstasy that is completely unsensual, almost amiable. There is no recipe for producing this effect ...
A modest number of Haydn&#x27;s works are striking exceptions to this upbeat character. Some excursions into emotional darkness include The Seven Last Words of Christ, the &quot;largo&quot; movement of the string quartet Op. 76 no. 5, which Haydn marked &quot;mesto&quot; (sorrowful), and the widely admired coda section of his Variations in F minor for piano.

Perhaps more than any other composer&#x27;s, Haydn&#x27;s music is known for its humour; specifically, incongruous musical passages heard as jokes. The most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his &quot;Surprise&quot; symphony; Haydn&#x27;s many other musical jokes include numerous false endings (e.g., in the quartets Op. 33 No. 2 and Op. 50 No. 3), and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of Op. 50 No. 1.

Haydn&#x27;s fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy, especially in the finales. Some characteristic examples of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;rollicking&quot; finale type are found in the &quot;London&quot; Symphony No. 104, the String Quartet Op. 50 No. 1, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 27. Haydn&#x27;s early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo, relaxed, and reflective. Later on, the emotional range of the slow movements increases, notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets Op. 76 Nos. 3 and 5, the Symphonies No. 98 and 102, and the Piano Trio Hob XV: 23. The minuets tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character. Over time, Haydn turned some of his minuets into &quot;scherzi&quot; which are much faster, at one beat to the bar.

===Style===
Haydn&#x27;s lifetime overlapped substantially with those of the most celebrated masters of Baroque music: he was born 18 years before the death of J. S. Bach and 27 years before that of Handel. Yet the models that influenced him, according to Karl Geiringer, were not at all these composers, but rather the leaders in the earliest development of the emerging Classical style, particularly in Vienna: his employer Johann Georg Reutter, Georg Christoph Wagenseil, and Georg Matthias Monn  -- none of whom wrote music that is widely played today. This was a period of exploration and uncertainty, and Haydn was himself one of the musical explorers of this time. Fairly early in his career Haydn discovered, and quickly came to revere, the music of a composer from outside Vienna, J. S. Bach&#x27;s son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Geiringer emphasizes how Haydn was struck by the emotional depth of Bach&#x27;s work: &quot;Up to then he had been familiar with the gay and superficial idiom of the musical rococo; here he found compositions that deeply stirred and excited him.&quot;.

Tracing Haydn&#x27;s subsequent work over the six decades in which it was produced (he composed from about 1749 to 1802), one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication, which developed as Haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues. Several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of Haydn&#x27;s musical style.

In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Haydn entered a stylistic period known as &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; (&quot;storm and stress&quot;). This term is taken from a literary movement of about the same time, though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years. The musical language of this period is similar to what went before, but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive, especially in the works in minor keys. James Webster describes the works of this period as &quot;longer, more passionate, and more daring&quot;. Some of the most famous compositions of this time are the &quot;Trauer&quot; (Mourning) Symphony No. 44, &quot;Farewell&quot; Symphony No. 45, the Piano Sonata in C minor (Hob. XVI/20, L. 33), and the six &quot;Sun&quot; Quartets Op. 20, all from c. 1771–72. It was also around this time that Haydn became interested in writing fugues in the Baroque style, and three of the Op. 20 quartets end with a fugue.

Following the climax of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, Haydn returned to a lighter, more overtly entertaining style. There are no quartets from this period, and the symphonies take on new features: the scoring often includes trumpets and timpani. These changes are often related to a major shift in Haydn&#x27;s professional duties, which moved him away from instrumental music and toward the production of comic operas. Several of the operas were Haydn&#x27;s own work (see List of operas by Joseph Haydn); these are seldom performed today. Haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works, which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade.

In 1779, an important change in Haydn&#x27;s contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer. This may have encouraged Haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of instrumental music. The change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781, when Haydn published the six Op. 33 String Quartets, announcing (in a letter to potential purchasers) that they were written in &quot;a new and completely special way&quot;. Charles Rosen has argued that this assertion on Haydn&#x27;s part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously, and he points out a number of important advances in Haydn&#x27;s compositional technique that appear in these quartets, advances that mark the advent of the Classical style in full flower. These include a fluid form of phrasing, in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption, the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material, and a kind of &quot;Classical counterpoint&quot; in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity. These traits continue in the many quartets that Haydn wrote after Op. 33.

In the 1790s, stimulated by his England journeys, Haydn developed what Rosen calls his &quot;popular style&quot;, a method of composition that, with unprecedented success, created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure. An important element of the popular style was the frequent use of folk or folk-like material (see Haydn and folk music). Haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations, such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales. In such locations, the folk material serves as an element of stability, helping to anchor the larger structure. Haydn&#x27;s popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work, including the twelve &quot;London&quot; symphonies, the late quartets and piano trios, and the two late oratorios.

The return to Vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in Haydn&#x27;s career. Although his musical style evolved little, his intentions as a composer changed. While he had been a servant, and later a busy entrepreneur, Haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion, with frequent deadlines. As a rich man, Haydn now felt that he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity. This is reflected in the subject matter of &quot;The Creation&quot; (1798) and &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1801), which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music. Haydn&#x27;s new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work: both oratorios took him over a year to complete. Haydn once remarked that he had worked on &quot;The Creation&quot; so long because he wanted it to last.

The change in Haydn&#x27;s approach was important in the history of classical music, as other composers were soon following his lead. Notably, Beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high.

===Catalogues===
Anthony van Hoboken prepared a comprehensive catalogue of Haydn&#x27;s works. The Hoboken catalogue assigns a catalogue number to each work, called its Hoboken number (abbreviated H. or Hob.). These Hoboken numbers are often used in identifying Haydn&#x27;s compositions.

Haydn&#x27;s string quartets also have Hoboken numbers, but they are usually identified instead by their opus numbers, which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that Haydn published together. For example, the string quartet Opus 76, No. 3 is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as Opus 76.

===Instruments===
An &quot;Anton Walter in Wien&quot; fortepiano used by the composer is now on display in the &quot;Haydn-Haus Eisenstadt&quot;. In Vienna in 1788 Haydn bought himself a fortepiano made by Wenzel Schantz. When the composer was visiting London for the first time, an English piano builder, John Broadwood, supplied him with a concert grand.

<text>James Marshall &quot;Jimi&quot; Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, songwriter and singer. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential guitarists in the history of popular music. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a part of his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the institution describes him as &quot;arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.&quot;

Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at age 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin&#x27; circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers&#x27; backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires.

Hendrix moved to England in late 1966, after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, he had formed his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience (with its rhythm section consisting of bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell), and achieved three UK top ten hits: &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;. He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. His third and final studio album, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; (1968), became his most commercially successful release and his only number one album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The world&#x27;s highest-paid rock musician, Hendrix headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. He died in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia in September 1970, at the age of 27.

Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented: &quot;Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.&quot;

== Ancestry and childhood ==

Hendrix was of African-American and alleged Cherokee descent. His paternal grandfather, Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix, was born in 1866 from an extramarital affair between a woman named Fanny and a grain merchant from either Urbana, Ohio or Illinois, one of the wealthiest men in the area at that time. Hendrix&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Zenora &quot;Nora&quot; Rose Moore, was a former dancer and vaudeville performer who co-founded Fountain Chapel in Hogan&#x27;s Alley. Hendrix and Moore relocated to Vancouver, Canada, where they had a son they named James Allen Hendrix on June 10, 1919; the family called him &quot;Al&quot;.

In 1941, after moving to Seattle, Washington, Al met Lucille Jeter (1925–1958) at a dance; they married on March 31, 1942. Lucille&#x27;s father (Jimi&#x27;s maternal grandfather) was Preston Jeter (born 1875), whose mother was born in similar circumstances as Bertran Philander Ross Hendrix. Lucille&#x27;s mother, Clarice (&quot;née&quot; Lawson), had African-American ancestors who had been enslaved people. Al, who had been drafted by the US Army to serve in World War II, left to begin his basic training three days after the wedding. Johnny Allen Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle; he was the first of Lucille&#x27;s five children. In 1946, Johnny&#x27;s parents changed his name to James Marshall Hendrix, in honor of Al and his late brother Leon Marshall.

Stationed in Alabama at the time of Hendrix&#x27;s birth, Al was denied the standard military furlough afforded servicemen for childbirth; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son in Seattle. He spent two months locked up without trial, and, while in the stockade, received a telegram announcing his son&#x27;s birth. During Al&#x27;s three-year absence, Lucille struggled to raise their son. When Al was away, Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends, especially Lucille&#x27;s sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the US Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later, unable to find Lucille, Al went to the Berkeley, California, home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ, who had taken care of and attempted to adopt Hendrix; this is where Al saw his son for the first time.

After returning from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but his inability to find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon in and out of foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela in 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother&#x27;s. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, he confided to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.

=== First instruments ===
At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle during the mid-1950s, Hendrix&#x27;s habit of carrying a broom with him to emulate a guitar gained the attention of the school&#x27;s social worker. After more than a year of his clinging to a broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving him without a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.

In 1957, while helping his father with a side-job, Hendrix found a ukulele among the garbage they were removing from an older woman&#x27;s home. She told him that he could keep the instrument, which had only one string. Learning by ear, he played single notes, following along to Elvis Presley songs, particularly &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. By the age of 33, Hendrix&#x27;s mother Lucille had developed cirrhosis of the liver, and on February 2, 1958, she died when her spleen ruptured. Al refused to take James and Leon to attend their mother&#x27;s funeral; he instead gave them shots of whiskey and told them that was how men should deal with loss. In 1958, Hendrix completed his studies at Washington Junior High School and began attending, but did not graduate from, Garfield High School.

In mid-1958, at age 15, Hendrix acquired his first acoustic guitar, for $5 (). He played for hours daily, watching others and learning from more experienced guitarists, and listening to blues artists such as Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Robert Johnson. The first tune Hendrix learned to play was the television theme &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;. Around that time, Hendrix jammed with boyhood friend Sammy Drain and his keyboard-playing brother. In 1959, attending a concert by Hank Ballard &amp; The Midnighters in Seattle, Hendrix met the group&#x27;s guitarist Billy Davis. Davis showed him some guitar licks and got him a short gig with the Midnighters. The two remained friends until Hendrix&#x27;s death in 1970.

Soon after he acquired the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, he could barely be heard over the sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix&#x27;s first gig was with an unnamed band in the Jaffe Room of Seattle&#x27;s Temple De Hirsch, but they fired him between sets for showing off. He joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When his guitar was stolen after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.

== Military service ==
Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. Given a choice between prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then when you go to jump school ... you get hell. They work you to death, fussing and fighting.&quot; In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar in Seattle at the home of his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: &quot;I really need it now.&quot; His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words &quot;Betty Jean&quot; to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return. In November 1961, fellow serviceman Billy Cox walked past an army club and heard Hendrix playing. Impressed by Hendrix&#x27;s technique, which Cox described as a combination of &quot;John Lee Hooker and Beethoven&quot;, Cox borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within weeks, they began performing at base clubs on the weekends with other musicians in a loosely organized band, the Casuals.

Hendrix completed his paratrooper training and, on January 11, 1962, Major General Charles W. G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch. By February, his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrix&#x27;s platoon sergeant, James C. Spears, filed a report in which he stated: &quot;He has no interest whatsoever in the Army ... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never come up to the standards required of a soldier. I feel that the military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible.&quot; On June 29, 1962, Hendrix was granted a general discharge under honorable conditions. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump, but no Army records have been produced that indicate that he received or was discharged for any injuries.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
In September 1962, after Cox was discharged from the Army, he and Hendrix moved about across the state line from Fort Campbell to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band, the King Kasuals. In Seattle, Hendrix saw Butch Snipes play with his teeth and now the Kasuals&#x27; second guitarist, Alphonso &quot;Baby Boo&quot; Young, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix also learned to play in this way. He later explained: &quot;The idea of doing that came to me... in Tennessee. Down there you have to play with your teeth or else you get shot. There&#x27;s a trail of broken teeth all over the stage.&quot;

Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville&#x27;s Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city&#x27;s black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and for the next two years Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R&amp;B, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, Ike &amp; Tina Turner and Jackie Wilson.

In January 1964, feeling he had outgrown the circuit artistically, and frustrated by having to follow the rules of bandleaders, Hendrix decided to venture out on his own. He moved into the Hotel Theresa in Harlem, where he befriended Lithofayne Pridgon, known as &quot;Faye&quot;, who became his girlfriend. A Harlem native with connections throughout the area&#x27;s music scene, Pridgon provided him with shelter, support, and encouragement. Hendrix also met the Allen twins, Arthur and Albert. In February 1964, Hendrix won first prize in the Apollo Theater amateur contest. Hoping to secure a career opportunity, he played the Harlem club circuit and sat in with various bands. At the recommendation of a former associate of Joe Tex, Ronnie Isley granted Hendrix an audition that led to an offer to become the guitarist with the Isley Brothers&#x27; backing band, the I.B. Specials, which he readily accepted.

=== First recordings ===
In March 1964, Hendrix recorded the two-part single &quot;Testify&quot; with the Isley Brothers. Released in June, it failed to chart. In May, he provided guitar instrumentation for the Don Covay song, &quot;Mercy Mercy&quot;. Issued in August by Rosemart Records and distributed by Atlantic, the track reached number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

Hendrix toured with the Isleys during much of 1964, but near the end of October, after growing tired of playing the same set every night, he left the band. Soon afterward, Hendrix joined Little Richard&#x27;s touring band, the Upsetters. During a stop in Los Angeles in February 1965, he recorded his first and only single with Richard, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What You Got (But It&#x27;s Got Me)&quot;, written by Don Covay and released by Vee-Jay Records. Richard&#x27;s popularity was waning at the time, and the single peaked at number 92, where it remained for one week before dropping off the chart. Hendrix met singer Rosa Lee Brooks while staying at the Wilcox Hotel in Hollywood, and she invited him to participate in a recording session for her single, which included the Arthur Lee penned &quot;My Diary&quot; as the A-side, and &quot;Utee&quot; as the B-side. Hendrix played guitar on both tracks, which also included background vocals by Lee. The single failed to chart, but Hendrix and Lee began a friendship that lasted several years; Hendrix later became an ardent supporter of Lee&#x27;s band, Love.

In July 1965, Hendrix made his first television appearance on &quot;Night Train&quot;, a program produced and aired on Nashville TV station WLAC-TV (now WTVF). Performing in Little Richard&#x27;s ensemble band, he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on &quot;Shotgun&quot;. The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix often clashed over tardiness, wardrobe, and Hendrix&#x27;s stage antics, and in late July, Richard&#x27;s brother Robert fired him.

On July 27, Hendrix signed his first recording contract with Juggy Murray at Sue Records and Copa Management. He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers, and recorded a second single with them, &quot;Move Over and Let Me Dance&quot; backed with &quot;Have You Ever Been Disappointed&quot;. Later that year, he joined a New York-based R&amp;B band, Curtis Knight and the Squires, after meeting Knight in the lobby of a hotel where both men were staying. Hendrix performed with them for eight months.

In October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single, &quot;How Would You Feel&quot; backed with &quot;Welcome Home&quot;. Despite his two-year contract with Sue, Hendrix signed a three-year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin on October 15. While the relationship with Chalpin was short-lived, his contract remained in force, which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix. During his time with Knight, Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the Starliters, and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpe&#x27;s two-part single, &quot;Help Me&quot;. Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals, &quot;Hornets Nest&quot; and &quot;Knock Yourself Out&quot;, released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966.

Feeling restricted by his experiences as an R&amp;B sideman, Hendrix moved in 1966 to New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, which had a vibrant and diverse music scene. There, he was offered a residency at the Cafe Wha? on MacDougal Street and formed his own band that June, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, which included future Spirit guitarist Randy California. The Blue Flames played at several clubs in New York and Hendrix began developing his guitar style and material that he would soon use with the Experience. In September, they gave some of their last concerts at the Cafe Au Go Go in Manhattan, as the backing group for a singer and guitarist then billed as John Hammond.

=== The Jimi Hendrix Experience ===
By May 1966, Hendrix was struggling to earn a living wage playing the R&amp;B circuit, so he briefly rejoined Curtis Knight and the Squires for an engagement at one of New York City&#x27;s most popular nightspots, the Cheetah Club. During a performance, Linda Keith, the girlfriend of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, noticed Hendrix and was &quot;mesmerised&quot; by his playing. She invited him to join her for a drink, and the two became friends.

While Hendrix was playing as Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, Keith recommended him to Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham and producer Seymour Stein. They failed to see Hendrix&#x27;s musical potential and rejected him. Keith referred him to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and was interested in managing and producing artists. Chandler saw Hendrix play in Cafe Wha?, a Greenwich Village, New York City nightclub. Chandler liked the Billy Roberts song &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, and was persuaded he could create a hit single with the right artist. Impressed with Hendrix&#x27;s version of the song, he brought him to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. That night, Hendrix gave an impromptu solo performance at The Scotch of St James and began a relationship with Kathy Etchingham that lasted for two and a half years.

Following Hendrix&#x27;s arrival in London, Chandler began recruiting members for a band designed to highlight his talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Hendrix met guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding&#x27;s knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix. Another important criterion for Hendrix was fashion—according to author Keith Shadwick, &quot;what he really liked was Redding&#x27;s hairstyle.&quot; Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrix&#x27;s band; Redding agreed. Chandler began looking for a drummer and soon after contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they found common ground in their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. Chandler also persuaded Hendrix to change the spelling of his first name from &quot;Jimmy&quot; to the more exotic &quot;Jimi&quot;.

On October 1, 1966, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was scheduled to perform, and where Hendrix and guitarist Eric Clapton met. Clapton later said: &quot;He asked if he could play a couple of numbers. I said, &#x27;Of course&#x27;, but I had a funny feeling about him.&quot; Halfway through Cream&#x27;s set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin&#x27; Wolf song &quot;Killing Floor&quot;. In 1989, Clapton described the performance: &quot;He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn&#x27;t in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it ... He walked off, and my life was never the same again&quot;.

==== UK success ====
In mid-October 1966, Chandler arranged an engagement for the Experience as Johnny Hallyday&#x27;s supporting act during a brief tour of France. Thus, the Jimi Hendrix Experience performed their first show on October 13, 1966, at the Novelty in Evreux. Their enthusiastically received 15-minute performance at the Olympia theatre in Paris on October 18 marks the earliest known recording of the band. In late October, Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp, managers of the Who, signed the Experience to their newly formed label, Track Records, and the group recorded their first song, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, on October 23. &quot;Stone Free&quot;, which was Hendrix&#x27;s first songwriting effort after arriving in England, was recorded on November 2.

From November 8 to 11, 1966, the Jimi Hendrix Experience had a short residency at the Big Apple club in Munich, their first gigs in Germany. At this occasion Hendrix had a show experience that would define him from then on: when trying to escape in panic from a frenetic audience that had pulled him off the stage, he smashed his guitar for the first time in a sound explosion on stage, which was perceived by the audience as part of the show. Observing the audience&#x27;s reaction, Chandler decided that this show of violence had to become a permanent feature of the Experience&#x27;s show.

In mid-November, they performed at the Bag O&#x27;Nails nightclub in London, with Clapton, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Kevin Ayers in attendance. Ayers described the crowd&#x27;s reaction as stunned disbelief: &quot;All the stars were there, and I heard serious comments, you know &#x27;shit&#x27;, &#x27;Jesus&#x27;, &#x27;damn&#x27; and other words worse than that.&quot; The performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in &quot;Record Mirror&quot; with the headline: &quot;Mr. Phenomenon&quot;. &quot;Now hear this ... we predict that [Hendrix] is going to whirl around the business like a tornado&quot;, wrote Bill Harry, who asked the rhetorical question: &quot;Is that full, big, swinging sound really being created by only three people?&quot; Hendrix said: &quot;We don&#x27;t want to be classed in any category ... If it must have a tag, I&#x27;d like it to be called, &#x27;Free Feeling&#x27;. It&#x27;s a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues&quot;. Through a distribution deal with Polydor Records, the Experience&#x27;s first single, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, backed with &quot;Stone Free&quot;, was released on December 16, 1966. After appearances on the UK television shows &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Hey Joe&quot; entered the UK charts on December 29 and peaked at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, and in May with &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;, which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks, peaking at number six. On March 12, 1967, he performed at the Troutbeck Hotel, Ilkley, West Yorkshire, where, after about 900 people turned up (the hotel was licensed for 250) the local police stopped the gig due to safety concerns.

On March 31, 1967, while the Experience waited to perform at the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler discussed ways in which they could increase the band&#x27;s media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that they needed to do something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: &quot;Maybe I can smash up an elephant&quot;, to which Altham replied: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s a pity you can&#x27;t set fire to your guitar&quot;. Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire at the end of a 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London&#x27;s press labeled Hendrix the &quot;Black Elvis&quot; and the &quot;Wild Man of Borneo&quot;.

An enduring urban legend in the UK maintains that a possible explanation for the feral parakeets that have appeared in Great Britain since the mid-20th century may derive from a single pair of the birds that were released by Hendrix on Carnaby Street in the 1960s. According to a study, however, which mapped historical news reports of sightings of the birds, the myth is not true.

==== &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; ====
After the UK chart success of their first two singles, &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, the Experience began assembling material for a full-length LP. In London, recording began at De Lane Lea Studios, and later moved to the prestigious Olympic Studios. The album, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, features a diversity of musical styles, including blues tracks such as &quot;Red House&quot; and the R&amp;B song &quot;Remember&quot;. It also included the experimental science fiction piece, &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; and the post-modern soundscapes of the title track, with prominent backwards guitar and drums. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot; served as a medium for Hendrix&#x27;s guitar feedback improvisation and &quot;Fire&quot; was driven by Mitchell&#x27;s drumming.

Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; spent 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two. It was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. On May 29 he performed at the Barbeque 67 concert in Spalding, Lincolnshire, considered by some to have been the first rock festival; tickets cost £1. On June 4, 1967, Hendrix opened a show at the Saville Theatre in London with his rendition of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; title track, which was released just three days previous. Beatles manager Brian Epstein owned the Saville at the time, and both George Harrison and Paul McCartney attended the performance. McCartney described the moment: &quot;The curtains flew back and he came walking forward playing &#x27;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;. It&#x27;s a pretty major compliment in anyone&#x27;s book. I put that down as one of the great honors of my career.&quot; Released in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, described &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; as &quot;the album that shook the world ... leaving it forever changed&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the double-platinum LP Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;epochal debut&quot;, and they ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time, noting his &quot;exploitation of amp howl&quot;, and characterizing his guitar playing as &quot;incendiary ... historic in itself&quot;.

==== Monterey Pop Festival ====

Although popular in Europe at the time, the Experience&#x27;s first US single, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, failed to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. Their fortunes improved when McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the Monterey Pop Festival. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix, whom he called &quot;an absolute ace on the guitar&quot;. McCartney agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in mid-June.

On June 18, 1967, introduced by Brian Jones as &quot;the most exciting performer [he had] ever heard&quot;, Hendrix opened with a fast arrangement of Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s song &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, wearing what Shadwick described as &quot;clothes as exotic as any on display elsewhere&quot;. Shadwick wrote: &quot;[Hendrix] was not only something utterly new musically, but an entirely original vision of what a black American entertainer should and could look like.&quot; The Experience went on to perform renditions of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, B.B. King&#x27;s &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;, Chip Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Wild Thing&quot;, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, and four original compositions: &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, &quot;Can You See Me&quot;, &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;, and &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. The set ended with Hendrix destroying his guitar and tossing pieces of it out to the audience. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Alex Vadukul wrote:

Caraeff stood on a chair next to the edge of the stage and took four monochrome pictures of Hendrix burning his guitar. Caraeff was close enough to the fire that he had to use his camera to protect his face from the heat. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later colorized the image, matching it with other pictures taken at the festival before using the shot for a 1987 magazine cover. According to author Gail Buckland, the final frame of &quot;Hendrix kneeling in front of his burning guitar, hands raised, is one of the most famous images in rock&quot;. Author and historian Matthew C. Whitaker wrote that &quot;Hendrix&#x27;s burning of his guitar became an iconic image in rock history and brought him national attention&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asserted that, upon leaving the stage, Hendrix &quot;graduated from rumor to legend&quot;. Author John McDermott wrote that &quot;Hendrix left the Monterey audience stunned and in disbelief at what they&#x27;d just heard and seen&quot;. According to Hendrix: &quot;I decided to destroy my guitar at the end of a song as a sacrifice. You sacrifice things you love. I love my guitar.&quot; The performance was filmed by D. A. Pennebaker and included in the concert documentary &quot;Monterey Pop&quot;, which helped Hendrix gain popularity with the US public.

After the festival, the Experience was booked for five concerts at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore, with Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. The Experience outperformed Jefferson Airplane during the first two nights and replaced them at the top of the bill on the fifth. Following their successful West Coast introduction, which included a free open-air concert at Golden Gate Park and a concert at the Whisky a Go Go, the Experience was booked as the opening act for the first American tour of the Monkees. The Monkees requested Hendrix as a supporting act because they were fans, but their young audience disliked the Experience, who left the tour after six shows. Chandler later said he engineered the tour to gain publicity for Hendrix.

==== &quot;Axis: Bold as Love&quot; ====

The second Experience album, &quot;&quot;, opens with the track &quot;EXP&quot;, which uses microphonic and harmonic feedback in a new, creative fashion. It also showcased an experimental stereo panning effect in which sounds emanating from Hendrix&#x27;s guitar move through the stereo image, revolving around the listener. The piece reflected his growing interest in science fiction and outer space. He composed the album&#x27;s title track and finale around two verses and two choruses, during which he pairs emotions with personas, comparing them to colors. The song&#x27;s coda features the first recording of stereo phasing. Shadwick described the composition as &quot;possibly the most ambitious piece on &quot;Axis&quot;, the extravagant metaphors of the lyrics suggesting a growing confidence&quot; in Hendrix&#x27;s songwriting. His guitar playing throughout the song is marked by chordal arpeggios and contrapuntal motion, with tremolo-picked partial chords providing the musical foundation for the chorus, which culminates in what musicologist Andy Aledort described as &quot;simply one of the greatest electric guitar solos ever played&quot;. The track fades out on tremolo-picked 32nd note double stops.

The scheduled release date for &quot;Axis&quot; was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, but they could not match the quality of the lost mix of &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot;. Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses, Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals. Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having re-mixed the album so quickly, and he felt that it could have been better had they been given more time.

&quot;Axis&quot; featured psychedelic cover art that depicts Hendrix and the Experience as various avatars of Vishnu, incorporating a painting of them by Roger Law, from a photo-portrait by Karl Ferris. The painting was then superimposed on a copy of a mass-produced religious poster. Hendrix stated that the cover, which Track spent $5,000 producing, would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage. He said: &quot;You got it wrong ... I&#x27;m not that kind of Indian.&quot; Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five, spending 16 weeks on the charts. In February 1968, &quot;Axis: Bold as Love&quot; reached number three in the US.

While author and journalist Richie Unterberger described &quot;Axis&quot; as the least impressive Experience album, according to author Peter Doggett, the release &quot;heralded a new subtlety in Hendrix&#x27;s work&quot;. Mitchell said: &quot;&quot;Axis&quot; was the first time that it became apparent that Jimi was pretty good working behind the mixing board, as well as playing, and had some positive ideas of how he wanted things recorded. It could have been the start of any potential conflict between him and Chas in the studio.&quot;

==== &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; ====
Recording for the Experience&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;, began as early as December 20, 1967, at Olympic Studios. Several songs were attempted; however, in April 1968, the Experience, with Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren, moved the sessions to the newly opened Record Plant Studios in New York. As the sessions progressed, Chandler became increasingly frustrated with Hendrix&#x27;s perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes. Hendrix also allowed numerous friends and guests to join them in the studio, which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Redding later recalled: &quot;There were tons of people in the studio; you couldn&#x27;t move. It was a party, not a session.&quot; Redding, who had formed his own band in mid-1968, Fat Mattress, found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience, so Hendrix played many of the bass parts on &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover stated that it was &quot;produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix&quot;.
During the &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; recording sessions, Hendrix began experimenting with other combinations of musicians, including Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s Jack Casady and Traffic&#x27;s Steve Winwood, who played bass and organ, respectively, on the 15-minute slow-blues jam, &quot;Voodoo Chile&quot;. During the album&#x27;s production, Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King, Al Kooper, and Elvin Bishop. &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; was released on October 25, and by mid-November it had reached number one in the US, spending two weeks at the top spot. The double LP was Hendrix&#x27;s most commercially successful release and his only number one album. It peaked at number six in the UK, spending 12 weeks on the chart. &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; included Hendrix&#x27;s cover of a Bob Dylan song, &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, which became Hendrix&#x27;s highest-selling single and his only US top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; the single reached number five in the UK. &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, his first recorded song to feature a wah-wah pedal, was added to the album. It was originally released as his fourth single in the UK in August 1967 and reached number 18 on the charts.

In 1989, Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of &quot;Guitar World&quot;, described &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; as &quot;Hendrix&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;. According to author Michael Heatley, &quot;most critics agree&quot; that the album is &quot;the fullest realization of Jimi&#x27;s far-reaching ambitions.&quot; In 2004, author Peter Doggett wrote: &quot;For pure experimental genius, melodic flair, conceptual vision and instrumental brilliance, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; remains a prime contender for the status of rock&#x27;s greatest album.&quot; Doggett described the LP as &quot;a display of musical virtuosity never surpassed by any rock musician.&quot;

=== Break-up of the Experience ===
In January 1969, after an absence of more than six months, Hendrix briefly moved back into his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham&#x27;s apartment in Brook Street, London, next door to the home of the composer Handel. After a performance of &quot;Voodoo Child&quot;, on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Happening for Lulu&quot; show in January 1969, the band stopped midway through an attempt at their first hit &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and then launched into an instrumental version of &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, as a tribute to the recently disbanded band Cream, until director and producer Stanley Dorfman was forced to bring the song to a premature end. The Experience bass player Noel Redding describes in his autobiography, &quot;as the minutes ticked by on his live show, short of running onto the set to stop us or pulling the plug, there was nothing he could do. We played past the point where Lulu might have joined us, played through the time for talking at the end, played through Stanley tearing his hair, pointing to his watch and silently screaming at us. We played out the show...Afterwards, Dorfman refused to speak to us, but the result is one of the most widely used bits of film we ever did. Certainly, it’s the most relaxed.&quot; Dorfman recalls at the BBC club after the show, he found Hendrix to be &quot;a very sweet man, very quiet, he didn’t know he’d done anything wrong at all.&quot; However, according to rock and roll legend, Hendrix was banned from working at the BBC again. During this time, the Experience toured Scandinavia, West Germany, and gave their final two performances in France. On February 18 and 24, they played sold-out concerts at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, which were the last European appearances of this lineup.

By February 1969, Redding had grown weary of Hendrix&#x27;s unpredictable work ethic and his creative control over the Experience&#x27;s music. During the previous month&#x27;s European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: &quot;On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing doing ... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, and it was still ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued ... On the last day, I just watched it happen for a while, and then went back to my flat.&quot; The last Experience sessions that included Redding—a re-recording of &quot;Stone Free&quot; for use as a possible single release—took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.
The last performance of the original Experience lineup took place on June 29, 1969, at Barry Fey&#x27;s Denver Pop Festival, a three-day event held at Denver&#x27;s Mile High Stadium that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience. The band narrowly escaped from the venue in the back of a rental truck, which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle. Before the show, a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day, Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career, blaming Hendrix&#x27;s plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later said: &quot;Mitch and I hung out a lot together, but we&#x27;re English. If we&#x27;d go out, Jimi would stay in his room. But any bad feelings came from us being three guys who were traveling too hard, getting too tired, and taking too many drugs ... I liked Hendrix. I don&#x27;t like Mitchell.&quot;

Soon after Redding&#x27;s departure, Hendrix began lodging at the eight-bedroom Ashokan House, in the hamlet of Boiceville near Woodstock in upstate New York, where he had spent some time vacationing in mid-1969. Manager Michael Jeffery arranged the accommodations in the hope that the respite might encourage Hendrix to write material for a new album. During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix&#x27;s first appearance on US TV—on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.

=== Woodstock ===

By 1969, Hendrix was the world&#x27;s highest-paid rock musician. In August, he headlined the Woodstock Music and Art Fair that included many of the most popular bands of the time. For the concert, he added rhythm guitarist Larry Lee and conga players Juma Sultan and Jerry Velez. The band rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and according to Mitchell, they never connected musically. Before arriving at the engagement, Hendrix heard reports that the size of the audience had grown enormously, which concerned him as he did not enjoy performing for large crowds. He was an important draw for the event, and although he accepted substantially less money for the appearance than his usual fee, he was the festival&#x27;s highest-paid performer.

Hendrix decided to move his midnight Sunday slot to Monday morning, closing the show. The band took the stage around 8:00 a.m, by which time Hendrix had been awake for more than three days. The audience, which peaked at an estimated 400,000 people, was reduced to 30,000. The festival MC, Chip Monck, introduced the group as &quot;the Jimi Hendrix Experience&quot;, but Hendrix clarified: &quot;We decided to change the whole thing around and call it &#x27;Gypsy Sun and Rainbows&#x27;. For short, it&#x27;s nothin&#x27; but a &#x27;Band of Gypsys&#x27;.&quot;

Hendrix&#x27;s performance included a rendition of the US national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, with copious feedback, distortion, and sustain to imitate the sounds made by rockets and bombs. Contemporary political pundits described his interpretation as a statement against the Vietnam War. Three weeks later Hendrix said: &quot;We&#x27;re all Americans ... it was like &#x27;Go America!&#x27;... We play it the way the air is in America today. The air is slightly static, see.&quot; Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film, &quot;Woodstock&quot;, Hendrix&#x27;s version became part of the sixties zeitgeist. Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote: &quot;It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock, and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties.&quot; Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket with fringe, a red head-scarf, and blue jeans are regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era. He played &quot;Hey Joe&quot; during the encore, concluding the 3-day festival. Upon leaving the stage, he collapsed from exhaustion. In 2011, the editors of &quot;Guitar World&quot; named his performance of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; the greatest performance of all time.

=== Band of Gypsys ===
A legal dispute arose in 1966 regarding a record contract that Hendrix had entered into the previous year with producer Ed Chalpin. After two years of litigation, the parties agreed to a resolution that granted Chalpin the distribution rights to an album of original Hendrix material. Hendrix decided that they would record the LP, &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot;, during two live appearances. In preparation for the shows he formed an all-black power trio with Cox and drummer Buddy Miles, formerly with Wilson Pickett, the Electric Flag, and the Buddy Miles Express. Critic John Rockwell described Hendrix and Miles as jazz-rock fusionists, and their collaboration as pioneering. Others identified a funk and soul influence in their music. Concert promoter Bill Graham called the shows &quot;the most brilliant, emotional display of virtuoso electric guitar&quot; that he had ever heard. Biographers have speculated that Hendrix formed the band in an effort to appease members of the Black Power movement and others in the black communities who called for him to use his fame to speak up for civil rights.

Hendrix had been recording with Cox since April and jamming with Miles since September, and the trio wrote and rehearsed material which they performed at a series of four shows over two nights on December 31 and January 1, at the Fillmore East. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP, which was produced by Hendrix. The album includes the track &quot;Machine Gun&quot;, which musicologist Andy Aledort described as the pinnacle of Hendrix&#x27;s career, and &quot;the premiere example of [his] unparalleled genius as a rock guitarist ... In this performance, Jimi transcended the medium of rock music, and set an entirely new standard for the potential of electric guitar.&quot; During the song&#x27;s extended instrumental breaks, Hendrix created sounds with his guitar that sonically represented warfare, including rockets, bombs, and diving planes.

The &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot; album was the only official live Hendrix LP made commercially available during his lifetime; several tracks from the Woodstock and Monterey shows were released later that year. The album was released in April 1970 by Capitol Records; it reached the top ten in both the US and the UK. That same month a single was issued with &quot;Stepping Stone&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Izabella&quot; as the B-side, but Hendrix was dissatisfied with the quality of the mastering and he demanded that it be withdrawn and re-mixed, preventing the songs from charting and resulting in Hendrix&#x27;s least successful single; it was also his last.

On January 28, 1970, a third and final Band of Gypsys appearance took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the &quot;Winter Festival for Peace&quot;. American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: &quot;[Hendrix] came in with his head down, sat on the couch alone, and put his head in his hands ... He didn&#x27;t move until it was time for the show.&quot; Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;. He then began playing &quot;Earth Blues&quot; before telling the audience: &quot;That&#x27;s what happens when earth fucks with space&quot;. Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.

=== Cry of Love Tour ===
Soon after the abruptly ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution, Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience lineup. Although Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding were interviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in February 1970 as a united group, Hendrix never intended to work with Redding. When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a re-formed Experience, he was told that he had been replaced with Cox. During an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Keith Altham, Hendrix defended the decision: &quot;It&#x27;s nothing personal against Noel, but we finished what we were doing with the Experience and Billy&#x27;s style of playing suits the new group better.&quot; Although an official name was never adopted for the lineup of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox, promoters often billed them as the Jimi Hendrix Experience or just Jimi Hendrix.

During the first half of 1970, Hendrix sporadically worked on material for what would have been his next LP. Many of the tracks were posthumously released in 1971 as &quot;The Cry of Love&quot;. He had started writing songs for the album in 1968, but in April 1970 he told Keith Altham that the project had been abandoned. Soon afterward, he and his band took a break from recording and began the Cry of Love tour at the L.A. Forum, performing for 20,000 people. Set-lists during the tour included numerous Experience tracks as well as a selection of newer material. Several shows were recorded, and they produced some of Hendrix&#x27;s most memorable live performances. At one of them, the second Atlanta International Pop Festival, on July 4, he played to the largest American audience of his career. According to authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz, as many as 500,000 people attended the concert. On July 17, they appeared at the New York Pop Festival; Hendrix had again consumed too many drugs before the show, and the set was considered a disaster. The American leg of the tour, which included 32 performances, ended in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 1, 1970. This would be Hendrix&#x27;s final concert appearance in the US.

=== Electric Lady Studios ===
In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly invested in the purchase of the Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but when an audit of Hendrix&#x27;s expenses revealed that he had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking recording studios for lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided to convert the building into a studio of his own. Hendrix could then work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix&#x27;s creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.

Hendrix first used Electric Lady on June 15, 1970, when he jammed with Steve Winwood and Chris Wood of Traffic; the next day, he recorded his first track there, &quot;Night Bird Flying&quot;. The studio officially opened for business on August 25, and a grand opening party was held the following day. Immediately afterwards, Hendrix left for England; he never returned to the States. He boarded an Air India flight for London with Cox, joining Mitchell for a performance as the headlining act of the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1970.

=== European tour ===
When the European leg of the Cry of Love tour began, Hendrix was longing for his new studio and creative outlet, and was not eager to fulfill the commitment. On September 2, 1970, he abandoned a performance in Aarhus after three songs, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve been dead a long time&quot;. Four days later, he gave his final concert appearance, at the Isle of Fehmarn Festival in West Germany. He was met with booing and jeering from fans in response to his cancellation of a show slated for the end of the previous night&#x27;s bill due to torrential rain and risk of electrocution. Immediately following the festival, Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox traveled to London.

Three days after the performance, Cox, who was suffering from severe paranoia after either taking LSD or being given it unknowingly, quit the tour and went to stay with his parents in Pennsylvania. Within days of Hendrix&#x27;s arrival in England, he had spoken with Chas Chandler, Alan Douglas, and others about leaving his manager, Michael Jeffery. On September 16, Hendrix performed in public for the last time during an informal jam at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in Soho with Eric Burdon and his latest band, War. They began by playing a few of their recent hits, and after a brief intermission Hendrix joined them during &quot;Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. He died less than 48 hours later.

== Substance abuse and behavioral problems ==
===Alcohol===
In July 1962, Hendrix entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee, drawn in by live music. He stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 () that he had saved during his time in the Army. &quot;I went in this jazz joint and had a drink,&quot; he explained. &quot;I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I came out of that place with sixteen dollars left.&quot; Alcohol eventually became &quot;the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence&quot;.

===LSD and other substances===
Roby and Schreiber assert that Hendrix first used LSD when he met Linda Keith in late 1966. Shapiro and Glebbeek, however, contends that Hendrix used it in June 1967 at the earliest while attending the Monterey Pop Festival. According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross, the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keith&#x27;s New York apartment. One of Keith&#x27;s friends offered Hendrix &quot;acid&quot;, a street name for LSD, but Hendrix asked for LSD instead, showing what Cross describes as &quot;his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics&quot;. Before that, Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs, including cannabis, hashish, amphetamines, and occasionally cocaine. After 1967, he regularly used cannabis, hashish, LSD, and amphetamines, particularly while touring. According to Cross, &quot;few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi&quot;.

=== Violent behavior ===
When Hendrix drank to excess or mixed drugs with alcohol, often he became angry and violent. His friend Herbie Worthington said Hendrix &quot;simply turned into a bastard&quot; when he drank. According to friend Sharon Lawrence, liquor &quot;set off a bottled-up anger, a destructive fury he almost never displayed otherwise&quot;.

In January 1968, the Experience travelled to Sweden to start a one-week tour of Europe. During the early morning hours of the first day, Hendrix got into a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen in Gothenburg, smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment. The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.

In 1969, Hendrix rented a house in Benedict Canyon, California, that was burglarized. Later, while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, he accused his friend Paul Caruso of the theft, threw punches and stones at him, and chased him away from his house. A few days later Hendrix hit his girlfriend, Carmen Borrero, above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage, and gave her a cut that required stitches.

=== Possession charge ===
Hendrix was passing through customs at Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, when authorities found a small amount of heroin and hashish in his luggage, and charged him with drug possession. He was released on $10,000 bail (), and was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months leading up to his December 1969 trial. For the Crown to prove possession, they had to show that Hendrix knew that the drugs were there. During the jury trial, he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication which he put in his bag. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated that they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix&#x27;s bag without his knowledge.

== Death, post-mortem, and burial ==
Details concerning Hendrix&#x27;s last day and death are disputed. He spent much of September 17, 1970, in London with Monika Dannemann, the only witness to his final hours. Dannemann said that she prepared a meal for them at her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel around 11 p.m., when they shared a bottle of wine. She drove him to the residence of an acquaintance at approximately 1:45 a.m., where he remained for about an hour before she picked him up and drove them back to her flat at 3 a.m. She said that they talked until around 7 a.m., when they went to sleep. Dannemann awoke around 11 a.m. and found Hendrix breathing but unconscious and unresponsive. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m., and it arrived nine minutes later. Paramedics transported Hendrix to St Mary Abbots Hospital where doctor John Bannister pronounced him dead at 12:45 p.m. on September 18.

Coroner Gavin Thurston ordered a post-mortem examination which was performed on September 21 by Robert Donald Teare, a forensic pathologist. Thurston completed the inquest on September 28 and concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. Citing &quot;insufficient evidence of the circumstances&quot;, he declared an open verdict. Dannemann later revealed that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage.

Desmond Henley embalmed Hendrix&#x27;s body, which was flown to Seattle on September 29. Hendrix&#x27;s family and friends held a service at Dunlap Baptist Church in Seattle&#x27;s Rainier Valley on Thursday, October 1; his body was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in nearby Renton, the location of his mother&#x27;s grave. Family and friends traveled in 24 limousines, and more than 200 people attended the funeral, including Mitch Mitchell, Noel Redding, Miles Davis, John Hammond, and Johnny Winter.

Hendrix is often cited as one example of an allegedly disproportionate number of musicians dying at age 27, including Brian Jones, Alan Wilson, Jim Morrison, and Janis Joplin in the same era, a phenomenon referred to as the 27 Club.

== Unauthorized and posthumous releases ==
By 1967, as Hendrix was gaining in popularity, many of his pre-Experience recordings were marketed to an unsuspecting public as Jimi Hendrix albums, sometimes with misleading later images of Hendrix. The recordings, which came under the control of producer Ed Chalpin of PPX, with whom Hendrix had signed a recording contract in 1965, were often re-mixed between their repeated reissues, and licensed to record companies such as Decca and Capitol. Hendrix publicly denounced the releases, describing them as &quot;malicious&quot; and &quot;greatly inferior&quot;, stating: &quot;At PPX, we spent on average about one hour recording a song. Today I spend at least twelve hours on each song.&quot; These unauthorized releases have long constituted a substantial part of his recording catalogue, amounting to hundreds of albums.

Some of Hendrix&#x27;s unfinished fourth studio album was released as the 1971 title &quot;The Cry of Love&quot;. Although the album reached number three in the US and number two in the UK, producers Mitchell and Kramer later complained that they were unable to make use of all the available songs because some tracks were used for 1971&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot;; still others were issued on 1972&#x27;s &quot;War Heroes&quot;. Material from &quot;The Cry of Love&quot; was re-released in 1997 as &quot;First Rays of the New Rising Sun&quot;, along with the other tracks that Mitchell and Kramer had wanted to include. Four years after Hendrix&#x27;s death, producer Alan Douglas acquired the rights to produce unreleased music by Hendrix; he attracted criticism for using studio musicians to replace or add tracks.

In 1993, MCA Records delayed a multimillion-dollar sale of Hendrix&#x27;s publishing copyrights because Al Hendrix was unhappy about the arrangement. He acknowledged that he had sold distribution rights to a foreign corporation in 1974, but stated that it did not include copyrights and argued that he had retained veto power of the sale of the catalogue. Under a settlement reached in July 1995, Al Hendrix regained control of his son&#x27;s song and image rights. He subsequently licensed the recordings to MCA through the family-run company Experience Hendrix LLC, formed in 1995. In August 2009, Experience Hendrix announced that it had entered a new licensing agreement with Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s Legacy Recordings division, to take effect in 2010. Legacy and Experience Hendrix launched the 2010 Jimi Hendrix Catalog Project starting with the release of &quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot; in March of that year. In the months before his death, Hendrix recorded demos for a concept album tentatively titled &quot;Black Gold&quot;, now in the possession of Experience Hendrix LLC, but it has not been released.

== Equipment ==

=== Guitars ===
Hendrix played a variety of guitars but was most prominently associated with the Fender Stratocaster. He acquired his first in 1966, when a girlfriend loaned him enough money to purchase a used Stratocaster built around 1964. He used it often during performances and recordings. In 1967, he described the Stratocaster as &quot;the best all-around guitar for the stuff we&#x27;re doing&quot;; he praised its &quot;bright treble and deep bass&quot;.

Hendrix mainly played right-handed guitars that were turned upside down and restrung for left-hand playing. Because of the slant of the Stratocaster&#x27;s bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound, while his highest string had a darker sound, the opposite of the intended design. Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.

=== Amplifiers ===
During 1965 and 1966, while Hendrix was playing back-up for soul and R&amp;B acts in the US, he used an 85-watt Fender Twin Reverb amplifier. When Chandler brought Hendrix to England in October 1966, he supplied him with 30-watt Burns amps, which Hendrix thought were too small for his needs. After an early London gig when he was unable to use his Fender Twin, he asked about the Marshall amps he had noticed other groups using. Years earlier, Mitch Mitchell had taken drum lessons from Marshall founder Jim Marshall, and he introduced Hendrix to Marshall. At their initial meeting, Hendrix bought four speaker cabinets and three 100-watt Super Lead amplifiers; he grew accustomed to using all three in unison. The equipment arrived on October 11, 1966, and the Experience used it during their first tour.

Marshall amps were important to the development of Hendrix&#x27;s overdriven sound and his use of feedback, creating what author Paul Trynka described as a &quot;definitive vocabulary for rock guitar&quot;. Hendrix usually turned all the control knobs to the maximum level, which became known as the Hendrix setting. During the four years prior to his death, he purchased between 50 and 100 Marshall amplifiers. Jim Marshall said Hendrix was &quot;the greatest ambassador&quot; his company ever had.

=== Effects ===
One of Hendrix&#x27;s signature effects was the wah-wah pedal, which he first heard used with an electric guitar in Cream&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot;, released in May 1967. That July, while performing at the Scene club in New York City, Hendrix met Frank Zappa, whose band the Mothers of Invention were performing at the adjacent Garrick Theater. Hendrix was fascinated by Zappa&#x27;s application of the pedal, and he experimented with one later that evening. He used a wah pedal during the opening to &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot;, creating one of the best-known wah-wah riffs of the classic rock era. He also uses the effect on &quot;Up from the Skies&quot;, &quot;Little Miss Lover&quot;, and &quot;Still Raining, Still Dreaming&quot;.

Hendrix used a Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face and a Vox wah pedal during recording sessions and performances, but also experimented with other guitar effects. He enjoyed a fruitful long-term collaboration with electronics enthusiast Roger Mayer, whom he once called &quot;the secret&quot; of his sound. Mayer introduced him to the Octavia, an octave-doubling effect pedal, in December 1966, and he first recorded with it during the guitar solo to &quot;Purple Haze&quot;.

Hendrix also used the Uni-Vibe, designed to simulate the modulation effects of a rotating Leslie speaker. He uses the effect during his performance at Woodstock and on the Band of Gypsys track &quot;Machine Gun&quot;, which prominently features the Uni-vibe along with an Octavia and a Fuzz Face. For performances, he plugged his guitar into the wah-wah, which was connected to the Fuzz Face, then the Uni-Vibe, and finally a Marshall amplifier.
== Influences ==
As an adolescent in the 1950s, Hendrix became interested in rock and roll artists such as Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. In 1968, he told &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine that electric blues artists Muddy Waters, Elmore James, and B. B. King inspired him during the beginning of his career; he also cited Eddie Cochran as an early influence. Of Muddy Waters, the first electric guitarist of which Hendrix became aware, he said: &quot;I heard one of his records when I was a little boy and &quot;it scared me to death&quot; because I heard all of these &quot;sounds&quot;.&quot; In 1970, he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he was a fan of western swing artist Bob Wills and while he lived in Nashville, the television show the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;.

Cox stated that during their time serving in the US military, he and Hendrix primarily listened to southern blues artists such as Jimmy Reed and Albert King. According to Cox, &quot;King was a very, very powerful influence&quot;. Howlin&#x27; Wolf also inspired Hendrix, who performed Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Killing Floor&quot; as the opening song of his US debut at the Monterey Pop Festival. The influence of soul artist Curtis Mayfield can be heard in Hendrix&#x27;s guitar playing, and the influence of Bob Dylan can be heard in Hendrix&#x27;s songwriting; he was known to play Dylan&#x27;s records repeatedly, particularly &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.
== Legacy ==
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography for the Experience states: &quot;Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music. Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah-wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll.&quot; Musicologist Andy Aledort described Hendrix as &quot;one of the most creative&quot; and &quot;influential musicians that has ever lived&quot;. Music journalist Chuck Philips wrote: &quot;In a field almost exclusively populated by white musicians, Hendrix has served as a role model for a cadre of young black rockers. His achievement was to reclaim title to a musical form pioneered by black innovators like Little Richard and Chuck Berry in the 1950s.&quot;

Hendrix favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain. He was instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of guitar amplifier feedback and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock. He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low 6th string root notes with his thumb. He applied this technique during the beginning bars of &quot;Little Wing&quot;, which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist&#x27;s left hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right hand. Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist was performing. He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock music recordings. Holly George-Warren of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.&quot;

While creating his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues, R&amp;B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll, and jazz. Musicologist David Moskowitz emphasized the importance of blues music in Hendrix&#x27;s playing style, and according to authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber, &quot;[He] explored the outer reaches of psychedelic rock&quot;. His influence is evident in a variety of popular music formats, and he has contributed significantly to the development of hard rock, heavy metal, funk, post-punk, grunge, and hip hop music. His lasting influence on modern guitar players is difficult to overstate; his techniques and delivery have been abundantly imitated by others. Despite his hectic touring schedule and notorious perfectionism, he was a prolific recording artist who left behind numerous unreleased recordings. More than 40 years after his death, Hendrix remains as popular as ever, with annual album sales exceeding that of any year during his lifetime.

As with his contemporary Sly Stone, Hendrix embraced the experimentalism of white musicians in progressive rock in the late 1960s and inspired a wave of progressive soul musicians that emerged by the next decade. He has directly influenced numerous funk and funk rock artists, including Prince, George Clinton, John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic, and Ernie Isley of the Isley Brothers. Hendrix influenced post-punk guitarists such as John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees and Robert Smith of The Cure. Grunge guitarists such as Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, and Mike McCready and Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam have cited Hendrix as an influence. Hendrix&#x27;s influence also extends to many hip hop artists, including De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Digital Underground, Beastie Boys, and Run–D.M.C. Miles Davis was deeply impressed by Hendrix, and he compared Hendrix&#x27;s improvisational abilities with those of saxophonist John Coltrane. Desert blues artists from the Sahara desert region including Mdou Moctar and Tinariwen have also acknowledged Hendrix&#x27;s influence.

Rock and roll fans still debate whether Hendrix actually said that Chicago co-founder Terry Kath was a better guitar player than he was, but Kath named Hendrix as a major influence: &quot;But then there was Hendrix, man. Jimi was really the last cat to freak me. Jimi was playing all the stuff I had in my head. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, when I first heard him. Man, no one can ever do what he did with a guitar. No one can ever take his place.&quot;

Hendrix also influenced Black Sabbath, industrial artist Marilyn Manson, blues musician Stevie Ray Vaughan, 
Randy Hansen, 
Uli Jon Roth, Kiss&#x27;s Ace Frehley, Metallica Kirk Hammett, Aerosmith&#x27;s Brad Whitford, Judas Priest&#x27;s Richie Faulkner, instrumental rock guitarist Joe Satriani, King&#x27;s X singer/bassist Doug Pinnick, Adrian Belew, and heavy metal guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, who said: &quot;[Hendrix] created modern electric playing, without question ... He was the first. He started it all. The rest is history.&quot; &quot;For many&quot;, Hendrix was &quot;the preeminent black rocker&quot;, according to Jon Caramanica. Members of the Soulquarians, an experimental black music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s, were influenced by the creative freedom in Hendrix&#x27;s music and extensively used Electric Lady Studios to work on their own music.

=== Recognition and awards ===
Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, &quot;Billboard&quot; named him the Artist of the Year and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared him the Performer of the Year. &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, &quot;Guitar Player&quot; named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has ranked the band&#x27;s three studio albums, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; (1967), &quot;&quot; (1967), and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; (1968), in its various lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and it ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.

Hendrix received several prestigious rock music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; voted him the Pop Musician of the Year. In 1968, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared him the Performer of the Year. Also in 1968, the City of Seattle gave him the keys to the city. &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; newspaper honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970 &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked his three non-posthumous studio albums, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; (1967), &quot;Axis: Bold as Love&quot; (1967), and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; (1968) among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They ranked Hendrix number one on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, and number six on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s readers voted six of Hendrix&#x27;s solos among the top 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of All Time: &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (70), &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; (52; from &quot;Live at Woodstock&quot;), &quot;Machine Gun&quot; (32; from &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot;), &quot;Little Wing&quot; (18), &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; (11), and &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; (5). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed seven of his recordings in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (17), &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; (47) &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; (102), &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; (153), &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (201), &quot;Little Wing&quot; (366), and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; (379). They also included three of Hendrix&#x27;s songs in their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;: &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (2), &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; (12), and &quot;Machine Gun&quot; (49).

A star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was dedicated to Hendrix on November 14, 1991, at 6627 Hollywood Boulevard. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 1998, Hendrix was inducted into the Native American Music Hall of Fame during its first year. In 1999, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked Hendrix among the most important musicians of the 20th century. In 2005, his debut album, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, was one of 50 recordings added that year to the US National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress, &quot;[to] be preserved for all time ... [as] part of the nation&#x27;s audio legacy&quot;. In Seattle, November 27, 1992, which would have been Hendrix&#x27;s 50th birthday, was made Jimi Hendrix Day, largely due to the efforts of his boyhood friend, guitarist Sammy Drain.

The blue plaque identifying Hendrix&#x27;s former residence at 23 Brook Street, London, was the first issued by English Heritage to commemorate a pop star. Next door is the former residence of George Frideric Handel, 25 Brook Street, which opened to the public as the Handel House Museum in 2001. From 2016 the museum made use of the upper floors of 23 for displays about Hendrix and was rebranded as Handel &amp; Hendrix in London.

&quot;The Electric Lady Studio Guitar&quot;, a sculpture depicting Hendrix playing a Stratocaster, stands near the corner of Broadway and Pine Streets in Seattle. In May 2006, the city renamed a park near its Central District Jimi Hendrix Park, in his honor. In 2012, an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 Second Atlanta International Pop Festival near Byron, Georgia. The marker text reads, in part: &quot;Over thirty musical acts performed, including rock icon Jimi Hendrix playing to the largest American audience of his career.&quot;

Hendrix&#x27;s music has received a number of Hall of Fame Grammy awards, starting with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992, followed by two Grammys in 1999 for his albums &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; and &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;; &quot;Axis: Bold as Love&quot; received a Grammy in 2006. In 2000, he received a Hall of Fame Grammy award for his original composition, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, and in 2001, for his recording of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. Hendrix&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; was honored with a Grammy in 2009.

The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp honoring Hendrix in 2014. On August 21, 2016, Hendrix was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Michigan. The James Marshall &quot;Jimi&quot; Hendrix United States Post Office in Renton Highlands near Seattle, about a mile from Hendrix&#x27;s grave and memorial, was renamed for Hendrix in 2019.

On June 23, 2019, the Band of Gypsys were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit, Michigan. Billy Cox, the last surviving member of the group, was on hand to accept, along with representatives of the Buddy Miles and Hendrix estates.

A plaster lifecast of Hendrix&#x27;s penis, created in 1968 by Cynthia Plaster Caster, was put on permanent display in the Icelandic Phallological Museum in 2022.

<doc id="16097" wikidata="Q76966" url="?curid=16097" title="Johann Elert Bode">
<text>Johann Elert Bode (; 19 January 1747 – 23 November 1826) was a German astronomer known for his reformulation and popularisation of the Titius–Bode law. Bode determined the orbit of Uranus and suggested the planet&#x27;s name.

==Life and career==
Bode was born in Hamburg. As a youth, he suffered from a serious eye disease that particularly damaged his right eye; he continued to have trouble with his eyes throughout his life.

His early promise in mathematics brought him to the attention of Johann Georg Büsch, who allowed Bode to use his own library for study.
He began his career with the publication of a short work on the solar eclipse of 5 August 1766. This was followed by an elementary treatise on astronomy entitled &quot;Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels&quot; (1768, 10th ed. 1844), the success of which led to his being invited to Berlin by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772 for the purpose of computing ephemerides on an improved plan. There he founded, in 1774, the well-known &quot;Astronomisches Jahrbuch&quot;, 51 yearly volumes of which he compiled and issued.

He became director of the Berlin Observatory in 1786, from which he retired in 1825.
There he published the &quot;Uranographia&quot; in 1801, a celestial atlas that aimed both at scientific accuracy in showing the positions of stars and other astronomical objects, as well as the artistic interpretation of the stellar constellation figures. The &quot;Uranographia&quot; marks the climax of an epoch of artistic representation of the constellations. Later atlases showed fewer and fewer elaborate figures until they were no longer printed on such tables.

Bode also published another small star atlas, intended for astronomical amateurs (&quot;Vorstellung der Gestirne&quot;). He is credited with the discovery of Bode&#x27;s Galaxy (M81). Comet Bode (C/1779 A1) is named after him; its orbit was calculated by Erik Prosperin. Asteroid 998 Bodea, discovered on 6 August 1923 by Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg, was also christened in his honour, the letter &#x27;a&#x27; added to its name to fulfil the convention that asteroids were given feminine names.

His name became attached to the &#x27;law&#x27; discovered by Johann Daniel Titius in 1766. Bode first makes mention of it in the &quot;Anleitung zur Kenntniss des gestirnten Himmels&quot; in a footnote, and although it is often officially called the Titius–Bode law, it is also commonly just called Bode&#x27;s law. This law attempts to explain the distances of the planets from the Sun in a formula although ironically it breaks down for the planet Neptune which was later discovered in Berlin. It was the discovery of Uranus at a position predicted by the law which aroused great interest in it. There was a gap (with no planet) between Mars and Jupiter, and Bode urged a search for a planet in this region which culminated in a group formed for this purpose, the so-called &quot;celestial police&quot;. However before the group initiated a search, they were trumped by the discovery of the asteroid Ceres by Giuseppe Piazzi from Palermo in 1801, at Bode&#x27;s predicted position.

Latterly, the law fell out of favour when it was realised that Ceres was only one of a small number of asteroids and when Neptune was found not to be in a position required by the law. The discovery of planets around other stars has brought the law back into discussion.

Bode himself was directly involved in research leading from the discovery of a planet – that of Uranus in 1781. Although Uranus was the first planet to be discovered by telescope, it is just about visible with the naked eye. Bode consulted older star charts and found numerous examples of the planet&#x27;s position being given while being mistaken for a star, for example, John Flamsteed, Astronomer Royal in Britain, had listed it in his catalogue of 1690 as a star with the name &quot;34 Tauri&quot;. These earlier sightings allowed an exact calculation of the orbit of the new planet.

Bode was also responsible for giving the new planet its name. The discoverer William Herschel proposed to name it after George III which was not accepted so readily in other countries. Bode opted for Uranus, with the apparent logic that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn.
 There were further alternatives proposed, but ultimately Bode&#x27;s suggestion became the most widely used – however it had to wait until 1850 before gaining official acceptance in Britain when the Nautical Almanac Office switched from using the name &quot;Georgium Sidus&quot; to &quot;Uranus&quot;.
In 1789, Bode&#x27;s Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth was inspired by Bode&#x27;s name for the planet to name his newly discovered element &quot;uranium&quot;.[37]

From 1787 to 1825 Bode was director of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. In 1794, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In April 1789 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

Bode died in Berlin on 23 November 1826, aged 79.

<doc id="16099" wikidata="Q236421" url="?curid=16099" title="Janet Reno">
<text>Janet Wood Reno (July 21, 1938 – November 7, 2016) was an American lawyer and public official who served as the first female and 78th United States attorney general. Reno, a member of the Democratic Party, held the position from 1993 to 2001, making her the second-longest serving attorney general, behind only William Wirt.

Reno was born and raised in Miami, Florida. After leaving to attend Cornell University and Harvard Law School, she returned to Miami where she started her career at private law firms. Her first foray into government was as a staff member for the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives. She then worked for the Dade County State Attorney&#x27;s Office before returning to private practice. She was elected to the Office of State Attorney five times and was the first woman to serve as a state attorney in Florida. President Bill Clinton appointed her attorney general in 1993, a position she held until Clinton left office in 2001.

==Early life and education ==
Reno was born in Miami, Florida. Reno&#x27;s mother, Jane Wallace (née Wood), wrote a weekly home improvement column for &quot;The Miami News&quot; under a male pseudonym and later became an investigative reporter for the paper. Janet&#x27;s father, Henry Olaf Reno (né Rasmussen), was an emigrant from Denmark and a reporter for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; for 43 years. Janet Reno had three younger siblings: Mark; writer Robert Reno; and Maggy Hurchalla. In 1943, the Reno family moved to a house in then-rural South Miami; it came with enough land to keep farm animals, including cows, chicken, ducks, goats, and turkeys. Reno helped her parents churn butter, which the family sold to make ends meet.

As the family expanded, they outgrew the house and couldn&#x27;t afford a larger one. Jane Reno decided to build a new home herself near the Everglades, learning masonry, electrical work, and plumbing for the task. The Reno family moved to the house Jane built when Janet was 8 years old. The house would be Reno&#x27;s lifelong home and a source of inspiration; she later said, &quot;the house is a symbol to me that you can do anything you really want if it&#x27;s the right thing to do and you put your mind to it.&quot; The Renos&#x27; lot for the house originally was 21 acres, some of which they later sold to pay for the children&#x27;s education.

Reno attended public school in Miami-Dade County, Florida. After she completed middle school in 1951, Reno&#x27;s parents sent her to stay with her uncle who served as a U.S. military judge in Regensburg, Germany. There, Janet continued her education and traveled around Europe during breaks from school. After a year, Reno returned to Florida where she was a debating champion and salutatorian at Coral Gables Senior High School. In 1956 she enrolled at Cornell University, where she majored in chemistry, became president of the Women&#x27;s Self-Government Association, and earned her room and board. After graduating from Cornell, Reno enrolled at Harvard Law School, one of 16 women in a class of 500 students. She graduated from Harvard in 1963.

== Early career ==
From 1963 to 1971, Reno worked as an attorney for two Miami law firms. In 1971, she joined the staff of the Judiciary Committee of the Florida House of Representatives. The following year, Reno unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Florida&#x27;s state house. In 1973, she worked on a project to revise the state&#x27;s system of rules and regulations for criminal procedures. Later in the same year, she accepted a position with the Dade County State Attorney&#x27;s Office led by Richard Gerstein. Shortly after joining the office, Gerstein made Reno his chief assistant. Reno did not try any cases during her time working for Gerstein. She worked for the Judiciary Circuit, and left the state attorney&#x27;s office in 1976 to become a partner in a private law firm, Steel, Hector &amp; Davis. Gerstein decided to retire in 1977, creating a vacancy with Florida governor Reubin Askew to appoint a successor. Reno was one of two candidates Gerstein recommended to replace him.

===State Attorney===

In January 1978, Governor Askew appointed Reno the State Attorney for Dade County (now called Miami-Dade County). She was the first woman to serve as a state attorney in Florida. She was elected to the Office of State Attorney in November 1978 and was returned to office by the voters four more times. Reno ran as a liberal, pro-choice Democrat even though Miami-Dade was a conservative county. Reno did not always face serious challengers, although in 1984 Cuban-American lawyer Jose Garcia-Pedrosa ran against Reno, and picked up the endorsement of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; editorial board. In spite of his support among Miami&#x27;s Hispanic voters, Reno won the election decisively.

The office she led included 95 attorneys and an annual caseload that included 15,000 felonies and 40,000 misdemeanors. As state attorney, she developed a reputation for ethical behavior, going so far as to purchase a car at sticker price to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

==== Drug court ====

She established a drug court which was later replicated in other parts of the country. She worked actively in various civic organizations, including the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug Free Community and the Beacon Council, which was formed to address Miami-Dade&#x27;s economic development.

==== McDuffie trial ====
In May 1980, Reno prosecuted five white policemen who were accused of beating a black insurance salesman, Arthur McDuffie, to death. The policemen were all acquitted. During the resulting 1980 Miami riots, eighteen people were killed, with looters in Liberty City angrily chanting &quot;Reno! Reno! Reno!&quot; Reno met with nearly all of her critics, and a few months later, she won reelection in a landslide.

==== Child abuse prosecutions ====

During Reno&#x27;s tenure as state attorney, she began what the PBS series &quot;Frontline&quot; described as a &quot;crusade&quot; against accused child abusers. Reno pioneered the &quot;Miami Method&quot;, &quot;a controversial technique for eliciting intimate details from young children and inspired passage of a law allowing them to testify by closed-circuit television, out of the possibly intimidating presence of their suspected molesters.&quot; Bobby Fijnje, &quot;a 14-year-old boy, was acquitted after his attorneys discredited the children&#x27;s persistent interrogations by a psychologist who called herself the &#x27;yucky secrets doctor&#x27;.&quot; Grant Snowden was acquitted, retried, convicted, and eventually freed by a federal appeals court after 12 years in prison.&quot;

Reno&#x27;s &quot;model case&quot; was against Frank Fuster, co-owner of the Country Walk Babysitting Service in a suburb of Miami, Florida. In 1984, he was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse and sentenced to prison with a minimum of 165 years. Fuster was convicted based in large part on the testimony of his 18-year-old wife, Ileana Flores, who pleaded guilty and testified against him, after allegedly being tortured. In a 2002 episode of &quot;Frontline&quot;, Flores maintained that she and her ex-husband were innocent, and that Reno personally pressured her to confess. The number and timing of Reno&#x27;s visits are in dispute. Fuster remains imprisoned.

In 1989, as Florida state attorney, Reno pressed adult charges against 13-year-old Bobby Fijnje, who was accused of sexually molesting 21 children in his care during church services. The charges were driven by the testimony of children interviewed by mental-health professionals using techniques later discredited. Fijnje refused plea-bargain offers. During the trial, the prosecution was unable to present any witnesses to the alleged abuse. After two years of investigation and trial, Fijnje was acquitted of all charges.

When Reno was nominated for attorney general in the Clinton administration, &quot;the Nation&quot; and &quot;Miami New Times&quot; raised questions about her handling of these cases, Debbie Nathan&#x27;s journal article was faxed to the White House, and Fijnje&#x27;s father (a Dutch diplomat) &quot;sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee&quot;. However, Reno was not directly questioned about them. When she was asked in 2002, Reno said that she lacked the time to review the Country Walk case files.

==== Death penalty ====
Although Reno personally opposed the death penalty, her office secured 80 capital punishment convictions during her tenure. None of these were executed during her tenure, but five were later executed.

==U.S. Attorney General==


President-elect Bill Clinton had vowed to assemble an administration that &quot;looked like America&quot;, and it was widely assumed that one of the major cabinet posts would go to a woman. On February 11, 1993, Clinton introduced Reno as his nominee for United States Attorney General, stating that he wanted to hire a woman for the job but had also considered multiple male candidates. Both of his previous choices, Zoë Baird and Kimba Wood, faced problems because both had employed undocumented immigrants as nannies. Clinton said he had discounted Reno early in his search because she did not have experience in the Justice Department or federal law, but ultimately he came to understand that she had experience with a variety of criminal law issues from her role as State Attorney. On March 11, 1993, the Senate confirmed Reno by a vote of 98 to 0. She was sworn in the next day, becoming the first woman to serve as U.S. Attorney General. As Attorney General, Reno oversaw the Justice Department and its 95,000 employees. Reno remained Attorney General for the rest of Clinton&#x27;s presidency, making her the longest-serving Attorney General since William Wirt in 1829.

In 1994, Reno tasked the Justice Department with compiling a report on DNA exoneration. The science was still new at that point in time. Reno commissioned the report after reading about the exoneration of a death row inmate. She wanted to know how many cases existed like the one she read about and what the Department of Justice could learn from it. The resulting report concluded there was a strong possibility that many more wrongful convictions that could be cleared with DNA evidence existed. Reno changed policies on how to interview eyewitnesses and laboratory protocols in response.

The following Department of Justice actions occurred during Reno&#x27;s tenure:
* The 51-day Waco siege standoff and resulting 76 deaths—the Branch Davidians—in Waco, Texas. (The standoff began on February 28, 1993, twelve days before Reno was installed as attorney general). Reno stated in congressional testimony that she authorized the FBI assault on the Branch Davidians because of reports that militia groups were en route to Waco during the standoff &quot;either to help [Branch Davidian leader David] Koresh or to attack him.&quot; The FBI had also, erroneously, reported to Reno that children were being abused at the compound. Reno publicly expressed her regret of the decision to storm the compound, and accepted full responsibility for the loss of life.
* The antitrust division brought suit against the software company Microsoft for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Justice Department alleged that Microsoft was bundling its browser with its operating system to decrease competition for other browser makers. Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer responded to the suit saying &quot;To Heck with Janet Reno&quot;, a comment for which he later expressed regret. The case was ultimately settled in 2001, after Reno&#x27;s departure.
* Declining to question anyone in the Wenatchee child abuse prosecutions, with Reno concluding there was no &quot;evidence of prosecutable violations of federal civil rights law&quot;.
* Prosecution resulting in the conviction of 21 of the Montana Freemen, a group that did not believe there should be government above the county level, after an 81-day armed standoff which ended without loss of life. In March 1996, Montana Freemen began a 61-day standoff with the FBI after the FBI arrested three members of the group for refusing to leave property from which they had been evicted. Following the tragedy at Waco, the FBI was determined to avoid violence, and Reno assured the public that the FBI was looking for a peaceful solution to the standoff. 
* Capture and conviction of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber.
* Capture and conviction of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the Oklahoma City bombing.
* Capture and conviction of those who conducted the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, resulting in life-sentences of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and four conspirators.
* Leak to the news media regarding Richard Jewell that led to the widespread and incorrect presumption of his guilt in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing. She later apologized, saying &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry it happened. I think we owe him an apology. I regret the leak.&quot;
* The government&#x27;s unsuccessful defense of the Communications Decency Act, which culminated in the Supreme Court decision &quot;Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union&quot;.
* Identification of the correct suspect (Eric Rudolph) in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and other bombings, who remained a fugitive throughout her tenure. Rudolph was apprehended in 2003 and pleaded guilty to the attacks.
* Capture and conviction of Mir Qazi for the 1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters.
* The armed seizure of six-year-old Elián González and his return to his father, who eventually took him home to Cuba; Elián&#x27;s mother and stepfather had died in a dangerous trip by sea, and though his U.S. relatives had lost custody to his father in court, local officials did not enforce the ruling. Reno made the decision to remove Elián González from the house of a relative and return him to his father in Cuba.

=== Clinton administration investigations ===
In 1994, Reno appointed Robert Fiske special counsel to investigate Bill Clinton&#x27;s involvement in Whitewater, a controversy stemming from Clinton&#x27;s business dealings during his time as Governor of Arkansas. Fiske wrapped up his criminal investigation within six months, and found no link between Whitewater and the suicide of former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Congress reauthorized the investigation and in August 1994, a panel of judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals overseeing the special counsel refused to reappoint Fiske. The panel considered it a conflict of interest for Fiske to investigate Clinton because Reno, a member of the Clinton Administration, appointed Fiske. Instead, the panel appointed former member of the Reagan and Bush Administrations Ken Starr to continue the Whitewater investigation. Starr concluded the Whitewater investigation in December 1997 due to insufficient evidence. The following month, Starr received permission from Reno to redirect his probe into conduct related to the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky affairs. Starr&#x27;s Report, issued in September 1998, listed eleven grounds for impeachment against Clinton.

In 1998, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, in a party line vote, voted to recommend the House cite Reno for contempt of Congress for not turning over two internal Justice Department memos related to a campaign finance controversy during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Reno contended she refused to turn over the documents sought because the documents would reveal prosecutor strategy in an ongoing investigation. Reno argued that her actions were in defense of the principle that prosecutors should be free of political influence. The full House of Representatives never voted on the resolution and the documents were turned over to the House.

==Later career==
Reno ran for Governor of Florida in 2002, but lost in the Democratic primary to Bill McBride 44% to 44.4%. Voting problems arose in the election, and she did not concede defeat until a week later.

After her tenure as United States Attorney General and her unsuccessful gubernatorial bid, Reno toured the country giving speeches on topics relating to the criminal justice system. On March 31, 2006, she spoke at a criminology conference at the University of Pennsylvania. She stated that she believed the education system in the United States needs to be improved, as there is a link between the quality of education and the crime rate. She also believed that too much money has been diverted away from the juvenile court system and that the government should find some way to make the juvenile courts work effectively, so as to prevent problems in troubled children and adolescents before these problems are exacerbated by the time they reach adulthood.

Reno was a founding member of the board of directors for the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization which assists prisoners who may be exonerated through DNA testing, in 2004. By 2013 she was director emeritus of the board of directors.

==Personal life==
Reno never married and did not have children. She took Spanish lessons during her time as state attorney. She remained active after her diagnosis of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1995; she learned inline skating in 1996. After her mother&#x27;s death in 1992, Reno inherited her childhood home. In response to a 1998 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch, which portrayed her as lonely, former Justice Department public affairs director Carl Stern said, &quot;Both in Florida and in Washington she has a great many friends whose homes she visits, and she goes to plays, her dance card is full.&quot;

==Death==
Reno died from Parkinson&#x27;s disease on November 7, 2016. She was surrounded by friends and family at the end of her life, including her sister Maggy and her goddaughter. Upon her death, President Barack Obama praised Reno for her &quot;intellect, integrity, and fierce commitment to justice&quot; and President Clinton released a statement thanking Reno &quot;for her service, counsel, and friendship&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
&quot;Glamour&quot; magazine named Reno one of its &quot;Women of the Year&quot; for 1993. In 2000, Reno was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In March 2008, Reno received the Council on Litigation Management&#x27;s Professionalism Award, which recognizes and commemorates an individual who has demonstrated the unique ability to lead others by example in the highest standard of their profession.

On April 17, 2009, Reno was awarded the Justice Award by the American Judicature Society. Eric Holder, Attorney General in the Obama Administration, presented the award to Reno. Seth Andersen, Executive Vice President of AJS said the award recognizes &quot;her commitment to improving our systems of justice and educating Americans about our great common enterprise – to ensure equality under the law&quot;. The award is the highest given by the AJS, and recognizes significant contributions toward improvements in the administration of justice within the United States.

== In popular culture ==
Reno had a higher profile than many of her immediate predecessors. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; and was the subject of a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; profile.

Four days after the seizure of Elián González, Reno was featured in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Quintuplets 2000&quot;.

Late night hosts frequently joked about her height and perceived lack of traditional femininity, and Will Ferrell repeatedly portrayed Reno on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2001, Reno appeared alongside Ferrell on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the final installment of the recurring sketch &quot;Janet Reno&#x27;s Dance Party&quot;.

In a 2007 Super Bowl XLI TV commercial, Reno was among the guests at Chad Ochocinco&#x27;s Super Bowl party.

Reno curated a compilation of old-time American songs performed by contemporary artists, titled &quot;Song of America&quot;. Reno worked with music producer Ed Pettersen (her niece&#x27;s husband) on the project. Reno said her goal with the project was to share music with her great-nieces and great-nephews.

In 2013, Reno voiced herself for the &quot;Dark Knight Court&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

She was depicted by Jane Lynch in &quot;&quot;, a fictionalized account of the true story of the FBI&#x27;s hunt for the Unabomber.

Anquette, an R&amp;B girl group from Miami, dedicated a song to her on their 1988 album &quot;Respect&quot;.

The Offspring&#x27;s 2001 song &quot;Original Prankster&quot; from their album &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot; mentioned her.
