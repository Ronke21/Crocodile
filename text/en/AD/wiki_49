<text>A is one of several types of traditionally made swords from Japan. Bronze swords were made as early as the Yayoi period (1,000 BC – 300 AD), though most people generally refer to the curved blades made from the Heian period (794–1185) to the present day when speaking of &quot;Japanese swords&quot;. There are many types of Japanese swords that differ by size, shape, field of application and method of manufacture. Some of the more commonly known types of Japanese swords are the &quot;uchigatana&quot;, &quot;tachi&quot;, &quot;ōdachi&quot;, &quot;wakizashi&quot;, and &quot;tantō&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;katana&quot; was used in ancient Japan and is still used today, whereas the old usage of the word &quot;nihontō&quot; is found in the poem the Song of &quot;Nihontō&quot;, by the Song dynasty poet Ouyang Xiu. The word &quot;nihontō&quot; became more common in Japan in the late Tokugawa shogunate. Due to importation of Western swords, the word &quot;nihontō&quot; was adopted to distinguish it from the .

&quot;Meibutsu&quot; (noted swords) is a special designation given to sword masterpieces which are listed in a compilation from the 18th century called the &quot;Kyoho Meibutsucho&quot;. The swords listed are &quot;Koto&quot; blades from several different provinces; 100 of the 166 swords listed are known to exist today, with &quot;Sōshū&quot; blades being very well represented. The &quot;Kyoho Meibutsucho&quot; also listed the nicknames, prices, history and length of the &quot;Meibutsu&quot;, with swords by Yoshimitsu, Masamune, Yoshihiro, and Sadamune being very highly priced.

== Anatomy ==
=== Blade ===
Each blade has a unique profile, mostly dependent on the swordsmith and the construction method. The most prominent part is the middle ridge, or &quot;shinogi&quot;. In the earlier picture, the examples were flat to the shinogi, then tapering to the blade edge. However, swords could narrow down to the shinogi, then narrow further to the blade edge, or even expand outward towards the shinogi then shrink to the blade edge (producing a trapezoidal shape). A flat or narrowing shinogi is called &quot;shinogi-hikushi&quot;, whereas a flat blade is called a &quot;shinogi-takushi&quot;.

The shinogi can be placed near the back of the blade for a longer, sharper, more fragile tip or a more moderate shinogi near the center of the blade.

The sword also has an exact tip shape, which is considered an extremely important characteristic: the tip can be long (&quot;ōkissaki&quot;), medium (&quot;chūkissaki&quot;), short (&quot;kokissaki&quot;), or even hooked backwards (&quot;ikuri-ōkissaki&quot;). In addition, whether the front edge of the tip is more curved (&quot;fukura-tsuku&quot;) or (relatively) straight (&quot;fukura-kareru&quot;) is also important.

The &quot;&quot; (point) is not usually a &quot;chisel-like&quot; point, and the Western knife interpretation of a &quot;tantō point&quot; is rarely found on true Japanese swords; a straight, linearly sloped point has the advantage of being easy to grind, but less stabbing/piercing capabilities compared to traditional Japanese kissaki Fukura (curvature of the cutting edge of tip) types. Kissaki usually have a curved profile, and smooth three-dimensional curvature across their surface towards the edge—though they are bounded by a straight line called the &quot;yokote&quot; and have crisp definition at all their edges. While the straight tip on the &quot;American tanto&quot; is identical to traditional Japanese fukura, two characteristics set it apart from Japanese sword makes: The absolute lack of curve only possible with modern tools, and the use of the word &quot;tanto&quot; in the nomenclature of the western tribute is merely a nod to the Japanese word for knife or short sword, rather than a tip style.

Although it is not commonly known, the &quot;chisel point&quot; kissaki originated in Japan. Examples of such are shown in the book &quot;The Japanese Sword&quot; by Kanzan Sato. Because American bladesmiths use this design extensively it is a common misconception that the design originated in America.

A hole is punched through the tang &quot;&quot;, called a &quot;&quot;. It is used to anchor the blade using a &quot;&quot;, a small bamboo pin that is inserted into another cavity in the handle &quot;&quot; and through the mekugi-ana, thus restricting the blade from slipping out. To remove the handle one removes the mekugi. The swordsmith&#x27;s signature &quot;&quot; is carved on the tang.
=== Mountings ===

In Japanese, the scabbard is referred to as a &quot;&quot;, and the handguard piece, often intricately designed as an individual work of art—especially in later years of the Edo period—was called the &quot;tsuba&quot;. Other aspects of the mountings , such as the &quot;&quot; (decorative grip swells), &quot;&quot; (blade collar and scabbard wedge), &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; (handle collar and cap), &quot;&quot; (small utility knife handle), &quot;&quot; (decorative skewer-like implement), &quot;&quot; lacquer, and &quot;&quot; (professional handle wrap, also named ), received similar levels of artistry.
=== Signature and date ===

The &quot;mei&quot; is the signature inscribed on to the tang of the Japanese sword. Fake signatures (&quot;gimei&quot;) are common not only due to centuries of forgeries but potentially misleading ones that acknowledge prominent smiths and guilds, and those commissioned to a separate signer.

Sword scholars collect and study &quot;oshigata&quot;, or paper tang-rubbings, taken from a blade: to identify the mei, the hilt is removed and the sword is held point side up. The mei is chiseled onto the tang on the side which traditionally faces away from the wearer&#x27;s body while being worn; since the katana and wakizashi are always worn with the cutting edge up, the edge should be held to the viewer&#x27;s left. The inscription will be viewed as kanji on the surface of the tang: the first two kanji represent the province; the next pair is the smith; and the last, when present, is sometimes a variation of &#x27;made by&#x27;, or, &#x27;respectfully&#x27;. The date will be inscribed near the mei, either with the reign name; the Zodiacal Method; or those calculated from the reign of the legendary Emperor Jimmu, dependent upon the period.

=== Length ===
What generally differentiates the different swords is their length. Japanese swords are measured in units of &quot;shaku&quot;. Since 1891, the modern Japanese shaku is approximately equal to a foot (11.93 inches), calibrated with the meter to equal exactly 10 meters per 33 shaku (30.30 cm).

However, the historical shaku was slightly longer (13.96 inches or 35.45 cm). Thus, there may sometimes be confusion about the blade lengths, depending on which shaku value is being assumed when converting to metric or U.S. customary measurements.

The three main divisions of Japanese blade length are:
* Less than 1 &quot;shaku&quot; for &quot;tantō&quot; (knife or dagger).
* Between 1 and 2 &quot;shaku&quot; for (&quot;wakizashi&quot; or &quot;kodachi&quot;).
* Greater than 2 &quot;shaku&quot; for (long sword, such as &quot;katana&quot; or &quot;tachi&quot;).

A blade shorter than one &quot;shaku&quot; is considered a &quot;tantō&quot; (knife). A blade longer than one &quot;shaku&quot; but less than two is considered a &quot;shōtō&quot; (short sword). The wakizashi and &quot;kodachi&quot; are in this category. The length is measured in a straight line across the back of the blade from tip to &quot;munemachi&quot; (where blade meets tang). Most blades that fall into the &quot;shōtō&quot; size range are &quot;wakizashi&quot;. However, some &quot;daitō&quot; were designed with blades slightly shorter than 2 &quot;shaku&quot;. These were called &quot;kodachi&quot; and are somewhere in between a true &quot;daitō&quot; and a &quot;wakizashi&quot;. A &quot;shōtō&quot; and a &quot;daitō&quot; together are called a &quot;daishō&quot; (literally, &quot;big-little&quot;). The &quot;daishō&quot; was the symbolic armament of the Edo period samurai.

A blade longer than two &quot;shaku&quot; is considered a &quot;daitō&quot;, or long sword. To qualify as a &quot;daitō&quot; the sword must have a blade longer than 2 &quot;shaku&quot; (approximately 24 inches or 60 centimeters) in a straight line. While there is a well defined lower limit to the length of a &quot;daitō&quot;, the upper limit is not well enforced; a number of modern historians, swordsmiths, etc. say that swords that are over 3 &quot;shaku&quot; in blade length are &quot;longer than normal &quot;daitō&quot;&quot; and are usually referred to as &quot;ōdachi&quot;. The word &quot;daitō&quot; is often used when explaining the related terms &quot;shōtō&quot; (short sword) and &quot;daishō&quot; (the set of both large and small sword). Miyamoto Musashi refers to the long sword in &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;. He is referring to the &quot;katana&quot; in this, and refers to the &quot;nodachi&quot; and the &quot;odachi&quot; as &quot;extra-long swords&quot;.

Before about 1500 most swords were usually worn suspended from cords on a belt, edge-down. This style is called &quot;jindachi-zukuri&quot;, and &quot;daitō&quot; worn in this fashion are called &quot;tachi&quot; (average blade length of 75–80 cm). From 1600 to 1867, more swords were worn through an &quot;obi&quot; (sash), paired with a smaller blade; both worn edge-up. This style is called &quot;buke-zukuri&quot;, and all &quot;daitō&quot; worn in this fashion are &quot;katana&quot;, averaging 70–74 cm (2 shaku 3 sun to 2 shaku 4 sun 5 bu) in blade length. However, Japanese swords of longer lengths also existed, including lengths up to 78 cm (2 shaku 5 sun 5 bu).

It was not simply that the swords were worn by cords on a belt, as a &#x27;style&#x27; of sorts. Such a statement trivializes an important function of such a manner of bearing the sword. It was a very direct example of &#x27;form following function.&#x27; At this point in Japanese history, much of the warfare was fought on horseback. Being so, if the sword or blade were in a more vertical position, it would be cumbersome, and awkward to draw. Suspending the sword by &#x27;cords&#x27; allowed the sheath to be more horizontal, and far less likely to bind while drawing it in that position.

Abnormally long blades (longer than 3 &quot;shaku&quot;), usually carried across the back, are called &quot;ōdachi&quot; or &quot;nodachi.&quot; The word &quot;ōdachi&quot; is also sometimes used as a synonym for Japanese swords. &quot;Odachi&quot; means &quot;great sword&quot;, and &quot;Nodachi&quot; translates to &quot;field sword&quot;. These greatswords were used during war, as the longer sword gave a foot soldier a reach advantage. These swords are now illegal in Japan. Citizens are not allowed to possess an &quot;odachi&quot; unless it is for ceremonial purposes.

Here is a list of lengths for different types of blades:
* Nodachi, Ōdachi, Jin tachi: 90.9 cm and over (more than three shaku)
* Tachi, Katana: over 60.6 cm (more than two shaku)
* Wakizashi: between 30.3 and 60.6 cm (between one and two shaku)
* Tantō, Aikuchi: under 30.3 cm (less than one shaku)

Blades whose length is next to a different classification type are described with a prefix &#x27;O-&#x27; (for great) or &#x27;Ko-&#x27; (for small), e.g. a Wakizashi with a length of 59 cm is called an O-wakizashi (almost a Katana) whereas a Katana of 61 cm is called a Ko-Katana (for small Katana; but note that a small accessory blade sometimes found in the sheath of a long sword is also a &quot;kogatana&quot; (小刀)).

Since 1867, restrictions and/or the deconstruction of the samurai class meant that most blades have been worn &quot;jindachi-zukuri&quot; style, like Western navy officers. Since 1953, there has been a resurgence in the &quot;buke-zukuri&quot; style, permitted only for demonstration purposes.

== Classification ==
=== Classification by shape and usage ===


In modern times the most commonly known type of Japanese sword is the &quot;Shinogi-Zukuri&quot; &quot;katana&quot;, which is a single-edged and usually curved sabre traditionally worn by samurai from the 15th century onwards. Western historians have said that Japanese katana were among the finest cutting weapons in world military history, for their intended use.

Other types of Japanese swords include: tsurugi or , which is a straight double-edged sword; ōdachi, tachi, which are older styles of a very long curved single-edged sword; uchigatana, a slightly shorter curved single-edged long sword; wakizashi, a medium-sized sword; and tantō, which is an even smaller knife-sized sword. Naginata, nagamaki, and yari, despite being polearms, are still considered to be swords, which is a common misconception; naginata, nagamaki and yari differ from swords.

The type classifications for Japanese swords indicate the combination of a blade and its mounts as this, then, determines the style of use of the blade. An unsigned and shortened blade that was once made and intended for use as a tachi may be alternately mounted in tachi koshirae and katana koshirae. It is properly distinguished, then, by the style of mount it currently inhabits. A long tanto may be classified as a wakizashi due to its length being over ; however, it may have originally been mounted and used as a tanto making the length distinction somewhat arbitrary but necessary when referring to unmounted short blades. When the mounts are taken out of the equation, a tanto and wakizashi will be determined by length under or over , unless their intended use can be absolutely determined or the speaker is rendering an opinion on the intended use of the blade. In this way, a blade formally attributed as a wakizashi due to length may be informally discussed between individuals as a tanto because the blade was made during an age where tanto were popular and the wakizashi as a companion sword to katana did not yet exist.

The following are types of Japanese swords:
* : A straight two-edged sword that was mainly produced prior to the 10th century. After the 10th century, they completely disappeared as weapons and came to be made only as offerings to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples.
* : A straight single edged sword that was mainly produced prior to the 10th century. Since the 10th century, they disappeared as weapons and came to be made only as offerings to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples.
* : A sword that is generally longer and more curved than the later katana, with curvature often centered from the middle or towards the tang, and often including the tang. Tachi were worn suspended, with the edge downward. The tachi was in vogue before the 15th century.
* : A shorter version of the tachi, but with similar mounts and intended use, mostly found in the 13th century or earlier.
* /: A longer version of the tachi, generally with a blade length of more than , mostly found in the 14th century or later. 
* : A sword with a curved blade longer than (there is no upper length limit but generally they are shorter than ), worn with the edge upwards in the sash. It was developed from &quot;sasuga&quot;, a kind of &quot;tantō&quot;, around the 14th century, and became the mainstream replacing &quot;tachi&quot; from the 15th century onwards. 
* : A general term for a sword between one and two shaku long ( in modern measurements), predominantly made after 1600. Generally it is the short blade that accompanies a katana in the traditional samurai &quot;daisho&quot; pairing of swords, but may be worn by classes other than the samurai as a single blade, also worn edge up as the katana. The name derives from the way the sword would be stuck at one&#x27;s side through the &quot;sash&quot;.
* : A sword with a blade shorter than one shaku (). &quot;Tantō&quot; are generally classified as a sword, but its usage is the same as that of a knife. Usually one-edged, but some were double-edged, though asymmetrical.

There are other bladed weapons made in the same traditional manner as Japanese swords, which are not swords, but are still classified as Japanese swords (&quot;nihontō&quot;) (as &quot;tō&quot; means &quot;blade&quot;, rather than specifically &quot;sword&quot;) because of the way they are made in a similar manner to Japanese swords:
* : A sword with an exceptionally long handle, usually about as long as the blade. The name refers to the length of the handle wrapping.
* : A polearm with a curved single-edged blade. Naginata mounts consist of a long wooden pole, different from a nagamaki mount, which is shorter and wrapped. 
* : A spear, or spear-like polearm. Yari have various blade forms, from a simple double edged and flat blade, to a triangular cross section double edged blade, to those with a symmetric cross-piece (&quot;jumonji-yari&quot;) or those with an asymmetric cross piece. The main blade is symmetric and straight, unlike a naginata, and usually smaller, but can be as large as or bigger than some naginata blades.

Other edged weapons or tools that are made using the same methods as Japanese swords:
* Arrowheads for war, yajiri (or yanone).
* : An accessory or utility knife, sometimes found mounted in a pocket on the side of the scabbard of a sword. A typical blade is about long and wide, and is made using the same techniques as the larger sword blades. Also referred to as a &quot;Kozuka&quot; (小柄), which literally means &#x27;small handle&#x27;, but this terminology can also refer to the handle and the blade together. In entertainment media, the kogatana is sometimes shown as a throwing weapon, but its real purpose was the same as a &#x27;pocket knife&#x27; in the West.

=== Classification by period ===

Each Japanese sword is classified according to when the blade was made.:
* &quot;Jōkotō&quot; ( &quot;ancient swords&quot;, until around 900 A.D.)
* &quot;Kotō&quot; ( &quot;old swords&quot; from around 900–1596)
* &quot;Shintō&quot; ( &quot;new swords&quot; 1596–1780)
* &quot;Shinshintō&quot; ( &quot;new new swords&quot; 1781–1876)
* &quot;Gendaitō&quot; ( &quot;modern or contemporary swords&quot; 1876–present)

Historically in Japan, the ideal blade of a Japanese sword has been considered to be the &quot;kotō&quot; in the Kamakura period, and the swordsmiths from the Edo period to the present day from the &quot;Shinto&quot; period focused on reproducing the blade of a Japanese sword in the Kamakura period. There are more than 100 Japanese swords designated as National Treasures in Japan, of which the &quot;Kotō&quot; of the Kamakura period account for 80% and the &quot;tachi&quot; account for 70%.

Japanese swords since &quot;shintō&quot; are different from &quot;kotō&quot; in forging method and steel. This was due to the destruction of the Bizen school due to a great flood, the spread of the Mino school, and the virtual unification of Japan by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, which made almost no difference in the steel used by each school. Japanese swords since the &quot;Shintō&quot; period often have gorgeous decorations carved on the blade and lacquered &quot;maki-e&quot; decorations on the scabbard. This was due to the economic development and the increased value of swords as arts and crafts as the Sengoku period ended and the peaceful Edo period began.

Japanese swords are still commonly seen today; antique and modern forged swords can be found and purchased. Modern, authentic Japanese swords (&quot;nihontō&quot;) are made by a few hundred swordsmiths. Many examples can be seen at an annual competition hosted by the All Japan Swordsmith Association, under the auspices of the Nihontō Bunka Shinkō Kyōkai (Society for the Promotion of Japanese Sword Culture). However, to maintain the quality of Japanese swords, the Japanese government limits the number of Japanese swords a swordsmith can make in a year to 24 (up to 2 swords per month). Therefore, many of the swords called &quot;Japanese sword&quot; distributed around the world today are made in China, and the manufacturing process and quality are not authorized.
=== Classification by school ===
Many old Japanese swords can be traced back to one of five provinces, each of which had its own school, traditions, and &quot;trademarks&quot; (e.g., the swords from Mino province were &quot;from the start famous for their sharpness&quot;). These schools are known as &quot;Gokaden&quot; (The Five Traditions). In the &quot;Kotō&quot; era there were several other schools that did not fit within the Five Traditions or were known to mix elements of each &quot;Gokaden&quot;, and they were called (small school). There were 19 commonly referenced . The number of swordsmiths of &quot;Gokaden&quot;, as confirmed by signatures and documents, were 4005 in Bizen, 1269 in Mino, 1025 in Yamato, 847 in Yamashiro and 438 in Sōshū. These traditions and provinces are as follows:

====Yamato school====

The Yamato school is a school that originated in Yamato Province corresponding to present-day Nara Prefecture. Nara was the capital of ancient Japan.
Since there is a legend that it was a swordsmith named Amakuni who first signed the tang of a sword, he is sometimes regarded as the founder and the oldest school.
However, the founder identified in the material is Yukinobu in the Heian period. They forged the swords that were often worn by monk warriors called &quot;sōhei&quot; in Nara&#x27;s large temples. The Yamato school consists of five schools: &quot;Senjuin, Shikkake, Taima, Tegai, and Hōshō&quot;.
Each school forged swords under the supervision of a different temple. In the middle of the Muromachi period, swordsmiths moved to various places such as Mino, and the school disappeared. Their swords are often characterized by a deep curve, a narrow width from blade to back, a high central ridge, and a small tip. There are direct lines on the surface of the blade, the &quot;hamon&quot; is linear, and the grain at the boundary of the hamon is medium in size. It is often evaluated as a sword with a simple and strong impression.
====Yamashiro school====

The Yamashiro school is a school that originated in Yamashiro Province, corresponding to present-day Kyoto Prefecture. When Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to Kyoto in 794, swordsmiths began to gather. The founder of the school was Sanjō Munechika in the late 10th century in the Heian period. The Yamashiro school consisted of schools such as &quot;Sanjō, Ayanokōji, Awataguchi, and Rai&quot;. At first, they often forged swords in response to aristocrats&#x27; demands, so importance was placed on aesthetics and practicality was not emphasized. However, when a domestic conflict occurred at the end of the Heian period, practicality was emphasized and a swordsmith was invited from the Bizen school. In the Kamakura period, &quot;tachi&quot; from a magnificent &quot;rai&quot; school became popular among samurai. After that, they also adopted the forging method of Sōshū school. Their swords are often characterized as long and narrow, curved from the base or center, and have a sparkle on the surface of the blade, with the &quot;hamon&quot; being straight and the grains on the boundary of the &quot;hamon&quot; being small. It is often evaluated as a sword with an elegant impression.
====Bizen school====

The Bizen school is a school that originated in Bizen Province, corresponding to present-day Okayama Prefecture. Bizen has been a major production area of high-quality iron sand since ancient times. The Ko-bizen school in the mid Heian period was the originator. The Bizen school consisted of schools such as &quot;Ko-bizen, Fukuoka-ichimonji, Osafune,&quot; and &quot;Hatakeda&quot;.
According to a sword book written in the Kamakura period, out of the 12 best swordsmiths in Japan who were convened by the Retired Emperor Go-Toba, 10 were from the Bizen school.
Great swordsmiths were born one after another in the &quot;Osafune&quot; school which started in the Kamakura period, and it developed to the largest school in the history of Japanese swords.
Kanemitsu and Nagayoshi of the &quot;Osafune&quot; school were apprentices to Masamune of the Sōshū school, the greatest swordsmith in Japan. While they forged high-quality swords by order, at the same time, from the Muromachi period, when wars became large-scale, they mass-produced low-quality swords for drafted farmers and for export.
The Bizen school had enjoyed the highest prosperity for a long time, but declined rapidly due to a great flood which occurred in the late 16th century during the Sengoku period. Their swords are often characterized as curved from the base, with irregular fingerprint-like patterns on the surface of the blade, while the &quot;hamon&quot; has a flashy pattern like a series of cloves, and there is little grain but a color gradient at the boundary of the &quot;hamon&quot;. It is often evaluated as a sword with a showy and gorgeous impression.
====Sōshū school====

The Sōshū school is a school that originated in Sagami Province, corresponding to present-day Kanagawa Prefecture. Sagami Province was the political center of Japan where the Kamakura shogunate was established in the Kamakura period. At the end of the 13th century, the Kamakura shogunate invited swordsmiths from Yamashiro school and Bizen school, and swordsmiths began to gather. Shintōgo Kunimitsu forged experimental swords by combining the forging technology of Yamashiro school and Bizen school. Masamune, who learned from Shintōgo Kunimitsu, became the greatest swordsmith in Japan. From the lessons of the Mongol invasion of Japan, they revolutionized the forging process to make stronger swords. Although this forging method is not fully understood to date, one of the elements is heating at higher temperatures and rapid cooling. Their revolution influenced other schools to make the highest quality swords, but this technique was lost before the Azuchi–Momoyama period (&quot;Shintō&quot; period). The Sōshū school declined after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate. Their swords are often characterized by a shallow curve, a wide blade to the back, and a thin cross-section. There are irregular fingerprint-like patterns on the surface of the blade, the &quot;hamon&quot; has a pattern of undulations with continuous roundness, and the grains at the boundary of the &quot;hamon&quot; are large.

====Mino school====

The Mino school is a school that originated in Mino Province, corresponding to present-day Gifu Prefecture. Mino Province was a strategic traffic point connecting the Kanto and Kansai regions, and was surrounded by powerful &quot;daimyo&quot; (feudal lords). The Mino school started in the middle of the Kamakura period, when swordsmiths of the Yamato school who learned from the Sōshū school gathered in Mino. The Mino school became the largest production area of Japanese swords after the Bizen school declined due to a great flood. The production rate of &quot;katana&quot; was high, because it was the newest school among five big schools. Their swords are often characterized by a slightly higher central ridge and a thinner back. There are irregular fingerprint-like patterns on the surface of the blade, the &quot;hamon&quot; are various, and the grain on the border of the hamon are hardly visible.
== History ==
The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods: &quot;jōkotō&quot; (ancient swords, until around 900 A.D.), &quot;kotō&quot; (old swords from around 900–1596), &quot;shintō&quot; (new swords 1596–1780), &quot;shinshintō&quot; (new new swords 1781–1876), &quot;gendaitō&quot; (modern or contemporary swords 1876–present)

=== Jōkotō – Kotō (Old swords) ===

Early examples of iron swords were straight &quot;tsurugi&quot;, &quot;chokutō&quot; and others with unusual shapes, some of the styles and techniques were derived from Chinese dao, and some directly imported through trade. The swords of this period were a mixture of swords of Japanese original style and those of Chinese style brought to Japan via the Korean Peninsula and East China Sea. The cross-sectional shape of the blades of these early swords was an isosceles triangular &quot;hira-zukuri&quot;, and the &quot;kiriha-zukuri&quot; sword, which sharpened only the part close to the cutting edge side of a planar blade, gradually appeared. Swords of this period are classified as &quot;jōkotō&quot; and are often referred to in distinction from Japanese swords.
The direct predecessor of the &quot;tachi&quot; (太刀) has been called &quot;Warabitetō&quot; (:ja:蕨手刀) by the Emishi (Not to be confused with Ainu) of Tohoku. The Nihonto Meikan shows the earliest and by far the largest group of Ōshū smiths from the beginning of the 8th century were from the Mokusa school, listing over 100 Mokusa smiths before the beginning of the Kamakura period. Archaeological excavations of the Ōshū Tohoku region show iron ore smelting sites dating back to the early Nara period. The Tohoku region and indeed the whole Ōshū district in the 8th century was controlled and populated by the Emishi. Archaeological evidence of recovered &quot;Warabitetō&quot; (蕨手刀) show a high concentration in the burial goods of the Ōshū and Hokkaido regions. Mokusa Area was famous for legendary swordsmiths in the Heian period (AD 794–1185). They are considered as the original producers of the Japanese swords known as &quot;&quot;Warabitetō&quot; &quot; which can date back to the sixth to eighth centuries. &quot;&quot;Warabitetō&quot; &quot; gained its fame through the series of battles between Emishi people (蝦夷) and the Yamato-chotei government (大 和朝廷) in the late eighth century. Using &quot;&quot;Warabitetō&quot;,&quot; the small number of Emishi soldiers could resist against the numerous Yamato-chotei army over a Thirty-Eight Years&#x27; War (三十八年戦争) (AD 770–811). The Meikan describes that from earlier time there was a list of forty-two famous swordsmiths in the Toukou Meikan 刀工銘鑑 at Kanchiin 観智院. Eight of the swordsmiths on this list were from Ōshū schools. Five from Mokusa being Onimaru 鬼丸, Yoyasu 世安, Morifusa 森房, Hatafusa 幡房 and Gaan 瓦安, two from the Tamatsukuri Fuju 諷誦,Houji 寶次 and one from Gassan signing just Gassan 月山. According to the Nihonto Meikan, the Ōshū swordsmith group consists of the Mokusa (舞草), the Gassan (月山) and the Tamatsukuri (玉造), later to become the Hoju (寶壽) schools. Ōshū swords appear in various old books of this time, for example Heiji Monogatari 平治物語 (Tale of Heiji), Konjaku Monogatari 今昔物語 (Anthology of tales from the past), Kojidan 古事談 (Japanese collection of Setsuwa 説話), and Gikeiki 義経記 (War tale that focuses on the legends of Minamoto no Yoshitsune 源義経 and his followers). Ōshū swordsmiths appeared in books in quite early times compared to others. Tales in these books tell of the Emishi-to in the capital city and these swords seem to have been quite popular with the Bushi. Maybe a badge of honour being captured weapons. For example, In &quot;Nihongiryaku&quot; 日本紀略 983AD :&quot; the number of people wearing a funny looking Tachi 太刀 is increasing.&quot; In &quot;Kauyagokau&quot; 高野御幸 1124AD :&quot; when emperor Shirakawa 白河法皇 visited Kouyasan 高 野山, Fujiwara Zaemon Michisue 藤原左衛門通季 was wearing a Fushū sword “ In “Heihanki&quot; 兵範記 1158AD there was a line that mentioned the Emperor himself had Fushū Tachi.&quot; It seems that during the late Heian the Emishi-to was gaining popularity in Kyoto.
In the middle of the Heian period (794–1185), samurai improved on the Warabitetō to develop &quot;Kenukigata-tachi (:ja:毛抜形太刀)&quot; -early Japanese sword-. To be more precise, it is thought that the &quot;Emishi&quot; improved the &quot;warabitetō&quot; and developed &quot;Kenukigata-warabitetō (:ja:毛抜形蕨手刀)&quot; with a hole in the hilt and &quot;kenukigatatō (:ja:毛抜形刀)&quot; without decorations on the tip of the hilt, and the samurai developed &quot;kenukigata-tachi&quot; based on these swords. &quot;Kenukigata-tachi&quot;, which was developed in the first half of the 10th century, has a three-dimensional cross-sectional shape of an elongated pentagonal or hexagonal blade called &quot;shinogi-zukuri&quot; and a gently curved single-edged blade, which are typical features of Japanese swords. There is no wooden hilt attached to &quot;kenukigata-tachi&quot;, and the tang (&quot;nakago&quot;) which is integrated with the blade is directly gripped and used. The term &quot;kenukigata&quot; is derived from the fact that the central part of tang is hollowed out in the shape of an ancient Japanese tweezers (&quot;kenuki&quot;).
In the &quot;tachi&quot; developed after &quot;kenukigata-tachi&quot;, a structure in which the hilt is fixed to the tang (&quot;nakago&quot;) with a pin called &quot;mekugi&quot; was adopted. As a result, a sword with three basic external elements of Japanese swords, the cross-sectional shape of &quot;shinogi-zukuri&quot;, a gently curved single-edged blade, and the structure of &quot;nakago&quot;, was completed. Its shape may reflect the changing form of warfare in Japan. Cavalry were now the predominant fighting unit and the older straight &quot;chokutō&quot; were particularly unsuitable for fighting from horseback. The curved sword is a far more efficient weapon when wielded by a warrior on horseback where the curve of the blade adds considerably to the downward force of a cutting action. Early models had uneven curves with the deepest part of the curve at the hilt. As eras changed the center of the curve tended to move up the blade.

The &quot;tachi&quot; is a sword which is generally larger than a &quot;katana&quot;, and is worn suspended with the cutting edge down. This was the standard form of carrying the sword for centuries, and would eventually be displaced by the &quot;katana&quot; style where the blade was worn thrust through the belt, edge up. The &quot;tachi&quot; was worn slung across the left hip. The signature on the tang of the blade was inscribed in such a way that it would always be on the outside of the sword when worn. This characteristic is important in recognizing the development, function, and different styles of wearing swords from this time onwards.

When worn with full armour, the &quot;tachi&quot; would be accompanied by a shorter blade in the form known as &quot;koshigatana&quot; (腰刀, &quot;waist sword&quot;); a type of short sword with no handguard, and where the hilt and scabbard meet to form the style of mounting called an &quot;aikuchi&quot; (&quot;meeting mouth&quot;). Daggers (&quot;tantō&quot;), were also carried for close combat fighting as well as carried generally for personal protection.

By the 11th century during the Heian period, Japanese swords had already been exported to neighboring countries in Asia. For example, in the poem &quot;The Song of Japanese Swords&quot; Ouyang Xiu, a statesman of the Song dynasty in China, described Japanese swords as &quot;It is a treasured sword with a scabbard made of fragrant wood covered with fish skin, decorated with brass and copper, and capable of exorcising evil spirits. It is imported at a great cost.&quot;.

From the Heian period (794–1185), ordinary samurai wore swords of the style called &quot;kurourusi tachi (kokushitsu no tachi, 黒漆太刀)&quot;, which meant black lacquer &quot;tachi&quot;. The hilt of a &quot;tachi&quot; is wrapped in leather or ray skin, and it is wrapped with black thread or leather cord, and the scabbard is coated with black lacquer. On the other hand, court nobles wore &quot;tachi&quot; decorated with precisely carved metal and jewels for ceremonial purposes. High-ranking court nobles wore swords of the style called &quot;kazari tachi&quot; or &quot;kaza tachi&quot; (飾太刀, 飾剣), which meant decorative &quot;tachi&quot;, and lower-ranking court nobles wore simplified &quot;kazatachi&quot; swords of the style called &quot;hosodachi&quot; (細太刀), which meant thin &quot;tachi&quot;. The &quot;kazatachi&quot; and &quot;hosodachi&quot; worn by nobles were initially straight like a &quot;chokutō&quot;, but since the Kamakura period they have had a gentle curve under the influence of &quot;tachi&quot;. Since &quot;tachi&quot; worn by court nobles were for ceremonial use, they generally had an iron plate instead of a blade.

In the Kamakura period (1185–1333), high-ranking samurai wore &quot;hyogo gusari tachi (hyogo kusari no tachi, 兵庫鎖太刀)&quot;, which meant a sword with chains in the arsenal. The scabbard of the &quot;tachi&quot; was covered with a gilt copper plate and hung by chains at the waist. At the end of the Kamakura period, simplified &quot;hyogo gusari tachi&quot; came to be made as an offering to the &quot;kami&quot; of Shinto shrines and fell out of use as weapons. On the other hand, in the Kamakura period, there was a type of &quot;tachi&quot; called &quot;hirumaki tachi&quot; (蛭巻太刀) with a scabbard covered with metal, which was used as a weapon until the Muromachi period. The meaning was a sword wrapped around a leech, and its feature was that a thin metal plate was spirally wrapped around the scabbard, so it was both sturdy and decorative, and chains were not used to hang the scabbard around the waist.

The Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century during the Kamakura period spurred further evolution of the Japanese sword. The swordsmiths of the Sōshū school represented by Masamune studied &quot;tachi&quot; that were broken or bent in battle, developed new production methods, and created innovative Japanese swords. They forged the blade using a combination of soft and hard steel to optimize the temperature and timing of the heating and cooling of the blade, resulting in a lighter but more robust blade. They also made the curve of the blade gentle, lengthened the tip linearly, widened the width from the cutting edge to the opposite side of the blade, and thinned the cross section to improve the penetration and cutting ability of the blade.

Historically in Japan, the ideal blade of a Japanese sword has been considered to be the (lit., &quot;old swords&quot;) in the Kamakura period, and the swordsmiths from the Edo period (1603–1868) to the present day from the (lit., &quot;new swords&quot;) period focused on reproducing the blade of the Japanese sword made in Kamakura period. There are more than 100 Japanese swords designated as National Treasures in Japan, of which the &quot;Kotō&quot; of the Kamakura period account for 80% and the &quot;tachi&quot; account for 70%.

From the end of the Kamakura period to the end of the Muromachi period (1333–1573), &quot;kawatsutsumi tachi&quot; (革包太刀), which means a &quot;tachi&quot; wrapped in leather, was popular. The &quot;kawatsutsumi tachi&quot; was stronger than the &quot;kurourushi tachi&quot; because its hilt was wrapped in leather or ray skin, lacquer was painted on top of it, leather straps and cords were wrapped around it, and the scabbard and sometimes the &quot;tsuba&quot; (hand guard) were also wrapped in leather.
In the Nanboku-chō period (1336–1392) which corresponds to the early Muromachi period (1336–1573), huge Japanese swords such as &quot;ōdachi&quot; became popular. The reason for this is thought to be that the conditions for making a practical large-sized sword were established due to the nationwide spread of strong and sharp swords of the Sōshū school. In the case of &quot;ōdachi&quot; whose blade was 150 cm long, it was impossible to draw a sword from the scabbard on the waist, so people carried it on their back or had their servants carry it. Large &quot;naginata&quot; and &quot;kanabō&quot; were also popular in this period.
&quot;Katana&quot; originates from &quot;sasuga&quot;, a kind of &quot;tantō&quot; used by lower-ranking samurai who fought on foot in the Kamakura period. Their main weapon was a long &quot;naginata&quot; and &quot;sasuga&quot; was a spare weapon. In the Nanboku-chō period, long weapons such as &quot;ōdachi&quot; were popular, and along with this, &quot;sasuga&quot; lengthened and finally became &quot;katana&quot;. Also, there is a theory that &quot;koshigatana&quot; (腰刀), a kind of &quot;tantō&quot; which was equipped by high ranking samurai together with &quot;tachi&quot;, developed to &quot;katana&quot; through the same historical background as &quot;sasuga&quot;, and it is possible that both developed to &quot;katana&quot;. The oldest &quot;katana&quot; in existence today is called &quot;Hishizukuri uchigatana&quot;, which was forged in the Nanbokuchō period, and was dedicated to Kasuga Shrine later.

By the 15th century, Japanese swords had already gained international fame by being exported to China and Korea. For example, Korea learned how to make Japanese swords by sending swordsmiths to Japan and inviting Japanese swordsmiths to Korea. According to the record of June 1, 1430, in the &quot;Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, a Korean swordsmith who went to Japan and mastered the method of making Japanese swords presented a Japanese sword to the King of Korea and was rewarded for the excellent work which was no different from the swords made by the Japanese.

Traditionally, &quot;yumi&quot; (bows) were the main weapon of war in Japan, and &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;naginata&quot; were used only for close combat. The Ōnin War in the late 15th century in the Muromachi period expanded into a large-scale domestic war, in which employed farmers called &quot;ashigaru&quot; were mobilized in large numbers. They fought on foot using &quot;katana&quot; shorter than &quot;tachi&quot;. In the Sengoku period (1467–1615, period of warring states) in the late Muromachi period, the war became bigger and &quot;ashigaru&quot; fought in a close formation using &quot;yari&quot; (spears) lent to them. Furthermore, in the late 16th century, &quot;tanegashima&quot; (muskets) were introduced from Portugal, and Japanese swordsmiths mass-produced improved products, with &quot;ashigaru&quot; fighting with leased guns. On the battlefield in Japan, guns and spears became main weapons in addition to bows. Due to the changes in fighting styles in these wars, the &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;naginata&quot; became obsolete among samurai, and the &quot;katana&quot;, which was easy to carry, became the mainstream. The dazzling looking &quot;tachi&quot; gradually became a symbol of the authority of high-ranking samurai.

On the other hand, &quot;kenjutsu&quot; (swordsmanship) that makes use of the characteristics of &quot;katana&quot; was invented. The quicker draw of the sword was well suited to combat where victory depended heavily on short response times. (The practice and martial art for drawing the sword quickly and responding to a sudden attack was called ‘Battōjutsu’, which is still kept alive through the teaching of Iaido.) The &quot;katana&quot; further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (&quot;obi&quot;) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved &quot;tachi&quot; had been worn with the edge of the blade facing down and suspended from a belt.

From the 15th century, low-quality swords were mass-produced under the influence of the large-scale war. These swords, along with spears, were lent to recruited farmers called &quot;ashigaru&quot; and swords ware exported. Such mass-produced swords are called &quot;kazuuchimono&quot;, and swordsmiths of the Bisen school and Mino school produced them by division of labor. The export of Japanese sword reached its height during the Muromachi period when at least 200,000 swords were shipped to Ming dynasty China in official trade in an attempt to soak up the production of Japanese weapons and make it harder for pirates in the area to arm. In the Ming dynasty of China, Japanese swords and their tactics were studied to repel pirates, and &quot;wodao&quot; and &quot;miaodao&quot; were developed based on Japanese swords.

From this period, the tang () of many old were cut and shortened into . This kind of remake is called (磨上げ). For example, many of the &quot;tachi&quot; that Masamune forged during the Kamakura period were converted into &quot;katana&quot;, so his only existing works are &quot;katana&quot; and &quot;tantō&quot;. During this period, a great flood occurred in Bizen, which was the largest production area of Japanese swords, and the Bizen school rapidly declined, after which the Mino school flourished.

From around the 16th century, many Japanese swords were exported to Thailand, where katana-style swords were made and prized for battle and art work, and some of them are in the collections of the Thai royal family.
In the Sengoku period (1467–1615) or the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600), the &quot;itomaki tachi&quot; (&quot;itomaki no tachi&quot;, 糸巻太刀), which means a &quot;tachi&quot; wound with thread, appeared and became the mainstream of &quot;tachi&quot; after that. &quot;itomaki tachi&quot; was decorated with gorgeous lacquer decorations with lots of &quot;maki-e&quot; and flashy colored threads, and was used as a gift, a ceremony, or an offering to the &quot;kami&quot; of Shinto shrines.
In later Japanese feudal history, during the Sengoku and Edo periods, certain high-ranking warriors of what became the ruling class would wear their sword &quot;tachi&quot;-style (edge-downward), rather than with the scabbard thrust through the belt with the edge upward. This style of swords is called &quot;handachi&quot;, &quot;half &quot;tachi&quot;&quot;. In &quot;handachi&quot;, both styles were often mixed, for example, fastening to the &quot;obi&quot; was &quot;katana&quot; style, but metalworking of the scabbard was &quot;tachi&quot; style.

In the Muromachi period, especially the Sengoku period, anybody such as farmers, townspeople and monks could equip a sword. However, in 1588 during the Azuchi–Momoyama period, Toyotomi Hideyoshi conducted a sword hunt and banned farmers from owning them with weapons.

However, Toyotomi&#x27;s sword hunt couldn&#x27;t disarm peasants. Farmers and townspeople could wear daisho until 1683. And most of them kept wearing wakizashi on a daily basis until the middle of the 18th century. After then they wore it special times (travel, wedding, funeral) until meiji restoration.
=== Shintō – Shinshintō (New swords) ===

Swords forged after 1596 in the Keichō period of the Azuchi-Momoyama period are classified as &quot;shintō&quot; (New swords). Japanese swords since &quot;shintō&quot; are different from &quot;kotō&quot; in forging method and steel (&quot;tamahagane&quot;). This is thought to be because Bizen school, which was the largest swordsmith group of Japanese swords, was destroyed by a great flood in 1590 and the mainstream shifted to Mino school, and because Toyotomi Hideyoshi virtually unified Japan, uniform steel began to be distributed throughout Japan. The &quot;kotō&quot; swords, especially the Bizen school swords made in the Kamakura period, had a &quot;midare-utsuri&quot; like a white mist between &quot;hamon&quot; and &quot;shinogi&quot;, but the swords since &quot;shinto&quot; have almost disappeared. In addition, the whole body of the blade became whitish and hard. Almost no one was able to reproduce &quot;midare-utsurii&quot; until Kunihira Kawachi reproduced it in 2014.

Japanese swords since the &quot;sintō&quot; period often have gorgeous decorations carved on the blade and lacquered &quot;maki-e&quot; decorations on the scabbard. This was due to the economic development and the increased value of swords as arts and crafts as the Sengoku period ended and the peaceful Edo period began. The Umetada school led by Umetada Myoju who was considered to be the founder of &quot;shinto&quot; led the improvement of the artistry of Japanese swords in this period. They were both swordsmiths and metalsmiths, and were famous for carving the blade, making metal accouterments such as &quot;tsuba&quot; (handguard), remodeling from &quot;tachi&quot; to &quot;katana&quot; (&quot;suriage&quot;), and inscriptions inlaid with gold.
During this period, the Tokugawa shogunate required samurai to wear &quot;Katana&quot; and shorter swords in pairs. These short swords were &quot;wakizashi&quot; and &quot;tantō&quot;, and &quot;wakizashi&quot; were mainly selected. This set of two is called a &quot;daishō&quot;. Only &quot;samurai&quot; could wear the &quot;daishō&quot;: it represented their social power and personal honour. Samurai could wear decorative sword mountings in their daily lives, but the Tokugawa shogunate regulated the formal sword that samurai wore when visiting a castle by regulating it as a &quot;daisho&quot; made of a black scabbard, a hilt wrapped with white ray skin and black string.

Townspeople (&quot;Chōnin&quot;) and farmers were allowed to equip a short wakizashi, and the public were often equipped with &quot;wakizashi&quot; on their travels. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, swordmaking and the use of firearms declined. Japanese swords made in this period is classified as &quot;shintō&quot;.
In the late 18th century, swordsmith Suishinshi Masahide criticized that the present &quot;katana&quot; blades only emphasized decoration and had a problem with their toughness. He insisted that the bold and strong kotō blade from the Kamakura period to the Nanboku-chō period was the ideal Japanese sword, and started a movement to restore the production method and apply it to &quot;katana&quot;. &quot;Katana&quot; made after this is classified as a , &quot;new revival swords&quot; or literally &quot;new-new swords.&quot; One of the most popular swordsmiths in Japan today is Minamoto Kiyomaro who was active in this &quot;shinshintō&quot; period. His popularity is due to his timeless exceptional skill, as he was nicknamed &quot;Masamune in Yotsuya&quot; and his disastrous life. His works were traded at high prices and exhibitions were held at museums all over Japan from 2013 to 2014.

The arrival of Matthew Perry in 1853 and the subsequent Convention of Kanagawa caused chaos in Japanese society. Conflicts began to occur frequently between the forces of &quot;sonnō jōi&quot; (尊王攘夷派), who wanted to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate and rule by the emperor, and the forces of &quot;sabaku&quot; (佐幕派), who wanted the Tokugawa Shogunate to continue. These political activists, called the &quot;shishi&quot; (志士), fought using a practical &quot;katana&quot;, called the &quot;kinnōtō&quot; (勤皇刀) or the &quot;bakumatsutō&quot; (幕末刀). Their &quot;katana&quot; were often longer than in blade length, less curved, and had a big and sharp point, which was advantageous for stabbing in indoor battles.
=== Gendaitō (Modern or contemporary swords) ===

In 1867, the Tokugawa Shogunate declared the return of Japan&#x27;s sovereignty to the emperor, and from 1868, the government by the emperor and rapid modernization of Japan began, which was called the Meiji Restoration. The Haitōrei Edict in 1876 all but banned carrying swords and guns on streets. Overnight, the market for swords died, many swordsmiths were left without a trade to pursue, and valuable skills were lost. Swords forged after the Haitōrei Edict are classified as &quot;gendaitō&quot;. The craft of making swords was kept alive through the efforts of some individuals, notably Miyamoto kanenori (宮本包則, 1830–1926) and Gassan Sadakazu (月山貞一, 1836–1918), who were appointed Imperial Household Artist. These smiths produced fine works that stand with the best of the older blades for the emperor and other high-ranking officials. The businessman Mitsumura Toshimo (光村利藻, 1877–1955) tried to preserve their skills by ordering swords and sword mountings from the swordsmiths and craftsmen. He was especially enthusiastic about collecting sword mountings, and he collected about 3,000 precious sword mountings from the end of the Edo period to the Meiji period. About 1200 items from a part of the collection are now in the Nezu Museum.

The Japanese sword remained in use in some occupations such as the police force. At the same time, kendo was incorporated into police training so that police officers would have at least the training necessary to properly use one. In time, it was rediscovered that soldiers needed to be armed with swords, and over the decades at the beginning of the 20th century swordsmiths again found work. These swords, called &quot;guntō,&quot; were often oil-tempered, or simply stamped out of steel and given a serial number rather than a chiseled signature. The mass-produced ones often look like Western cavalry sabers rather than Japanese swords, with blades slightly shorter than blades of the &quot;shintō&quot; and &quot;shinshintō&quot; periods. In 1934 the Japanese government issued a military specification for the &quot;shin guntō&quot; (new army sword), the first version of which was the Type 94 &quot;Katana&quot;, and many machine- and hand-crafted swords used in World War II conformed to this and later &quot;shin guntō&quot; specifications.
Under the United States occupation at the end of World War II all armed forces in occupied Japan were disbanded and production of Japanese swords with edges was banned except under police or government permit. The ban was overturned through a personal appeal by Dr. Junji Honma. During a meeting with General Douglas MacArthur, Honma produced blades from the various periods of Japanese history and MacArthur was able to identify very quickly what blades held artistic merit and which could be considered purely weapons. As a result of this meeting, the ban was amended so that &quot;guntō&quot; weapons would be destroyed while swords of artistic merit could be owned and preserved. Even so, many Japanese swords were sold to American soldiers at a bargain price; in 1958 there were more Japanese swords in America than in Japan. The vast majority of these one million or more swords were &quot;guntō&quot;, but there were still a sizable number of older swords.

After the Edo period, swordsmiths turned increasingly to the production of civilian goods. The Occupation and its regulations almost put an end to the production of Japanese swords. A few smiths continued their trade, and Honma went on to be a founder of the , who made it their mission to preserve the old techniques and blades. Thanks to the efforts of other like-minded individuals, the Japanese swords did not disappear, many swordsmiths continued the work begun by Masahide, and the old swordmaking techniques were rediscovered.

Nowadays, &quot;iaitō&quot; is used for &quot;iaidō&quot;. Due to their popularity in modern media, display-only Japanese swords have become widespread in the sword marketplace. Ranging from small letter openers to scale replica &quot;wallhangers&quot;, these items are commonly made from stainless steel (which makes them either brittle (if made from cutlery-grade 400-series stainless steel) or poor at holding an edge (if made from 300-series stainless steel)) and have either a blunt or very crude edge. There are accounts of good quality stainless steel Japanese swords, however, these are rare at best. Some replica Japanese swords have been used in modern-day armed robberies. As a part of marketing, modern ahistoric blade styles and material properties are often stated as traditional and genuine, promulgating disinformation. Some companies and independent smiths outside Japan produce &quot;katana&quot; as well, with varying levels of quality. According to the Parliamentary Association for the Preservation and Promotion of Japanese Swords, organized by Japanese Diet members, many Japanese swords distributed around the world as of the 21st century are fake Japanese-style swords made in China. The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; analyzed that this is because the Japanese government allowed swordsmiths to make only 24 Japanese swords per person per year to maintain the quality of Japanese swords.

In Japan, genuine edged hand-made Japanese swords, whether antique or modern, are classified as art objects (and not weapons) and must have accompanying certification to be legally owned. 
Prior to WWII Japan had 1.5million swords in the country – 200,000 of which had been manufactured in factories during the Meiji Restoration. As of 2008, only 100,000 swords remain in Japan. It is estimated that 250,000–350,000 sword have been brought to other nations as souvenirs, art pieces or for Museum purposes. 70% of &quot;daito&quot; (long swords), formerly owned by Japanese officers, have been exported or brought to the United States.

Many swordsmiths since the Edo period have tried to reproduce the sword of the Kamakura period which is considered as the best sword in the history of Japanese swords, but they have failed. Then, in 2014, Kunihira Kawachi succeeded in reproducing it and won the Masamune Prize, the highest honor as a swordsmith. No one could win the Masamune Prize unless he made an extraordinary achievement, and in the section of &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;katana&quot;, no one had won for 18 years before Kawauchi.

The popularity of Japanese swords among Japanese women increased dramatically after the release of a browser video game called &quot;Touken Ranbu&quot;, featuring anthropomorphic characters of famous Japanese swords, in 2015. Since then, sales of books on Japanese swords have increased dramatically, and the number of special exhibitions at various museums featuring famous historical swords has increased dramatically, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of visitors to museums. In addition, museums and Shinto shrines have launched a number of crowdfunding programmes to purchase historical swords featured in games from private owners, as well as reproductions of swords and new sword mountings, increasing the number of opportunities to view these masterpieces. With the increased interest in Japanese swords, &quot;gendaitō&quot; swordsmiths are now being asked by women for their autographs.

=== Cultural and social significance ===

The events of Japanese society have shaped the craft of sword making, as has the sword itself influenced the course of cultural and social development within the nation.

The Museum of Fine Arts states that when an artisan plunged the newly crafted sword into the cold water, a portion of his spirit was transferred into the sword. His spirit, morals and state of mind at the time became crucial to the defining of the swords moral and physical characteristics

During the Jōmon period (10,000–1000 BCE) swords resembled iron knife blades and were used for hunting, fishing and farming. There is the idea that swords were more than a tool during the Jōmon period, no swords have been recovered to back this hypothesis.

The Yayoi period (1000 BCE – 300 CE) saw the establishment of villages and the cultivation of rice farming within Japan. Rice farming came as a result of Chinese and Korean influence, they were the first group of people to introduce swords into the Japanese Isles. Subsequently, bronze swords were used for religious ceremonies. The Yayoi period saw swords be used primarily for religious and ceremonial purposes.

During the Kofun period (250–538 CE) Animism was introduced into Japanese society. Animism is the belief that everything in life contains or is connected to a divine spirit. This connection to the spirit world premediates the introduction of Buddhism into Japan. During this time, China was craving steel blades on the Korean Peninsula. Japan saw this as a threat to national security and felt the need to develop their military technology. As a result, clan leaders took power as military elites, fighting one another for power and territory. As dominant figures took power, loyalty and servitude became an important part of Japanese life – this became the catalyst for the honour culture that is often affiliated with Japanese people.

In the Edo period (1603–1868), swords gained prominence in everyday life as the &quot;most important&quot; part of a warrior&#x27;s amour. The Edo era saw swords became a mechanism for bonding between Daimyo and Samurai. Daimyo would gift samurai&#x27;s with swords as a token of their appreciation for their services. In turn, samurai would gift Daimyo swords as a sign of respect, most Daimyo would keep these swords as family heirlooms. In this period, it was believed that swords were multifunctional; in spirit they represent proof of military accomplishment, in practice they are coveted weapons of war and diplomatic gifts.

The peace of the Edo period saw the demand for swords fall. To retaliate, in 1719 the eighth Tokugawa shogun, Yoshimune, compiled a list of &quot;most famous swords&quot;. Masamune, Awatacuchi Yoshimitsu, and Go no Yoshihiro were dubbed the &quot;Three Famous Smiths&quot;, their swords became sought after by the Daimyo. The prestige and demand for these status symbols spiked the price for these fine pieces.

During the Late-Edo period, Suishinshi Masahide wrote that swords should be less extravagant. Swords began to be simplified and altered to be durable, sturdy and made to cut well. In 1543 guns arrived in Japan, changing military dynamic and practicality of swords and samurai&#x27;s. This period also saw introduction of martial arts as a means to connecting to the spirit world and allowed common people to participate in samurai culture.

The Meiji period (1868–1912) saw the dissolution of the samurai class, after foreign powers demanded Japan open their borders to international trade – 300-hundred years of Japanese isolation came to an end. In 1869 and 1873, two petition were submitted to government to abolish the custom of sword wearing because people feared the outside world would view swords as a &quot;tool for bloodshed&quot; and would consequentially associate Japanese people as violent. Haitōrei (1876) outlawed and prohibited wearing swords in public, with the exception for those in the military and government official; swords lost their meaning within society. Emperor Meiji was determined to westernize Japan with the influence of American technological and scientific advances; however, he himself appreciated the art of sword making. The Meiji era marked the final moments of samurai culture, as samurai&#x27;s were no match for conscript soldiers who were trained to use western firearms. Some samurai found it difficult to assimilate to the new culture as they were forced to give up their privileges, while others preferred this less-hierarchical way of life. Even with the ban, the Sino-Japanese War (1894) saw Japanese troops wear swords into battle, not for practical use but for symbolic reasons.

The Meiji era also saw the integration of Buddhism into Shinto Japanese beliefs. Swords were no longer necessary, in war or lifestyle, and those who practiced martial arts became the &quot;modern samurai&quot; – young children were still groomed to serve the emperor and put loyalty and honour above all else, as this new era of rapid development required loyal, hard working men. The practice of sword making was prohibited, thus swords during the Meiji period were obsolete and a mere symbol of status. Swords were left to rust, sold or melted into more ‘practical’ objects for everyday life.

Prior to and during WWII, even with the modernization of the army, the demand for swords exceeded the number of swordsmiths still capable of making them. As a result, swords of this era are of poor quality. In 1933, during the Shōwa era (1926–1989), a sword making factory designed to re-establish the &quot;spirit of Japan&quot; through the art of sword making was built to preserve the legacy and art of swordsmiths and sword making. The government at the time feared that the warrior spirit (loyalty and honour) was disappearing within Japan, along with the integrity and quality of swords.

For a portion of the US occupation of Japan, sword making, swordsmiths and wielding of swords was prohibited. As a means to preserve the warrior culture of Japan, martial arts was put into the school curriculum. In 1953, America finally lifted the ban on swords after realizing that sword making is an important cultural asset to preserving Japanese history and legacy.

==== Religion, honour and mythology ====
The origins of Japanese swords and their effects and influence on society differs depending on the story that is followed.
* Swords and warriors are closely associated with Shinto in Japanese culture. Shinto is &quot;the way of the gods&quot;, meaning that all elements of the world are embedded with god like spirits. Shinto endorses self-purification, ancestral worship, nature-worship and imperial divinity. It is said that swords are a source of wisdom and &quot;emanate energy&quot; to inspire the wielder. As Shintoism shaped the progress of Japanese expansionism and international affairs so too did the sword become a mechanism for change.
* There is a Japanese legend that, along with the mirror and the jewels, the sword makes up one of three Imperial Icons. The Imperial Icons present the three values and personality traits that all good emperors should possess as leaders of celestial authority.
* Japanese mythology states that the sword is a &quot;symbol of truth&quot; and a &quot;token of virtue&quot;. Legend states originate from the battle between Amaterasu and her brother, Susa-no-wo-o-no Mikotot (Susa-no). To defeat Susa-no, Amaterasu split the ten-span sword until she broke herself into three pieces. Legend states that the sword can &quot;create union by imposing social order&quot; because it hold the ability to cut objects into two or more pieces and dictate the shape and size of the pieces.
* Mythology also suggests that when Emperor Jimmu Tennō was moving his army through the land, a deity blocked their path with toxic gas which caused them to drift into an indefinite slumber. Upon seeing this, Amaterasu pleaded with the God of Thunder to punish the deity and allow the emperor to proceed. The God of Thunder, instead of following her orders, sent his sword down to the emperor to subdue the land. Upon receiving the sword, the emperor woke up, along with his troops and they proceeded with their mission. According this legend, swords have the power to save the imperial (divine) bloodline in times of need.
* In martial arts training, it is believed that within a sword: 
** &quot;The blade represents the juncture where the wisdom of leaders and gods intersects with the commoner. The sword represents the implement by which societies are managed. The effectiveness of the sword as a tool and the societal beliefs surrounding it both lift the sword to the pinnacle of warrior symbolism.&quot;
* Swords are a symbol of Japanese honour and esteem for hand-to-hand combat. They represent the idea that taking another&#x27;s life should be done with honour, and long-range combat (firearms) is a cowardly way to end another&#x27;s life. This also connects to the Japanese belief of self-sacrifice, warriors should be ready to lay down their lives for their nation (emperor).

There is a rich relationship between swords, Japanese culture, and societal development. The different interpretations of the origins of swords and their connection to the spirit world, each hold their own merit within Japanese society, past and present. Which one and how modern-day samurai interpret the history of swords, help influence the kind of samurai and warrior they choose to be.

==Manufacturing==

Japanese swords are generally made by a division of labor between six and eight craftsmen. &quot;Tosho&quot; (&quot;Toko&quot;, &quot;Katanakaji&quot;) is in charge of forging blades, &quot;togishi&quot; is in charge of polishing blades, &quot;kinkosi&quot; (&quot;chokinshi&quot;) is in charge of making metal fittings for sword fittings, &quot;shiroganeshi&quot; is in charge of making &quot;habaki&quot; (blade collar), &quot;sayashi&quot; is in charge of making scabbards, &quot;nurishi&quot; is in charge of applying lacquer to scabbards, &quot;tsukamakishi&quot; is in charge of making hilt, and &quot;tsubashi&quot; is in charge of making &quot;tsuba&quot; (hand guard). &quot;Tosho&quot; use apprentice swordsmiths as assistants. Prior to the Muromachi period, &quot;tosho&quot; and &quot;kacchushi&quot; (armorer) used surplus metal to make &quot;tsuba&quot;, but from the Muromachi period onwards, specialized craftsmen began to make &quot;tsuba&quot;. Nowadays, &quot;kinkoshi&quot; sometimes serves as &quot;shiroganeshi&quot; and &quot;tsubashi&quot;.

Typical features of Japanese swords represented by &quot;katana&quot; and &quot;tachi&quot; are a three-dimensional cross-sectional shape of an elongated pentagonal or hexagonal blade called &quot;shinogi-zukuri&quot;, a style in which the blade and the tang (&quot;nakago&quot;) are integrated and fixed to the hilt (&quot;tsuka&quot;) with a pin called &quot;mekugi&quot;, and a gentle curve.
When a &quot;shinogi-zukuri&quot; sword is viewed from the side, there is a ridge line of the thickest part of the blade called &quot;shinogi&quot; between the cutting edge side and the back side. This &quot;shinogi&quot; contributes to lightening and toughening of the blade and high cutting ability.

Japanese swords were often forged with different profiles, different blade thicknesses, and varying amounts of grind. &quot;Wakizashi&quot; and &quot;tantō&quot;, for instance, were not simply scaled-down versions of &quot;katana&quot;; they were often forged in a shape called &quot;hira-zukuri&quot;, in which the cross-sectional shape of the blade becomes an isosceles triangle.

The &quot;daishō&quot; was not always forged together. If a samurai was able to afford a &quot;daishō&quot;, it was often composed of whichever two swords could be conveniently acquired, sometimes by different smiths and in different styles. Even when a &quot;daishō&quot; contained a pair of blades by the same smith, they were not always forged as a pair or mounted as one. &quot;Daishō&quot; made as a pair, mounted as a pair, and owned/worn as a pair, are therefore uncommon and considered highly valuable, especially if they still retain their original mountings (as opposed to later mountings, even if the later mounts are made as a pair).

The forging of a Japanese blade typically took weeks or even months and was considered a sacred art. As with many complex endeavors, rather than a single craftsman, several artists were involved. There was a smith to forge the rough shape, often a second smith (apprentice) to fold the metal, a specialist polisher (called a &quot;togi&quot;) as well as the various artisans that made the &quot;koshirae&quot; (the various fittings used to decorate the finished blade and &quot;saya&quot; (sheath) including the &quot;tsuka&quot; (hilt), &quot;fuchi&quot; (collar), &quot;kashira&quot; (pommel), and &quot;tsuba&quot; (hand guard)). It is said that the sharpening and polishing process takes just as long as the forging of the blade itself.

The legitimate Japanese sword is made from Japanese steel &quot;Tamahagane&quot;. The most common lamination method the Japanese sword blade is formed from is a combination of two different steels: a harder outer jacket of steel wrapped around a softer inner core of steel. This creates a blade which has a hard, razor sharp cutting edge with the ability to absorb shock in a way which reduces the possibility of the blade breaking when used in combat. The &quot;hadagane&quot;, for the outer skin of the blade, is produced by heating a block of raw steel, which is then hammered out into a bar, and the flexible back portion. This is then cooled and broken up into smaller blocks which are checked for further impurities and then reassembled and reforged. During this process the billet of steel is heated and hammered, split and folded back upon itself many times and re-welded to create a complex structure of many thousands of layers. Each different steel is folded differently, to provide the necessary strength and flexibility to the different steels. The precise way in which the steel is folded, hammered and re-welded determines the distinctive grain pattern of the blade, the &quot;jihada&quot;, (also called &quot;jigane&quot; when referring to the actual surface of the steel blade) a feature which is indicative of the period, place of manufacture and actual maker of the blade. The practice of folding also ensures a somewhat more homogeneous product, with the carbon in the steel being evenly distributed and the steel having no voids that could lead to fractures and failure of the blade in combat.

The shingane (for the inner core of the blade) is of a relatively softer steel with a lower carbon content than the hadagane. For this, the block is again hammered, folded and welded in a similar fashion to the hadagane, but with fewer folds. At this point, the hadagane block is once again heated, hammered out and folded into a ‘U’ shape, into which the shingane is inserted to a point just short of the tip. The new composite steel billet is then heated and hammered out ensuring that no air or dirt is trapped between the two layers of steel. The bar increases in length during this process until it approximates the final size and shape of the finished sword blade. A triangular section is cut off from the tip of the bar and shaped to create what will be the kissaki. At this point in the process, the blank for the blade is of rectangular section. This rough shape is referred to as a .

The is again heated, section by section and hammered to create a shape which has many of the recognisable characteristics of the finished blade. These are a thick back (), a thinner edge (), a curved tip (), notches on the edge () and back () which separate the blade from the tang (). Details such as the ridge line () another distinctive characteristic of the Japanese sword, are added at this stage of the process. The smith&#x27;s skill at this point comes into play as the hammering process causes the blade to naturally curve in an erratic way, the thicker back tending to curve towards the thinner edge, and he must skillfully control the shape to give it the required upward curvature. The is finished by a process of filing and scraping which leaves all the physical characteristics and shapes of the blade recognisable. The surface of the blade is left in a relatively rough state, ready for the hardening processes. The is then covered all over with a clay mixture which is applied more thickly along the back and sides of the blade than along the edge. The blade is left to dry while the smith prepares the forge for the final heat treatment of the blade, the yaki-ire, the hardening of the cutting edge.

This process takes place in a darkened smithy, traditionally at night, so that the smith can judge by eye the colour and therefore the temperature of the sword as it is repeatedly passed through the glowing charcoal. When the time is deemed right (traditionally the blade should be the colour of the moon in February and August which are the two months that appear most commonly on dated inscriptions on the tang), the blade is plunged edge down and point forward into a tank of water. The precise time taken to heat the sword, the temperature of the blade and of the water into which it is plunged are all individual to each smith and they have generally been closely guarded secrets. Legend tells of a particular smith who cut off his apprentice&#x27;s hand for testing the temperature of the water he used for the hardening process. In the different schools of swordmakers there are many subtle variations in the materials used in the various processes and techniques outlined above, specifically in the form of clay applied to the blade prior to the yaki-ire, but all follow the same general procedures.
The application of the clay in different thicknesses to the blade allows the steel to cool more quickly along the thinner coated edge when plunged into the tank of water and thereby develop into the harder form of steel called martensite, which can be ground to razor-like sharpness. The thickly coated back cools more slowly retaining the pearlite steel characteristics of relative softness and flexibility. The precise way in which the clay is applied, and partially scraped off at the edge, is a determining factor in the formation of the shape and features of the crystalline structure known as the hamon. This distinctive tempering line found near the edge is one of the main characteristics to be assessed when examining a blade.
The martensitic steel which forms from the edge of the blade to the hamon is in effect the transition line between these two different forms of steel, and is where most of the shapes, colours and beauty in the steel of the Japanese sword are to be found. The variations in the form and structure of the hamon are all indicative of the period, smith, school or place of manufacture of the sword. As well as the aesthetic qualities of the hamon, there are, perhaps not unsurprisingly, real practical functions. The hardened edge is where most of any potential damage to the blade will occur in battle. This hardened edge is capable of being reground and sharpened many times, although the process will alter the shape of the blade. Altering the shape will allow more resistance when fighting in hand-to-hand combat.

Almost all blades are decorated, although not all blades are decorated on the visible part of the blade. Once the blade is cool, and the mud is scraped off, grooves and markings (hi or bo-hi) may be cut into it. One of the most important markings on the sword is performed here: the file markings. These are cut into the tang or the hilt-section of the blade, where they will be covered by the hilt later. The tang is never supposed to be cleaned; doing this can reduce the value of the sword by half or more. The purpose is to show how well the steel ages.

Some other marks on the blade are aesthetic: dedications written in Kanji characters as well as engravings called &quot;horimono&quot; depicting gods, dragons, or other acceptable beings. Some are more practical. The presence of a groove (the most basic type is called a &quot;hi&quot;) reduces the weight of the sword yet keeps its structural integrity and strength.

==Use==

The &quot;tachi&quot; became the primary weapon on the battlefield during the Kamakura period, used by cavalry. The sword was mostly considered as a secondary weapon until then, used in the battlefield only after the bow and polearm were no longer feasible. During the Edo period samurai went about on foot unarmored, and with much less combat being fought on horseback in open battlefields the need for an effective close quarter weapon resulted in samurai being armed with daishō.

Testing of swords, called &quot;tameshigiri&quot;, was practiced on a variety of materials (often the bodies of executed criminals) to test the sword&#x27;s sharpness and practice cutting techniques.

&quot;Kenjutsu&quot; is the Japanese martial art of using the Japanese swords in combat. The Japanese swords are primarily a cutting weapon, or more specifically, a slicing one. Its moderate curve, however, allowed for effective thrusting as well. The hilt was held with two hands, though a fair amount of one-handed techniques exist. The placement of the right hand was dictated by both the length of the handle and the length of the wielder&#x27;s arm. Two other martial arts were developed specifically for training to draw the sword and attack in one motion. They are &quot;battōjutsu&quot; and &quot;iaijutsu&quot;, which are superficially similar, but do generally differ in training theory and methods.

For cutting, there was a specific technique called &quot;&quot;ten-uchi&quot;.&quot; &quot;Ten-uchi&quot; refers to an organized motion made by arms and wrist, during a descending strike. As the sword is swung downward, the elbow joint drastically extends at the last instant, popping the sword into place. This motion causes the swordsman&#x27;s grip to twist slightly and if done correctly, is said to feel like wringing a towel (Thomas Hooper reference). This motion itself caused the sword&#x27;s blade to impact its target with sharp force, and is used to break initial resistance. From there, fluidly continuing along the motion wrought by &quot;ten-uchi&quot;, the arms would follow through with the stroke, dragging the sword through its target. Because the Japanese swords slices rather than chops, it is this &quot;dragging&quot; which allows it to do maximum damage, and is thus incorporated into the cutting technique. At full speed, the swing will appear to be full stroke, the sword passing through the targeted object. The segments of the swing are hardly visible, if at all. Assuming that the target is, for example, a human torso, &quot;ten-uchi&quot; will break the initial resistance supplied by shoulder muscles and the clavicle. The follow through would continue the slicing motion, through whatever else it would encounter, until the blade inherently exited the body, due to a combination of the motion and its curved shape.

Nearly all styles of &quot;kenjutsu&quot; share the same five basic guard postures. They are as follows; &quot;chūdan-no-kamae&quot; (middle posture), &quot;jōdan-no-kamae&quot; (high posture), &quot;gedan-no-kamae&quot; (low posture), &quot;hassō-no-kamae&quot; (eight-sided posture), and &quot;waki-gamae&quot; (side posture).

The Japanese swords razor-edge was so hard that upon hitting an equally hard or harder object, such as another sword&#x27;s edge, chipping became a definite risk. As such, blocking an oncoming blow blade-to-blade was generally avoided. In fact, evasive body maneuvers were preferred over blade contact by most, but, if such was not possible, the flat or the back of the blade was used for defense in many styles, rather than the precious edge. A popular method for defeating descending slashes was to simply beat the sword aside. In some instances, an &quot;umbrella block&quot;, positioning the blade overhead, diagonally (point towards the ground, pommel towards the sky), would create an effective shield against a descending strike. If the angle of the block was drastic enough, the curve of the Japanese swords blade would cause the attacker&#x27;s blade to slide along its counter and off to the side.

=== Carrying ===
Japanese swords were carried in several different ways, varying throughout Japanese history. The style most commonly seen in &quot;samurai&quot; movies is called &quot;buke-zukuri&quot;, with the katana (and &quot;wakizashi&quot;, if also present) carried edge up, with the sheath thrust through the &quot;obi&quot; (sash).

The sword would be carried in a sheath and tucked into the samurai&#x27;s belt. Originally, they would carry the sword with the blade turned down. This was a more comfortable way for the armored samurai to carry his very long sword or to draw while mounted. The bulk of the samurai armor made it difficult to draw the sword from any other place on his body. When unarmored, samurai would carry their sword with the blade facing up. This made it possible to draw the sword and strike in one quick motion. In one such method of drawing the sword, the samurai would turn the sheath downward ninety degrees and pull it out of his sash just a bit with his left hand, then gripping the hilt with his right hand he would slide it out while sliding the sheath back to its original position.
== Appreciation ==

Historically, Japanese swords have been regarded not only as weapons but also as works of art, especially for high-quality ones. For a long time, Japanese people have developed a unique appreciation method in which the blade is regarded as the core of their aesthetic evaluation rather than the sword mountings decorated with luxurious lacquer or metal works.

It is said that the following three objects are the most noteworthy objects when appreciating a blade. The first is the overall shape referred to as &quot;sugata&quot;. Curvature, length, width, tip, and shape of tang of the sword are the objects for appreciation. The second is a fine pattern on the surface of the blade, which is referred to as &quot;hada&quot; or &quot;jigane&quot;. By repeatedly folding and forging the blade, fine patterns such as fingerprints, tree rings and bark are formed on its surface. The third is &quot;hamon&quot;. It is a fuzzy line in the white pattern of the cutting edge produced by quenching and tempering. It does not refer to the white area on the side of the blade. The white part is the part that is whitened by a polishing process called &quot;hadori&quot; to make it easier to see the &quot;hamon&quot;, and the actual &quot;hamon&quot; is a fuzzy line within the white part. The actual line of the &quot;hamon&quot; can be seen by holding the sword in your hand and looking at it while changing the angle of the light shining on the blade. The object of appreciation is the shape of hammon and the crystal particles formed at the boundary of hammon. Depending on the size of the particles, they can be divided into two types, a &quot;nie&quot; and a &quot;nioi&quot;, which makes them look like stars or mist. In addition to these three objects, a swordsmith signature and a file pattern engraved on tang, and a carving inscribed on the blade, which is referred to as &quot;horimono&quot;, are also the objects of appreciation.
The Hon&#x27;ami clan, which was an authority of appraisal of Japanese swords, rated Japanese swords from these artistic points of view. In addition, experts of modern Japanese swords judge when and by which swordsmith school the sword was made from these artistic points of view.

Generally, the blade and the sword mounting of Japanese swords are displayed separately in museums, and this tendency is remarkable in Japan. For example, the Nagoya Japanese Sword Museum &quot;Nagoya Touken World&quot;, one of Japan&#x27;s largest sword museums, posts separate videos of the blade and the sword mounting on its official website and YouTube.
== Rating of Japanese swords and swordsmiths ==
In Japan, Japanese swords are rated by authorities of each period, and some of the authority of the rating is still valid today.

In 1719, Tokugawa Yoshimune, the 8th shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate, ordered Hon&#x27;ami Kōchū, who was an authority of sword appraisal, to record swords possessed by &quot;daimyo&quot; all over Japan in books. In the completed &quot;&quot;Kyōhō Meibutsu Chō&quot; (享保名物帳) 249 precious swords were described, and additional 25 swords were described later. The list also includes 81 swords that had been destroyed in previous fires. The precious swords described in this book were called &quot;Meibutsu&quot;&quot; (名物) and the criteria for selection were artistic elements, origins and legends. The list of &quot;Meibutsu&quot; includes 59 swords made by Masamune, 34 by Awataguchi Yoshimitsu and 22 by Go Yoshihiro, and these 3 swordsmiths were considered special. &quot;Daimyo&quot; hid some swords for fear that they would be confiscated by the Tokugawa Shogunate, so even some precious swords were not listed in the book. For example, &quot;Daihannya Nagamitsu&quot; and &quot;Yamatorige&quot;, which are now designated as National Treasures, were not listed.
Yamada Asaemon V, who was the official sword cutting ability examiner and executioner of the Tokugawa shogunate, published a book, &quot;Kaiho Kenjaku&quot; (懐宝剣尺), in 1797 in which he ranked the cutting ability of swords. The book lists 228 swordsmiths, whose forged swords are called &quot;&quot;Wazamono&quot; (業物) and the highest &quot;Saijo Ō Wazamono&quot; (最上大業物) has 12 selected. In the reprinting in 1805, 1 swordsmith was added to the highest grade, and in the major revised edition in 1830 &quot;Kokon Kajibiko&quot; (古今鍛冶備考), two swordsmiths were added to the highest grade, and in the end, 15 swordsmiths were ranked as the highest grade. The &quot;katana&quot; forged by Nagasone Kotetsu, one of the top-rated swordsmiths, became very popular at the time when the book was published, and many counterfeits were made. In these books, the three swordsmiths treated specially in &quot;Kyōhō Meibutsu Chō&quot;&quot; and Muramasa, who was famous at that time for forging swords with high cutting ability, were not mentioned. The reasons for this are considered to be that Yamada was afraid of challenging the authority of the shogun, that he could not use the precious sword possessed by the daimyo in the examination, and that he was considerate of the legend of Muramasa&#x27;s curse.
At present, by the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, important swords of high historical value are designated as Important Cultural Properties (&quot;Jūyō Bunkazai&quot;, 重要文化財), and special swords among them are designated as National Treasures (&quot;Kokuhō&quot;, 国宝). The swords designated as cultural properties based on the law of 1930, which was already abolished, have the rank next to Important Cultural Properties as Important Art Object (&quot;Jūyō Bijutsuhin&quot;, 重要美術品). In addition, the Society for Preservation of Japanese Art Swords, a public interest incorporated foundation, rates high-value swords in four grades, and the highest grade Special Important Sword (&quot;Tokubetsu Juyo Token&quot;, 特別重要刀剣) is considered to be equivalent to the value of Important Art Object. Although swords owned by the Japanese imperial family are not designated as National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties because they are outside the jurisdiction of the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, there are many swords of the National Treasure class, and they are called &quot;Gyobutsu&quot; (御物).

Currently, there are several authoritative rating systems for swordsmiths. According to the rating approved by the Japanese government, from 1890 to 1947, two swordsmiths who were appointed as Imperial Household Artist and after 1955, six swordsmiths who were designated as Living National Treasure are regarded as the best swordsmiths. According to the rating approved by the Society for Preservation of Japanese Art Swords, a public interest incorporated foundation, 39 swordsmiths who were designated as &quot;Mukansa&quot; (無鑑査) since 1958 are considered to be the highest-ranking swordsmiths. The best sword forged by Japanese swordsmiths is awarded the most honorable Masamune prize by the Society for Preservation of Japanese Art Swords. Since 1961, eight swordsmiths have received the Masamune Prize, and among them, three swordsmiths, Masamine Sumitani, Akitsugu Amata and Toshihira Osumi, have received the prize three times each and Sadakazu Gassan II has received the prize two times. These four persons were designated both Living National Treasures and &quot;Mukansa&quot;.

<text>Kurt Vonnegut ( ; November 11, 1922 – April 11, 2007) was an American author known for his satirical and darkly humorous novels. His published work includes fourteen novels, three short-story collections, five plays, and five nonfiction works over fifty-plus years; further works have been published since his death.

Born and raised in Indianapolis, Vonnegut attended Cornell University, but withdrew in January 1943 and enlisted in the U.S. Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden, where he survived the Allied bombing of the city in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, he married Jane Marie Cox. He and his wife both attended the University of Chicago while he worked as a night reporter for the City News Bureau.

Vonnegut published his first novel, &quot;Player Piano&quot;, in 1952. It received positive reviews yet sold poorly. In the nearly 20 years that followed, several well regarded novels were published, including &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959) and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1963), both of which were nominated for the Hugo Award for best science fiction or fantasy novel of the year. His short-story collection, &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House,&quot; was published in 1968. 

Vonnegut&#x27;s breakthrough was his commercially and critically successful sixth novel, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1969). Its anti-war sentiment resonated with its readers amid the Vietnam War, and its reviews were generally positive. It rose to the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and made Vonnegut famous. Later in his career, Vonnegut published autobiographical essays and short-story collections such as &quot;Fates Worse Than Death&quot; (1991) and &quot;A Man Without a Country&quot; (2005). He has been hailed for his darkly humorous commentary on American society. His son Mark published a compilation of his work, &quot;Armageddon in Retrospect&quot;, in 2008. In 2017, Seven Stories Press published &quot;Complete Stories&quot;, a collection of Vonnegut&#x27;s short fiction.

== Biography ==
=== Family and early life ===
Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis, on November 11, 1922, the youngest of three children of Kurt Vonnegut Sr. (1884–1956) and his wife Edith (1888–1944; née Lieber). His older siblings were Bernard (1914–1997) and Alice (1917–1958). He descended from a long line of German Americans whose immigrant ancestors settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his paternal great-grandfather, Clemens Vonnegut, settled in Indianapolis and founded the Vonnegut Hardware Company. His father and grandfather Bernard were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt Sr. designed such buildings as Das Deutsche Haus (now called &quot;The Athenæum&quot;), the Indiana headquarters of the Bell Telephone Company, and the Fletcher Trust Building. Vonnegut&#x27;s mother was born into Indianapolis&#x27;s Gilded Age high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city based on a fortune deriving from a successful brewery.

Both of Vonnegut&#x27;s parents were fluent speakers of the German language, but pervasive anti-German sentiment during and after World War I caused them to abandon German culture; many German Americans were told at the time that this was a precondition for American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach Vonnegut to speak German or introduce him to German literature, cuisine, or traditions, leaving him feeling &quot;ignorant and rootless&quot;. Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family&#x27;s African-American cook and housekeeper during the first decade of his life, for raising him and giving him values; he said, &quot;she gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me&quot;, and &quot;was as great an influence on me as anybody&quot;. He described her as &quot;humane and wise&quot; and added that &quot;the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs&quot; came from her.

The financial security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts had once enjoyed were destroyed in a matter of years. The Liebers&#x27; brewery closed down in 1921 after the advent of prohibition. When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.&#x27;s architectural firm to become scarce. Vonnegut&#x27;s brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed in a public school called Public School No. 43 (now the James Whitcomb Riley School). He was bothered by the Great Depression, and both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a &quot;dreamy artist&quot;. His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family&#x27;s wealth and status, and Vonnegut said that she expressed hatred for her husband that was &quot;as corrosive as hydrochloric acid&quot;. She often tried in vain to sell short stories she had written to &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and other magazines.

=== High school and Cornell University ===

Vonnegut enrolled at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in 1936. While there, he played clarinet in the school band and became a co-editor (along with Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, &quot;The Shortridge Echo&quot;. Vonnegut said that his tenure with the &quot;Echo&quot; allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience, he said, was &quot;fun and easy&quot;. &quot;It just turned out that I could write better than a lot of other people&quot;, Vonnegut observed. &quot;Each person has something he can do easily and can&#x27;t imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it.&quot;

After graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut enrolled at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He wanted to study the humanities and had aspirations of becoming an architect like his father, but his father and brother Bernard, an atmospheric scientist, urged him to study a &quot;useful&quot; discipline. As a result, Vonnegut majored in biochemistry, but he had little proficiency in the area and was indifferent towards his studies. As his father had been a member at MIT, Vonnegut was entitled to join the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and did. He overcame stiff competition for a place at the university&#x27;s independent newspaper, &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot;, first serving as a staff writer, then as an editor. By the end of his first year, he was writing a column titled &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot;, which reused jokes from other publications. He later penned a piece &quot;Well All Right&quot; focusing on pacifism, a cause he strongly supported, arguing against US intervention in World War II.

===World War II===

The attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into WWII. Vonnegut was a member of Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, but poor grades and a satirical article in Cornell&#x27;s newspaper cost him his place there. He was placed on academic probation in May 1942 and dropped out the following January. No longer eligible for a deferment as a member of ROTC, he faced likely conscription into the U.S. Army. Instead of waiting to be drafted, he enlisted in the Army and in March 1943 reported to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, for basic training. Vonnegut was trained to fire and maintain howitzers and later received instruction in mechanical engineering at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the University of Tennessee as part of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP).

In early 1944, the ASTP was canceled due to the Army&#x27;s need for soldiers to support the D-Day invasion, and Vonnegut was ordered to an infantry battalion at Camp Atterbury, south of Indianapolis in Edinburgh, Indiana, where he trained as a scout. He lived so close to his home that he was &quot;able to sleep in [his] own bedroom and use the family car on weekends&quot;.

On May 14, 1944, Vonnegut returned home on leave for Mother&#x27;s Day weekend to discover that his mother had committed suicide the previous night by overdosing on sleeping pills. Possible factors that contributed to Edith Vonnegut&#x27;s suicide include the family&#x27;s loss of wealth and status, Vonnegut&#x27;s forthcoming deployment overseas, and her own lack of success as a writer. She was inebriated at the time and under the influence of prescription drugs.

Three months after his mother&#x27;s suicide, Vonnegut was sent to Europe as an intelligence scout with the 106th Infantry Division. In December 1944, he fought in the Battle of the Bulge, one of the last German offensives of the war. On December 22, Vonnegut was captured with about 50 other American soldiers. Vonnegut was taken by boxcar to a prison camp south of Dresden, in the German province of Saxony. During the journey, the Royal Air Force mistakenly attacked the trains carrying Vonnegut and his fellow prisoners of war, killing about 150 of them. Vonnegut was sent to Dresden, the &quot;first fancy city [he had] ever seen&quot;. He lived in a slaughterhouse when he got to the city, and worked in a factory that made malt syrup for pregnant women. Vonnegut recalled the sirens going off whenever another city was bombed. The Germans did not expect Dresden to be bombed, Vonnegut said. &quot;There were very few air-raid shelters in town and no war industries, just cigarette factories, hospitals, clarinet factories.&quot;
On February 13, 1945, Dresden became the target of Allied forces. In the hours and days that followed, the Allies engaged in a firebombing of the city. The offensive subsided on February 15, with about 25,000 civilians killed in the bombing. Vonnegut marveled at the level of both the destruction in Dresden and the secrecy that attended it. He had survived by taking refuge in a meat locker three stories underground. &quot;It was cool there, with cadavers hanging all around&quot;, Vonnegut said. &quot;When we came up the city was gone ... They burnt the whole damn town down.&quot; Vonnegut and other American prisoners were put to work immediately after the bombing, excavating bodies from the rubble. He described the activity as a &quot;terribly elaborate Easter-egg hunt&quot;.

The American POWs were evacuated on foot to the border of Saxony and Czechoslovakia after U.S. General George S. Patton&#x27;s 3rd Army captured Leipzig. With the captives abandoned by their guards, Vonnegut reached a prisoner-of-war repatriation camp in Le Havre, France, in May 1945, with the aid of the Soviets. Sent back to the United States, he was stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, typing discharge papers for other soldiers. Soon after, he was awarded a Purple Heart, about which he remarked: &quot;I myself was awarded my country&#x27;s second-lowest decoration, a Purple Heart for frost-bite.&quot; He was discharged from the U.S. Army and returned to Indianapolis.

=== Marriage, University of Chicago, and early employment ===
After he returned to the United States, 22-year-old Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, his high-school girlfriend and classmate since kindergarten, on September 1, 1945. The pair moved to Chicago; there, Vonnegut enrolled in the University of Chicago on the G.I. Bill, as an anthropology student in an unusual five-year joint undergraduate/graduate program that conferred a master&#x27;s degree. There, he studied under anthropologist Robert Redfield, his &quot;most famous professor&quot;. He also worked as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago.

Jane, who had graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore, accepted a scholarship from the university to study Russian literature as a graduate student. Jane dropped out of the program after becoming pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child, Mark (born May 1947), while Kurt also left the university without any degree (despite having completed his undergraduate education). Vonnegut failed to write a dissertation, as his ideas had all been rejected. One abandoned topic was about the Ghost Dance and Cubist movements. A later topic, rejected &quot;unanimously&quot;, had to do with the shapes of stories. Vonnegut received his graduate degree in anthropology 25 years after he left, when the university accepted his novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; in lieu of his master&#x27;s thesis.

Shortly thereafter, General Electric (GE) hired Vonnegut as a technical writer, then publicist, for the company&#x27;s Schenectady, New York, News Bureau, a publicity department that operated like a newsroom. His brother Bernard had worked at GE since 1945, focusing mainly on a silver-iodide-based cloud seeding project that quickly became a joint GE–U.S. Army Signal Corps program, Project Cirrus. In &quot;The Brothers Vonnegut&quot;, Ginger Strand draws connections between many real events at General Electric, including Bernard&#x27;s work, and Vonnegut&#x27;s early stories, which were regularly being rejected everywhere he sent them. Throughout this period, Jane Vonnegut encouraged him, editing his stories, strategizing about submissions and buoying his spirits.

In 1949, Kurt and Jane had a daughter named Edith. Still working for GE, Vonnegut had his first piece, titled &quot;Report on the Barnhouse Effect&quot;, published in the February 11, 1950, issue of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, for which he received $750. The story concerned a scientist who fears that his invention will be used as a weapon, much as Bernard was fearing at the time about his cloudseeding work. Vonnegut wrote another story, after being coached by the fiction editor at &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, Knox Burger, and again sold it to the magazine, this time for $950. While Burger supported Vonnegut&#x27;s writing, he was shocked when Vonnegut quit GE as of January 1, 1951, later stating: &quot;I never said he should give up his job and devote himself to fiction. I don&#x27;t trust the freelancer&#x27;s life, it&#x27;s tough.&quot; Nevertheless, in early 1951 Vonnegut moved with his family to Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to write full time, leaving GE behind. He initially moved to Osterville, but he ended up purchasing a home in Barnstable.

=== First novel ===
In 1952, Vonnegut&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Player Piano&quot;, was published by Scribner&#x27;s. The novel has a post-World War III setting, in which factory workers have been replaced by machines. &quot;Player Piano&quot; draws upon Vonnegut&#x27;s experience as an employee at GE. The novel is set at a General Electric-like company and includes many scenes based on things Vonnegut saw there. He satirizes the drive to climb the corporate ladder, one that in &quot;Player Piano&quot; is rapidly disappearing as automation increases, putting even executives out of work. His central character, Paul Proteus, has an ambitious wife, a backstabbing assistant, and a feeling of empathy for the poor. Sent by his boss, Kroner, as a double agent among the poor (who have all the material goods they want, but little sense of purpose), he leads them in a machine-smashing, museum-burning revolution. &quot;Player Piano&quot; expresses Vonnegut&#x27;s opposition to McCarthyism, something made clear when the Ghost Shirts, the revolutionary organization Paul penetrates and eventually leads, is referred to by one character as &quot;fellow travelers&quot;.

In &quot;Player Piano&quot;, Vonnegut originates many of the techniques he would use in his later works. The comic, heavy-drinking Shah of Bratpuhr, an outsider to this dystopian corporate United States, is able to ask many questions that an insider would not think to ask, or would cause offense by doing so. For example, when taken to see the artificially intelligent supercomputer EPICAC, the Shah asks it &quot;what are people for?&quot; and receives no answer. Speaking for Vonnegut, he dismisses it as a &quot;false god&quot;. This type of alien visitor would recur throughout Vonnegut&#x27;s later novels.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writer and critic Granville Hicks gave &quot;Player Piano&quot; a positive review, favorably comparing it to Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Hicks called Vonnegut a &quot;sharp-eyed satirist&quot;. None of the reviewers considered the novel particularly important. Several editions were printed—one by Bantam with the title &quot;Utopia 14&quot;, and another by the Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club—whereby Vonnegut gained the reputation as a writer of science fiction, a genre held in disdain by writers at that time. He defended the genre and deplored a perceived sentiment that &quot;no one can simultaneously be a respectable writer and understand how a refrigerator works&quot;.

=== Struggling writer ===

After &quot;Player Piano&quot;, Vonnegut continued to sell short stories to various magazines. Contracted to produce a second novel (which eventually became &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;), he struggled to complete it, and the work languished for years. In 1954, the couple had a third child, Nanette. With a growing family and no financially successful novels yet, Vonnegut&#x27;s short stories helped to sustain the family, though he frequently needed to find additional sources of income. In 1957, he and a partner opened a Saab automobile dealership on Cape Cod, but it went bankrupt by the end of the year. He designed a World War II–themed board game called &quot;GHQ&quot; (General Headquarters), but publishers did not buy it.

In 1958, his sister, Alice, died of cancer two days after her husband, James Carmalt Adams, was killed in a train accident. The Vonneguts took in three of the Adams&#x27; young sons—James, Steven, and Kurt, aged 14, 11, and 9, respectively. A fourth Adams son, Peter (2), also stayed with the Vonneguts for about a year before being given to the care of a paternal relative in Georgia.

Grappling with family challenges, Vonnegut continued to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar in terms of plot. He also wrote Harrison Bergeron.

&quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Niles Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp that causes him to appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach&#x27;s opera &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;.

Rumfoord, who is based on Franklin D. Roosevelt, also physically resembles the former president. Rumfoord is described this way: he &quot;put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up.&quot; William Rodney Allen, in his guide to Vonnegut&#x27;s works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; and &quot;Jailbird&quot;.

&quot;Mother Night&quot;, published in 1961, received little attention at the time of its publication. Howard W. Campbell Jr., Vonnegut&#x27;s protagonist, is an American who is raised in Germany from age 11 and joins the Nazi Party during the war as a double agent for the US Office of Strategic Services, rising to the regime&#x27;s highest ranks as a radio propagandist. After the war, the spy agency refuses to clear his name, and he is eventually imprisoned by the Israelis in the same cell block as Adolf Eichmann. Vonnegut wrote in a foreword to a later edition: &quot;we are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be&quot;. Literary critic Lawrence Berkove considered the novel, like Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, to illustrate the tendency for &quot;impersonators to get carried away by their impersonations, to become what they impersonate and therefore to live in a world of illusion&quot;.

Also published in 1961 was Vonnegut&#x27;s short story &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, set in a dystopic future where all are equal, even if that means disfiguring beautiful people and forcing the strong or intelligent to wear devices that negate their advantages. Fourteen-year-old Harrison is a genius and athlete forced to wear record-level &quot;handicaps&quot; and imprisoned for attempting to overthrow the government. He escapes to a television studio, tears away his handicaps, and frees a ballerina from her lead weights. As they dance, they are killed by the Handicapper General, Diana Moon Glampers. Vonnegut, in a later letter, suggested that &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; might have sprung from his envy and self-pity as a high-school misfit. In his 1976 biography of Vonnegut, Stanley Schatt suggested that the short story shows &quot;in any leveling process, what really is lost, according to Vonnegut, is beauty, grace, and wisdom&quot;. Darryl Hattenhauer, in his 1998 journal article on &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, theorized that the story was a satire on American Cold War understandings of communism and socialism.

With &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; (1963), Allen wrote, &quot;Vonnegut hit full stride for the first time&quot;. The narrator, John, intends to write of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the fictional fathers of the atomic bomb, seeking to cover the scientist&#x27;s human side. Hoenikker, in addition to the bomb, has developed another threat to mankind, &quot;ice-nine&quot;, solid water stable at room temperature, but more dense than liquid water. If a particle of ice-nine is dropped in water, all of the surrounding water becomes ice-nine. Felix Hoenikker is based on Bernard Vonnegut&#x27;s boss at the GE Research Lab, Irving Langmuir, and the way ice-nine is described in the novel is reminiscent of how Bernard Vonnegut explained his own invention, silver-iodide cloudseeding, to Kurt. Much of the second half of the book is spent on the fictional Caribbean island of San Lorenzo, where John explores a religion called Bokononism, whose holy books (excerpts from which are quoted) give the novel the moral core science does not supply. After the oceans are converted to ice-nine, wiping out most of humankind, John wanders the frozen surface, seeking to save himself and to make sure that his story survives.

Vonnegut based the title character of &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; (1964) on an accountant he knew in Cape Cod who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a volunteer fire department and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs. Allen deemed &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; more &quot;a cry from the heart than a novel under its author&#x27;s full intellectual control&quot;, that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.

In the mid-1960s, Vonnegut contemplated abandoning his writing career. In 1999, he wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I had gone broke, was out of print and had a lot of kids...&quot; But then, on the recommendation of an admirer, he received a surprise offer of a teaching job at the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, employment that he likened to the rescue of a drowning man.

=== &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; ===
After spending almost two years at the writer&#x27;s workshop at the University of Iowa, teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he was becoming a well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins.

Vonnegut had been writing about his war experiences at Dresden ever since he returned from the war, but unable to write anything that was acceptable to himself or his publishers; chapter one of &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; tells of his difficulties. Released in 1969, the novel rocketed Vonnegut to fame. It tells of the life of Billy Pilgrim, who like Vonnegut was born in 1922 and survives the bombing of Dresden. The story is told in a non-linear fashion, with many of the story&#x27;s climaxes—Billy&#x27;s death in 1976, his kidnapping by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore nine years earlier, and the execution of Billy&#x27;s friend Edgar Derby in the ashes of Dresden for stealing a teapot—disclosed in the story&#x27;s first pages. In 1970, Vonnegut was also a correspondent in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War.

&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; received generally positive reviews, with Michael Crichton writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;:
he writes about the most excruciatingly painful things. His novels have attacked our deepest fears of automation and the bomb, our deepest political guilts, our fiercest hatreds and loves. No one else writes books on these subjects; they are inaccessible to normal novelists.

The book went immediately to the top of &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Vonnegut&#x27;s earlier works had appealed strongly to many college students, and the antiwar message of &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; resonated with a generation marked by the Vietnam War. He later stated that the loss of confidence in government that Vietnam caused finally allowed an honest conversation regarding events like Dresden.

=== Later life ===

After &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; was published, Vonnegut embraced the fame and financial security that attended its release. He was hailed as a hero of the burgeoning anti-war movement in the United States, was invited to speak at numerous rallies, and gave college commencement addresses around the country. In addition to briefly teaching at Harvard University as a lecturer in creative writing in 1970, Vonnegut taught at the City College of New York as a distinguished professor during the 1973–1974 academic year. He was later elected vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and given honorary degrees by, among others, Indiana University and Bennington College. Vonnegut also wrote a play called &quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot;, which opened on October 7, 1970, at New York&#x27;s Theatre de Lys. Receiving mixed reviews, it closed on March 14, 1971. In 1972, Universal Pictures adapted &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; into a film, which the author said was &quot;flawless&quot;.

Vonnegut&#x27;s difficulties in his personal life thereafter materialized in numerous ways, including the painfully slow progress made on his next novel, the darkly comical &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;. In 1971, he stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak&#x27;s book &quot;American Literature on Stage and Screen&quot;, &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; was called &quot;funny and outlandish&quot;, but reviewers noted that it &quot;lacks substance and seems to be an exercise in literary playfulness&quot;. Vonnegut&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;Slapstick&quot;, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27;s review of &quot;Slapstick&quot;, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said that Vonnegut &quot;seems to be putting less effort into [storytelling] than ever before&quot; and that &quot;it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all&quot;. At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors&#x27; complaints.

In subsequent years, his popularity resurged as he published several satirical books, including &quot;Jailbird&quot; (1979), &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot; (1982), &quot;Galápagos&quot; (1985), &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1987), and &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1990). Although he remained a prolific writer in the 1980s, Vonnegut struggled with depression and attempted suicide in 1984. Two years later, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in Rodney Dangerfield&#x27;s film &quot;Back to School&quot;. The last of Vonnegut&#x27;s fourteen novels, &quot;Timequake&quot; (1997), was, as University of Detroit history professor and Vonnegut biographer Gregory Sumner said, &quot;a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency&quot;. Vonnegut&#x27;s final book, a collection of essays entitled &quot;A Man Without a Country&quot; (2005), became a bestseller.

==Personal life==
Vonnegut married his first wife, Jane Marie Cox, in 1945. She later embraced Christianity, which was contrary to Vonnegut&#x27;s atheistic beliefs, and after five of their six children having left home, Vonnegut said that the two were forced to find &quot;other sorts of seemingly important work to do&quot;. The couple battled over their differing beliefs until Vonnegut moved from their Cape Cod home to New York in 1971. Vonnegut called the disagreements &quot;painful&quot; and said that the resulting split was a &quot;terrible, unavoidable accident that we were ill-equipped to understand&quot;. The couple divorced but remained friends until Jane&#x27;s death in late 1986. 

Beyond his failed marriage, Vonnegut was deeply affected when his son Mark suffered a mental breakdown in 1972, which exacerbated Vonnegut&#x27;s chronic depression and led him to take Ritalin. When he stopped taking the drug in the mid-1970s, he began to see a psychologist weekly.

In 1979, Vonnegut married Jill Krementz, a photographer whom he met while she was working on a series about writers in the early 1970s. With Jill, he adopted a daughter, Lily, when the baby was three days old. They remained married until his death.

== Death and legacy ==

In a 2006 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Vonnegut sardonically stated that he would sue the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company, the maker of the Pall Mall-branded cigarettes he had been smoking since he was around 12 or 14 years old, for false advertising: &quot;And do you know why? Because I&#x27;m 83 years old. The lying bastards! On the package Brown &amp; Williamson promised to kill me.&quot;

Vonnegut died in Manhattan on the night of April 11, 2007, as a result of brain injuries incurred several weeks prior, from a fall at his brownstone home. His death was reported by his wife Jill. He was 84 years old. At the time of his death, he had written fourteen novels, three short-story collections, five plays, and five nonfiction books. A book composed of his unpublished pieces, &quot;Armageddon in Retrospect&quot;, was compiled and posthumously published by his son Mark in 2008.

When asked about the impact Vonnegut had on his work, author Josip Novakovich stated that he has &quot;much to learn from Vonnegut—how to compress things and yet not compromise them, how to digress into history, quote from various historical accounts, and not stifle the narrative. The ease with which he writes is sheerly masterly, Mozartian.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Gregory Rodriguez said that the author will &quot;rightly be remembered as a darkly humorous social critic and the premier novelist of the counterculture&quot;, and Dinitia Smith of &quot;The New York Times&quot; dubbed Vonnegut the &quot;counterculture&#x27;s novelist&quot;.

Vonnegut has inspired numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library was opened in Vonnegut&#x27;s hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published a compendium of Vonnegut&#x27;s compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies: Gregory Sumner&#x27;s &quot;Unstuck in Time&quot; and Charles J. Shields&#x27;s &quot;And So It Goes&quot;. Shields&#x27;s biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. &quot;Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes&quot;, said &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;″s Wendy Smith. &quot;Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose&quot;, said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.

Vonnegut&#x27;s works have evoked ire on several occasions. His most prominent novel, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, has been objected to or removed at various institutions in at least 18 instances. In the case of &quot;Island Trees School District v. Pico&quot;, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a school district&#x27;s ban on &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;—which the board had called &quot;anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy&quot;—and eight other novels was unconstitutional. When a school board in Republic, Missouri, decided to withdraw Vonnegut&#x27;s novel from its libraries, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library offered a free copy to all the students of the district.

Tally, writing in 2013, suggests that Vonnegut has only recently become the subject of serious study rather than fan adulation, and much is yet to be written about him. &quot;The time for scholars to say &#x27;Here&#x27;s why Vonnegut is worth reading&#x27; has definitively ended, thank goodness. We know he&#x27;s worth reading. Now tell us things we don&#x27;t know.&quot; Todd F. Davis notes that Vonnegut&#x27;s work is kept alive by his loyal readers, who have &quot;significant influence as they continue to purchase Vonnegut&#x27;s work, passing it on to subsequent generations and keeping his entire canon in print—an impressive list of more than twenty books that [Dell Publishing] has continued to refurbish and hawk with new cover designs.&quot; Donald E. Morse notes that Vonnegut &quot;is now firmly, if somewhat controversially, ensconced in the American and world literary canon as well as in high school, college and graduate curricula&quot;. Tally writes of Vonnegut&#x27;s work:


The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Vonnegut posthumously in 2015. The asteroid 25399 Vonnegut is named in his honor. A crater on the planet Mercury has also been named in his honor. In 2021, the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library in Indianapolis was designated a Literary Landmark by the Literary Landmarks Association. In 1986, the University of Evansville library located in Evansville, Indiana, was named after Vonnegut, where he spoke during the dedication ceremony.

== Views ==
=== War ===
In the introduction to &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, Vonnegut recounts meeting the film producer Harrison Starr at a party, who asked him whether his forthcoming book was an anti-war novel—&quot;Yes, I guess&quot;, replied Vonnegut. Starr responded: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you write an anti-glacier novel?&quot; In the novel, Vonnegut&#x27;s character continues: &quot;What he meant, of course, is that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers. I believe that, too. And even if wars didn&#x27;t keep coming like glaciers, there would still be plain old death&quot;. Vonnegut was a pacifist.
In 2011, NPR wrote: &quot;Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s blend of anti-war sentiment and satire made him one of the most popular writers of the 1960s.&quot; Vonnegut stated in a 1987 interview: &quot;my own feeling is that civilization ended in World War I, and we&#x27;re still trying to recover from that&quot;, and that he wanted to write war-focused works without glamorizing war itself. Vonnegut had not intended to publish again, but his anger against the George W. Bush administration led him to write &quot;A Man Without a Country&quot;.

&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is the Vonnegut novel best known for its antiwar themes, but the author expressed his beliefs in ways beyond the depiction of the destruction of Dresden. One character, Mary O&#x27;Hare, opines that &quot;wars were partly encouraged by books and movies&quot;, starring &quot;Frank Sinatra or John Wayne or some of those other glamorous, war-loving, dirty old men&quot;. Vonnegut made a number of comparisons between Dresden and the bombing of Hiroshima in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; and wrote in &quot;Palm Sunday&quot; (1991): &quot;I learned how vile that religion of mine could be when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima&quot;.

Nuclear war, or at least deployed nuclear arms, is mentioned in almost all of Vonnegut&#x27;s novels. In &quot;Player Piano&quot;, the computer EPICAC is given control of the nuclear arsenal and is charged with deciding whether to use high-explosive or nuclear arms. In &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, John&#x27;s original purpose in setting pen to paper was to write an account of what prominent Americans had been doing as Hiroshima was bombed.

=== Religion ===
Vonnegut was an atheist, a humanist and a freethinker, serving as the honorary president of the American Humanist Association. In an interview for &quot;Playboy&quot;, he stated that his forebears who came to the United States did not believe in God, and he learned his atheism from his parents. Vonnegut did not, however, disdain those who seek the comfort of religion, hailing church associations as a type of extended family. He occasionally attended a Unitarian church, but with little consistency. In his autobiographical work &quot;Palm Sunday&quot;, Vonnegut says that he is a &quot;Christ-worshipping agnostic&quot;. During a speech to the Unitarian Universalist Association, he called himself a &quot;Christ-loving atheist&quot;. However, he was keen to stress that he was not a Christian.

Vonnegut was an admirer of Jesus&#x27; Sermon on the Mount, particularly the Beatitudes, and incorporated it into his own doctrines. He also referred to it in many of his works. In his 1991 book &quot;Fates Worse than Death&quot;, Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, &quot;anything that sounded like the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American&quot;. In &quot;Palm Sunday&quot;, he wrote that &quot;the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade&quot;. However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the televangelists of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.

Religion features frequently in Vonnegut&#x27;s work, both in his novels and elsewhere. He laced a number of his speeches with religion-focused rhetoric and was prone to using such expressions as &quot;God forbid&quot; and &quot;thank God&quot;. He once wrote his own version of the Requiem Mass, which he then had translated into Latin and set to music. In &quot;God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian&quot;, Vonnegut goes to heaven after he is euthanized by Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Once in heaven, he interviews 21 deceased celebrities, including Isaac Asimov, William Shakespeare, and Kilgore Trout—the last a fictional character from several of his novels. Vonnegut&#x27;s works are filled with characters founding new faiths, and religion often serves as a major plot device, for example, in &quot;Player Piano&quot;, &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. In &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, Rumfoord proclaims The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent. &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; sees Billy Pilgrim, lacking religion himself, nevertheless become a chaplain&#x27;s assistant in the military and display a large crucifix on his bedroom wall. In &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, Vonnegut invented the religion of Bokononism.

=== Politics ===
Vonnegut&#x27;s thoughts on politics were shaped in large part by Robert Redfield, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago, co-founder of the Committee on Social Thought, and one of Vonnegut&#x27;s professors during his time at the university. In a commencement address, Vonnegut remarked that &quot;Dr. Redfield&#x27;s theory of the Folk Society ... has been the starting point for my politics, such as they are&quot;. Vonnegut did not particularly sympathize with liberalism or conservatism and mused on the specious simplicity of American politics, saying facetiously: &quot;If you want to take my guns away from me, and you&#x27;re all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other ... you&#x27;re a liberal. If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you&#x27;re a conservative. What could be simpler?&quot; Regarding political parties, Vonnegut said: &quot;The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers. The people don&#x27;t acknowledge this. They claim membership in two imaginary parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, instead.&quot;

Vonnegut disregarded more mainstream American political ideologies in favor of socialism, which he thought could provide a valuable substitute for what he saw as social Darwinism and a spirit of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in American society, believing that &quot;socialism would be a good for the common man&quot;. Vonnegut would often return to a quote by socialist and five-time presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs: &quot;As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I&#x27;m of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.&quot; Vonnegut expressed disappointment that communism and socialism seemed to be unsavory topics to the average American and believed that they offered beneficial substitutes to contemporary social and economic systems.

=== Technology ===
In &quot;A Man Without a Country&quot;, Vonnegut quipped &quot;I have been called a Luddite. I welcome it. Do you know what a Luddite is? A person who hates newfangled contraptions.&quot; The negative effects of the progress of technology is a constant theme throughout Vonnegut&#x27;s works, from &quot;Player Piano&quot; to his final essay collection &quot;A Man Without a Country&quot;. Political theorist Patrick Deneen has identified this skepticism of technological progress as a theme of Vonnegut novels and stories, including &quot;Player Piano&quot;, &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot;. Scholars who position Vonnegut as a critic of liberalism reference his pessimism toward technological progress. Vonnegut described &quot;Player Piano&quot; some years after its publication as &quot;a novel about people and machines, and machines frequently got the best of it, as machines will.&quot; Loss of jobs due to machine innovation, and thus loss of meaning or purpose in life, is a key plot point in the novel. The &quot;newfangled contraptions&quot; Vonnegut hated included the television, which he critiqued often throughout his non-fiction and fiction. In &quot;Timequake&quot;, for example, Vonnegut tells the story of &quot;Booboolings&quot;, human analogs who develop morally through their imaginative formation. However, one evil sister on the planet of the Booboolings learns to build televisions from lunatics. He writes: When the bad sister was a young woman, she and the nuts worked up designs for television cameras and transmitters and receivers. Then she got money from her very rich mom to manufacture these satanic devices, which made imaginations redundant. They were instantly popular because the shows were so attractive and no thinking was involved ... Generations of Booboolings grew up without imaginations ... Without imaginations, though, they couldn&#x27;t do what their ancestors had done, which was read interesting, heartwarming stories in the faces of one another. So ... Booboolings became among the most merciless creatures in the local family of galaxies.Against imagination-killing devices like televisions, and against electronic substitutes for embodied community, Vonnegut argued that &quot;Electronic communities build nothing. You wind up with nothing. We are dancing animals. How beautiful it is to get up and go out and do something.&quot;

== Writing ==

=== Influences ===
Vonnegut&#x27;s writing was inspired by an eclectic mix of sources. When he was younger, Vonnegut stated that he read works of pulp fiction, science fiction, fantasy, and action-adventure. He also read the classics, such as the plays of Aristophanes—like Vonnegut&#x27;s works, humorous critiques of contemporary society. Vonnegut&#x27;s life and work also share similarities with that of &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; writer Mark Twain. Both shared pessimistic outlooks on humanity and a skeptical take on religion and, as Vonnegut put it, were both &quot;associated with the enemy in a major war&quot;, as Twain briefly enlisted in the South&#x27;s cause during the American Civil War, and Vonnegut&#x27;s German name and ancestry connected him with the United States&#x27; enemy in both world wars. He also cited Ambrose Bierce as an influence, calling &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; the greatest American short story and deeming any who disagreed or had not read the story &quot;twerps&quot;.

Vonnegut called George Orwell his favorite writer and admitted that he tried to emulate Orwell. &quot;I like his concern for the poor, I like his socialism, I like his simplicity&quot;, Vonnegut said. Vonnegut also said that Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley heavily influenced his debut novel, &quot;Player Piano&quot;, in 1952. The novel also included ideas from mathematician Norbert Wiener&#x27;s book &quot;Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine&quot;. Vonnegut commented that Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s stories were emblems of thoughtfully put together works that he tried to mimic in his own compositions. Vonnegut also hailed playwright and socialist George Bernard Shaw as &quot;a hero of [his]&quot; and an &quot;enormous influence&quot;. Within his own family, Vonnegut stated that his mother, Edith, had the greatest influence on him. &quot;[My] mother thought she might make a new fortune by writing for the slick magazines. She took short-story courses at night. She studied writers the way gamblers study horses.&quot;

Early on in his career, Vonnegut decided to model his style after Henry David Thoreau, who wrote as if from the perspective of a child, allowing Thoreau&#x27;s works to be more widely comprehensible. Using a youthful narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and straightforward way. Other influences on Vonnegut include &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; author H. G. Wells and satirist Jonathan Swift. Vonnegut credited American journalist and critic H. L. Mencken for inspiring him to become a journalist.

=== Style and technique ===

The book &quot;Pity the Reader: On Writing with Style&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut and his longtime friend and former student Suzanne McConnell, published posthumously by Rosetta Books and Seven Stories Press in 2019, delves into the style, humor, and methodologies Vonnegut employed, including his belief that one should &quot;Write like a human being. Write like a writer.&quot;

In his book &quot;Popular Contemporary Writers&quot;, Michael D. Sharp describes Vonnegut&#x27;s linguistic style as straightforward, his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter in a way that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability and pointed to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut&#x27;s compositions include distinct references to his own life, notably in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; and &quot;Slapstick&quot;.

Vonnegut believed that ideas, and the convincing communication of those ideas to the reader, were vital to literary art. He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of &quot;Player Piano&quot; leads to the moment when Paul, on trial and hooked to a lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood. Paul states: &quot;every new piece of scientific knowledge is a good thing for humanity&quot;. Robert T. Tally Jr., in his volume on Vonnegut&#x27;s novels, wrote: &quot;rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness&quot;. Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety. The large, artificial U.S. families in &quot;Slapstick&quot; soon serve as an excuse for tribalism. People give no help to those not part of their group; the extended family&#x27;s place in the social hierarchy becomes vital.

In the introduction to their essay &quot;Kurt Vonnegut and Humor&quot;, Tally and Peter C. Kunze suggest that Vonnegut was not a &quot;black humorist&quot;, but a &quot;frustrated idealist&quot; who used &quot;comic parables&quot; to teach the reader absurd, bitter or hopeless truths, with his grim witticisms serving to make the reader laugh rather than cry. &quot;Vonnegut makes sense through humor, which is, in the author&#x27;s view, as valid a means of mapping this crazy world as any other strategies.&quot; Vonnegut resented being called a black humorist, feeling that, as with many literary labels, it allows readers to disregard aspects of a writer&#x27;s work that do not fit the label.

Vonnegut&#x27;s works have been labeled science fiction, satire and postmodern. He resisted such labels, but his works do contain common tropes in those genres. In his books, Vonnegut imagines alien societies and civilizations, as is common in science fiction. Vonnegut emphasizes or exaggerates absurdities and idiosyncrasies. Furthermore, Vonnegut makes fun of problems, as satire does. However, literary theorist Robert Scholes noted in &quot;Fabulation and Metafiction&quot; that Vonnegut &quot;reject[s] the traditional satirist&#x27;s faith in the efficacy of satire as a reforming instrument. [He has] a more subtle faith in the humanizing value of laughter.&quot;

Postmodernism entails a response to the theory that science will reveal truths. Postmodernists contend that truth is subjective, rather than objective. Truth includes bias toward individual beliefs and outlooks on the world. Postmodernist writers use unreliable, first-person narration, and narrative fragmentation. One critic has argued that Vonnegut&#x27;s most famous novel, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, features a metafictional, Janus-headed outlook and seeks to represent historical events while doubting the ability to represent history. Doubt is evident in the opening lines of the novel: &quot;All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true.&quot; The bombastic opening—&quot;All this happened&quot;—&quot;reads like a declaration of complete mimesis,&quot; which is radically called into question in the rest of the quote and &quot;[t]his creates an integrated perspective that seeks out extratextual themes [like war and trauma] while thematizing the novel&#x27;s textuality and inherent constructedness at one and the same time.&quot; Although Vonnegut does use fragmentation and metafiction in some of his works, he more distinctly focuses on the peril of individuals who find subjective truths, mistake them for objective truths, and proceed to impose these truths on other people.

=== Themes ===

==== Economy ====
Vonnegut was a vocal critic of American society, and this was reflected in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut&#x27;s works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan as a result of his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances, as the lives of both groups&#x27; members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut&#x27;s socialist views.

In &quot;Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion&quot;, Thomas F. Marvin states: &quot;Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States.&quot; Marvin suggests that Vonnegut&#x27;s works demonstrate what happens when a &quot;hereditary aristocracy&quot; develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism and a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune and fails to help them out of their poverty because &quot;they deserve their fate&quot;.

==== Ethics in science ====

Science and the ethical obligations of scientists are also a common theme in Vonnegut&#x27;s works. His first published story, &quot;Report on the Barnhouse Effect&quot;, like many of his early stories, centered on a scientist concerned about the uses of his own invention. &quot;Player Piano&quot; and &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot; explore the effects on humans of scientific advances. In 1969, Vonnegut gave a speech to the American Association of Physics Teachers called &quot;The Virtuous Physicist&quot;. Asked afterwards what a virtuous scientist was, Vonnegut replied, &quot;one who declines to work on weapons.&quot;

==== Life ====
Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; and &quot;Timequake&quot; the characters have no choice in what they do; in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, Bokononism views free will as heretical.

The majority of Vonnegut&#x27;s characters are estranged from their actual families and seek to build replacement or extended families. For example, the engineers in &quot;Player Piano&quot; called their manager&#x27;s spouse &quot;Mom&quot;. In &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, Vonnegut devises two separate methods for loneliness to be combated: A &quot;karass&quot;, which is a group of individuals appointed by God to do his will, and a &quot;granfalloon&quot;, defined by Marvin as a &quot;meaningless association of people, such as a fraternal group or a nation&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;Slapstick&quot;, the US government codifies that all Americans are a part of large extended families.

Fear of the losing one&#x27;s purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut&#x27;s works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut witnessed machines being built to take the place of human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, &quot;Player Piano&quot;, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work, as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in &quot;Galápagos&quot;, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in &quot;Timequake&quot;, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.

Suicide by fire is another common theme in Vonnegut&#x27;s works; the author often returns to the theory that &quot;many people are not fond of life&quot;. He uses this as an explanation for why humans have so severely damaged their environments and made devices such as nuclear weapons that can make their creators extinct. In &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot;, Vonnegut features the neutron bomb, which is designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices at the disposal of politicians.

&quot;What is the point of life?&quot; is a question Vonnegut often pondered in his works. When one of Vonnegut&#x27;s characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question &quot;What is the purpose of life?&quot; written in a bathroom, his response is: &quot;To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool.&quot; Marvin finds Trout&#x27;s theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, &quot;[as] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by and do nothing while such reports come in&quot;. In the epigraph to &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, Vonnegut quotes his son Mark and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: &quot;We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.&quot;

==== Tralfamadore ====
A fictional planet called Tralfamadore is a recurring motif in Vonnegut&#x27;s works; a planet by that name is referenced in &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;, &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, and &quot;Timequake&quot;. It is variously depicted as being located outside of the Milky Way galaxy or being fictional within the fiction itself; in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, it is implied to be imaginary as a result of the protagonist losing his grip on reality. A recurring characteristic of the inhabitants of Tralfamadore is their low esteem of humanity. According to Julia A. Whitehead, Vonnegut used the concept of an imagined planet inhabited by beings more enlightened than humans as an outlet for escapism. By contrast, Lawrence R. Boer rejects the notion that the pessimism and fatalism of the Tralfamadorians in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; reflects the views of the author, and Brian Stableford characterizes the different Tralfamadorian races in that book and &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; as &quot;tiny-minded smartasses&quot;.

<text>A  ( ; ; ; ; ) is a story, dialogue, question, or statement from Chinese Chan Buddhist lore, supplemented with commentaries, that is used in Zen Buddhist practice in different ways. The main goal of practice in Zen is to achieve (Chinese: jianxing 見性), to see or observe one&#x27;s buddha-nature.

Extended study of literature as well as meditation () on a is a major feature of modern Rinzai Zen. They are also studied in the Sōtō school of Zen to a lesser extent. In Chinese Chan and Korean Seon Buddhism, meditating on a , a key phrase of a , is also a major Zen meditation method.

==Etymology==
The Japanese term is the Sino-Japanese reading of the Chinese word (). The term is a compound word, consisting of the characters (&#x27;public; official; governmental; common; collective; fair; equitable&#x27;) and (&#x27;table; desk, altar; (law) case; record; file; plan; mandate, proposal.&#x27;)

According to the Yuan dynasty Zen master Zhongfeng Mingben ( 1263–1323), originated as an abbreviation of (, Japanese —literally the (&#x27;official correspondence; documents; files&#x27;) of a (&#x27;government post&#x27;)), which referred to a &quot;public record&quot; or the &quot;case records of a public law court&quot; in Tang dynasty China. / thus serves as a metaphor for principles of reality beyond the private or subjective opinion of one person, and a teacher may test the student&#x27;s ability to recognize and understand that principle.

Commentaries in collections bear some similarity to judicial decisions that cite and sometimes modify precedents. An article by T. Griffith Foulk claims:

 was itself originally a metonym—an article of furniture involved in setting legal precedents came to stand for such precedents. For example, () is the original title of &quot;Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee&quot;, the famous Chinese detective novel based on a historical Tang dynasty judge. Similarly, Zen collections are public records of the notable sayings and actions of Zen masters and disciples attempting to pass on their teachings.

==Doctrinal background==
The popular Western understanding sees as referring to an unanswerable question or a meaningless or absurd statement. However, in Zen practice, a is not meaningless, and not a riddle or a puzzle. Teachers do expect students to present an appropriate response when asked about a . According to Hori, a central theme of many is the &#x27;identity of opposites&#x27;:

Comparable statements are: &quot;Look at the flower and the flower also looks&quot;; &quot;Guest and host interchange&quot;. are also understood as pointers to an unmediated &quot;Pure Consciousness&quot;, devoid of cognitive activity. Victor Hori criticizes this understanding:

== in China ==

=== The &quot;public cases&quot; of the old masters ===
 literature developed at some point in between the late Tang dynasty (10th century) to the Song dynasty (960–1279), though the details are unclear. They arose out of the collections of the recorded sayings of Chán masters and &quot;transmission&quot; texts like the &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot;. These sources contained numerous stories of famous past Chán masters which were used to educate Zen students. According to Morten Schlütter &quot;it is not clear exactly when the practice of commenting on old gongan cases started, but the earliest Chan masters to have such commentaries included in the recorded sayings attributed to them appear to be Yunmen Wenyan and Fenyang Shanzhao (947–1024).&quot;

According to Robert Buswell, the tradition &quot;can be viewed as the products of an internal dynamic within Chan that began in the T&#x27;ang and climaxed in the Sung.&quot; By the beginning of the Song era, Chan masters were known to use these stories in their sermons, as well as to comment on them and to use them to challenge their students.

Schlütter also writes:

Originally, such a story was only considered a when it was commented upon by another Chán master, i.e. when it was used as a &quot;case&quot; study for enlightenment. This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters also served to confirm the master&#x27;s position as an awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past.

According to Schlütter, these stories were also used &quot;to challenge Chan students to demonstrate their insights: a Chan master would cite a story about a famous master and then demand that his students comment.&quot; Later on, certain questions (like: &quot;Why did Bodhidharma come from the West?&quot;) developed independently from the traditional stories and were used in the same fashion. Schlütter also notes that &quot;most commonly used in the Song originally came from the influential &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot;, although the subsequent transmission histories also became sources of .&quot;

Over time, a whole literary genre of collection and commentary developed which was influenced by &quot;educated literati&quot; of the Song era. These collections included quotations of encounter-dialogue passages (the &quot;cases&quot;, ) with a master&#x27;s comment on the case attached. When a prose comment was added, the genre was called (&#x27;picking up the old ones&#x27;), and when poems were used to comment, the genre was termed (&#x27;eulogizing the old ones&#x27;). Further commentaries would then be written by later figures on these initial comments, leading to quite complex and layered texts.

The style of these Song-era Zen texts was influenced by many Chinese literary conventions and the style of &quot;literary games&quot; (competitions involving improvised poetry). Common literary devices included:

There were dangers involved in such a highly literary approach, such as ascribing specific meanings to the cases, or become too involved in book learning. Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;, for the hindrance it had become to the study of Chán by his students.

=== &quot;Observing the phrase&quot; ===
During the late Song dynasty (11th–12th century), the practice of assigning specific to students for contemplation had become quite common and some sources contain examples of Zen masters (e.g. Touzi Yiqing) who became enlightened through contemplating a . 
Thus, by the time of Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163), this practice was well established. Dahui promoted and popularized the practice extensively, under the name of &quot;observing the phrase zen&quot; (). In this practice, students were to observe () or concentrate on a single word or phrase (), such as the famous of the , and develop a sense of &quot;great doubt&quot; within until this ball of doubt &quot;shattered&quot;, leading to enlightenment. Dahui&#x27;s invention was aimed at balancing the insight developed by reflection on the teachings with developing śamatha, calmness of mind.

This idea of observing a key phrase or word was Dahui&#x27;s unique contribution, since the earlier method of contemplation never taught the focusing on a single word, nor did it teach to develop a &quot;ball of doubt that builds up before finally shattering.&quot; According to Wright, instead of focusing on the full narrative of a , Dahui promoted &quot;intense focus on one critical phrase, generally one word or element at the climax of the .&quot;

Dahui also taught that meditation on just one of a single was enough to achieve enlightenment, since penetrating one was penetrating into all of them. He went even further, arguing that this new meditation technique was the only way of achieving enlightenment for Chan practitioners of his day. Thus, Schlütter writes that &quot;in this insistence, he was unusual among the Song Chan masters, who generally tended to take a rather inclusive view of Buddhist practice. It is therefore fair to say that Dahui not only developed a new contemplative technique, he also invented a whole new kind of Chan in the process.&quot; Whatever the case, Dahui was extremely influential in shaping the development of the Linji school in the Song.

Dale S. Wright also writes that Dahui: 

As Robert Buswell explains, this emphasis on non-conceptual meditation on a meant that &quot;there is nothing that need be developed; all the student must do is simply renounce both the hope that there is something that can be achieved through the practice as well as the conceit that he will achieve that result.&quot;

Wright argues that since &quot;the narrative structure of the was eliminated in the focus on a single point&quot;, that is the (which was said to have no meaning), such a practice became a śamatha-like practice (which even resembles Caodong silent illumination), even if this was never acknowledged by the masters of the Linji school in the Song. Furthermore, Wright also argues that this practice was anti-intellectual since all learning was to be renounced in the practice of . According to Wright, this development left Chinese Chán vulnerable to criticisms by a resurgent neo-Confucianism.

According to Mario Poceski, although Dahui&#x27;s &quot;kanhua&quot; Chan (in which one focuses on a &quot;huatou&quot;) purports to be a sudden method, it essentially consists of a process of gradually perfecting concentration. Poceski also observes the role the &quot;kanhua&quot; technique played in standardizing Chan practice. He argues that this contributed to the routinization of the tradition, resulting in a loss of some of the more open and creative aspects of earlier Chan.

=== The Chan master&#x27;s role ===
According to Kasulis, the rise of contemplation in Song-era Zen led to a greater emphasis on the interaction between master and student, which came to be identified as the essence of enlightenment, since &quot;its verification was always interpersonal. In effect, enlightenment came to be understood not so much as an insight, but as a way of acting in the world with other people.&quot;

This mutual inquiry of past cases gave Zen students a role model and a sense of belonging to a spiritual family since &quot;one looked at the enlightened activities of one&#x27;s lineal forebears in order to understand one&#x27;s own identity.&quot; The practice also served to confirm an individual&#x27;s enlightenment and authority in a specific lineage or school. This formal authorization or confirmation (, Japanese: , Korean: ) was given by their teacher and was often part of a process of &quot;dharma transmission&quot; () in a specific lineage. This formal act placed the &quot;confirmed&quot; Chan master in a special unique position as an interpreter and guide to the .

The importance of the teacher student relationship is seen in modern Japanese training which always requires an authorized teacher ( or ) in a specific lineage who has the ability to judge a disciple&#x27;s understanding and expression of a . In the Rinzai Zen school, which uses extensively, the teacher certification process includes an appraisal of proficiency in using that school&#x27;s extensive curriculum. According to Barbara O&#x27;Brien, the practice of going to a private interview with one&#x27;s Zen master () where one has to prove one&#x27;s understanding of &quot;is the real point of the whole exercise&quot;.
=== Chinese collections ===
Some of the key Song-era collections are:

* The &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; (; Japanese: ) is a collection of 100 compiled in 1125 by Yuanwu Keqin ( 1063–1135), mostly drawn from earlier &quot;transmission&quot; stories.
* The &quot;Book of Equanimity&quot; or &quot;Book of Serenity&quot; (; ) is a collection of 100 by Hongzhi Zhengjue (Chinese: ; Japanese: Wanshi Shōgaku) (1091–1157), compiled with commentaries by Wansong Xingxiu (1166–1246). 
* &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; (Chinese: ; Japanese: ) is a collection of 48 and commentaries published in 1228 by Chinese monk Wumen ( ). The title may be more accurately rendered as &quot;Gateless Barrier&quot; or &quot;Gateless Checkpoint&quot;. Five in the collection derive from the sayings and doings of Zhaozhou Congshen (transliterated as Chao-chou in Wade–Giles and pronounced Jōshū in Japanese).
* The (, &quot;Treasury of the true dharma eye&quot;, Japanese: ) is a collection of and dialogues compiled between 1147 and 1150 by Dahui Zonggao. Dahui&#x27;s &quot;Treasury&quot; is composed of three scrolls prefaced by three short introductory pieces. 
* The () was compiled in 1183 by Huiweng Wuming () (n.d.), three generations after Dahui in the same line; the sermon is found in zh 20 (x 79: 173a).

These texts mostly draw and develop stories which are found in other sources, mainly the &quot;Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall&quot; (Chinese , mid-10th century), and the hagiographical &quot;Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp&quot; (Chinese , early 11th century).

=== After the Song era ===
Zhongfeng Mingben (1263–1323), a Chinese Chan master who lived at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, revitalized the Chinese Linji school. Zhongfeng put a strong emphasis on the use of , seeing them as a &quot;work of literature [that] should be used as objective, universal standards to test the insight of monks who aspired to be recognized as Ch&#x27;an masters&quot;. He also promoted Dahui&#x27;s famous method of meditating on a and influenced several Japanese Rinzai masters of the time who came to China to study with him, including Kosen Ingen, Kohō Kakumyō, Jakushitsu Genkō (1290–1367).

According to Zhongfeng:

In later periods like the Ming dynasty, Chinese Chan developed in different directions, such as incorporating Pure Land elements and the re-introduction of an emphasis on the study of scripture.

However, meditation was still practiced in the Linji lineages. During the Ming, Miyun Yuanwu (1566–1642) was a successful promoter of the Linji school&#x27;s methods, emphasizing vigorous master disciple encounters which made use of shouting and beating in imitation of classic stories. Yuanwu&#x27;s efforts to revive the Linji tradition were so successful that according to Marcus Bingenheimer, &quot;Miyun&#x27;s Tiantong branch of the Linji School became the dominant Chan lineage in China and beyond&quot; (). He led numerous communities of thousands of monks and confirmed twelve dharma heirs.

His teachings also influenced Japanese Zen since his student Yinyuan Longqi (Japanese: Ingen Ryūki, 1592–1673) later founded the Ōbaku school in Japan. This lineage also spread the Linji teachings to Vietnam, mainly through the efforts of Yuanshao (, 1648–1728).

==Modern Chinese Chán and Korean Seon==
In the modern period, the practice of meditating on the critical phrase () of a is still taught and some Chinese Chan figures like Sheng Yen and Xuyun taught the practice and wrote on it.

Modern Chinese Chán and Korean Seon generally follow the method taught by Dahui, which emphasizes meditation on a (&#x27;critical phrase&#x27;, &#x27;word head&#x27;). In this method one repeats the phrase over and over again and inquires into it while in meditation (sitting or walking) as well as in daily activities. In this mainland tradition of practice, also called , &#x27;reflection on the &#x27;, a fragment of a , such as , or a &quot;what is&quot;-question is used by focusing on this fragment and repeating it over and over again.

In this tradition one generally contemplates one such phrase for an extended period of time, going deeper and deeper into it, instead of going through an extended curriculum as in Japanese Rinzai. A student may be assigned only one for their whole life. The focus of this contemplation is on generating the sense of &quot;great doubt&quot; and on having faith in the Dharma and the practice. According to Ford the &quot;becomes a touchstone of our practice: it is a place to put our doubt, to cultivate great doubt, to allow the revelation of great faith, and to focus our great energy.&quot;

Xuyun wrote:

Examples of which are used in meditation include: &quot;What is this?&quot;; &quot;What was the original face before my father and mother were born?&quot;; &quot;Who is dragging this corpse about?&quot;; and &quot;Who am I?&quot;.

Another popular practice in Chinese Chan is using the (repetition of Amitabha Buddha&#x27;s name) as a practice. This method of &quot; Chan&quot; () was promoted in the modern era by Xuyun and relies on repeating the Buddha&#x27;s name while also asking &quot;who is reciting?&quot;. The practice of using in a like fashion is also found in the Japanese Ōbaku school and was taught by their founding masters (including Yǐnyuán, i.e. Ingen), indicating that this method dates at least as far back as the Ming dynasty.

The modern Korean master Seung Sahn developed his own curriculum of multiple in his Kwan Um School of Zen, but this was a modern development unheard of in Korean Seon.

== in Japan==
=== The introduction of ===
When the Chán tradition was established in Japan in the 12th century, both Rinzai and Sōtō, took over the use of study and commenting. In Sōtō-Zen, commentary was not linked to seated meditation. Japanese monks had to master the Chinese language and specific expressions used in the training. The desired &quot;spontaneity&quot; expressed by enlightened masters required a thorough study of Chinese language and poetry. Japanese Zen imitated the Chinese &quot;syntax and stereotyped norms&quot;.

During the Kamakura period, the officially recognized Rinzai monasteries belonging to the (Five Mountain System) where key centers for the study of . Senior monks in these monasteries were supposed to compose Chinese verse in a complex style of matched counterpoints known as . It took a lot of literary and intellectual skills for a monk to succeed in this system.

The Rinka monasteries, the provincial temples which were under less direct state control, laid less stress on the correct command of Chinese verse. These monasteries developed &quot;more accessible methods of instruction&quot;. It had three features:

#A standardized curriculum;
#A standardized set of answers based on stereotypes Chinese sayings;
#A standardized method of secretly guiding students through the curriculum of and answers.

By standardizing the curriculum every generation of students proceeded to the same series of . Students had to memorize a set number of stereotyped sayings, , &#x27;appended words&#x27;. The proper series of responses for each were taught by the master in private instruction sessions to selected individual students who would inherit the dharma lineage.

The development of Rinzai curriculums occurred in various stages. According to Eshin Nishimura, Japanese Rinzai-masters like (1202–1280) and (1235–1308) had already divided the Chinese into three groups namely (&#x27;ultimate truth&#x27;), (&#x27;skillful method&#x27;) and (&#x27;non-attachment&#x27;). Musō Soseki (1275–1351) further developed the use of . Despite belonging to the Rinzai-school, Musō Soseki also made extensive use of (teaching), explaining the sutras, instead of (). According to Musō Soseki, both are , &#x27;skillful means&#x27; meant to educate students. Musō Soseki called both , &#x27;little jewels&#x27;, tools to help the student to attain satori.

In the 18th century, the Rinzai school became dominated by the legacy of Hakuin, who laid a strong emphasis on study as a means to gain , but also not to get stuck in this initial insight, and to develop a compassionate, selfless attitude. After Hakuin, most Rinzai monasteries followed the teachings of his lineage on practice. study was also further systematized in a standard sequence of that the student had to pass and work through step by step. There are two curricula used in Rinzai, derived from two dharma-heirs of Gasan: the Takuju curriculum, and the Inzan curriculum. Both curricula have standardized answers.

=== Rinzai school ===
 practice is particularly important among Japanese practitioners of the Rinzai school. Japanese Rinzai uses extensive -curricula, checking questions, and (&#x27;capping phrases&#x27;, quotations from Chinese poetry) in its use of koans,

Koan practice starts with the , or &#x27;first barrier&#x27;, usually the or the question &quot;What is the sound of one hand?&quot;. After having attained , students continue their practice investigating subsequent . In the Takuju-school, after breakthrough students work through the &quot;Gateless Gate&quot; (), the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; (), the &quot;Entangling Vines&quot; (), and the &quot;Collection of Wings of the Blackbird&quot; (, ). The Inzan-school uses its own internally generated list of .

==== curricula ====
In Rinzai a gradual succession of is studied. There are two general branches of curricula used within Rinzai, the Takuju curriculum, and the Inzan curriculum. However, there are a number of sub-branches of these, and additional variations of curriculum often exist between individual teaching lines which can reflect the recorded experiences of a particular lineage&#x27;s members. curricula are, in fact, subject to continued accretion and evolution over time, and thus are best considered living traditions of practice rather than set programs of study.

While Hakuin only refers to break-through , and &quot;difficult to pass&quot; to sharpen and refine the initial insight and foster compassion, Hakuin&#x27;s descendants developed a fivefold classification system:

#, dharma-body , are used to awaken the first insight into . They reveal the , or Fundamental. They introduce &quot;the undifferentitated and the unconditional&quot;.
#, dynamic action , help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view; where represent , substance, represent , function.
#, explication of word , aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters. They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.
#, eight &quot;difficult to pass&quot; . There are various explanations for this category, one being that these cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through . It is uncertain which are exactly those eight . Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten :
#*Miura and Sasaki:
#**Nansen&#x27;s Flower (Hekigan-roku Case 40)
#**A Buffalo Passes the Window (Mumonkan Case 38)
#**Sōzan&#x27;s Memorial Tower (Kattō-shō Case 140)
#**Suigan&#x27;s Eyebrows (Hekigan-roku Case 8)
#**Enkan&#x27;s Rhinoceros Fan (Hekigan-roku Case 91)
#*Shimano:
#**The Old Woman Burns the Hut (Kattō-shō Case 162)
#*Asahina Sōgen:
#**Goso Hōen&#x27;s &quot;Hakuun Said &#x27;Not Yet&#x27;&quot; (Kattō-shō Case 269)
#**Shuzan&#x27;s Main Cable (Kattō-shō Case 280).
#*Akizuki:
#**Nansen Has Died (Kattō-shō Case 282)
#**Kenpō&#x27;s Three Illnesses (Kattō-shō Case 17).
#, the Five Ranks of Tozan and the Ten Grave Precepts.

According to Akizuki there was an older classification system, in which the fifth category was , &#x27;Directed upwards&#x27;. This category too was meant to rid the monk of any &quot;stink of Zen&quot;. The very advanced practitioner may also receive the , &quot;The last barrier&quot;, and , &quot;The final confirmation&quot;. &quot;The last barrier&quot; is given when one left the training hall, for example &quot;Sum up all of the records of Rinzai in one word!&quot; It is not meant to be solved immediately, but to be carried around in order to keep practising. &quot;The final confirmation&quot; may be another word for the same kind of . Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu gave &quot;If nothing what you do will do, then what will you do?&quot; as &#x27;unanswerable&#x27; question, which keeps nagging on premature certainty.

==== The breakthrough- ====
In the Rinzai school, the Sanbo Kyodan, and the White Plum Asanga, practice starts with the assignment of a or &quot;break-through &quot;, usually the or &quot;the sound of one hand&quot;. Students are instructed to concentrate on the &quot;word-head&quot;, like the phrase . In the Wumenguan (), public case No. 1 (&quot;Zhaozhou&#x27;s Dog&quot;), Wumen (Mumon) wrote:

Arousing this great inquiry or &quot;Great Doubt&quot; is an essential element of practice. It builds up &quot;strong internal pressure (), never stopping knocking from within at the door of [the] mind, demanding to be resolved&quot;. To illustrate the enormous concentration required in meditation, Zen Master Wumen commented:

Analysing the for its literal meaning will not lead to insight, though understanding the context from which emerged can make them more intelligible. For example, when a monk asked Zhaozhou (Joshu) &quot;does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?&quot;, the monk was referring to the understanding of the teachings on Buddha-nature, which were understood in the Chinese context of absolute and relative reality.
The continuous pondering of the break-through () or , &quot;word head&quot;, leads to , an initial insight into &quot;seeing the (Buddha-)nature.

The aim of the break-through is to see the &quot;nonduality of subject and object&quot;:

Various accounts can be found which describe &quot;becoming one&quot; with the and the resulting breakthrough:

However, the use of the has also been criticised. According to Ama Samy, the main aim is merely to &quot;&#x27;become one&#x27; with the &quot;. Showing to have &#x27;become one&#x27; with the first is enough to pass the first . According to Samy, this is not equal to :

==== Testing insight – or learning responses ====

===== – Checking questions =====
Teachers may probe students about their practice using , &quot;checking questions&quot; to validate their (understanding) or (seeing the nature). For the and the clapping hand-, there are between 20 and 100 checking questions, depending on the teaching lineage. The checking questions serve to deepen the insight or of the student, but also to test his or her understanding.

===== Standardized answers =====
Those checking questions, and their answers, are part of a standardised set of questions and answers. Ama Samy states that the &quot;s and their standard answers are fixed.&quot; Isshu Muira Roshi also states, in &quot;The Zen Koan&quot;: &quot;In the Inzan and Takuju lines, the answers to the koans were more or less standardized for each line respectively.&quot; and , &quot;Records of secret instruction&quot; have been preserved for various Rinzai lineages. They contain both the curricula and the standardized answers. 

In Sōtō-Zen they are called , an abbreviation of , &quot;secret instructions of the lineage&quot;. The follow a standard question-and-answer format. A series of questions is given, to be asked by the master. The answers are also given by the master, to be memorized by the student.

According to critics, students are learning a &quot;ritual performance&quot;, learning how to behave and respond in specific ways, learning &quot;clever repartees, ritualized language and gestures and be submissive to the master&#x27;s diktat and arbitration.&quot;

In 1916 Tominaga Shūho, using the pseudonym &quot;Hau Hōō&quot;, published a critique of the Rinzai system, , which also contained a translation of a . The part has been translated by Yoel Hoffmann as &quot;The Sound of the One Hand&quot; (see ) and .

===== Jakugo – Capping phrases =====
In the Rinzai school, passing a koan and the checking questions has to be supplemented by &quot;jakugo&quot;, &quot;capping phrases&quot;, citations of Chinese poetry to demonstrate the insight. Students can use collections of those citations, instead of composing poetry themselves.

==== Post-satori practice ====
After the initial insight further practice is necessary, to deepen the insight and learn to integrate it in daily life. In Chinese Chán and Korean Seon, this further practice consists of further pondering of the same Hua Tou. In Rinzai-Zen, this further practice is undertaken by further koan-study, for which elaborate curricula exist. In Sōtō-Zen, Shikantaza is the main practice for deepening insight.

==== Real-life integration ====
After completing the koan-training, &quot;Gogo no shugyo&quot; is necessary:
Completing the koan-curriculum in the Rinzai-schools traditionally also led to a mastery of Chinese poetry and literary skills:
==== Breathing practices ====
Hakuin Ekaku, the 17th century revitalizer of the Rinzai school, taught several practices which serve to correct physical and mental imbalances arising from, among other things, incorrect or excessive koan practice. The &quot;soft-butter&quot; method (&quot;nanso no ho&quot;) and &quot;introspection method&quot; (&quot;naikan no ho&quot;) involve cultivation of ki centered on the tanden (Chinese:dantian). These practices are described in Hakuin&#x27;s works Orategama and Yasen Kanna, and are still taught in some Rinzai lineages today.

=== In Japanese Sōtō ===
Few Sōtō Zen practitioners concentrate on kōans during meditation, but the Sōtō sect has a strong historical connection with kōans, since many kōan collections were compiled by Sōtō priests. During the 13th century, Dōgen, founder of the Sōtō sect in Japan, quoted 580 kōans in his teachings. He compiled some 300 kōans in the volumes known as the Greater &quot;Shōbōgenzō.&quot; Dōgen wrote of &quot;Genjokōan&quot;, which points out that everyday life experience and indeed, the whole universe in this moment, is the &quot;fundamental kōan&quot;, which does not refer to any ancient Zen story, but to the &quot;heart of the matter&quot;, the question of life and death. 

Over time, Sōtō sect adopted various koan meditation methods from other schools like Rinzai, including the method of observing a koan in meditation and koan curriculums. By the 15th century, Sōtō temples were publishing koan texts, and Sōtō monks often studied at Rinzai temples and passed on Rinzai koan practice lineages (and vice versa). Sōtō teachers continued to write and collect kōan texts throughout the medieval period. Later kōan collections compiled and annotated by Sōtō priests include &quot;The Iron Flute&quot; (Tetteki Tōsui) by Genrō Ōryū in 1783 and &quot;Verses and Commentaries on One Hundred Old Cases of Tenchian&quot; (&quot;Tenchian hyakusoku hyoju&quot;) compiled by Tetsumon in 1771.

However, during the late 18th and 19th century, the Sōtō tradition of commentary and practice became criticized and suppressed in the Sōtō school, due to a reform movement that sought to return to the teaching of Dōgen and standardise the procedures for dharma transmission. An important figure in this development was Gentō Sokuchū (1729-1807), who sought to remove Rinzai and Obaku influences on Sōtō and focus strictly on Dōgen&#x27;s teachings and writings. 

Another reason for suppressing the tradition in the Sōtō school may have been to highlight the differences with the Rinzai school, and create a clear Sōtō identity. This reform movement had started to venerate Dōgen as the founding teacher of the Sōtō school and they sought to make Dōgen&#x27;s teachings the main standard for the Sōtō school. While Dōgen himself made extensive use of commentary in his works, it is clear he emphasized shikantaza (&quot;just sitting&quot;) without an object, instead of the koan introspection method.

=== In Sanbo Kyodan and White Plum Asanga ===
The Sanbo Kyodan school of the former Sōtō-priest Hakuun Yasutani, and the White Plum Asanga of Taizan Maezumi and the many groups that derive from him, incorporate koan-study. The Sanbo kyodan places great emphasis on kensho, initial insight into one&#x27;s true nature, as a start of real practice. It follows the so-called Harada-Yasutani koan-curriculum, which is derived from Hakuin&#x27;s student Takuju. It is a shortened koan-curriculum, in which the so-called &quot;capping phrases&quot; are removed. The curriculum takes considerably less time to study than the Takuju-curriculum of Rinzai.

To attain kensho, most students are assigned the mu-koan. After breaking through, the student first studies twenty-two &quot;in-house&quot; koans, which are &quot;unpublished and not for the general public&quot;, but are nevertheless published and commented upon. There-after, the students goes through the &quot;Gateless Gate&quot; (Mumonkan), the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;, the &quot;Book of Equanimity&quot;, and the &quot;Record of Transmitting the Light&quot;. The koan-curriculum is completed by the Five ranks of Tozan and the precepts.

==Examples of traditional kōans==
===Does a dog have Buddha-nature===


&quot;Zhaozhou&quot; is rendered as &quot;Chao-chou&quot; in Wade–Giles, and pronounced &quot;Joshu&quot; in Japanese. &quot;Wu&quot; appears as &quot;mu&quot; in Japanese, meaning &quot;no&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;nonbeing&quot;, or &quot;without&quot; in English. This is a fragment of Case No. 1 of the &quot;Wúménguān&quot;. However, another koan presents a longer version, in which Zhaozhou answered &quot;yes&quot; in response to the same question asked by a different monk: see Case No. 18 of the &quot;Book of Serenity&quot;.

===The sound of one hand===


Victor Hori comments:
Yet, Hakuin himself introduced this question with a reference to Kanzeon (Guanyin), bodhisattva of great compassion, who hears the sounds of the suffering ones in the world, and is awakened by hearing these sounds and responding to them. To hear the sound of one hand is to still the sounds of the world, that is, to put an end to all suffering.

===Original face===


This is a fragment of case No. 23 of the &quot;Wumenguan&quot;.

===Killing the Buddha===
===Other koans===

This is a fragment of case No. 18 of the &quot;Wumenguan&quot; as well as case No. 12 of the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;.


This is a fragment of case No. 37 of the &quot;Wumenguan&quot; as well as case No. 47 of the &quot;Book of Serenity&quot;.

==Cultural legacy==
Gentō Sokuchū, the 18th century abbot of Dogen&#x27;s Eihei-ji, aggressively sought to reform Sōtō from all things &#x27;foreign&#x27; and associated with Rinzai, including kōans. The unorthodox Zen monk Ikkyū contemplated kōans for years while creating dolls for a merchant in Kyoto, specifically penetrating the case no. 15 from &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; and thereafter earning his dharma name &quot;Ikkyū&quot;.

Facing criticism by Buddhists such as Philip Kapleau and D. T. Suzuki for misunderstanding Zen, Alan Watts claimed that a kōan supported his lack of zazen practice. On the topic, Suzuki claimed: &quot;I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.&quot;

Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid&quot; discusses Zen kōans in relation to paradoxical questions and perceiving reality outside of one&#x27;s experience. Inspired by Zen teachings (including kōans), Frank Herbert wrote on the subject of the paradoxical elements of his &quot;Dune&quot; series:

The 1989 South Korean film &quot;Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?&quot; bases much of its narrative on kōans, with its title deriving from a particular kōan about the founder of Zen, Bodhidharma.

After becoming smitten with Zen (even offering to turn his own house into a zendo), filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky meditated and studied koans with the traveling monk Ejo Takata (1928–1997). After the release of &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, Jodorowsky gave a talk at the University of Mexico on the subject of kōans. After this talk, Takata gifted Jodorowsky his keisaku, believing that the filmmaker had mastered the ability to understand kōans.

In the 1958 novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;, Jack Kerouac paraphrases the Yunmen &quot;shit-stick&quot; kōan as: &quot;The Buddha is a dried piece of turd&quot;. The second volume of the manga &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; by Kazuo Koike and Goseki Kojima is titled &#x27;The Gateless Barrier&#x27; and revolves around a Linji kōan (&quot;If you meet a Buddha, kill him&quot;) as the protagonist is tasked to kill a troublesome &quot;living Buddha&quot;.

In hacker culture, funny short stories concerning computer science developed, named hacker koans. The book Jargon File contains many kōans, including the &quot;AI Koans&quot;. &quot;The Codeless Code&quot; is another book about software engineers at big businesses instead of unix hackers, deriving its title from the &quot;Gateless Gate&quot;.

The song &quot;False Prophet&quot; by Bob Dylan includes the line: &quot;I climbed a mountain of swords on my bare feet&quot;, a reference to a Gateless Gate kōan (&quot;You must climb a mountain of swords with bare feet&quot;). British musical artist Brian Eno collaborated with Intermorphic on developing a generative music software system named &quot;Koan&quot;. In 2009, American composer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey released his second album, &quot;Koan&quot;.

The 1997 novel &quot;The Sound of One Hand Clapping&quot; by Richard Flanagan (and its 1998 film adaptation of the same name) derives its title from a kōan by Hakuin Ekaku. The episode of the 2014 first season of &quot;Fargo&quot; entitled &quot;Eating the Blame&quot; derives its episode title from a koan of the same name from the &quot;Shasekishū&quot;. Cyriaque Lamar of io9 stated that the approach to technology in &quot;&quot; was reminiscent of kōans.

==Criticism==
===Academic criticism===
According to Mario Poceski, encounter dialogues (which make up the content of koans/&quot;gong&#x27;an&quot;) are not historically reliable and &quot;have little or nothing to do with the lives, ideas, and teachings of the Tang-era protagonists who are featured in them.&quot; Such stories instead reflect the artistic license and religious imagination of mid-tenth century Chan. Poceski further observes that although Zen is often portrayed as promoting spontaneity and freedom, encounter-dialogue exegesis actually points in the opposite direction, namely towards a tradition bound by established parameters of orthodoxy. According to Poceski, on the whole, the encounter-dialogue genre is marked by formulaic repetition and cliché. He describes encounter-dialogue stories as &quot;mass produced&quot; and &quot;artificially manufactured.&quot; He says: In the end, notwithstanding the iconoclastic ethos imputed to them, it is apparent that these textual sources are products of a conservative tradition that, in the course of its growth and transformation during the Tang-Song transition, was keen to promote a particular version of Buddhist orthodoxy and secure its place as the main representative of elite Chinese Buddhism.

Poceski points out how, in commenting on &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot;, Chan masters&#x27; interpretive possibilities are limited by &quot;the straightjacket of a certain type of Chan orthodoxy.&quot; This refers to &quot;ideological constraints and clerical agendas&quot; which take encounter-dialogue stories as depictions of the enlightened behavior of perfected beings that point to some rarefied truth, despite there being no compelling empirical evidence for this. According to Poceski, as this is never up for questioning or scrutiny, &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; stories amount to &quot;received articles of faith, reinforced by a cumulative tradition and embedded in specific institutional structures.&quot;

Poceski explains how institutional agendas regarding &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; have historically been tied up with nexuses of power. Commenting on ancient cases bolstered Chan masters as living embodiments of a mystical Chan lineage, reinforcing their status and authority. At the same time, the ostentatious literary form such exegesis often took served to impress literati supporters, the sociopolitical elites of Song China, who were its intended audience. In this way, &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; exegesis aligned with the cultural predilections and aesthetic sensibilities of the establishment. What&#x27;s more, Alan Cole states that, in China, koan writing &quot;appears to have been a thoroughly literary affair, with little or nothing to do with meditation.&quot;

According to Foulk, commenting on a &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; doesn&#x27;t merely serve to elucidate the wisdom of the patriarchs for a student&#x27;s sake, but rather functions as a device for demonstrating a master&#x27;s authority, not only in relation to a living disciple, but also in relation to the patriarchs themselves. That is, in commenting on a &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot;, a master&#x27;s authority is demonstrated to be both derivative and absolute: derivative in that it draws on the prestige of the earlier patriarchs, absolute in the sense that it gives the living master the last word and ultimate judgment. Similarly, Cole points out that koan exegesis is a kind of performance which positions the commentator as an absolute master of tradition, &quot;one who has even mastered the Chan masters of the Tang&quot; (who appear as the main characters in koan stories).

According to Stuart Lachs, koans are largely literary fictions which serve to reinforce hierarchical structures within Zen institutions. Lachs also observes that the ritual koan interview between a student and master is so presented as to give a sense of timelessness in which the student is made to feel that the procedure is an inherent part of Zen that has existed since the beginning, despite its being an institutional construction. Lachs quotes from Peter Berger&#x27;s analysis of religious legitimation, stating that the point of the ritual is to &quot;let people forget that this order was established by men and continues to be dependent on the consent of men.&quot;

Poceski points out how &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; exegesis deploys certain strategies to deflect criticism or challenges to authority which continue all the way to the present. These often involve the charge that critics lack genuine Chan experience and understanding. As this can be true even for bodhisattvas of the tenth level, this also reflects a sectarian notion that Chan is superior to canonical Buddhism. Poceski says:

A person daring to articulate any sort of meaningful criticism can simply be dismissed as being an unenlightened ignoramus whose mind is filled with shallow views and one-sided attachments. So much for intellectual freedom and the need to question established authority.

According to Poceski, modern publications and popular Zen books tend to be confined to the same strictures and ideological suppositions as the classical sources. A noteworthy element of modern interpretations of &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; material is the tendency to stick uncritically to conventional lines of exegesis that fail to question normative traditions and the untenable assumptions underlying them. This includes the idea that &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; represent timeless truths that must be &quot;unlocked via dedicated Zen practice, undertaken under proper spiritual guidance.&quot; This again reflects a concern for orthodoxy and authority, as it reinforces the modern Zen master as gatekeeper of truth and prime arbiter of value and meaning. In this way, ideological suppositions about &quot;gong&#x27;an&quot; are entwined with social relationships and power structures, as they aim to perpetuate a religious institution whose members derive tangible benefits by virtue of their status in it as maintainers of tradition. For as Lachs points out, advancement within Zen institutions requires a sufficient degree of socialization, and this entails not questioning institutional positions and authority. In regards to this state of affairs, Poceski asks:However, was it not the case that Chan/Zen was supposed to take us in an entirely different direction, away from the familiar intersections of knowledge and power? Wasn&#x27;t it supposed to blow away archaic ideological smokescreens and obliterate all forms of conceptual posturing, rather than conjure or shore them up? Perhaps not, or so it seems.

===Criticism from within the Zen tradition===
Koans have also been criticized from within the Zen tradition at various points throughout history. According to Schlütter, &quot;the practice was common enough to attract criticism&quot; which can be found in Song sources like the &quot;Sengbao zhengxu zhuan&quot; (True continuation of the chronicles of the saṃgha treasure), where one master called Chanti Weizhao &quot;rails against deluded masters who teach people to contemplate (&quot;can&quot;) gongan stories.&quot; The Song era master Foyan Qingyuan (1067–1120) was critical of the use of koans (public cases) and similar stories, arguing that they did not exist during the time of Bodhidharma. He said, &quot;In other places they like to have people look at model case stories, but here we have the model case story of what is presently coming into being; you should look at it, but no one can make you see all the way through such an immense affair.&quot;

According to Arthur Braverman, Bassui Tokushō (1327–1387) &quot;was very critical of the Rinzai practice of studying kōans, perhaps because they were becoming more and more formalized, hence losing their original spirit.&quot; Ikkyū Sōjun (1394–1481) also criticized the mechanical nature of koan practice during his time, in which formulaic answers to koans were preserved and sold.

The unconventional Rinzai master Bankei Yōtaku (1622–1693) famously criticized the kōan method, seeing it as a hopelessly contrived and artificial technique. Bankei referred to kōans disparagingly as &quot;old wastepaper&quot; and referred to Zen masters who required devices in order to guide people as engaging in &quot;devices Zen.&quot; Bankei also criticized the practice of rousing a &quot;great ball of doubt&quot; employed in koan Zen. He said:

&quot;Others tell students pursuing this teaching that it&#x27;s no good unless they rouse a great ball of doubt and succeed in breaking through it. &#x27;No matter what,&#x27; they tell them, &#x27;you&#x27;ve got to rouse a ball of doubt!&#x27; They don&#x27;t teach, &#x27;Abide in the Unborn Buddha Mind!&#x27; [but instead] cause people &quot;without&quot; any ball of doubt to saddle themselves &quot;with&quot; one, making them exchange the Buddha Mind for a ball of doubt. A mistaken business, isn&#x27;t it!&quot;

When asked why he did not make use of koans, Bankei pointed out that Chan masters before Yuanwu and Dahui did not make use of koans either. Bankei observed accurately that koan study represents a later development of Chinese Chan. &quot;In this sense,&quot; Peter Haskel writes, &quot;Bankei was a traditionalist. He harked back to the Zen masters of the &#x27;golden age&#x27; before the triumph of the koan, masters like Lin-chi I-hsüan (J: Rinzai Gigen, d. 860), founder of the Rinzai school.&quot; Similarly, D.T. Suzuki writes, &quot;Bankei can be said to have attempted a return to the Zen of the early T&#x27;ang dynasty.&quot; Bankei said:
&quot;Unlike the other masters everywhere, in my teaching I don&#x27;t set up any particular object, such as realizing enlightenment or studying koans. Nor do I rely on the words of the buddhas and patriarchs. I just point things out directly, so there&#x27;s nothing to hold onto, and that&#x27;s why no one will readily accept [what I teach].&quot;

The Sōtō school emphasizes shikantaza as its main practice, though it does not completely reject the study and use of koans. That being said, some Sōtō figures have criticized the Rinzai style koan method. Gentō Sokuchū (1729–1807), nominated abbot of Eiheiji in 1795, sought to purify the Sōtō school of koans, which he regarded as a foreign influence. More recently, the famous Sōtō master Kodo Sawaki criticized Rinzai koan practice as &quot;stepladder Zen&quot; and said:From the end of the Song Dynasty to the Yuan [and] Ming dynasties techniques developed, and solving koans was the way monks became respected for having had satoris. Well, today [monks] have satoris, which in certain religious sects allows the monks to be candidates to be head priests of temples. That&#x27;s the way they think. But they&#x27;re wrong. Believe in zazen itself, and if you put your whole body into it, that is [true] zazen.

Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu (1889–1980) criticized contemporary koan practice, which moves from one koan to another, as gradualistic and likened it to trying to approximate a circle by forever increasing the number of sides of a polygon. He instead emphasized what he called his &quot;fundamental koan&quot; which he said included all koans. Hisamatsu also said of his fundamental koan that it did not require any guidance from a teacher.

The modern Korean Sŏn master Daehaeng taught that it was not necessary to receive a &quot;hwadu&quot; (the &quot;critical phrase&quot; of a koan) from others since everyone already has their own &quot;original hwadus.&quot; She said:Daily life is itself a hwadu, so there is no need to receive a hwadu from others or to give a hwadu to others. Your very existence is a hwadu. Thus, if you are continuously holding on to a hwadu someone else gave you, when will you be able to solve your original hwadu? Trying to solve another person&#x27;s hwadu is like turning empty millstones or spinning a car&#x27;s wheels without moving forward. Your body itself is a hwadu. Birth itself is a hwadu. Work itself is a hwadu. The vast universe is a hwadu. If you want to add more hwadus to these, when will you be able to taste this infinitely deep world we live in?

===Other criticism===
D.T. Suzuki observes that although the koan method represents a convenience for the Zen practitioner, a form of &quot;grandmotherly kindness,&quot; it is also liable to tend towards formalization and counterfeit. He writes:

The danger lies in the tendency to formalization. It may happen that a petty thief crowing like a cock at dawn will get past the barrier by deceiving the gatekeeper into opening the gates. As a matter of fact, in the koan system such fellows do get past, or we should say rather that they are passed through. The danger that the goods will be sold cheap is something intrinsic to the system. In any construct devised by man a pattern always evolves. When the pattern becomes fixed, the quick of life cannot move within it. When the realm of true reality which is freed of samsaric suffering is treated in such a way that it comes to resemble the fixed gestures and patterned moves learned in a fencing class, Zen ceases to be Zen. At times patterns work well and are useful. And they do have the virtue of universal currency. But by that alone no living thing is produced. I suppose, though, there are some who even find enjoyment in such a counterfeit, lifeless thing, much as they would divert themselves with games of chess or mahjong.

According to Alan Watts, the koan method suffered from two drawbacks. The first is that it can potentially lead to a kind of romanticism for exotic cultural forms. The second was that its method of deliberately rousing great doubt and then breaking through it after an intense period of striving amounted to a kind of psychological trick. Regarding this, Watts says:
The second, and more serious, drawback can arise from the opposition of satori to the intense “feeling of doubt” which some koan exponents so deliberately encourage. For this is to foster a dualistic satori. To say that the depth of the satori is proportional to the intensity of seeking and striving which precede it is to confuse satori with its purely emotional adjuncts. In other words, if one wants to feel exhilaratingly light-footed, it is always possible to go around for some time with lead in one’s shoes–and then take them off. The sense of relief will certainly be proportional to the length of time such shoes have been worn, and to the weight of the lead. This is equivalent to the old trick of religious revivalists who give their followers a tremendous emotional uplift by first implanting an acute sense of sin, and then relieving it through faith in Jesus.

*Hoffmann, Yoel, tr. &quot;The Sound of the One Hand.&quot; Basic Books, 1975. This book contains examples of how some Zen practitioners answer the koans &quot;correctly&quot;.

<text>Karma (, from , ; ) is an ancient Indian concept that refers to an action, work, or deed, and its effect or consequences. In Indian religions, the term more specifically refers to a principle of cause and effect, often descriptively called the principle of karma, wherein individuals&#x27; intent and actions (cause) influence their future (effect): Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and happier rebirths, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and worse rebirths. In some scriptures, however, there is no link between rebirth and karma. Karma is often misunderstood as fate, destiny, or predetermination. Fate, destiny or predetermination has specific terminology in Sanskrit and is called Prarabdha.

The concept of karma is closely associated with the idea of rebirth in many schools of Indian religions (particularly in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism), as well as Taoism. In these schools, karma in the present affects one&#x27;s future in the current life as well as the nature and quality of future lives—one&#x27;s &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. This concept has also been adopted in Western popular culture, in which the events that happen after a person&#x27;s actions may be considered natural consequences of those actions.

==Definition==
The term &quot;karma&quot; (; ) refers to both the executed &#x27;deed, work, action, act&#x27; and the &#x27;object, intent&#x27;.

Wilhelm Halbfass (2000) explains karma (&quot;karman&quot;) by contrasting it with the Sanskrit word &quot;kriya&quot;: whereas &quot;kriya&quot; is the activity along with the steps and effort in action, &quot;karma&quot; is (1) the executed action as a consequence of that activity, as well as (2) the intention of the actor behind an executed action or a planned action (described by some scholars as metaphysical residue left in the actor). A good action creates good karma, as does good intent. A bad action creates bad karma, as does bad intent.

Difficulty in arriving at a definition of karma arises because of the diversity of views among the schools of Hinduism; some, for example, consider karma and rebirth linked and simultaneously essential, some consider karma but not rebirth to be essential, and a few discuss and conclude karma and rebirth to be flawed fiction. Buddhism and Jainism have their own karma precepts. Thus, karma has not one, but multiple definitions and different meanings. It is a concept whose meaning, importance, and scope varies between the various traditions that originated in India, and various schools in each of these traditions. According to Manu Doshi, all Aryan philosophies accept karma but Jainism has gone deeper into this subject. Wendy O&#x27;Flaherty claims that, furthermore, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether karma is a theory, a model, a paradigm, a metaphor, or a metaphysical stance.

=== Principle of karma ===
&quot;Karma&quot; also refers to a conceptual principle that originated in India, often descriptively called the &quot;principle of karma&quot;, and sometimes the &quot;karma-theory&quot; or the &quot;law of karma&quot;.

In the context of theory, &quot;karma&quot; is complex and difficult to define. Different schools of Indology derive different definitions for the concept from ancient Indian texts; their definition is some combination of (1) causality that may be ethical or non-ethical; (2) ethicization, i.e., good or bad actions have consequences; and (3) rebirth. Other Indologists include in the definition that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in the past. These actions may be those in a person&#x27;s current life, or, in some schools of Indian traditions, possibly actions from their past lives; furthermore, the consequences may result in the current life, or a person&#x27;s future lives. The law of karma operates independent of any deity or any process of divine judgment.

==== Causality ====
A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality. This relationship between karma and causality is a central motif in all schools of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain thought. One of the earliest associations of karma to causality occurs in the &quot;Brihadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; verses 4.4.5–6:

The theory of karma as causation holds that: (1) executed actions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives, and (2) the intentions of an individual affects the individual and the life he or she lives. Disinterested actions, or unintentional actions do not have the same positive or negative karmic effect, as interested and intentional actions. In Buddhism, for example, actions that are performed, or arise, or originate without any bad intent, such as covetousness, are considered non-existent in karmic impact or neutral in influence to the individual.

Another causality characteristic, shared by karmic theories, is that &quot;like deeds&quot; lead to &quot;like effects&quot;. Thus, good karma produces good effect on the actor, while bad karma produces bad effect. This effect may be material, moral, or emotional – that is, one&#x27;s karma affects both one&#x27;s happiness and unhappiness. The effect of karma need not be immediate; the effect of karma can be later in one&#x27;s current life, and in some schools it extends to future lives.

The consequence or effects of one&#x27;s karma can be described in two forms: &quot;phala&quot; and &quot;samskara&quot;. A &quot;phala&quot; () is the visible or invisible effect that is typically immediate or within the current life. In contrast, a &quot;samskara&quot; () is an invisible effect, produced inside the actor because of the karma, transforming the agent and affecting his or her ability to be happy or unhappy in their current and future lives. The theory of karma is often presented in the context of &quot;samskaras&quot;.

Karl Potter and Harold Coward suggest that karmic principle can also be understood as a principle of psychology and habit. Karma seeds habits (&quot;vāsanā&quot;), and habits create the nature of man. Karma also seeds self perception, and perception influences how one experiences life-events. Both habits and self perception affect the course of one&#x27;s life. Breaking bad habits is not easy: it requires conscious karmic effort. Thus, psyche and habit, according to Potter and Coward, link karma to causality in ancient Indian literature. The idea of karma may be compared to the notion of a person&#x27;s &#x27;character&#x27;, as both are an assessment of the person and determined by that person&#x27;s habitual thinking and acting.

====Ethicization====
The second theme common to karma theories is ethicization. This begins with the premise that every action has a consequence, which will come to fruition in either this life or a future life; thus, morally good acts will have positive consequences, whereas bad acts will produce negative results. An individual&#x27;s present situation is thereby explained by reference to actions in his present or in previous lifetimes. Karma is not itself &#x27;reward and punishment&#x27;, but the law that produces consequence. Wilhelm Halbfass notes that good karma is considered as &quot;dharma&quot; and leads to &quot;punya&quot; (&#x27;merit&#x27;), while bad karma is considered &quot;adharma&quot; and leads to &quot;pāp&quot; (&#x27;demerit, sin&#x27;).

Reichenbach (1988) suggests that the theories of karma are an ethical theory. This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit, and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor&#x27;s intention. In ethics, one&#x27;s intentions, attitudes, and desires matter in the evaluation of one&#x27;s action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless. A karma theory considers not only the action, but also the actor&#x27;s intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building-block of an ethical theory.

====Rebirth====
The third common theme of karma theories is the concept of reincarnation or the cycle of rebirths (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;). Rebirth is a fundamental concept of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Rebirth, or &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, is the concept that all life forms go through a cycle of reincarnation, that is, a series of births and rebirths. The rebirths and consequent life may be in different realm, condition, or form. The karma theories suggest that the realm, condition, and form depends on the quality and quantity of karma. In schools that believe in rebirth, every living being&#x27;s soul transmigrates (recycles) after death, carrying the seeds of Karmic impulses from life just completed, into another life and lifetime of karmas. This cycle continues indefinitely, except for those who consciously break this cycle by reaching &quot;moksha&quot;. Those who break the cycle reach the realm of gods, those who do not continue in the cycle.

The concept has been intensely debated in ancient literature of India; with different schools of Indian religions considering the relevance of rebirth as either essential, or secondary, or unnecessary fiction. Hiriyanna (1949) suggests rebirth to be a necessary corollary of karma; Yamunacharya (1966) asserts that karma is a fact, while reincarnation is a hypothesis; and Creel (1986) suggests that karma is a basic concept, rebirth is a derivative concept.

The theory of &#x27;karma and rebirth&#x27; raises numerous questions – such as how, when, and why did the cycle start in the first place, what is the relative Karmic merit of one karma versus another and why, and what evidence is there that rebirth actually happens, among others. Various schools of Hinduism realized these difficulties, debated their own formulations – some reaching what they considered as internally consistent theories – while other schools modified and de-emphasized it; a few schools in Hinduism such as Charvakas (or Lokayata) abandoned the theory of &#x27;karma and rebirth&#x27; altogether. Schools of Buddhism consider karma-rebirth cycle as integral to their theories of soteriology.

== Early development ==
The Vedic Sanskrit word  (nominative ) means &#x27;work&#x27; or &#x27;deed&#x27;, often used in the context of Srauta rituals. In the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the word occurs some 40 times. In &quot;Satapatha Brahmana&quot; 1.7.1.5, &quot;sacrifice&quot; is declared as the &quot;greatest&quot; of works; &quot;Satapatha Brahmana&quot; 10.1.4.1 associates the potential of becoming immortal (&quot;amara&quot;) with the karma of the &quot;agnicayana&quot; sacrifice.

In the early Vedic literature, the concept of karma is also present beyond the realm of rituals or sacrifices. The Vedic language includes terms for sins and vices such as āgas, agha, enas, pāpa/pāpman, duṣkṛta, as well as for virtues and merit like sukṛta and puṇya, along with the neutral term karman.

The verse refers to the evaluation of virtuous and sinful actions in the afterlife. Regardless of their application in rituals (whether within or outside the Vedi), the concepts of good and evil here broadly represent merits and sins.

The Vedic words for &quot;action&quot; and &quot;merit&quot; in pre-Upaniṣadic texts carry moral significance and are not solely linked to ritual practices. The word karman simply means &quot;action,&quot; which can be either positive or negative, and is not always associated with religious ceremonies; its predominant association with ritual in the Brāhmaṇa texts is likely a reflection of their ritualistic nature. In the same vein, sukṛta (and subsequently, puṇya) denotes any form of &quot;merit,&quot; whether it be ethical or ritualistic. In contrast, terms such as pāpa and duṣkṛta consistently represent morally wrong actions.

The earliest clear discussion of the karma doctrine is in the &quot;Upanishads&quot;. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death. For example, causality and ethicization is stated in &quot;Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad&quot; 3.2.13:Truly, one becomes good through good &quot;deeds&quot;, and evil through evil &quot;deeds&quot;. Some authors state that the &quot;samsara&quot; (transmigration) and karma doctrine may be non-Vedic, and the ideas may have developed in the &quot;shramana&quot; traditions that preceded Buddhism and Jainism. Others state that some of the complex ideas of the ancient emerging theory of karma flowed from Vedic thinkers to Buddhist and Jain thinkers. The mutual influences between the traditions is unclear, and likely co-developed.

Many philosophical debates surrounding the concept are shared by the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist traditions, and the early developments in each tradition incorporated different novel ideas. For example, Buddhists allowed karma transfer from one person to another and sraddha rites, but had difficulty defending the rationale. In contrast, Hindu schools and Jainism would not allow the possibility of karma transfer.

==In Hinduism==

The concept of karma in Hinduism developed and evolved over centuries. The earliest &quot;Upanishads&quot; began with the questions about how and why man is born, and what happens after death. As answers to the latter, the early theories in these ancient Sanskrit documents include &quot;pancagni vidya&quot; (the five fire doctrine), &quot;pitryana&quot; (the cyclic path of fathers), and &quot;devayana&quot; (the cycle-transcending, path of the gods). Those who perform superficial rituals and seek material gain, claimed these ancient scholars, travel the way of their fathers and recycle back into another life; those who renounce these, go into the forest and pursue spiritual knowledge, were claimed to climb into the higher path of the gods. It is these who break the cycle and are not reborn. With the composition of the Epics – the common man&#x27;s introduction to dharma in Hinduism – the ideas of causality and essential elements of the theory of karma were being recited in folk stories. For example:
The 6th chapter of the &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; (the Teaching Book), the 13th book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, opens with Yudhishthira asking Bhishma: &quot;Is the course of a person&#x27;s life already destined, or can human effort shape one&#x27;s life?&quot; The future, replies Bhishma, is both a function of current human effort derived from free will and past human actions that set the circumstances. Over and over again, the chapters of Mahabharata recite the key postulates of karma theory. That is: intent and action (karma) has consequences; karma lingers and doesn&#x27;t disappear; and, all positive or negative experiences in life require effort and intent. For example:
Over time, various schools of Hinduism developed many different definitions of karma, some making karma appear quite deterministic, while others make room for free will and moral agency. Among the six most studied schools of Hinduism, the theory of karma evolved in different ways, as their respective scholars reasoned and attempted to address the internal inconsistencies, implications and issues of the karma doctrine. According to Professor Wilhelm Halbfass,
* The Nyaya school of Hinduism considers karma and rebirth as central, with some Nyaya scholars such as Udayana suggesting that the Karma doctrine implies that God exists.
* The Vaisesika school does not consider the karma from past lives doctrine very important.
* The Samkhya school considers karma to be of secondary importance (second to &quot;prakrti&quot;).
* The Mimamsa school gives a negligible role to karma from past lives, disregards &quot;samsara&quot; and &quot;moksa&quot;.
* The Yoga school considers karma from past lives to be secondary, one&#x27;s behavior and psychology in the current life is what has consequences and leads to entanglements.
* The Vedanta schools (including Advaita) accept the doctrine of karma, and they hold that it does not function on its own power, instead they think that God (Isvara) is the dispenser of the fruit (phala) of karma. This idea is defended in the &quot;Brahmasutras&quot; (3.2.38).

The above schools illustrate the diversity of views, but are not exhaustive. Each school has sub-schools in Hinduism, such as that of non-dualism and dualism under Vedanta. Furthermore, there are other schools of Indian philosophy, such as Charvaka (or Lokayata; the materialists), that denied the theory of karma-rebirth, as well as the existence of God; to this non-Vedic school, the properties of things come from the nature of things. Causality emerges from the interaction, actions, and nature of things and people, making determinative principles such as karma or God unnecessary.

==In Buddhism==

Karma and &quot;karmaphala&quot; are fundamental concepts in Buddhism, which explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in &quot;samsara&quot;, whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the Noble Eightfold Path, shows us the way out of &quot;samsara&quot;.

The cycle of rebirth is determined by karma, literally &#x27;action&#x27;. &quot;Karmaphala&quot; (wherein &quot;phala&quot; means &#x27;fruit, result&#x27;) refers to the &#x27;effect&#x27; or &#x27;result&#x27; of karma. The similar term &quot;karmavipaka&quot; (wherein &quot;vipāka&quot; means &#x27;ripening&#x27;) refers to the &#x27;maturation, ripening&#x27; of karma.

In the Buddhist tradition, &quot;karma&quot; refers to actions driven by intention (&quot;cetanā&quot;), a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences. The &quot;Nibbedhika Sutta&quot;, Anguttara Nikaya 6.63:

How these intentional actions lead to rebirth, and how the idea of rebirth is to be reconciled with the doctrines of impermanence and no-self, is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed. In early Buddhism, no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out, and &quot;the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.&quot; In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.
Unlike that of Jains, Buddha&#x27;s teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors such as other Niyamas. It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process. There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results. The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed. &quot;Karmaphala&quot; is not a &quot;judgement&quot; enforced by a God, Deity or other supernatural being that controls the affairs of the Cosmos. Rather, &quot;karmaphala&quot; is the outcome of a natural process of cause and effect.
Within Buddhism, the real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process. The &quot;Acintita Sutta&quot; warns that &quot;the results of karma&quot; is one of the four incomprehensible subjects (or &quot;acinteyya&quot;), subjects that are beyond all conceptualization, and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason.

Nichiren Buddhism teaches that transformation and change through faith and practice changes adverse karma—negative causes made in the past that result in negative results in the present and future—to positive causes for benefits in the future.

== In Jainism ==


In Jainism, karma conveys a totally different meaning from that commonly understood in Hindu philosophy and western civilization. Jain philosophy is one of the oldest Indian philosophy that completely separates body (matter) from the soul (pure consciousness). In Jainism, karma is referred to as karmic dirt, as it consists of very subtle particles of matter that pervade the entire universe. Karmas are attracted to the karmic field of a soul due to vibrations created by activities of mind, speech, and body as well as various mental dispositions. Hence the karmas are the subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul. When these two components (consciousness and karma) interact, we experience the life we know at present. Jain texts expound that seven &quot;tattvas&quot; (truths or fundamentals) constitute reality. These are:

# &quot;Jīva&quot;: the soul which is characterized by consciousness
# &quot;Ajīva&quot;: the non-soul
# &quot;Āsrava&quot;: inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
# &quot;Bandha&quot; (bondage): mutual intermingling of the soul and karmas.
# &quot;Samvara&quot; (stoppage): obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
# &quot;Nirjara&quot; (gradual dissociation): separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
# &quot;Mokṣha&quot; (liberation): complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

According to Padmanabh Jaini,

This emphasis on reaping the fruits only of one&#x27;s own karma was not restricted to the Jainas; both Hindus and Buddhist writers have produced doctrinal materials stressing the same point. Each of the latter traditions, however, developed practices in basic contradiction to such belief. In addition to &quot;shrardha&quot; (the ritual Hindu offerings by the son of deceased), we find among Hindus widespread adherence to the notion of divine intervention in ones fate, while Buddhists eventually came to propound such theories like boon-granting bodhisattvas, transfer of merit and like. Only the Jainas have been absolutely unwilling to allow such ideas to penetrate their community, despite the fact that there must have been tremendous amount of social pressure on them to do so.

The relationship between the soul and karma, states Padmanabh Jaini, can be explained with the analogy of gold. Like gold is always found mixed with impurities in its original state, Jainism holds that the soul is not pure at its origin but is always impure and defiled like natural gold. One can exert effort and purify gold, similarly, Jainism states that the defiled soul can be purified by proper refining methodology. Karma either defiles the soul further, or refines it to a cleaner state, and this affects future rebirths. Karma is thus an efficient cause (&quot;nimitta&quot;) in Jain philosophy, but not the material cause (&quot;upadana&quot;). The soul is believed to be the material cause.

The key points where the theory of karma in Jainism can be stated as follows:

* Karma operates as a self-sustaining mechanism as natural universal law, without any need of an external entity to manage them. (absence of the exogenous &#x27;Divine entity&#x27; in Jainism)
* Jainism advocates that a soul attracts &quot;karmic&quot; matter even with the thoughts, and not just the actions. Thus, to even think evil of someone would endure a &quot;karma-bandha&quot; or an increment in bad karma. For this reason, Jainism emphasise on developing Ratnatraya (The Three Jewels): &quot;samyaka darśana&quot; (&#x27;Right Faith&#x27;), &quot;samyaka jnāna&quot; (&#x27;Right Knowledge&#x27;) and &quot;samyaka charitra&quot; (&#x27;Right Conduct&#x27;).
* In Jain theology, a soul is released from worldly affairs as soon as it is able to emancipate from the &quot;karma-bandha&quot;. In Jainism, &quot;nirvana&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; are used interchangeably. &quot;Nirvana&quot; represents annihilation of all karmas by an individual soul and &quot;moksha&quot; represents the perfect blissful state (free from all bondage). In the presence of a &quot;Tirthankara&quot;, a soul can attain &quot;Kevala Jnana&quot; (&#x27;omniscience&#x27;) and subsequently nirvana, without any need of intervention by the Tirthankara.
* The karmic theory in Jainism operates endogenously. Even the &quot;Tirthankaras&quot; themselves have to go through the stages of emancipation, for attaining that state.
* Jainism treats all souls equally, inasmuch as it advocates that all souls have the same potential of attaining nirvana. Only those who make effort really attain it, but nonetheless, each soul is capable on its own to do so by gradually reducing its karma.

===Eight Karmas===
There are eight types of Karma which attach a soul to Samsara (the cycle of birth and death):

# Jnanavarniya (knowledge-obstructing): like a veil prevents a face and its features from being seen, this karma prevents the soul from knowing an object along with details about that object. This karma obstructs the soul from realizing its essential quality of knowledge. In its absence, a soul is omniscient. There are five sub-types of &quot;jnanavarniya&quot; karma which prevents the five types of knowledge: &quot;mati jnana&quot; (sensory knowledge), &quot;shruta jnana&quot; (articulate knowledge), &quot;avadhi jnana&quot; (clairvoyance), &quot;mana paryaya jnana&quot; (telepathy) and &quot;kevala jnana&quot; (omniscience).
# Darshanavarniya (perception-obstructing): like a gatekeeper prevents the sight of the king, this karma prevents an object from being perceived, hiding it. This karma obstructs the soul from realizing its essential quality of perception. In its absence, a soul completely perceives all substances in the universe. There are nine sub-types of this karma. Four of these prevent the four types of perception; visual perception, non-visual perception, clairvoyant perception and omniscient perception. The other five sub-types of darshanavarniya karma bondage induce five kinds of sleep causing reduction in consciousness: light sleep, deep sleep, drowsiness, heavy drowsiness, and sleep-walking.
# Vedaniya (sensation-producing): like licking honey from a sword gives a sweet taste but cuts the tongue, this karma makes a soul experience pleasure and pain. The soul&#x27;s bliss is continuously disturbed by experiences of external sensual pleasure and pain. In the absence of the vedaniya karma, the soul experiences undisturbed bliss. There are two sub-types of this karma; pleasure-producing and pain-producing.
# Mohniya (deluding): like a bee becoming infatuated with the smell of a flower and is attracted to it, this karma attracts the soul to the objects that it considers favorable while repelling it from objects it considers unfavorable. It creates a delusion in the soul that external objects can affect it. This karma obstructs the soul&#x27;s essential quality of happiness and prevents the soul from finding pure happiness in itself.
# Ayu (lifespan-determining): like a prisoner remains trapped by iron chains (around his legs, hands, etc.) this karma keeps a soul trapped in a particular life (or birth).
# Nama (body-producing): like a painter creates various pictures and gives them various names, this karma gives souls various types of bodies (that are classified based on various attributes). It is the &quot;namakarma&quot; which determines the body of living organism into which the soul must enter.
# Gotra (status-determining): like a potter makes short and tall pots, this karma bestows a low or high (societal) status on the body of soul. It creates social inequalities and in its absence, all souls are equal. There are two sub-types of gotra karma: high status and low status.
# Antaraya (power-obstructing): like a treasurer obstructs a king from spending his wealth, this karma prevents the soul from using its innate power for acts of charity, profit, enjoyment, repeated enjoyment and will-power. It obstructs and prevents the soul&#x27;s essential quality of infinite power from manifesting. In its absence, a soul has infinite power.

==Reception in other traditions==
===Sikhism===

In Sikhism, all living beings are described as being under the influence of the three qualities of &quot;maya&quot;. Always present together in varying mix and degrees, these three qualities of &quot;maya&quot; bind the soul to the body and to the earth plane. Above these three qualities is the eternal time. Due to the influence of three modes of &quot;maya&#x27;s&quot; nature, &quot;jivas&quot; (individual beings) perform activities under the control and purview of the eternal time. These activities are called &quot;karma&quot;, wherein the underlying principle is that karma is the law that brings back the results of actions to the person performing them.

This life is likened to a field in which our karma is the seed. We harvest exactly what we sow; no less, no more. This infallible law of karma holds everyone responsible for what the person is or is going to be. Based on the total sum of past karma, some feel close to the Pure Being in this life and others feel separated. This is the law of karma in Gurbani (Sri Guru Granth Sahib). Like other Indian and oriental schools of thought, the Gurbani also accepts the doctrines of karma and reincarnation as the facts of nature.

===Falun Gong===
David Ownby, a scholar of Chinese history at the University of Montreal, asserts that Falun Gong differs from Buddhism in its definition of the term &quot;karma&quot; in that it is taken not as a process of award and punishment, but as an exclusively negative term. The Chinese term &quot;de&quot;, or &#x27;virtue&#x27;, is reserved for what might otherwise be termed &#x27;good karma&#x27; in Buddhism. Karma is understood as the source of all suffering – what Buddhism might refer to as &#x27;bad karma&#x27;. According to Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Gong: &quot;A person has done bad things over his many lifetimes, and for people this results in misfortune, or for cultivators, its karmic obstacles, so there&#x27;s birth, aging, sickness, and death. This is ordinary karma.&quot;

Falun Gong teaches that the spirit is locked in the cycle of rebirth, also known as &quot;samsara&quot;, due to the accumulation of karma. This is a negative, black substance that accumulates in other dimensions lifetime after lifetime, by doing bad deeds and thinking bad thoughts. Falun Gong states that karma is the reason for suffering, and what ultimately blocks people from the truth of the universe and attaining enlightenment. At the same time, karma is also the cause of one&#x27;s continued rebirth and suffering. Li says that due to accumulation of karma, the human spirit upon death will reincarnate over and over again, until the karma is paid off or eliminated through cultivation, or the person is destroyed due to the bad deeds he has done.

Ownby regards the concept of karma as a cornerstone to individual moral behaviour in Falun Gong, and also readily traceable to the Christian doctrine of &quot;one reaps what one sows&quot;. Others say Matthew 5:44 means no unbeliever will not fully reap what they sow until they are judged by God after death in Hell. Ownby says Falun Gong is differentiated by a &quot;system of transmigration&quot;, although, &quot;in which each organism is the reincarnation of a previous life form, its current form having been determined by karmic calculation of the moral qualities of the previous lives lived.&quot; Ownby says the seeming unfairness of manifest inequities can then be explained, at the same time allowing a space for moral behaviour in spite of them. In the same vein of Li&#x27;s &quot;monism&quot;, matter and spirit are one, karma is identified as a black substance which must be purged in the process of cultivation.

According to Li, Human beings all fell here from the many dimensions of the universe. They no longer met the requirements of the Fa at their given levels in the universe, and thus had to drop down. Just as we have said before, the heavier one&#x27;s mortal attachments, the further down one drops, with the descent continuing until one arrives at the state of ordinary human beings.He says that, in the eyes of higher beings, the purpose of human life is not merely to be human, but to awaken quickly on Earth, a &quot;setting of delusion,&quot; and return. &quot;That is what they really have in mind; they are opening a door for you. Those who fail to return will have no choice but to reincarnate, with this continuing until they amass a huge amount of karma and are destroyed.&quot;

Ownby regards this as the basis for Falun Gong&#x27;s apparent &quot;opposition to practitioners&#x27; taking medicine when ill; they are missing an opportunity to work off karma by allowing an illness to run its course (suffering depletes karma) or to fight the illness through cultivation.&quot; Benjamin Penny shares this interpretation. Since Li believes that &quot;karma is the primary factor that causes sickness in people,&quot; Penny asks: &quot;if disease comes from karma and karma can be eradicated through cultivation of &quot;xinxing&quot;, then what good will medicine do?&quot; Li himself states that he is not forbidding practitioners from taking medicine, maintaining that &quot;What I&#x27;m doing is telling people the relationship between practicing cultivation and medicine-taking.&quot; Li also states that &quot;An everyday person needs to take medicine when he gets sick.&quot; Danny Schechter (2001) quotes a Falun Gong student who says &quot;It is always an individual choice whether one should take medicine or not.&quot;

===Taoism===

Karma is an important concept in Taoism. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.

The karma doctrine of Taoism developed in three stages. In the first stage, causality between actions and consequences was adopted, with supernatural beings keeping track of everyone&#x27;s karma and assigning fate (&quot;ming&quot;). In the second phase, transferability of karma ideas from Chinese Buddhism were expanded, and a transfer or inheritance of Karmic fate from ancestors to one&#x27;s current life was introduced. In the third stage of karma doctrine development, ideas of rebirth based on karma were added. One could be reborn either as another human being or another animal, according to this belief. In the third stage, additional ideas were introduced; for example, rituals, repentance and offerings at Taoist temples were encouraged as it could alleviate Karmic burden.

===Shinto===
Interpreted as &quot;musubi&quot;, a view of karma is recognized in Shinto as a means of enriching, empowering, and affirming life. &quot;Musubi&quot; has fundamental significance in Shinto, because creative development forms the basis of the Shinto worldview.

Many deities are connected to musubi and have it in their names.

==Discussion==
===Free will and destiny===

One of the significant controversies with the karma doctrine is whether it always implies destiny, and its implications on free will. This controversy is also referred to as the moral agency problem; the controversy is not unique to karma doctrine, but also found in some form in monotheistic religions.

The free will controversy can be outlined in three parts:

# A person who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, can claim all his bad actions were a product of his karma: he is devoid of free will, he can not make a choice, he is an agent of karma, and he merely delivers necessary punishments his &quot;wicked&quot; victims deserved for their own karma in past lives. Are crimes and unjust actions due to free will, or because of forces of karma?
# Does a person who suffers from the unnatural death of a loved one, or rape or any other unjust act, assume a moral agent is responsible, that the harm is gratuitous, and therefore seek justice? Or, should one blame oneself for bad karma over past lives, and assume that the unjust suffering is fate?
# Does the karma doctrine undermine the incentive for moral education—because all suffering is deserved and consequence of past lives, why learn anything when the balance sheet of karma from past lives will determine one&#x27;s action and sufferings?

The explanations and replies to the above free will problem vary by the specific school of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, that have emphasized current life over the dynamics of karma residue moving across past lives, allow free will. Their argument, as well of other schools, are threefold:

# The theory of karma includes both the action and the intent behind that action. Not only is one affected by past karma, one creates new karma whenever one acts with intent – good or bad. If intent and act can be proven beyond reasonable doubt, new karma can be proven, and the process of justice can proceed against this new karma. The actor who kills, rapes or commits any other unjust act, must be considered as the moral agent for this new karma, and tried.
# Life forms not only receive and reap the consequence of their past karma, together they are the means to initiate, evaluate, judge, give and deliver consequence of karma to others.
# Karma is a theory that explains some evils, not all (cf. moral evil versus natural evil).

Other schools of Hinduism, as well as Buddhism and Jainism that do consider cycle of rebirths central to their beliefs and that karma from past lives affects one&#x27;s present, believe that both free will (&quot;cetanā&quot;) and karma can co-exist; however, their answers have not persuaded all scholars.

===Psychological indeterminacy===
Another issue with the theory of karma is that it is psychologically indeterminate, suggests Obeyesekere (1968). That is, if no one can know what their karma was in previous lives, and if the karma from past lives can determine one&#x27;s future, then the individual is psychologically unclear what if anything he or she can do now to shape the future, be more happy, or reduce suffering. If something goes wrong, such as sickness or failure at work, the individual is unclear if karma from past lives was the cause, or the sickness was caused by curable infection and the failure was caused by something correctable.

This psychological indeterminacy problem is also not unique to the theory of karma; it is found in every religion adopting the premise that God has a plan, or in some way influences human events. As with the karma-and-free-will problem above, schools that insist on primacy of rebirths face the most controversy. Their answers to the psychological indeterminacy issue are the same as those for addressing the free will problem.

===Transferability===
Some schools of Indian religions, particularly within Buddhism, allow transfer of karma merit and demerit from one person to another. This transfer is an exchange of non-physical quality just like an exchange of physical goods between two human beings. The practice of karma transfer, or even its possibility, is controversial. Karma transfer raises questions similar to those with substitutionary atonement and vicarious punishment. It undermines the ethical foundations, and dissociates the causality and ethicization in the theory of karma from the moral agent. Proponents of some Buddhist schools suggest that the concept of karma merit transfer encourages religious giving and that such transfers are not a mechanism to transfer bad karma (i.e., demerit) from one person to another.

In Hinduism, Sraddha rites during funerals have been labelled as karma merit transfer ceremonies by a few scholars, a claim disputed by others. Other schools in Hinduism, such as the Yoga and Advaita Vedantic philosophies, and Jainism hold that karma can not be transferred.

===The problem of evil===
There has been an ongoing debate about karma theory and how it answers the problem of evil and related problem of theodicy. The problem of evil is a significant question debated in monotheistic religions with two beliefs:

# There is one God who is absolutely good and compassionate (omnibenevolent); and
# That one God knows absolutely everything (omniscient) and is all powerful (omnipotent).

The problem of evil is then stated in formulations such as, &quot;why does the omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent God allow any evil and suffering to exist in the world?&quot; Sociologist Max Weber extended the problem of evil to Eastern traditions.

The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Eastern traditions, both in theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in &quot;Uttara Mīmāṃsā&quot; Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1; the 8th century arguments by Adi Sankara in &quot;Brahma Sutra&quot; &quot;bhasya&quot; where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world; and the 11th century theodicy discussion by Ramanuja in &quot;Sri Bhasya&quot;. Epics such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, for example, suggest three prevailing theories in ancient India as to why good and evil exist one being that everything is ordained by God, another being karma, and a third citing chance events (&quot;yadrccha&quot;, यदृच्छा). The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which includes Hindu deity Vishnu in the avatar of Krishna as one of the central characters, debates the nature and existence of suffering from these three perspectives, and includes a theory of suffering as arising from an interplay of chance events (such as floods and other events of nature), circumstances created by past human actions, and the current desires, volitions, dharma, adharma and current actions (&quot;purusakara&quot;) of people. However, while karma theory in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; presents alternative perspectives on the problem of evil and suffering, it offers no conclusive answer.

Other scholars suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some theistic schools do not define or characterize their God(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato&#x27;s Demiurge. Therefore, the problem of theodicy in many schools of major Indian religions is not significant, or at least is of a different nature than in Western religions. Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus. Some scholars, particularly of the Nyaya school of Hinduism and Sankara in &quot;Brahma Sutra bhasya&quot;, have posited that karma doctrine implies existence of god, who administers and affects the person&#x27;s environment given that person&#x27;s karma, but then acknowledge that it makes karma as violable, contingent and unable to address the problem of evil. Arthur Herman states that karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.

Some theistic Indian religions, such as Sikhism, suggest evil and suffering are a human phenomenon and arises from the karma of individuals. In other theistic schools such as those in Hinduism, particularly its Nyaya school, karma is combined with dharma and evil is explained as arising from human actions and intent that is in conflict with dharma. In nontheistic religions such as Buddhism, Jainism and the Mimamsa school of Hinduism, karma theory is used to explain the cause of evil as well as to offer distinct ways to avoid or be unaffected by evil in the world.

Those schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism that rely on karma-rebirth theory have been critiqued for their theological explanation of suffering in children by birth, as the result of his or her sins in a past life. Others disagree, and consider the critique as flawed and a misunderstanding of the karma theory.

==Comparable concepts==
Western culture, influenced by Christianity, holds a notion similar to karma, as demonstrated in the phrase &quot;&quot;.

=== Christianity ===
Mary Jo Meadow suggests karma is akin to &quot;Christian notions of sin and its effects.&quot; She states that the Christian teaching on a Last Judgment according to one&#x27;s charity is a teaching on karma. Christianity also teaches morals such as (Galatians 6:7) and live by the sword, die by the sword (Matthew 26:52). Most scholars, however, consider the concept of Last Judgment as different from karma, with karma as an ongoing process that occurs every day in one&#x27;s life, while Last Judgment, by contrast, is a one-time review at the end of life.

===Judaism===
There is a concept in Judaism called in Hebrew &quot;midah k&#x27;neged midah&quot;, which is often translated as &quot;measure for measure&quot;. The concept is used not so much in matters of law, but rather in matters of divine retribution for a person&#x27;s actions. David Wolpe compared &quot;midah k&#x27;neged midah&quot; to karma.

===Psychoanalysis===
Carl Jung once opined on unresolved emotions and the synchronicity of karma;
Popular methods for negating cognitive dissonance include meditation, metacognition, counselling, psychoanalysis, etc., whose aim is to enhance emotional self-awareness and thus avoid negative karma. This results in better emotional hygiene and reduced karmic impacts. Permanent neuronal changes within the amygdala and left prefrontal cortex of the human brain attributed to long-term meditation and metacognition techniques have been proven scientifically. This process of emotional maturation aspires to a goal of Individuation or self-actualisation. Such peak experiences are hypothetically devoid of any karma (nirvana or moksha).

=== Theosophy ===
The idea of karma was popularized in the Western world through the work of the Theosophical Society. In this conception, karma was a precursor to the Neopagan &quot;law of return&quot; or &quot;Threefold Law,&quot; the idea that the beneficial or harmful effects one has on the world will return to oneself. Colloquially this may be summed up as &#x27;what goes around comes around.&#x27;

Theosophist I. K. Taimni wrote, &quot;Karma is nothing but the Law of Cause and Effect operating in the realm of human life and bringing about adjustments between an individual and other individuals whom he has affected by his thoughts, emotions and actions.&quot; Theosophy also teaches that when humans reincarnate they come back as humans only, not as animals or other organisms.

<text>The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, mainly known as the Knights Templar, was a French military order of the Catholic faith, and one of the wealthiest and most popular military orders in Western Christianity. They were founded in 1118 to defend pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, with their headquarters located there on the Temple Mount, and existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages.

Officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church by such decrees as the papal bull &quot;Omne datum optimum&quot; of Pope Innocent II, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power. The Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. They were prominent in Christian finance; non-combatant members of the order, who made up as much as 90% of their members, managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom. They developed innovative financial techniques that were an early form of banking, building a network of nearly 1,000 commanderies and fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land. 

The Templars were closely tied to the Crusades. As they became unable to secure their holdings in the Holy Land, support for the order faded. Rumours about the Templars&#x27; secret initiation ceremony created distrust, and King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the order, turned this distrust to his own advantage. In 1307, he pressured Pope Clement V to have many of the order&#x27;s members in France arrested, tortured into giving false confessions, and then burned at the stake. Under further pressure, Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312. The abrupt disappearance of a major medieval European institution gave rise to speculation and legends, which have currently kept the &quot;Templar&quot; name alive.

== Names ==
The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon ( and ) are also known as the Order of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, and mainly the Knights Templar (), or simply the Templars (). 

The Temple Mount where they had their headquarters had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon.

== History ==
=== Rise ===
After the Franks in the First Crusade captured Jerusalem from the Fatimid Caliphate in 1099, many Christians made pilgrimages to various sacred sites in the Holy Land. Although the city of Jerusalem was relatively secure under Christian control, the rest of Outremer was not. Bandits and marauding highwaymen preyed upon these Christian pilgrims, who were routinely slaughtered, sometimes by the hundreds, as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at Jaffa through to the interior of the Holy Land.
In 1119, the French knight Hugues de Payens approached King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem, and proposed creating a monastic Catholic religious order for the protection of these pilgrims. King Baldwin and Patriarch Warmund agreed to the request, probably at the Council of Nablus in January 1120, and the king granted the Templars a headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the Temple Mount in the captured Al-Aqsa Mosque.

The order, with about nine knights including Godfrey de Saint-Omer and André de Montbard, had few financial resources and relied on donations to survive. Their emblem was of two knights riding on a single horse, emphasizing the order&#x27;s poverty.
The impoverished status of the Templars did not last long. They had a powerful advocate in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a leading Church figure, the French abbot primarily responsible for the founding of the Cistercian Order of monks and a nephew of André de Montbard, one of the founding knights. Bernard put his weight behind them and wrote persuasively on their behalf in the letter &quot;In Praise of the New Knighthood&quot;, and in 1129, at the Council of Troyes, he led a group of leading churchmen to officially approve and endorse the order on behalf of the church. With this formal blessing, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom, receiving money, land, businesses, and noble-born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the Holy Land. At the Council of Pisa in 1135, Pope Innocent II initiated the first papal monetary donation to the Order. Another major benefit came in 1139, when Innocent II&#x27;s papal bull exempted the order from obedience to local laws. This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders, were not required to pay any taxes and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope. However, in practice, they often had to respect the wishes of the European rulers in whose kingdoms they resided, especially in their handling of funds for the local noblility in their banks.

With its clear mission and ample resources, the order grew rapidly. Templars were often the advance shock troops in key battles of the Crusades, as the heavily armoured knights on their warhorses would charge into the enemy lines ahead of the main army. One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the Battle of Montgisard, where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat Saladin&#x27;s army of more than 26,000 soldiers.

Although the primary mission of the order was military, relatively few members were combatants. The majority acted in support positions to assist the knights and manage their financial infrastructure. Although individual members were sworn to poverty, the Templar Order controlled vast wealth even beyond direct donations. A nobleman participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management during his absence. Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer, in 1150 the order began to issue letters of credit for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land: pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking, received a document indicating the value of their deposit, then showed that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to claim treasure of equal value to their funds. This innovative arrangement was an early form of banking and may have been the first use of bank cheques; it protected pilgrims from robbery, while augmenting Templar finances.

Based on this mix of donations and business dealings, the Templars established financial networks across the whole of Christendom. They acquired large tracts of land, both in Europe and the Middle East; they bought and managed farms and vineyards; they built massive stone cathedrals and castles; they were involved in manufacturing, import, and export; they owned fleets of ships; and at one point they even owned the entire island of Cyprus. The order arguably qualifies as the world&#x27;s first multinational corporation. By the late 12th century the Templars were also politically powerful in the Holy Land. Secular nobles in the Kingdom of Jerusalem began granting them castles and surrounding lands as a defense against the growing threat of the Zengids in Syria. The Templars were even allowed to negotiate with Muslim rulers independently of the feudal lords. The Templar castles became &quot;de facto&quot; independent lordships with their own markets, further growing their political authority. During the regency after the death of King Baldwin IV in 1185, the royal castles were placed in the custody of the Templars and Hospitallers: the grand masters of the two orders, along with the patriarch of Jerusalem, each had a key to the crown jewels.

From the mid-12th century, the Templars were recruited (jointly with the Hospitallers) to fight the Muslim kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula, in addition to their campaigns in the Latin East. In the kingdoms of Castile and León, they obtained some major strongholds (such as Calatrava la Vieja or Coria), but their vulnerability along the border was exposed during the Almohad offensive. In Aragon, the Templars subsumed the Order of Mountjoy in the late 12th century, becoming an important vanguard force on the border, while in Portugal they commanded some castles along the Tagus line. One of these was Tomar, which was unsuccessfully besieged by the Almohad Caliphate in 1190.

Due to the expense of sending a third of their revenues to the East, Templar and Hospitaller activities in the Iberian Peninsula were at a disadvantage to the Hispanic military orders expended all their resources in the region.

=== War ===

Accounts of the Order&#x27;s early military activities in the Levant are vague, though it appears their first battles were defeats, because the Seljuk Turks and other Muslim powers used different tactics than those in Europe at that time. The Templars later adapted to this and became strategic advisors to the leaders of the Crusader states. The first recorded battle involving the Knights Templar was in the town of Teqoa, south of Jerusalem, in 1138. A force of Templars led by their grand master, Robert de Craon (who succeeded Hugues de Payens about a year earlier), was sent to retake the town after it was captured by Muslims. They were initially successful, but the Muslims regrouped outside the town and were able to take it back from the Templars. 

The Order&#x27;s mission developed from protecting pilgrims to taking part in regular military campaigns early on, and this is shown by the fact that the first castle received by the Knights Templar was located four hundred miles north of the pilgrim road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, on the northern frontier of the Principality of Antioch: the castle of Bagras in the Amanus Mountains. It may have been as early as 1131, and by 1137 at the latest, that the Templars were given the mountainous region that formed the border of Antioch and Cilician Armenia, which included the castles of Bagras, Darbsak, and Roche de Roissel. The Templars were there when Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos tried to make the Crusader states of Antioch, Tripoli, and Edessa his vassals between 1137 and 1142. Templar knights accompanied Emperor John II with troops from those states during his campaign against Muslim powers in Syria from 1137 to 1138, including at the sieges of Aleppo and Shaizar. In 1143, the Templars also began taking part in the Reconquista in Iberia at the request of the count of Barcelona. 

In 1147 a force of French, Spanish, and English Templars left France to join the Second Crusade, led by King Louis VII. At a meeting held in Paris on 27 April 1147 they were given permission by Pope Eugenius III to wear the red cross on their uniforms. They were led by the Templar provincial master in France, Everard des Barres, who was one of the ambassadors King Louis sent to negotiate the passage of the Crusader army through the Byzantine Empire on its way to the Holy Land. During the dangerous journey of the Second Crusade through Anatolia, the Templars provided security to the rest of the army from Turkish raids. After the Crusaders arrived in 1148, the kings Louis VII, Conrad III of Germany, and Baldwin III of Jerusalem made the decision to capture Damascus, but their siege in the summer of that year failed and ended with the defeat of the Christian army. In the fall of 1148 some returning Templars took part in the successful siege of Tortosa in Spain, after which one-fifth of that city was given to the Order.

Robert de Craon died in January 1149 and was succeeded as grand master by Everard des Barres, one of the few leaders at the siege of Damascus whose reputation was not damaged by the event. After the Second Crusade, Zengid forces under Nur ad-Din Zengi of Aleppo attacked the Principality of Antioch, and in June 1149 his army defeated the Crusaders at the Battle of Inab, where Prince Raymond of Antioch was killed. King Baldwin III led reinforcements to the principality, which led Nur ad-Din to accept a truce with Antioch and not advance any further. The force with King Baldwin included 120 Templar knights and 1,000 sergeants and squires.

In the winter of 1149 and 1150, King Baldwin III oversaw the reconstruction of the fortress at Gaza City, which had been left in ruins. It was part of the ring of castles that were built along the southern border of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to protect it from raids by the Egyptian Fatimid Caliphate, and specifically from the Fatimid troops at the fortress of Ascalon, which by then was the last coastal city in the Levant still under Muslim control. Gaza was given to the Knights Templar, becoming the first major Templar castle. In 1152 Everard stepped down as grand master for unknown reasons, and his successor was Bernard de Tremelay. In January of the following year, Bernard led the Templars when King Baldwin III led a Crusader army to besiege Ascalon. Several months of fighting went by until the wall of the city was breached in August 1153, at which point Bernard led forty knights into Ascalon. But the rest of the army did not join them and all of the Templars were killed by the Muslim defenders. Ascalon was captured by the rest of the army several days later, and Bernard was eventually succeeded by André de Montbard.

After the fall of Ascalon, the Templars continued operating in that region from their castle at Gaza. In June 1154 they attacked Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh, the vizier of Egypt, when he tried to flee from Cairo to Damascus after losing a power struggle. Abbas was killed and the Templars captured his son, who they later sent back to the Fatimids. In the late 1150s the Egyptians launched raids against the Crusaders in the areas of Gaza and Ascalon.

=== Decline ===

In the mid-12th century, the tide began to turn in the Crusades. The Islamic world had become more united under effective leaders such as Saladin, and the reborn Sunni regime in Egypt. Dissension arose among Christian factions in and concerning the Holy Land. The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian military orders, the Knights Hospitaller and the Teutonic Knights, and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions, both politically and militarily. After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns, including the pivotal Battle of Hattin, Jerusalem was recaptured by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II reclaimed the city for Christians in the Sixth Crusade of 1229, without Templar aid, but only held it for a little more than a decade. In 1244, the Ayyubid dynasty together with Khwarezmi mercenaries recaptured Jerusalem, and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when, during World War I, the British captured it from the Ottoman Empire.

The Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north, such as the seaport of Acre, which they held for the next century. It was lost in 1291, followed by their last mainland strongholds, Tortosa (Tartus in present-day Syria) and Atlit (in present-day Israel). Their headquarters then moved to Limassol on the island of Cyprus, and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny Arwad Island, just off the coast from Tortosa. In 1300, there was some attempt to engage in coordinated military efforts with the Mongols via a new invasion force at Arwad. In 1302 or 1303, however, the Templars lost the island to the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate in the siege of Arwad. With the island gone, the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land.

With the order&#x27;s military mission now less important, support for the organization began to dwindle. The situation was complex, however, since during the two hundred years of their existence, the Templars had become a part of daily life throughout Christendom. The organization&#x27;s Templar Houses, hundreds of which were dotted throughout Europe and the Near East, gave them a widespread presence at the local level. The Templars still managed many businesses, and many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar network, such as by working at a Templar farm or vineyard, or using the order as a bank in which to store personal valuables. The order was still not subject to local government, making it everywhere a &quot;state within a state&quot; – its standing army, although it no longer had a well-defined mission, could pass freely through all borders. This situation heightened tensions with some European nobility, especially as the Templars were indicating an interest in founding their own monastic state, just as the Teutonic Knights had done in Prussia and the Baltic and the Knights Hospitaller were doing in Rhodes.

The Templars were accused of enabling corruption in their ranks which often allowed them to influence the legal systems of Europe to act in their favor and gain influence over local rulers&#x27; lands at the expense of the rulers.

=== Arrests, charges and dissolution ===

In 1305, the new Pope Clement V, based in Avignon, France, sent letters to both the Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay and the Hospitaller Grand Master Fulk de Villaret to discuss the possibility of merging the two orders. Neither was amenable to the idea, but Pope Clement persisted, and in 1306 he invited both grand masters to France to discuss the matter. De Molay arrived first in early 1307, but de Villaret was delayed for several months. While waiting, de Molay and Clement discussed criminal charges that had been made two years earlier by an ousted Templar and were being discussed by King Philip IV of France and his ministers. It was generally agreed that the charges were false, but Clement sent King Philip a written request for assistance in the investigation. According to some historians, Philip, who was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his war against England, decided to seize upon the rumours for his own purposes. He began pressuring the church to take action against the order, as a way of freeing himself from his debts. 

At dawn on Friday, 13 October 1307 – a date that helped influence the superstition, but not necessarily the origin, of the popular stories about Friday the 13th – King Philip IV ordered de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously arrested. The arrest warrant started with the words: (&quot;God is not pleased. We have enemies of the faith in the kingdom&quot;). 

Claims were made that during Templar admissions ceremonies, recruits were forced to spit on the Cross, deny Christ, and engage in indecent kissing; brethren were also accused of worshipping idols, and the order was said to have encouraged homosexual practices. Many of these allegations contain tropes that bear similarities to accusations made against other persecuted groups such as Jews, heretics, and accused witches. These allegations, though, were highly politicised without any real evidence. Still, the Templars were charged with numerous other offences such as financial corruption, fraud, and secrecy. Many of the accused confessed to these charges under torture (even though the Templars denied being tortured in their written confessions), and their confessions, even though obtained under duress, caused a scandal in Paris. The prisoners were coerced to confess that they had spat on the Cross. One said: (&quot;I, Raymond de La Fère, 21 years old, admit that I have spat three times on the Cross, but only from my mouth and not from my heart&quot;). The Templars were accused of idolatry and were charged with worshipping either a figure known as Baphomet or a mummified severed head they recovered, amongst other artefacts, at their original headquarters on the Temple Mount. Some have theorised that this head might have been believed to be that of John the Baptist, among other things.

Relenting to King Phillip&#x27;s demands, Pope Clement then issued the papal bull on 22 November 1307, which instructed all Christian monarchs in Europe to arrest all Templars and seize their assets. Clement called for papal hearings to determine the Templars&#x27; guilt or innocence, and once freed of the Inquisitors&#x27; torture, many Templars recanted their confessions. 

Several Templars are listed as having come from Gisors to defend the Order on 26 February 1310: Henri Zappellans or Chapelain, Anceau de Rocheria, Enard de Valdencia, Guillaume de Roy, Geoffroy de Cera or de La Fere-en-Champagne, Robert Harle or de Hermenonville, and Dreux de Chevru. Some had sufficient legal experience to defend themselves in the trials, but in 1310, having appointed the archbishop of Sens, Philippe de Marigny, to lead the investigation, Philip blocked this attempt, using the previously forced confessions to have dozens of Templars burned at the stake in Paris.

With Philip threatening military action unless the pope complied with his wishes, Clement finally agreed to disband the order, citing the public scandal that had been generated by the confessions. At the Council of Vienne in 1312, he issued a series of papal bulls, including , which officially dissolved the order, and , which turned over most Templar assets to the Hospitallers.
As for the leaders of the order, the elderly Grand Master Jacques de Molay, who had confessed under torture, retracted his confession. Geoffroi de Charney, Preceptor of Normandy, also retracted his confession and insisted on his innocence. Both men, under pressure from the king, were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics and sentenced to burn alive at the stake in Paris on 18 March 1314. De Molay reportedly remained defiant to the end, asking to be tied in such a way that he could face the Notre Dame Cathedral and hold his hands together in prayer. According to legend, he called out from the flames that both Pope Clement and King Philip would soon meet him before God. His actual words were recorded on the parchment as follows: (&quot;God knows who is wrong and has sinned. Soon a calamity will occur to those who have condemned us to death&quot;). Clement died only a month later, and Philip died while hunting within the same year.

The remaining Templars around Europe were either arrested and tried under the Papal investigation (with virtually none convicted), absorbed into other Catholic military orders, or pensioned off and allowed to live out their days peacefully. By papal decree, the property of the Templars was transferred to the Knights Hospitaller except in the Kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal. Portugal was the first country in Europe where they had settled, occurring only two or three years after the order&#x27;s foundation in Jerusalem and even having a presence during Portugal&#x27;s conception.

The Portuguese king, Denis I, refused to pursue and persecute the former knights, as had occurred in some other states under the influence of Philip &amp; the crown. Under his protection, Templar organizations simply changed their name, from &quot;Knights Templar&quot; to the reconstituted Order of Christ and also a parallel Supreme Order of Christ of the Holy See; both are considered successors to the Knights Templar.

=== Chinon Parchment ===
In September 2001, a document known as the Chinon Parchment dated 17–20 August 1308 was discovered in the Vatican Archives by Barbara Frale, apparently after having been filed in the wrong place in 1628. It is a record of the trial of the Templars and shows that Clement absolved the Templars of all heresies in 1308 before formally disbanding the order in 1312, as did another Chinon Parchment dated 20 August 1308 addressed to Philip IV of France, also mentioning that all Templars that had confessed to heresy were &quot;restored to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church&quot;. This other Chinon Parchment has been well known to historians, having been published by Étienne Baluze in 1693 and by Pierre Dupuy in 1751.

The current position of the Roman Catholic Church is that the medieval persecution of the Knights Templar was unjust, that nothing was inherently wrong with the order or its rule, and that Pope Clement was pressed into his actions by the magnitude of the public scandal and by the dominating influence of King Philip IV, who was Clement&#x27;s relative.

== Organization ==

The Templars were organised as a monastic order similar to Bernard&#x27;s Cistercian Order, which was considered the first effective international organization in Europe. The organizational structure had a strong chain of authority. Each country with a major Templar presence (France, Poitou, Anjou, Jerusalem, England, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Tripoli, Antioch, Hungary, and Croatia) had a master of the Order for the Templars in that region.

All of them were subject to the grand master, appointed for life, who oversaw both the order&#x27;s military efforts in the East and their financial holdings in the West. The grand master exercised his authority via the visitors-general of the order, who were knights specially appointed by the grand master and convent of Jerusalem to visit the different provinces, correct malpractices, introduce new regulations, and resolve important disputes. The visitors-general had the power to remove knights from office and to suspend the master of the province concerned.

The central headquarters of the Templars had several offices that answered to the grand master. These were held as temporary appointments rather than for life. The second-in-command of the Order was the seneschal. The highest ranking military official was the marshal, while the preceptor (who was also sometimes called the commander) was responsible for the administration and provisions. The draper was responsible for their uniforms, the treasurer was in charge of finance, the turcopolier commanded auxiliary forces, and the prior was the head of the church at the headquarters. The headquarters and its most senior officials were known as the convent and its role was to assist and advise the grand master with running the administration of the Order.

No precise numbers exist, but it is estimated that at the order&#x27;s peak, there were between 15,000 and 20,000 Templars, of whom about a tenth were actual knights.

=== Ranks within the order ===

==== Three main ranks ====
There was a threefold division of the ranks of the Templars: the noble knights, the non-noble sergeants, and the chaplains. The knights wear white mantles to symbolise their purity and chastity. The sergeants wore black or brown. All three classes of brothers wore the order&#x27;s red cross. Before they received their monastic rule in 1129 at the Council of Troyes, the Templars were referred to only as knights (&quot;milites&quot; in Latin), and after 1129 they were also called brothers of their monastic order. Therefore the three main ranks were eventually known as knight brothers, sergeant brothers, and chaplain brothers. Knights and chaplains were referred to as brothers by 1140, but sergeants were not full members of the Order at first, and this did not change until the 1160s.

The knights were the most visible division of the order. They were equipped as heavy cavalry, with three or four horses and one or two squires. Squires were generally not members of the order but were instead outsiders who were hired for a set period of time. The Templars did not perform knighting ceremonies, so anyone wishing to become a knight in the Templar had to be a knight already.

Beneath the knights in the order and drawn from non-noble families were the sergeants. They brought vital skills and trades from blacksmiths and builders, including administration of many of the order&#x27;s European properties. In the Crusader States, they fought alongside the knights as light cavalry with a single horse. Several of the order&#x27;s most senior positions were reserved for sergeants, including the post of Commander of the Vault of Acre, who was also the &quot;de facto&quot; admiral of the Templar fleet. But he was subordinated to the Order&#x27;s preceptor instead of the marshal, indicating that the Templars considered their ships to be mainly for commerce rather than military purposes.

From 1139, chaplains constituted a third Templar rank. They were ordained priests who cared for the Templars&#x27; spiritual needs. These Templar clerics were also referred to as priest brothers or chaplain brothers.

The Templars also employed lightly armed mercenaries as cavalry in the 12th century that were known as turcopoles (the Greek term for descendants of Turks). Its meaning has been interpreted as either referring to people of a mixed Muslim-Christian heritage who became Christians, or members of the local population in Syria. Sometime in the 13th century, turcopole became a formal rank held by Templar brothers, including Latin Christians.

==== Grand masters ====
Starting with founder Hugues de Payens, the order&#x27;s highest office was that of grand master, a position which was held for life, though considering the martial nature of the order, this could mean a very short tenure. All but two of the grand masters died in office, and several died during military campaigns. For example, during the Siege of Ascalon in 1153, Grand Master Bernard de Tremelay led a group of 40 Templars through a breach in the city walls. When the rest of the Crusader army did not follow, the Templars, including their grand master, were surrounded and beheaded. Grand master Gérard de Ridefort was beheaded by Saladin in 1189 at the Siege of Acre.

The grand master oversaw all of the operations of the order, including both the military operations in the Holy Land and Eastern Europe and the Templars&#x27; financial and business dealings in Western Europe. Some grand masters also served as battlefield commanders, though this was not always wise: several blunders in de Ridefort&#x27;s combat leadership contributed to the devastating defeat at the Battle of Hattin. The last grand master was Jacques de Molay, burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 by order of King Philip IV.

=== Conduct, uniform and beards ===
Bernard de Clairvaux and founder Hugues de Payens devised a specific code of conduct for the Templar Order, known to modern historians as the Latin Rule. Its 72 clauses laid down the details of the knights&#x27; way of life, including the types of garments they were to wear and how many horses they could have. Knights were to take their meals in silence, eat meat no more than three times per week, and not have physical contact of any kind with women, even members of their own family. A master of the Order was assigned &quot;four horses, and one chaplain-brother, and one clerk with three horses, and one sergeant brother with two horses, and one gentleman valet to carry his shield and lance, with one horse&quot;. As the order grew, more guidelines were added, and the original list of 72 clauses was expanded to several hundred in its final form.

The daily schedule of the order adhered to the canonical hours in the &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot;, with communal prayers designated at specific hours throughout the day. Members unable to participate must recite the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; at the same hours.

The knights wore a white surcoat with a red cross, and a white mantle also with a red cross; the sergeants wore a black tunic with a red cross on the front and a black or brown mantle. The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at the Council of Troyes in 1129, and the cross was most probably added to their robes at the launch of the Second Crusade in 1147, when Pope Eugenius III, King Louis VII of France, and many other notables attended a meeting of the French Templars at their headquarters near Paris. Under the Rule, the knights were to wear the white mantle at all times: They were even forbidden to eat or drink unless wearing it.

The red cross that the Templars wore on their robes was a symbol of martyrdom, and to die in combat was considered a great honour that assured a place in heaven. There was a cardinal rule that the warriors of the order should never surrender unless the Templar flag had fallen, and even then they were first to try to regroup with another of the Christian orders, such as that of the Hospitallers. Only after all flags had fallen were they allowed to leave the battlefield. This uncompromising principle, along with their reputation for courage, excellent training, and heavy armament, made the Templars one of the most feared combat forces in medieval times.

Although not prescribed by the Templar Rule, it later became customary for members of the order to wear long and prominent beards. In about 1240, Alberic of Trois-Fontaines described the Templars as an &quot;order of bearded brethren&quot;; while during the interrogations by the papal commissioners in Paris in 1310–1311, out of nearly 230 knights and brothers questioned, 76 are described as wearing a beard, in some cases specified as being &quot;in the style of the Templars&quot;, and 133 are said to have shaved off their beards, either in renunciation of the order or because they had hoped to escape detection.

Initiation, known as &quot;reception&quot; (&quot;receptio&quot;) into the order, was a profound commitment and involved a solemn ceremony. Outsiders were discouraged from attending the ceremony, which aroused the suspicions of medieval inquisitors during the later trials. New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the order and vow to &quot;God and Our Lady&quot; (mother of Jesus) poverty, chastity, piety, obedience to the master of the order, and to conquer the Holy Land of Jerusalem. They were then promised &quot;the bread and water and poor clothing of the house and much pain and suffering&quot;.

Most brothers joined for life, although some were allowed to join for a set period. Sometimes a married man was allowed to join if he had his wife&#x27;s permission, but a married brother was not allowed to wear the white mantle.

== Legacy ==


With their military mission and extensive financial resources, the Knights Templar funded a large number of building projects around Europe and the Holy Land. Many of these structures are still standing. Many sites also maintain the name &quot;Temple&quot; because of centuries-old association with the Templars. For example, some of the Templars&#x27; lands in London were later rented to lawyers, which led to the names of the Temple Bar gateway and the Temple Underground station. Two of the four Inns of Court which may call members to act as barristers are the Inner Temple and Middle Temple – the entire area known as Temple, London.

Distinctive architectural elements of Templar buildings include the use of the image of &quot;two knights on a single horse&quot;, representing the Knights&#x27; poverty, and round buildings designed to resemble the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

=== Modern organizations ===
The Knights Templar were dismantled in the Rolls of the Catholic Church in 1309. Following the suppression of the Order, a number of Knights Templar joined the newly established Order of Christ, which effectively reabsorbed the Knights Templar and its properties in AD 1319, especially in Portugal. The story of the persecution and sudden dissolution of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars has drawn many other groups to use alleged connections with them as a way of enhancing their own image and mystery. Apart from the Order of Christ, there is no clear historical connection between the Knights Templar and any other modern organization, the earliest of which emerged publicly in the 18th century. 

==== Order of Christ ====
Following the dissolution of the Knights Templar, the Order of Christ was erected in 1319 and absorbed many of the Knights Templar into its ranks, along with Knights Templar properties in Portugal. Its headquarters became a castle in Tomar, a former Knights Templar castle. 

The Military Order of Christ consider themselves the successors of the former Knights Templar. After the Templars were abolished on 22 March 1312, the Order of Christ was founded in 1319 under the protection of the Portuguese king Denis, who refused to persecute the former knights. Denis revived the Templars of Tomar as the Order of Christ, grateful for their aid during the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and in the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars. Denis negotiated with Clement&#x27;s successor John XXII for recognition of the new order and its right to inherit Templar assets and property. This was granted in the papal bull &quot;Ad ea ex quibus&quot; of 14 March 1319. The Portuguese brought the Order of Christ with them to Kongo and Brazil, where the Order of Christ continues to be awarded; the Vatican additionally has awarded the Supreme Order of Christ.

==== Temperance movement ====

Many temperance organizations named themselves after the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, citing the belief that the original Knights Templar &quot;drank sour milk, and also because they were fighting &#x27;a great crusade&#x27; against &#x27;this terrible vice&#x27; of alcohol&quot;. The largest of these, the International Order of Good Templars (IOGT), grew throughout the world after being started in the 19th century and continues to advocate for the abstinence from alcohol and other drugs; other Orders in this tradition include those of the Templars of Honor and Temperance (Tempel Riddare Orden), which has a large presence in Scandinavia.

==== Freemasonry ====
Freemasonry has incorporated the symbols and rituals of several medieval military orders in a number of Masonic bodies since at least the 18th century. This can be seen in the &quot;Red Cross of Constantine,&quot; inspired by the Military Constantinian Order; the &quot;Order of Malta,&quot; inspired by the Knights Hospitaller; and the &quot;Order of the Temple&quot;, inspired by the Knights Templar. The Orders of Malta and the Temple feature prominently in the York Rite. Though some have claimed a link between the historical Knights Templar of the 14th century through members who allegedly took refuge in Scotland and aided Robert the Bruce, this theory has been rejected by both Freemasons and historians.
==== Neo-Templarism ====
Neo-Templarism is a term used to describe movements that claim to be direct continuations of the original Templars. The Templar degree system in Freemasonry built off an idea that Templars had embedded themselves within Freemasonry; however, some Freemasons believed the Templar degrees were not subordinate to masonry and were their own system. This culminated in 1805, when Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, a physician who refused to acknowledge the authority of the Catholic Church, created a revivalist Templar movement, claiming he had discovered a document that revealed an unbroken history of Templar grand masters to the present day. Fabré-Palaprat declared himself the grand master of his revivalist order. This began a long series of revival orders involving various schisms, which Fabré-Palaprat is usually regarded as the originator of; Fabré-Palaprat&#x27;s organization eventually evolved into the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem. The idea that these orders have legitimate descent from the Templars has been criticized by scholars of Templar history as dubious and tied to false claims.

=== Modern popular culture ===
The Knights Templar have been associated with legends circulated even during their time. Many orders, such as the freemasons, claimed to have received esoteric wisdom from the Templars, or were direct descendants of the order. Masonic writers added their own speculations in the 18th century, and further fictional embellishments have been added in popular novels such as &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;, and &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;; modern movies such as &quot;National Treasure&quot;, &quot;The Last Templar&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;; the television series &quot;Knightfall&quot;; as well as video games such as &quot;Broken Sword&quot;, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;.

The Templars were the subject of many conspiracy theories and legends. A legend is that when Louis XVI was executed, a freemason dipped a cloth in the king&#x27;s blood and said, &quot;Jacques de Molay, you are avenged.&quot;, the idea being that the king of France was responsible for destroying the Knights Templar back then. A theory states that they are still existent and running a secret conspiracy to preserve the bloodline of Jesus.

There have been speculative popular publications surrounding the order&#x27;s early occupation of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem as well as speculation about what relics the Templars may have found there. The association of the Holy Grail with the Templars has precedents even in 12th-century fiction; Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot; calls the knights guarding the Grail Kingdom &quot;templeisen&quot;, apparently a conscious fictionalization of the &quot;templarii&quot;.

<text>Kazaa Media Desktop ( ) (once stylized as &quot;KaZaA&quot;, but later usually written &quot;Kazaa&quot;) was a peer-to-peer file sharing application using the FastTrack protocol licensed by Joltid Ltd. and operated as Kazaa by Sharman Networks. Kazaa was subsequently under license as a legal music subscription service by Atrinsic, Inc., which lasted until August 2012.

Kazaa Media Desktop was commonly used to exchange MP3 music files and other file types, such as videos, applications, and documents over the Internet. The Kazaa Media Desktop client could be downloaded free of charge; however, it was bundled with adware and for a period there were &quot;No spyware&quot; warnings found on Kazaa&#x27;s website. During the years of Kazaa&#x27;s operation, Sharman Networks and its business partners and associates were the target of copyright-related lawsuits, related to the content distributed via Kazaa Media Desktop on the FastTrack protocol.

By August 2012, the Kazaa website was no longer active.

== History ==
Kazaa and FastTrack were originally created and developed by Estonian programmers from BlueMoon Interactive including Jaan Tallinn and sold to Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennström and Danish programmer Janus Friis (who were later to create Skype and later still Joost and Rdio). Kazaa was introduced by the Dutch company Consumer Empowerment in March 2001, near the end of the first generation of P2P networks typified by the shutdown of Napster in July 2001. Skype itself was based on Kazaa&#x27;s P2P backend, which allowed users to make a call by directly connecting them with each other.

Initially, some users of the Kazaa network were users of the Morpheus client program, formerly made available by MusicCity. Eventually, the official Kazaa client became more widespread. In February 2002, when Morpheus developers failed to pay license fees, Kazaa developers used an automatic update ability to shut out Morpheus clients by changing the protocol. Morpheus later became a client of the gnutella network.

== Lawsuits ==
Consumer Empowerment was sued in the Netherlands in 2001 by the Dutch music publishing body, Buma/Stemra. The court ordered Kazaa&#x27;s owners to take steps to prevent its users from violating copyrights or else pay a heavy fine. In October 2001 a lawsuit was filed against Consumer Empowerment by members of the music and motion picture industry in the US. In response Consumer Empowerment sold the Kazaa application to Sharman Networks, headquartered in Australia and incorporated in Vanuatu. In late March 2002, a Dutch court of appeal reversed an earlier judgment and stated that Kazaa was not responsible for the actions of its users. Buma/Stemra lost its appeal before the Dutch Supreme Court in December 2003.

In 2003, Kazaa signed a deal with Altnet and Streamwaves to try to convert users to paying, legal customers. Searchers on Kazaa were offered a free 30-second sample of songs for which they were searching and directed to sign up for the full-featured Streamwaves service.

However, Kazaa&#x27;s new owner, Sharman, was sued in Los Angeles by the major record labels and motion pictures studios and a class of music publishers. The other defendants in that case (Grokster and MusicCity, makers of the Morpheus file-sharing software) initially prevailed against the plaintiffs on summary judgment (Sharman joined the case too late to take advantage of that ruling). The summary judgment ruling was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but was unanimously reversed by the US Supreme Court in a decision titled &quot;MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.&quot;

Following that ruling in favor of the plaintiff labels and studios, Grokster almost immediately settled the case. Shortly thereafter, on 27 July 2006, it was announced that Sharman had also settled with the record industry and motion picture studios. As part of that settlement, the company agreed to pay $100 million in damages to the four major music companies—Universal Music, Sony BMG, EMI and Warner Music—and an undisclosed amount to the studios. Sharman also agreed to convert Kazaa into a legal music download service. Like the creators of similar products, Kazaa&#x27;s owners have been taken to court by music publishing bodies to restrict its use in the sharing of copyrighted material.

While the U.S. action was still pending, the record industry commenced proceedings against Sharman on its home turf. In February 2004, the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) announced its own legal action against Kazaa, alleging massive copyright breaches. The trial began on 29 November 2004. On 6 February 2005, the homes of two Sharman Networks executives and the offices of Sharman Networks in Australia were raided under a court order by ARIA to gather evidence for the trial.

On 5 September 2005, the Federal Court of Australia issued a landmark ruling that Sharman, though not itself guilty of copyright infringement, had &quot;authorized&quot; Kazaa users illegally to swap copyrighted songs. The court ruled six defendants—including Kazaa&#x27;s owners Sharman Networks, Sharman&#x27;s Sydney-based boss Nikki Hemming and associate Kevin Bermeister—had knowingly allowed Kazaa users illegally to swap copyrighted songs. The company was ordered to modify the software within two months (a ruling enforceable only in Australia). Sharman and the other five parties faced paying millions of dollars in damages to the record labels that instigated the legal action.

On 5 December 2005, the Federal Court of Australia ceased downloads of Kazaa in Australia after Sharman Networks failed to modify their software by the 5 December deadline. Users with an Australian IP address were greeted with the message &quot;Important Notice: The download of the Kazaa Media Desktop by users in Australia is not permitted&quot; when visiting the Kazaa website. Sharman planned to appeal against the Australian decision, but ultimately settled the case as part of its global settlement with the record labels and studios in the United States.

In yet another set of related cases, in September 2003, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) filed suit in civil court against several private individuals who had shared large numbers of files with Kazaa; most of these suits were settled with monetary payments averaging $3,000. Sharman Networks responded with a lawsuit against the RIAA, alleging that the terms of use of the network were violated and that unauthorized client software (such as Kazaa Lite) was used in the investigation to track down the individual file sharers. An effort to throw out this suit was denied in January 2004. However, that suit was also settled in 2006 (see above).

Most recently, in Duluth, Minnesota, the recording industry sued Jammie Thomas-Rasset, a 30-year-old single mother. On 5 October 2007, Thomas was ordered to pay the six record companies (Sony BMG, Arista Records LLC, Interscope Records, UMG Recordings Inc., Capitol Records Inc. and Warner Bros. Records Inc.) $9,250 for each of the 24 songs they had focused on in this case. She was accused of sharing a total of 1,702 songs through her Kazaa account. Along with attorney fees, this would have cost Thomas half a million dollars. Thomas testified that she does not have a Kazaa account, but her testimony was complicated by the fact that she had replaced her computer&#x27;s hard drive after the alleged downloading took place, and later than she originally said in a pre-trial deposition. Thomas-Rasset appealed the verdict and was given a new trial. In June 2009 that jury awarded the recording industry plaintiffs a judgment of $80,000 per song, or $1.92 million. This is less than half of the $150,000 amount authorized by statute. The federal court found the award &quot;monstrous and shocking&quot; and reduced it to $54,000. The recording industry offered to accept a settlement of $25,000, with the money going to charities that support musicians. Apparently undaunted, Thomas-Rasset was able to obtain a third trial on the issue of damages. In November 2010 she was again ordered to pay for her violation, this time $62,500 per song, for a total of $1.5 million. Her attorneys raised a challenge to the constitutional validity of massive statutory damages, where actual damages would have been $24. But this challenge was rejected by the supreme court in 2013. The final judgement against Thomas-Rasset was $222,000.

== Bundled malware ==

In 2006 StopBadware.org identified Kazaa as a spyware application. They identified the following components:
* Cydoor (spyware): Collects information on the PC&#x27;s surfing habits and passes it on to Cydoor Desktop Media.
* B3D (adware): An add-on which causes advertising popups if the PC accesses a website which triggers the B3D code.
* Altnet (adware): A distribution network for paid &quot;gold&quot; files.
* The Best Offers (adware): Tracks user&#x27;s browsing habits and internet usage to display advertisements similar to their interests.
* InstaFinder (hijacker): Redirects URL typing errors to InstaFinder&#x27;s web page instead of the standard search page.
* TopSearch (adware): Displays paid songs and media related to a Kazaa search.
* RX Toolbar (spyware): The toolbar monitors all sites visited with Microsoft Internet Explorer and provides links to competitors&#x27; websites.
* New.net (hijacker): A browser plugin that allowed users to access several of its own unofficial Top Level Domain names, e.g., .chat and .shop. The main purpose of this was to sell domain names such as www.record.shop which is actually www.record.shop.new.net (ICANN did not allow third-party registration of generic top level domains until 2012).

In response, &quot;clean&quot; third-party clients such as Kazaa Lite (which also provided slightly extended functionality) gained popularity with Kazaa users. First released in April 2002, by mid-2005 Kazaa Lite was almost as widely used as the official Kazaa client itself. As it connected to the same FastTrack network, it could exchange files with all Kazaa users.

== Transitional period ==

Kazaa&#x27;s legal issues ended after a settlement of $100 million in reparations to the recording industry. Without further recourse, and until the lawsuit was settled, the RIAA actively sued thousands of people across the U.S. for sharing copyrighted music over the network. Particularly, students were targeted and most were threatened with a penalty of $750 per song. Although the lawsuits were mainly in the U.S., other countries also began to follow suit. Beginning in 2008, however, RIAA announced an end to individual lawsuits.

While Napster lasted just three years, Kazaa survived much longer. However, the lawsuits (and a failed venture into a legal, monthly music subscription service similar to Napster) eventually ended the company.

<text>The is a traditional Japanese garment and the national dress of Japan. The kimono is a wrapped-front garment with square sleeves and a rectangular body, and is worn left side wrapped over right, unless the wearer is deceased. The kimono is traditionally worn with a broad sash, called an , and is commonly worn with accessories such as zōri sandals and socks.

Kimono have a set method of construction and are typically made from a long, narrow bolt of cloth known as a , though Western-style fabric bolts are also sometimes used. There are different types of kimono for men, women, and children, varying based on the occasion, the season, the wearer&#x27;s age, and – less commonly in the modern day – the wearer&#x27;s marital status. Despite the kimono&#x27;s reputation as a formal and difficult-to-wear garment, there are types of kimono suitable for both formal and informal occasions. The way a person wears their kimono is known as .

The history of the kimono can be tracked back to the Heian period (794–1185), when Japan&#x27;s nobility embraced a distinctive style of clothing. Formerly the most common Japanese garment, the kimono has fallen out of favor and is rarely worn as everyday dress now. They are most often seen at summer festivals, where people frequently wear the , the most informal type of kimono. More formal types are worn to funerals, weddings, graduations, and other formal events. Geisha and are required to wear a kimono as part of their profession, and (sumo wrestlers) must wear kimonos at all times in public. Despite the small number of people who wear it regularly and its reputation as a complicated garment, the kimono has experienced a number of revivals in previous decades, and is still worn today as fashionable clothing in Japan.

==History==

=== Yamato period to Nara period (300–794) ===
The first instances of kimono-like garments in Japan were traditional Chinese clothing introduced to Japan via Chinese envoys in the Kofun period (300–538 CE; the first part of the Yamato period), through immigration between the two countries and envoys to the Tang dynasty court leading to Chinese styles of dress, appearance, and culture becoming extremely popular in Japanese court society. The Imperial Japanese court quickly adopted Chinese styles of dress and clothing, with evidence of the oldest samples of tie-dyed fabric stored at the Shōsōin Temple being of Chinese origin, due to the limitations of Japan&#x27;s ability to produce the fabrics at the time. As early as the 4th century CE, images of priestess-queens and tribal chiefs in Japan depicted figures wearing clothing similar to that of Han dynasty China.

In 718 CE, the &quot;Yoro&quot; clothing code was instituted, which stipulated that all robes had to be overlapped at the front with a left-to-right closure, following typical Chinese fashions. This convention of wear is still followed today, with a right-to-left closure worn only by the deceased.

Clothing used by the upper classes was significantly simpler to don and wear than dress from the following Heian period. Sleeves, while narrow, were long enough to cover the fingers, since status was associated with covering more of the body.

=== Heian period to Azuchi–Momoyama period (794–1600)===
During the Heian period (794–1193 CE), Japan stopped sending envoys to the Chinese dynastic courts. This prevented Chinese-imported goods—including clothing—from entering the Imperial Palace. This also prevented dissemination to the upper classes, who were the main arbiters of traditional Japanese culture at the time, and the only people allowed to wear such clothing. The ensuing cultural vacuum facilitated the development of a Japanese culture independent from Chinese fashions. Elements previously lifted from the Tang Dynastic courts developed independently into what is known literally as &quot;national culture&quot; or . The term is used to refer to Heian-period Japanese culture, particularly that of the upper classes.

Women&#x27;s clothing in the imperial palace became increasingly stylised in the formal , with some elements being abandoned by both male and female courtiers, such as the round-necked and tube-sleeved jacket worn by both genders in the early 7th century. Others, such as the wrapped front robes also worn by men and women, were kept. Some elements, such as the skirt worn by women, continued to in a reduced capacity, worn only to formal occasions; the grew too narrow to wrap all the way around and became a trapezoidal pleated train. Hakama (trousers) became longer than the legs and also trailed behind the wearer.

During the later Heian period, various clothing edicts reduced the number of layers a woman could wear, leading to the () garment—previously considered underwear—becoming outerwear by the time of the Muromachi period (1336–1573 CE). Originally worn with , the began to be held closed with a small belt known as an instead. The resembled a modern kimono, though at this time the sleeves were sewn shut at the back and were smaller in width (shoulder seam to cuff) than the body of the garment. During the Sengoku period (1467–1615) and the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600), the decoration of the developed further, with bolder designs and flashy colours becoming popular. By this time, separate lower-body garments, such as the and , were almost never worn, allowing full-length patterns to be seen.

=== Edo period (1603–1867)===
During the Edo period (1603–1867 CE), both Japan&#x27;s culture and economy developed significantly. A particular factor in the development of the Edo period was the early Genroku period (1688–1704 CE), wherein &quot;Genroku culture&quot; – luxurious displays of wealth and increased patronage of the arts – led to the further development of many art forms, including those of clothing. Genroku culture was led by the growing and increasingly-powerful merchant classes (), whose clothing was representative of their increasing economic power and rivaled the aristocracy and samurai classes, shown by their brightly-coloured kimono that utilised expensive production techniques, such as hand-painted dyework. , a damask fabric, also became the preferred material for kimono at this time, replacing the previously-popular plain-weave silk, which had been used to create .

In response to the increasing material wealth of the merchant classes, the Tokugawa shogunate issued a number of sumptuary laws on kimono for the lower classes, prohibiting the use of purple or red fabric, gold embroidery, and the use of intricately dyed patterns. As a result, a school of aesthetic thought known as &quot;Iki&quot; developed. They valued and prioritised the display of wealth through an almost mundane appearance, and the concept of kimono design and wear continues to this day as a major influence.

From this point onwards, the basic shape of both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kimono remained largely unchanged. The sleeves of the began to grow in length, especially amongst unmarried women, and the became much longer and wider, with various styles of knots coming into fashion, alongside stiffer weaves of material to support them.

In the Edo period, the kimono market was divided into craftspeople, who made the and accessories, , or wholesalers, and retailers.

===Modern period===
====Meiji period (1868–1912)====
In 1869, the social class system was abolished, and with them, class-specific sumptuary laws. Kimono with formerly-restricted elements, like red and purple colours, became popular, particularly with the advent of synthetic dyestuffs such as mauvine.

Following the opening of Japan&#x27;s borders in the early Meiji period to Western trade, a number of materials and techniques – such as wool and the use of synthetic dyestuffs – became popular, with casual wool kimono being relatively common in pre-1960s Japan; the use of safflower dye () for silk linings fabrics (known as ; literally, &quot;red silk&quot;) was also common in pre-1960s Japan, making kimono from this era easily identifiable.

During the Meiji period, the opening of Japan to Western trade after the enclosure of the Edo period led to a drive towards Western dress as a sign of modernity. After an edict by Emperor Meiji, policemen, railroad workers and teachers moved to wearing Western clothing within their job roles, with the adoption of Western clothing by men in Japan happening at a much greater pace than by women. Initiatives such as the promoted Western dress as everyday clothing.

====Taishō period (1912–1926)====
Western clothing quickly became standard issue as army uniform for men and school uniform for boys, and between 1920 and 1930, the sailor outfit replaced the kimono and undivided as school uniform for girls. However, kimono still remained popular as an item of everyday fashion; following the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923, cheap, informal and ready-to-wear kimono, woven from raw and waste silk threads unsuitable for other uses, became highly popular, following the loss of many people&#x27;s possessions. By 1930, ready-to-wear kimono had become highly popular for their bright, seasonally changing designs, many of which took inspiration from the Art Deco movement. kimono were usually dyed using the ikat () technique of dyeing, where either warp or both warp and weft threads (known as ) were dyed using a stencil pattern before weaving.

It was during the Taishō period that the modern formalisation of kimono and kimono types began to emerge. The Meiji period had seen the slow introduction of kimono types that mediated between the informal and the most formal, a trend that continued throughout the Taishō period, as social occasions and opportunities for leisure increased under the abolition of class distinctions. As Western clothing increased in popularity for men as everyday clothing, the kimono industry further established its own traditions of formal and informal dress for women; this saw the invention of the , divisions of (short-sleeved) kimono for women, and . The bridal kimono trousseau (), an uncommon practice of the upper classes in the Edo period, also became common throughout the middle classes; traditions of kimono bridalwear for marriage ceremonies were also codified in this time, which resembled the bridalwear of samurai-class women. Standards of at this time began to slowly graduate to a more formalised, neatened appearance, with a flat, uniform and a smooth, uncreased , which also resembled the &quot;proper&quot; of upper-class women. However, standards were still relatively informal, and would not become formalised until after World War II.

====Shōwa period (1926–1989)====

While kimono were no longer common wear for men, they remained everyday wear for Japanese women until World War II (1940–1945). Though the Taishō period had seen a number of invented traditions, standards of (wearing kimono) were still not as formalised in this time, with creases, uneven and crooked still deemed acceptable.

During the war, kimono factories shut down, and the government encouraged people to wear (also romanised as ) – trousers constructed from old kimono – instead. Fibres such as rayon became widespread during WWII, being inexpensive to produce and cheap to buy, and typically featured printed designs. Cloth rationing persisted until 1951, so most kimono were made at home from repurposed fabrics.

In the second half of the 20th century, the Japanese economy boomed, and silk became cheaper, making it possible for the average family to afford silk kimono. The kimono retail industry had developed an elaborate codification of rules for kimono-wearing, with types of kimono, levels of formality, and rules on seasonality, which intensified after the war; there had previously been rules about kimono-wearing, but these were not rigidly codified and varied by region and class. Formalisation sought perfection, with no creases or unevenness in the kimono, and an increasingly tubular figure was promoted as the ideal for women in kimono. The kimono-retail industry also promoted a sharp distinction between Japanese and Western clothes; for instance, wearing Western shoes with Japanese clothing (while common in the Taishō period) was codified as improper; these rules on proper dressing are often described in Japanese using the English phrase &quot;Time, Place, and Occasion&quot; (TPO). As neither Japanese men or women commonly wore kimono, having grown up under wartime auspices, commercial schools were set up to teach women how to don kimono. Men in this period rarely wore kimono, and menswear thus escaped most of the formalisation.).

Kimono were promoted as essential for ceremonial occasions; for instance, the expensive worn by young women for was deemed a necessity. Bridal trousseaus containing tens of kimono of every possible subtype were also promoted as &quot;de rigueur&quot;, and parents felt obliged to provide kimono trousseaus that cost up to 10 million yen (~£70,000), which were displayed and inspected publicly as part of the wedding, including being transported in transparent trucks.

By the 1970s, formal kimono formed the vast majority of kimono sales. Kimono retailers, due to the pricing structure of brand new kimono, had developed a relative monopoly on not only prices but also a perception of kimono knowledge, allowing them to dictate prices and heavily promote more formal (and expensive) purchases, as selling a single formal kimono could support the seller comfortably for three months. The kimono industry peaked in 1975, with total sales of 2.8 trillion yen (~£18 billion). The sale of informal brand new kimono was largely neglected.

====Heisei period (1989–2019)====
The economic collapse of the 1990s bankrupted much of the kimono industry and ended a number of expensive practices. The rules for how to wear kimono lost their previous hold over the entire industry, and formerly-expensive traditions such as bridal kimono trousseaus generally disappeared, and when still given, were much less extensive. It was during this time that it became acceptable and even preferred for women to wear Western dress to ceremonial occasions like weddings and funerals. Many women had dozens or even hundreds of kimono, mostly unworn, in their homes; a secondhand kimono, even if unworn, would sell for about 500 yen (less than £3.50; about US$5), a few percent of the bought-new price. In the 1990s and early 2000s, many secondhand kimono shops opened as a result of this.

In the early years of the 21st century, the cheaper and simpler became popular with young people. Around 2010, men began wearing kimono again in situations other than their own wedding, and kimono were again promoted and worn as everyday dress by a small minority.

====Reiwa period (2019–present)====

Today, the majority of people in Japan wear Western clothing as everyday attire, and are most likely to wear kimono either to formal occasions such as wedding ceremonies and funerals, or to summer events, where the standard kimono is the easy-to-wear, single-layer cotton .

In 2019, the mayor of Kyoto announced that his staff were working to register &quot;Kimono Culture&quot; on UNESCO&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage list.

In 2020, the Victoria and Albert museum staged an exhibition called &quot;Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk&quot;, a &quot;collection of around 300 garments, accessories, paintings, prints, photographs and film clips&quot; relating to the history of the Kimono from the 17th century to the present. The final instalment of the exhibition&#x27;s four-year international tour was at the V&amp;A Dundee in 2024.

==Textiles==

Both kimono and are made from a wide variety of fibre types, including hemp, linen, silk, Japanese crêpe (known as ), and figured damask weaves (). Fabrics are typically – for both and kimono – woven as (bolts of narrow width), save for certain types of (such as the ), woven to double-width. Formal kimono are almost always made from silk, with thicker, heavier, stiff or matte fabrics generally being considered informal.

Modern kimono are widely available in fabrics considered easier to care for, such as polyester. Kimono linings are typically silk or imitation silk, and often match the top fabric in fibre type, though the lining of some casual silk kimono may be cotton, wool or linen.

===Kimono motifs===
Kimono fabrics are often decorated, sometimes by hand, before construction. Customarily, kimono with woven patterns are considered more informal, though for , the reverse is true, with featuring dyed patterns being less formal than with woven patterns. Though kimono fabrics with woven patterns are typically not especially heavy and can be lightweight, fabrics with woven patterns are often very heavy, with many formal being made from thickly-woven brocade. Traditionally, woven kimono are paired with that are decorated with dyed patterns, and vice versa. However, for all but the most formal kimono, this is more of a general suggestion than a strict rule. Formal kimono are typically decorated with dyed patterns, commonly found along the hemline. These patterns may feature embroidery in parts, couched gold and silver thread, and/or gold and silver foil. The layout of motifs can denote a kimono&#x27;s age, with patterns that mirror along the vertical back seam () being typical for kimono made before the 1930s.

Many kimono motifs are seasonal, and denote the season in which the kimono can be worn; however, some motifs have no season and can be worn all-year round. Others, such as the combination of pine, plum and bamboo – a grouping referred to as the Three Friends of Winter – are auspicious, and thus worn to formal occasions for the entire year. Motifs seen on are commonly seasonal motifs worn out of season, either to denote the spring just passed or the desire for cooler autumn or winter temperatures. Colour also contributes to the seasonality of kimono, with some seasons – such as autumn – generally favouring warmer, darker colours over lighter, cooler ones.

A number of different guides on seasonal kimono motifs exist, with some guides – such as those for tea ceremony in particular – being especially stringent on their reflection of the seasons. Motifs typically represent the flora, fauna, landscape or culture of Japan; one such example is cherry blossoms, a famously seasonal motif worn in spring until just before the actual cherry blossoms begin to bloom, it being considered unlucky to try and &#x27;compete&#x27; with the cherries. Motifs are typically worn a few weeks before the official &#x27;start&#x27; of any given season, as it is considered fashionable to anticipate the coming season.

Though men&#x27;s kimono historically displayed just as much decoration and variety as women&#x27;s kimono, in the modern era, the principal distinction of men&#x27;s kimono in terms of seasonality and occasion is the fabric. The typical men&#x27;s kimono is a subdued, dark colour; black, dark blues, greens and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte, in contrast to the occasional satin weaves of some women&#x27;s kimono. Some men&#x27;s kimono have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are more common in informal men&#x27;s kimono. Informal men&#x27;s kimono may also feature slightly brighter colours, such as lighter purples, greens and blues. Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colours, such as fuchsia, in their kimono, which they are required to wear when appearing in public.

===Terms===

The fabrics that kimono are made from are classified in two categories within Japan. is the term used to indicate silk kimono fabrics, composed of the characters , referring to the State of Wu in ancient China where silk weaving technology developed, and .

The term is also used to refer to kimono in general within Japan, particularly within the context of the kimono industry, as traditional kimono shops are referred to as either or – with the additional character of meaning &#x27;shop&#x27;.

Cotton and hemp fabrics are referred to generally as , meaning &quot;thick materials&quot;, with both cotton and hemp yarns being considerably thicker than silk yarns used for weaving. Cotton kimono are specifically referred to in the context of materials as , &quot;cotton clothes&quot;, whereas hemp kimono are known as , &quot;hemp clothes&quot;, in Japanese, with the character for hemp – – also being used to refer widely to hemp, linen and ramie kimono fabrics.

====Merchants&#x27; terms====
Until the end of the Edo period, the tailoring of both and fabrics was separated, with silk kimono handled at shops known as , and kimono of other fibres sold at shops known as . Stores that handled all types of fabric were known as , though after the Meiji period, stores only retailing kimono became less profitable in the face of cheaper everyday Western clothing, and eventually went out of business, leaving only stores to sell kimono – leading to kimono shops becoming known only as today.

===Reuse===
Kimono can readily be resized, or unpicked back into (bolt) lengths.

Outside of being re-woven into new fabrics, worn-out kimono have historically been recycled in a variety of ways, depending on the type of kimono and its original use. When the cloth is worn out, it may be used as fabric for smaller items or to create (patchwork) kimono (which were also sometimes made for the sake of fashion). The fact that the pattern pieces of a kimono consist of rectangles, and not complex shapes, make reuse in garments or other items easier. are used to hold cloth together and decorate it. The cloth used for patchwork clothing must all be of similar weight, drape, and handle.

Formal kimono, made of expensive and thin silk fabrics, would have been re-sewn into children&#x27;s kimono when they became unusable for adults, as they were typically unsuitable for practical clothing; kimono were shortened, with the taken off and the collar re-sewn to create , or were simply cut at the waist to create a side-tying jacket. After marriage or a certain age, young women would shorten the sleeves of their kimono; the excess fabric would be used as a (wrapping cloth), could be used to lengthen the kimono at the waist, or could be used to create a patchwork undergarment known as a . Kimono that were in better condition could be re-used as an under-kimono, or to create a false underlayer known as a .

Children also traditionally wore , kimono made of a fancier material in the and upper back.

==Construction==


Kimono are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric known as a , which is roughly long and wide for women, and long and wide for men. The entire bolt is used to make one kimono, and some men&#x27;s are woven to be long enough to create a matching jacket and as well. Kimono linings are made from bolts of the same width.

Some custom bolts of fabric are produced for especially tall or heavy people, such as sumo wrestlers, who must have kimono custom-made by either joining multiple bolts, weaving custom-width fabric, or using non-standard size fabric. For children, in the early 1900s, shorter lengths were used, and sometimes the body of the kimono was made only a single cloth width wide (). Tucks were also used to take in the garment; an outwards-facing pleat at each shoulder () and a kolpos-like overfold at the hip (), so that the child appeared to be wearing a sleeveless vest of the same fabric over their garment. These sewn tucks were let out as the child grew, and are mostly only seen today on the kimono of apprentice geisha in Kyoto, as apprentices previously began their training at a young age, requiring tucks to be let out as they grew. In the present day, apprentices begin their training in their late teenage years, and the tucks are retained merely as an anachronism.

Though adult women also retained a &#x27;tuck&#x27; at the hip, this was a leftover from the trailing length of most women&#x27;s kimono, which had previously been either held up by hand when walking or tied up loosely with a ; though kimono were not worn as trailing towards the end of the 19th century, the excess length of most women&#x27;s kimono remained, with the hip fold formalised and neatened into the of the modern day.

Kimono have a set method of construction, which allows the entire garment to be taken apart, cleaned and resewn easily. As the seam allowance on nearly every panel features two selvedges that will not fray, the woven edges of the fabric bolt are retained when the kimono is sewn, leading to large and often uneven seam allowances; unlike Western clothing, the seam allowances are not trimmed down, allowing for a kimono to be resewn to different measurements without the fabric fraying at the seams. This was also used to prolong the life of the garment by reversing the sleeves (hiding the worn cuff hem in the shoulder seam) or the back panels (swapping the high-stress center seam and the low-stress sides), like the European custom of side-to-middling or end-to-middling bedsheets.

Historically, kimono were taken apart entirely to be washed – a process known as . Once cleaned, the fabric would be resewn by hand; this process, though necessary in previous centuries, is uncommon in modern-day Japan, as it is relatively expensive.

Despite the expense of hand-sewing, however, some modern kimono, including silk kimono and all formal kimono, are still hand-sewn entirely; even machine-sewn kimono require some degree of hand-sewing, particularly in finishing the collar, the hem, and the lining, if present. Hand-sewn kimono are usually sewn with a single running stitch roughly to long, with stitches growing shorter around the collar area for strength. Kimono seams, instead of being pressed entirely flat, are pressed to have a &#x27;lip&#x27; of roughly (known as the ) pressed over each seam. This disguises the stitches, as hand-sewn kimono are not tightly sewn, rendering the stitches visible if pressed entirely flat.

===Terms===

A number of terms are used to refer to the different parts of a kimono. Kimono that are lined are known as kimono, whereas unlined kimono are known as kimono; partially lined kimono – with lining only at the sleeve cuff, the back of the sleeve, the lower chest portion of the and the entirety of the – are known as kimono. Some fully lined kimono do not have a separate lower and upper lining, and are instead lined with solid panels on the , the and the .

These terms refer to parts of a kimono:
















===Evolution of kimono construction===

Though the basic shape of the kimono has not changed in centuries, proportions have, historically, varied in different eras of Japanese history. Beginning in the later Heian period, the – an unlined robe worn as underwear – became the predominant outerwear garment for both men and women, known as the . Court-appropriate dress continued to resemble the previous eras.

By the beginning of the Kamakura period, the was an ankle-length garment for both men and women, and had small, rounded sleeves that were sewn to the body of the garment. The was a relatively thin belt tied somewhat low on the waist, usually in a plain bow, and was known as a . During this time period, the fashion of wearing a draped around the shoulders, over the head, or as the outermost garment stripped off the shoulders and held in place by the , led to the rise of the – a heavily decorated over-kimono, stemming from the verb , worn unbelted over the top of the – becoming popular as formal dress for the upper classes.

In the following centuries, the mostly retained its small, narrow and round-sleeved nature, with the length of women&#x27;s sleeves gradually increasing over time and eventually becoming mostly detached from the body of the garment below the shoulders. The collar on both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s retained its relatively long and wide proportions, and the front panel kept its long, shallow angle towards the hem. During the Edo period, the had developed roughly modern kimono proportions, though variety existed until roughly the mid- to later years of the era. Men&#x27;s sleeves continued to be sewn shut to the body of the kimono down most of their length, with no more than a few inches unattached at the bottom, unlike the women&#x27;s style of very deep sleeves mostly detached from the body of the kimono. Men&#x27;s sleeves were also less deep than women&#x27;s kimono sleeves so that they did not get tied under the narrow around the hips, whereas on a woman&#x27;s kimono, the long, unattached bottom of the sleeve could hang over the wider without getting in the way. Sleeves for both men and women grew in proportion to be of roughly equal width to the body panels, and the collar for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kimono became shorter and narrower.

In the present day, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kimono retain some historical features – for instance, women&#x27;s kimono trailed along the floor throughout certain eras, and when the wearer went outside, the excess length would be tucked and tied underneath the in a hip fold known as the . The is now used for fine length adjustments, and takes up of excess length. A hand-sewn tuck across the back under the is used for coarse adjustments, and made deliberately weak so that the stitches will tear before the cloth does under tension. Men&#x27;s kimono, on the other hand, are cut to the length of the wearer&#x27;s body and tied with a narrow belt at the hips, with no extra fabric in the kimono&#x27;s length for an overfold at the hip.

Formal women&#x27;s kimono also retain the wider collar of previous eras (made from a full -width instead of a half width), though it is always folded in half lengthwise before wearing – a style known as .

Women&#x27;s kimono are still worn trailing in some situations, such as onstage, in historical dramas, and by geisha and . In these instances, the kimono worn is constructed differently to a regular women&#x27;s kimono: the collar is set back further into the neck, the sleeves are sewn to the body unevenly (further down the front than the back), and the body is elongated. This style of kimono is referred to as a or . Though the length of the kimono, collar style and sleeve construction differs for this type of kimono, in all other types of women&#x27;s kimono, the construction is generally the same; the collar is set back only slightly into the nape of the neck, the sleeves are attached evenly only at the shoulder (not all the way down the sleeve length) and the kimono&#x27;s length from shoulder to hem is ideally the entire height of the woman wearing it, to allow for the creation of the .

===Sleeve length===
The sleeve length (dropping down from the arm towards the floor when held outstretched) varies in kimono.

==Cost==

Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s brand-new kimono can range in expense (in 2023) from around ¥1000 (~$7 USD) to ¥150,000 (~$1050 US)

The high expense of some hand-crafted brand-new kimono reflects the traditional kimono making industry, where the most skilled artisans practice specific, expensive and time-consuming techniques, known to and mastered only by a few. These techniques, such as hand-plied fabrics and hand-tied dotwork dyeing, may take over a year to finish. Kimono artisans may be made Living National Treasures in recognition of their work, with the pieces they produce being considered culturally important.

Even kimono that have not been hand-crafted will constitute a relatively high expense when bought new, as even for one outfit, a number of accessories of the right formality and appearance must be bought. Not all brand-new kimono originate from artisans, and mass-production of kimono – mainly of casual or semi-formal kimono – does exist, with mass-produced pieces being mostly cheaper than those purchased through a (kimono shop).

Though artisan-made kimono are some of the most accomplished works of textile art on the market, many pieces are not bought solely for appreciation of the craft. Unwritten social obligations to wear kimono to certain events – weddings, funerals – often leads consumers to purchase artisan pieces for reasons other than personal choice, fashion sense or love of kimono:

The high cost of most brand-new kimono reflects in part the pricing techniques within the industry. Most brand-new kimono are purchased through , where kimono are sold as fabric rolls only, the price of which is often left to the shop&#x27;s discretion. The shop will charge a fee separate to the cost of the fabric for it to be sewn to the customer&#x27;s measurements, and fees for washing the fabric or weatherproofing it may be added as another separate cost. If the customer is unfamiliar with wearing kimono, they may hire a service to help dress them; the end cost of a new kimono, therefore, remains uncertain until the kimono itself has been finished and worn.

 are also regarded as notorious for sales practices seen as unscrupulous and pressuring:

In contrast, kimono bought by hobbyists are likely to be less expensive, purchased from second-hand stores with no such sales practices or obligation to buy. Hobbyists may also buy cheaper synthetic kimono (marketed as &#x27;washable&#x27;) brand-new. Some enthusiasts also make their own kimono; this may be due to difficulty finding kimono of the right size, or simply for personal choice and fashion.

Second-hand items are seen as highly affordable; costs can be as little as ¥100 (about US$0.90) at thrift stores within Japan, and certain historic kimono production areas around the country – such as the Nishijin district of Kyoto – are well known for their second-hand kimono markets. Kimono themselves do not go out of fashion, making even vintage or antique pieces viable for wear, depending on condition.

However, even second-hand women&#x27;s are likely to remain somewhat pricey; a used, well-kept and high-quality second-hand can cost upwards of US$300, as they are often intricately woven, or decorated with embroidery, goldwork and may be hand-painted. Men&#x27;s , in contrast, retail much cheaper, as they are narrower, shorter, and have either very little or no decoration, though high-end men&#x27;s can still retail at a high cost equal to that of a high-end women&#x27;s .

==Types of kimono==
Several different types of kimono exist. These varieties are primarily based on formality and gender, with more women&#x27;s varieties of kimono existing than men&#x27;s.

The modern kimono canon was roughly formalised after WWII, following fabric shortages, a generation unfamiliar with wearing kimono in everyday life, and the postwar revival of kimono sales by , traditional kimono shops. In previous centuries, types of kimono were not as distinct, with factors such as age and social class playing a much larger role in determining kimono types than they do presently. Beginning in the Meiji period, and following the Meiji Restoration and the abolition of class distinctions, kimono varieties began to change as Japanese society did, with new varieties being invented for new social situations.

===Formality===
Kimono range in variation from extremely formal to very casual. For women, the formality is determined mostly by pattern placement, decoration style, fabric choice and colour. For men, whose kimono are generally monochromatic, formality is determined typically by fabric choice and colour. For both men and women, the accessories and worn with the kimono also determine formality.

The formality levels of different types of kimono are a relatively modern invention, having been developed between late Meiji- to post-war Japan, following the abolition of Edo-period sumptuary clothing laws in 1868. These laws changed constantly, as did the strictness with which they were enforced, and were designed to keep the nouveau riche merchant classes from dressing above their station, and appearing better-dressed than monetarily-poor but status-rich samurai class.

====Colours and patterns====
Under feudal sumptuary laws, colours were restricted by class; for instance, indigo-dyed clothing was allowed for all classes, and was commonly seen in hand-dyed cotton, linen or hemp fabrics, but other dyes, such as reds and purples, were forbidden to those below a certain class. Sometimes, for some classes, designs were restricted to below the belt, to the bottoms of the sleeves (for ) or to along the hem (); sometimes they were banned altogether, and were transferred to the collar of the underkimono, or the inside of the hem, where only the faintest glimpse would be intermittently visible. This type of subtle ostentation became an aesthetic known as , and outlasted the sumptuary laws. Modern-day rules of formality, however, still echo clothing distinctions typically employed by the uppermost samurai classes.

Aspects of men&#x27;s kimono still follow this extreme of . Bright, elaborate decoration is used on the lining of the (jacket), and on men&#x27;s (underkimono), which is not worn as an outer layer outside the home, and so only shows at the neck and inside the sleeves. Women&#x27;s were once bright and boldly-patterned (and were often kimono too damaged to use as an outer layer, repurposed), but are now typically muted pastel shades. The outside of men&#x27;s garments tended towards subtle patterns and colours even after the sumptuary laws lifted, with blues and blacks predominating, but designers later came to use browns, greens, purples, and other colours in increasingly bold patterns.

Older people generally wear more subtle patterns, and younger people brighter, bolder ones.

====Fabric type====
Kimono vary widely in fabric type, and are not all made of silk. Certain types of fabric, such as wool, cotton, linen and hemp, are always considered informal, and so are not seen on more formal varieties of kimono. Certain varieties of silk, such as , are considered informal, having once been woven only by silk farmers out of unusable cocoons for their own use; other, more modern varieties, such as , were designed to be used as casual, cheap daywear, and are machine-spun and -woven using brightly-patterned yarns. Some varieties of crêpe are on the lowest end of formal, with their rougher texture considered unsuitable for formal use; other varieties, such as smooth crêpe, are used for all varieties of formal kimono. The most formal kimono are only ever made of smooth, fine silks, such as glossy silk fabrics like habutai.

Some fabrics are also worn only at certain times of year; , for instance, is a plain-weave fabric with leno weave stripes only worn in high summer (July and August), but is used for all types of kimono and for other garments, such as under-kimono and . Some fabrics – such as certain types of crêpe – are never seen in certain varieties of kimono, and some fabrics such as (heavy satin) silk are barely ever seen in modern kimono or altogether, having been more popular in previous eras than in the present-day.

Despite their informal nature, many types of traditional, informal kimono fabrics are highly-prized for their craftsmanship. Varieties of , , and fabrics woven from &quot;Musa basjoo&quot; are valued for their traditional production, and regularly command high prices.

====Lined and unlined kimono====
In the summer months (from June until October in the most stringent kimono guides, such as those for tea ceremony), kimono are unlined (); for the rest of the year, they are lined (). This applies to all types of kimono, with a few caveats: the very informal is always unlined, and thus only worn in summer; the most formal kimono, in contrast, are unlikely to be worn unlined in summer, as many people simply do not have more than one formal kimono to wear, and do not wear formal kimono often enough to warrant the purchase of a new, unlined kimono, just for summer wear. also change fabric type in the summer months.

Within the two realms of lined and unlined, further distinctions exist for different months. Lined kimono are either made from transparent or gauze fabrics () or opaque fabrics, with kimono transitioning towards gauze fabrics at the height of summer and away from them as autumn begins. In one kimono guide for tea ceremony, at the start of the unlined season in June, fabrics such as (a type of silk crêpe noted as a more &quot;wrinkle-resistant&quot; form of ) and (a thicker type of with twisted silk threads) are recommended for wear. Following the beginning of the rainy season in some time in July, fabrics switch over to gauzier varieties, and highly-prized hemp fabrics such as are worn. Continuing into August, hemp, and continue to be worn; in September, they are still worn, but fabrics such as , worn in June, become suitable again, and opaque fabrics become preferred over sheer, though sheer may still be worn if the weather is hot.

In the same kimono guide, the first lined kimono are worn in October, and the transition away from plainer opaque fabrics to richer silks such as is immediate. The richness of fabrics increases going into November and December, with figured silks featuring woven patterns appropriate. Coming into January, crêpe fabrics with a rougher texture become appropriate, with fabrics such as worn in February. Figured silks continue to be worn until June, when the unlined season begins again. In Japan, this process of changing clothes is referred to as &quot;koromogae&quot;.

====Crests====
Formality is also determined by the number and type of or (crests). Five crests () are the most formal, three crests () are mid-formality, and one crest () is the least formal, used for occasions such as tea ceremony. Kimono (and other garments, like ) with are called (&quot;-carrying&quot;). The type of crest adds formality as well. A &quot;full sun&quot; () crest, where the design is outlined and filled in with white, is the most formal type. A &quot;mid-shadow&quot; () crest is mid-formality, with only the outline of the crest visible in white. A &quot;shadow&quot; () crest is the least formal, with the outline of the crest relatively faint. Shadow crests may be embroidered onto the kimono, and full-embroidery crests, called , are also seen.

====Choice of accessories====
Formality can also be determined by the type and colour of accessories. For women, this may be the weave of and the style of . For men, adding a (a traditional jacket) makes an outfit more formal, and adding both and (traditional trousers) is more formal still. The material, colour, and pattern of these overgarments also varies in formality. Longer are also more formal.

====Sleeve length and construction====
Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s kimono feature sleeves considered relatively short, with men&#x27;s sleeves shorter than women&#x27;s. Though lengths can vary by a few centimetres, these lengths are informally standardised.

Men&#x27;s kimono sleeves are only ever one length, and women&#x27;s sleeves are limited to a short length suitable for almost all types of kimono, or a longer length used for only one type of formal young women&#x27;s kimono. In the modern day, the two lengths of women&#x27;s sleeve worn on kimono are length, which almost reaches the floor, and a shorter length, used for every other variety of women&#x27;s kimono.

Before WWII, the length of women&#x27;s kimono sleeves varied, with sleeves gradually shortening as a woman got older. During WWII, due to shortage of fabric, the &#x27;short&#x27; length of women&#x27;s kimono sleeves became standardised, and post-WWII, the realm of long kimono sleeves was narrowly curtailed to the realm of only – formal young women&#x27;s and girl&#x27;s kimono, where previously longer sleeves were seen on other varieties of dress, both formal and informal. Pre-WWII women&#x27;s kimono are recognisable for their longer sleeves, which, though not length, are longer than most women&#x27;s kimono sleeves today.

Young women are not limited to wearing only , and outside of formal occasions that warrant it, can wear all other types of women&#x27;s kimono which feature shorter sleeves.

====Regional Variations and Modern Adaptations of Kimono====

The traditional kimono style is often associated with a singular image, but subtle variations exist across Japan’s regions, reflecting local culture and climate. For example, Kyoto is known for its intricate Yūzen dyeing technique, which produces vibrant, detailed designs often featuring nature motifs. In contrast, Okinawa is famous for Bingata, a traditional method of dyeing with bright colors and stencils, often using tropical motifs reflective of the island’s unique environment.

Modern adaptations have further diversified kimono styles. Contemporary designers are blending traditional kimono elements with Western influences, resulting in hybrid forms like shorter hemlines, looser fits, or kimonos tailored for everyday street fashion. This modern interpretation of kimono allows younger generations to incorporate traditional attire into casual wear, maintaining the cultural heritage while embracing a modern aesthetic.

===General types of kimono===

The , also referred to as the , is an under-kimono worn by both men and women. resemble a kimono in construction, with a few key differences: the sleeves are typically open along the entire cuff side, with only a few stitches sewing both sides together placed where a normal kimono sleeve cuff would end; the sleeve has no curve sewn into the outer edge, instead being square; the is typically a little shorter than the length of a kimono when worn, and features no extra length to be bloused into an for women&#x27;s kimono; the front either does not have any overlapping panels () or features only thin ones, with the collar set at a lower angle than that of a regular kimono. are considered an essential piece of kimono underwear, and are worn with all types of kimono except for .

 are typically made of lightweight materials, often silk. Women&#x27;s and can either be patterned or entirely plain, and modern women&#x27;s are frequently white in colour.

Men&#x27;s are often dyed in dark colours, and can be made of the same material as the outer kimono, as some kimono fabric bolts () are woven with enough length to accommodate this. Men&#x27;s are frequently more decorative than women&#x27;s, often featuring a dyed pictorial scene in the upper back, such as a scene from &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, women&#x27;s transitioned from being mostly red with bold white motifs to being white or light pastel colours. The dye technique previously used to achieve this, , fell out of fashion and knowledge and was rediscovered in 2010.
 are a type of kimono undergarment traditionally worn underneath the . are even further removed from resembling a kimono in construction than the ; the comes in two pieces (a wrap-front top and a skirt), features no collar, and either has tube sleeves or is sleeveless.

Unlike the , the is not considered an essential piece of kimono underwear, and a t-shirt and shorts are frequently substituted in its place.

 are casual cotton summer kimono worn by both men and women. were originally very simple indigo and white cotton kimono, little more than a bathrobe worn either within the house, or for a short walk locally; were also worn by guests at inns, with the design of the displaying the inn a person was staying at. From roughly the mid-1980s onwards, they began to be produced in a wider variety of colours and designs, responding to demand for a more casual kimono that could be worn to a summer festival, and have since become more formal than their previous status as bathrobes, with high-end, less colourful sometimes standing in place of .

In the present day, many are brightly coloured, featuring large motifs from a variety of different seasons. For women, they are worn with either a (half-width ) or a (a soft, sash-like ), and are often accessorised with colourful hair accessories. For men, are worn with either an informal or a . Children generally wear a with .

 are always unlined, and it is possible for women to wear a casual with a high-end, more subdued , often with a underneath. A high-end men&#x27;s could also be dressed up in the same way.

A is traditionally worn as a single layer or over a (an underkimono worn underneath the , featuring a simplified construction). may also be worn over the top of a t-shirt and shorts. This distinguishes from a more-formal kimono, where a (also simply referred to as a , an underkimono resembling) is worn underneath, showing a second layer of collar at the neckline. However, some modern are worn with collared cotton featuring a collar of linen, cotton or , for occasions such as informal eating-out.


 are casual silk kimono worn by both men and women. kimono traditionally referred to kimono woven in plain weave with silk noil, short-staple silk fibre, though now include various types of casual silk kimono whereby the pattern is produced by weave as opposed to surface dying. Tsumugi kimono are often dyed with Kasuri patterns.

 are informal women&#x27;s kimono. They were the type most often worn as everyday womenswear in pre-war Japan. Though informal, with smaller, denser patterns are considered a shade more formal than with larger, bolder patterns.

 mostly have no (crests), and the sleeves are fairly short. They are made with a repeating designs, though the repeat length may be quite long. Designs can be made with any method; woven patterns, prints, stencilled patterns in alternating orientations, freehand painting () or tie-dye patterns (). Traditionally the direction of the fabric was alternated in adjacent panels (necessary due to the lack of shoulder seam), so patterns were generally reversible. If the pattern is the same way up on each panel, the is more formal, approaching -level formality.

Woven geometric patterns (such as stripes) have no season, but others show images representing the season in general. Woven non-geometric patterns () are also common. Small, dense patterns are often used; this is practical, as fine-scale patterns hides stains.

 are made with informal materials such as (slubbed silk), cotton, linen, ramie, and hemp. In the modern day, synthetic blends and synthetics are also used; rayon () and polyester are common.

Now that kimono are not typically worn as informal clothing, are not worn as often as formal kimono, though they have a wider range of suitable use. are the most formal type of ; they may have one to three crests, with a small, fine pattern that appears to be a solid colour from a distance, and so resembles the more formal .

 are a type of worn by women characterised by an extremely small repeating pattern, usually done in white on a coloured background. The dyeing technique is sometimes said to originate in the late Heian period (circa mid-12th century), with a motif called , which shows tiny stylised cherry blossoms on a background of white dots. In the Edo period (1603–1867), the samurai classes used them for formal wear, with specific patterns becoming associated with specific families. Towards the end of the Edo period, in the early 1800s, commoners began to wear them. are of a similar formality to , and with one can be worn as low-formality visiting wear; because of this, they are always made of silk, unlike regular .

 are monochromatic, undecorated women&#x27;s kimono mainly worn to tea ceremonies, as the monochrome appearance is considered to be unobtrusive to the ceremony itself. Despite being monochromatic, may feature a woven design; suitable for autumn are often made of damask silk. Some with incredibly fine patterns are also considered suitable for tea ceremony, as from a distance they are visually similar to . may occasionally have one , though likely no more than this, and are always made of silk. accessories such as are never worn with if the purpose of wear is a tea ceremony; instead, flat and untextured silks are chosen for accessories.

 are low-ranking women&#x27;s formalwear, and are a step below , though the two sometimes appear similar or indistinguishable. The motifs on a are placed similarly to those of a – across the back-right shoulder and back-right sleeve, the front-left shoulder and the front-left sleeve, and across the hem, higher at the left than the right – but, unlike , do not typically cross over the seams of each kimono panel, though some confusingly do. In older examples, the motifs may instead be placed symmetrically along the hem, with the skirt patterns mirrored down the centre-back seam.

Similarities between and often lead to confusion, with some indistinguishable from ; often, are only distinguishable from by the size of the motifs used, with smaller, less fluid motifs generally considered to be , and larger, more fluid motifs considered to be .

 can have between one and three , and can be worn to parties, but not ceremonies or highly formal events.

 are women&#x27;s formal kimono with the same pattern placement as a , but with patterns generally matching across the seams. They are always made of silk, and are considered more formal than the .

 are first roughly sewn up, and the design is sketched onto the fabric, before the garment is taken apart to be dyed again. The &#x27;s close relative, the , has its patterns dyed on the bolt before sewing up. This method of production can usually distinguish the two, as the motifs on a are likely to cross fluidly over seams in a way a generally will not. However, the two can prove near-indistinguishable at times.

 may be worn by both married and unmarried women; often friends of the bride will wear to weddings (except relatives) and receptions. They may also be worn to formal parties.

 are formal women&#x27;s kimono that feature a design along the hem on a coloured background. They are slightly less formal than , which have roughly the same pattern placement on a black background. , though worn to formal events, may be chosen when a would make the wearer appear to be overdressed for the situation. The pattern placement for is roughly identical to , though patterns seen along the and may drift slightly into the back hem itself. with five are of the same formality as any . may be made of figured silk such as .
 are formal men&#x27;s kimono. feature formal crests along the shoulders on a colour background, which, apart from the cut of the sleeve, appears the same as an from the waist up, and thus cannot be distinguished in pattern when worn under the . Because formalwear for men requires , men do not wear formal kimono that have elaborate patterns on the hem, as these would be hidden.

 are formal women&#x27;s kimono, featuring a black background and a design along the hem. They are the most formal women&#x27;s kimono, and are worn to formal events such as weddings and wedding parties. The design is only present along the hem; the further up the body this design reaches, the younger the wearer is considered to be, though for a very young woman an may be chosen instead, being considered somewhat more mature. The design is either symmetrically placed on the and portions of the kimono, or asymmetrically placed along the entirety of the hem, with the design being larger and higher-placed at the left side than the right. Vintage kimono are more likely to have the former pattern placement than the latter, though this is not a hard rule.

 are always made of silk, and may have a – a false lining layer – attached, occasionally with a slightly padded hem. A usually has between 3 and 5 crests; a of any number of crests outranks an with less than five. , though formalwear, are not allowed at the royal court, as black is the colour of mourning, despite the colour designs decorating the kimono itself; outside of the royal court, this distinction for does not exist. are never made of flashy silks such as , but are instead likely to be a matte fabric with little texture.

 typically feature , small white decorative prickstitches along the collar.
 (&quot;black -decorated&quot;) are the most formal men&#x27;s kimono, which, apart from the cut of the sleeve, look exactly the same from the waist up as a , and thus cannot be distinguished in pattern when worn under the required for men&#x27;s formal dress.

===Occasion-specific types===


 are a category of kimono and kimono accessories suitable for mourning, worn by both men and women. kimono, and accessories are characterised by their plain, solid black appearance. kimono are plain black silk with five , worn with white undergarments and white . Men wear a kimono of the same kind, with a subdued and a black-and-white or black-and-grey striped , worn with black or white zōri.

A completely black mourning ensemble for women – a plain black , black and black – is usually reserved for those closest to the deceased. Those further away will wear kimono in dark and subdued colours, rather than a plain black kimono with a reduced number of crests. In time periods when kimono were worn more often, those closest to the deceased would slowly begin dressing in coloured kimono over a period of weeks after the death, with the being the last thing to be changed over to colour.


 are highly formal women&#x27;s over-kimono, worn only by brides or onstage. The name comes from the Japanese verb , &quot;to drape upon&quot;, originating in roughly the 16th century from a fashion among the ruling classes of the time to wear kimono (then called , ) unbelted over the shoulders of one&#x27;s other garments; the progressed into being an over-kimono worn by samurai women before being adopted some time in the 20th century as bridal wear.

 are designed to be worn over the top of a complete kimono outfit with , and thus are not designed to be worn belted. Unlike their 16th century counterparts, modern generally could not double as a regular kimono, as they often feature heavy, highly-formal decoration and may be padded throughout, if not solely on the hem. They are designed to trail along the floor, and the heavily-padded hem helps to achieve this.

Bridal are typically red or white, and often decorated heavily with auspicious motifs. Because they are not designed to be worn with an , the designs cover the entirety of the back.


 are pure-white wedding kimono worn by brides for a traditional Japanese Shinto wedding ceremony. Comparable to an and sometimes described as a white , the is worn for the part of the wedding ceremony, symbolising the purity of the bride coming into the marriage. The bride may later change into a red after the ceremony to symbolise good luck.

A will form part of a bridal ensemble with matching or coordinating accessories, such as a bridal (bridal wig), a set of matching (usually mock-tortoiseshell), and a fan tucked into the kimono. Due to the expensive nature of traditional bridal clothing, few are likely to buy brand-new ; it is not unusual to rent kimono for special occasions, and Shinto shrines are known to keep and rent out for traditional weddings. Those who do possess already are likely to have inherited them from close family members.


 () (also known as ) are women&#x27;s kimono with a specialised construction that allows them to be worn trailing, with a deep-set and widely-spaced collar. are extremely long kimono worn by geisha, , actors in kabuki and people performing traditional Japanese dance. A can be up to long, and are generally no shorter than from shoulder to hem; this is to allow the kimono to trail along the floor.

 are sewn differently to normal kimono due to the way they are worn. The collar on a is sewn further and deeper back into the nape of the neck, so that it can be pulled down much lower without causing the front of the kimono to ride up. The sleeves are set unevenly onto the body, shorter at the back than at the front, so that the underarm does not show when the collar is pulled down.

 are also tied differently when they are put on – whereas regular kimono are tied with a visible , and the side seams are kept straight, are pulled up somewhat diagonally, to emphasise the hips and ensure the kimono trails nicely on the floor. A small is tied, larger at the back than the front, but it wrapped against the body with a () wrap, which is then covered by the , rendering the invisible.

Aside from their specialised construction, can resemble many other types of women&#x27;s kimono in their decoration, fabric type, colour and sleeve length. The worn by geisha and their apprentices are formal kimono worn to engagements, and so are always made of fine silk, resembling kimono of formality and above in their pattern placement and background colour.

The worn by kabuki actors varies by role, and so can appear as the humble clothing of an Edo-period merchant&#x27;s daughter, as well as the fine silk clothing of a samurai woman. These costumes may be made of polyester, as well as silk, informal silk fabrics, cotton, linen or hemp. Pattern placement, colour and design varies by role, with many roles having costume designs preserved from previous centuries.

The worn by people performing traditional Japanese dance typically feature a bold design in block colours, as their clothing must stand out from the stage. Performers performing in a group wear kimono identical to one another, with the bold designs creating visual unity between performers.

==Related garments and accessories==
Though the kimono is the national dress of Japan, it has never been the sole item of clothing worn throughout Japan; even before the introduction of Western dress to Japan, many different styles of dress were worn, such as the of the Ainu people and the of the Ryukyuan people. Though similar to the kimono, these garments are distinguishable by their separate cultural heritage, and are not considered to be simply &#x27;variations&#x27; of kimono such as the clothing worn by the working class is considered to be.

Some related garments still worn today were the contemporary clothing of previous time periods, and have survived on in an official and/or ceremonial capacity, worn only on certain occasions by certain people.

There are a number of accessories that can be worn with the kimono, and these vary by occasion and use. Some are ceremonial, or worn only for special occasions, whereas others are part of dressing in kimono and are used in a more practical sense.

Both geisha and wear variations on common accessories that are not found in everyday dress. As an extension of this, many practitioners of Japanese traditional dance wear similar kimono and accessories to geisha and .

For certain traditional holidays and occasions some specific types of kimono accessories are worn. For instance, , also known as , are worn by girls for , alongside brightly coloured . are also worn by young women on (Coming of Age Day).

==Layering==
Pre-WW2, kimono were commonly worn layered, with three being the standard number of layers worn over the top of undergarments. The layered kimono underneath were known as , and were often a patchwork of older or unwearable kimono taken apart for their fabric. Specifically-designed matching sets of formal layered kimono were known as , and generally featured the same design presented on different background colours, such as white (innermost), red (middle layer) and black (outermost). The innermost layers, known as , typically featured the plainest decorative techniques, such as dyework only, and the successive outer layers would feature techniques such as embroidery and couched gold thread, with the outermost layer – known as the – displaying the most extensive decoration. These matching sets would be designed and created together, commonly as part of a bride&#x27;s outfit for a wedding. Extant intact sets of kimono are difficult to find, particularly in good condition, with the innermost kimono typically damaged and in poor condition.

In modern Japan, at least one layer is typically worn next to the skin when wearing kimono. Traditionally, this would be the or , a tube-sleeved, wrapped-front garment considered to be underwear, though in the modern day, regular underwear is sometimes worn instead, and a traditional is not considered strictly necessary. A is typically made of something more washable than silk, such as cotton, hemp, linen or some synthetic fibres.

For all forms of kimono except the (excluding high-quality dressed up as ), a , often known and referred to as a , is worn over the top of any underwear. The resembles a kimono made of a lighter, thinner fabric, not uncommonly constructed without an panel at the front, and often has a collar cover known as a sewn over its collar. The , which is visible at the neckline when worn underneath a kimono, is designed to be replaced and washed when needed.

In modern-day Japan, layered kimono are generally only seen on the stage, whether for classical dances or in kabuki. A false second layer called a may be attached instead of an entirely separate kimono to achieve this look; the resembles the lower half of a kimono&#x27;s lining which, and is sewn to the kimono horizontally along the back. A may have a false collar attached to it, or a matching false collar sewn to the kimono separately, creating the illusion of a layered kimono at the neckline; separate false sleeve cuffs may also be sewn into the kimono to create this effect.

Kimono featuring can be seen in some kabuki performances such as , where the kimono is worn with the flipped back slightly underneath the to expose the design on the . The can also be seen on some bridal kimono.

==Care==

In the past, a kimono would often be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for wearing. This traditional washing method involves two steps: taking the kimono apart and washing each piece () and then stretching each piece of a kimono onto a board to dry after they have been washed and starched (). Because the stitches must be taken out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. The process of traditionally washing kimono is very expensive and difficult and is one of the causes of the declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments.

New, custom-made kimono are generally delivered to a customer with long, loose basting stitches placed around the outside edges. These stitches are called (not to be confused with , the small white prickstitching seen along the collar of ). They are sometimes replaced for storage. They help to prevent bunching, folding and wrinkling, and keep the kimono&#x27;s layers in alignment.

Like many other traditional Japanese garments, there are specific ways to fold kimono. These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored. Kimono are often stored wrapped in acid-free paper envelopes known as .

Kimono need to be aired out at least seasonally and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono dry cleaned. Although this can be extremely expensive, it is generally less expensive than the traditional method of taking a kimono apart to clean it. This may, however, be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes.

==, kimono production regions==
Kimono are produced in different regions all over Japan. Locations known for making kimono are often called . Many of these regional variations still exist today and are recognized as , famous products of their place of origin.

==Outside of Japan==

Kimono are worn outside of Japan in a variety of circumstances. Kimono may be worn to Shinto ceremonies by Brazilian girls of Japanese descent in Curitiba, in the Brazilian state of Paraná.

Kimono are also worn by Japanese Americans, and by other members of the Japanese diaspora overseas, such as Japanese Filipinos in the Philippines (see Japanese in the Philippines).

Kimono are collected in the same way as Japanese hobbyists by some non-Japanese, and may be worn to events such as Kimono de Jack gatherings.

<text>Kingston upon Thames, colloquially known as Kingston, is a town in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, England. It is situated on the River Thames, south-west of Charing Cross. It is an ancient market town, notable as the place where some Saxon kings were crowned.

Historically in the county of Surrey, the ancient parish of Kingston covered both the town itself and a large surrounding area. The town was an ancient borough, having been formally incorporated in 1441, with a long history prior to that as a royal manor. From 1836 until 1965 the town formed the Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. From 1893 to 2020 Kingston was the seat of Surrey County Council. The town became part of Greater London in 1965, when the modern borough was also created as one of the 32 London boroughs.

Kingston is identified as a metropolitan centre in the London Plan and is one of the biggest retail centres in the UK, receiving 18 million visitors a year. It is also home to Kingston University.

The Kingston upon Thames post town corresponds to the KT1 and KT2 postcodes. The wider borough also includes the post towns of New Malden and Surbiton, parts of Worcester Park and peripheral parts of several other post towns based outside the borough. The Kingston upon Thames post town roughly corresponds to the six wards of Canbury Gardens, Coombe Hill, Kingston Gate, Kingston Town, Norbiton and Tudor, which had a combined population of 54,925 at the 2021 census, while the borough overall counted 168,063.

==Toponymy==
Kingston was called &quot;Cyninges tun&quot; in 838 AD, &quot;Chingestune&quot; in 1086, &quot;Kingeston&quot; in 1164, &quot;Kyngeston super Tamisiam&quot; in 1321 and &quot;Kingestowne upon Thames&quot; in 1589. The name means &#x27;the king&#x27;s manor or estate&#x27; from the Old English words &quot;cyning&quot; and &quot;tun&quot;. It belonged to the king in Saxon times and was the earliest royal borough.

There was historically some variation between authorities as to whether Kingston was &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;upon&#x27; Thames, and whether the name should be hyphenated or not. The Post Office initially adopted &#x27;Kingston-on-Thames&#x27;, the Ordnance Survey used &#x27;Kingston upon Thames&#x27;, and the old borough council preferred the hyphenated &#x27;Kingston-upon-Thames&#x27;. As late as 1959 the borough council was petitioning the other bodies to standardise the name as &#x27;Kingston-upon-Thames&#x27;. The London Borough created in 1965 used the form &#x27;Kingston upon Thames&#x27; without hyphens, since when that form has been used by the council, Ordnance Survey, and as the post town.

==History==
===Early history===

The first surviving record of Kingston is from AD 838 as the site of a meeting between King Egbert of Wessex and Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury. Kingston lay on the boundary between the ancient kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia, until in the early tenth century when King Æthelstan united both to create the kingdom of England. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, two tenth-century kings were consecrated in Kingston: Æthelstan (925), and Æthelred the Unready (978). There are certain other kings who are said to have been crowned there, but for whom the evidence (including the writings of Florence of Worcester and Ralph de Diceto) is less substantial: Edward the Elder (902), Edmund I (939), Eadred (946), Eadwig (956), Edgar the Peaceful () and Edward the Martyr (975). It was later thought that the coronations were conducted in the chapel of St Mary, which collapsed in 1730. Tradition dating to the 18th century holds that a large stone recovered from the ruins played a part in the coronations. It was initially used as a mounting block, but in 1850 it was moved to a more dignified place in the market before finally being moved to its current location in the grounds of the Guildhall.

From Medieval times Shrovetide Football was played annually at Kingston upon Thames and in surrounding towns including Richmond and Twickenham. The windows of the houses and shops were boarded up and from 12 noon the inhabitants would kick several balls around the town before retiring to the public houses. The last game was played in 1866, by which time the urban development of the town meant it caused too much damage and the custom was outlawed.

===Local government===

Kingston upon Thames formed an ancient parish in the Kingston hundred of Surrey. The parish of Kingston upon Thames covered a large area including numerous chapelries and townships which subsequently became separate parishes, including Hook, Kew, New Malden, Petersham, Richmond, Surbiton, Thames Ditton and East Molesey.

Kingston was a royal manor. It was granted various charters allowing it the right to hold markets and fairs, with the oldest surviving charter being from King John in 1208. A subsequent charter in 1441 formally incorporated the town as a borough.

The borough covered a much smaller area than the ancient parish, although as new parishes were split off the borough and parish eventually became identical in 1894. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, becoming the Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. It had been long been known as a royal borough through custom; its right to the title was formally confirmed by George V in 1927. Kingston upon Thames was the seat of Surrey County Council from 1893, when it moved from Newington to a new headquarters at County Hall. The county council remained based at County Hall until 2020, despite Kingston having been removed from its administrative area in 1965.
In 1965, Greater London was created and the old municipal borough was abolished. Its former area was merged with that of the Municipal Borough of Surbiton and the Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe, to form the London Borough of Kingston upon Thames. At the request of Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council another royal charter was granted by Queen Elizabeth II entitling it to continue using the title &quot;Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames&quot; for the new borough.

===Urban development===

Kingston was built at the first crossing point of the Thames upstream from London Bridge and a bridge still exists at the same site. It was this &#x27;great bridge&#x27; that gave it its early importance in the 13th century. Kingston was occupied by the Romans, and later it was either a royal residence or a royal demesne. There is a record of a council held there in 838, at which Egbert of Wessex, King of Wessex, and his son Ethelwulf of Wessex were present. In the Domesday Book it was held by William the Conqueror. Its domesday assets were: a church, five mills, four fisheries worth 10s, 27 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth six hogs. It rendered £31 10s (£31.50).

In 1730, the chapel containing the royal effigies collapsed, burying the sexton, who was digging a grave, the sexton&#x27;s daughter and another person. The daughter survived this accident and was her father&#x27;s successor as sexton. Kingston sent members to early Parliaments, until a petition by the inhabitants prayed to be relieved from the burden. Another chapel, the collegiate chapel of St Mary Magdalene, The Lovekyn Chapel, still exists. It was founded in 1309 by a former mayor of London, Edward Lovekyn. It is the only private chantry chapel to survive the Reformation.

With the coming of the railway in the 1830s, there was much building development to the south of the town. Much of this became the new town of Surbiton, but the Surbiton Park estate, built in the grounds of Surbiton Place in the 1850s, remained part of Kingston during the period of the Municipal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames.

A permanent military presence was established in the borough with the completion of The Barracks in 1875.

===Economic development===
Kingston evolved as a market town from the Saxon period, with goods transported on the Thames and over land via the crossing point.
Rights to hold markets were amongst the liberties granted by the royal charter of 1208 and the market formally established in 1242. A horse fair was held at a site on the downstream side of the river north of the bridge and a market extended from there to around the church by the 17th century and further south towards the course of the Hogsmill River. Goods traded included oats, wheat, rye, malt, apples and other fruit, flowers, wool, leather and cheese. Cattle, meat and fish were also traded. The regular Saturday market was supplemented by a Wednesday market in 1662. In addition to markets, regular fairs were held. Local industries included pottery, brick making, tanning, leather-working, fishing, milling, brewing and boat-building.

The presence of fabric and wood-working craft skills associated with boat-building was a factor in the choice of Kingston as the site chosen by Tommy Sopwith to expand production of early aircraft from Sopwith Aviation&#x27;s origins at Brooklands. Well known aviation personalities Sydney Camm, Harry Hawker and Tommy Sopwith were responsible for much of Kingston&#x27;s achievements in aviation. For much of the 20th century, Kingston was a major military aircraft manufacturing centre specialising in fighter aircraft – first with Sopwith Aviation, H G Hawker Engineering, later Hawker Aircraft, Hawker Siddeley and eventually British Aerospace. The renowned Sopwith Camel, Hawker Fury, Hurricane, Hunter and Harrier jump jet were all designed and built in the town and examples of all of these aircraft can be seen today at the nearby Brooklands Museum in Weybridge. British Aerospace finally closed its Lower Ham Road factory in 1992; part of the site was subsequently redeveloped for housing but the riverside part houses a community centre and sports complex.

=== Recent developments ===
Following the construction of the Kingston Relief Road (commonly known as the &quot;Kingston one-way system&quot;) in 1989, major shopping streets in the town centre and the historic Market Place were pedestrianised. Two major commercial developments were also built in Kingston town centre - with John Lewis Kingston department store opening in 1990 and the Bentall Centre shopping centre opening in 1992. In the early 2000s, the Charter Quay development south of Kingston Bridge completed the riverside walk, as well as adding bars, restaurants and the Rose Theatre, which opened in 2008 with Sir Peter Hall as the director. Also, in 2001, the old Kingston bus garage and bus station, closed the previous year, was demolished and the site redeveloped as the Rotunda complex, with an Odeon Cinema, restaurants and tenpin bowling.

==Governance==
Kingston straddles two Parliamentary constituencies: the area north of the railway line is part of Richmond Park, which is represented by Sarah Olney of the Liberal Democrats, and the area south of the railway line (including the ancient town centre) is part of Kingston and Surbiton which is represented by Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats.

==Notable locations==


Central Kingston is a busy, largely pedestrian and predominantly retail centre, with a small number of commercial offices and civic buildings.

The shopping centre includes a shopping mall, &quot;The Bentall Centre&quot;, containing the Bentalls department store and large branches of chain stores found in many British high streets. There is a large branch of the John Lewis department store group, with a Waitrose supermarket in the basement. A smaller 1960s shopping centre called Eden Walk exists nearby. The Rotunda, in a former Bentalls furniture depository building (a local landmark), includes a bowling alley, fitness centre, a 15-screen Odeon multiplex cinema and a few restaurants.

The ancient market is still held daily in the Market Place, including such produce as fish, jewellery, exotic foods, local foods and flowers.

Kingston&#x27;s civic buildings include Kingston Museum, public library, modern Crown Court, smaller County Court and the Guildhall. The Guildhall is located by the part-culverted mouth of the Hogsmill River, and houses Kingston Council and magistrates&#x27; court. A short distance away is the County Hall Building which houses the main offices of Surrey County Council. From 1893 to 1965, before Kingston became one of the 32 London boroughs of Greater London, it was the county town of Surrey following the period of 1791–1893 when Newington had this role. Guildford has officially reclaimed this ancient, now ceremonial title as Kingston is no longer administered by Surrey.

Kingston&#x27;s main open space is the River Thames, with its lively frontage of bars and restaurants. Downstream there is a walk through Canbury Gardens towards Teddington Lock. Upstream there is a promenade crossing the Hogsmill river and reaching almost to Surbiton. Eagle Brewery Wharf is a council-owned public space located on the riverside. Across Kingston Bridge is a tree lined river bank fronting the expanse of Hampton Court Park.
==Economy==
Kingston has many pubs and restaurants and several public houses in the centre have become restaurants or bars. The more traditional pubs tend to be in the northern part of the town (Canbury) and include The Canbury Arms, Park Tavern, The Wych Elm and Willoughby Arms. Further south are found the Druid&#x27;s Head, the Spring Grove, The Cricketers, The Albion Tavern, The Duke of Buckingham, and several small local pubs around Fairfield. The Druid&#x27;s Head is notable as one of the first taverns to make syllabub, the famous dessert, in the 18th century. There are several Chinese, Indian, Thai and Italian restaurants.

The local newspapers are the weekly &quot;Surrey Comet&quot;, which celebrated its 150th year in 2004, and the &quot;Kingston Guardian&quot;.

In 2010 retail footprint research, Kingston ranked 25th in terms of retail expenditure in the UK at £810 million, equal to Covent Garden and just ahead of Southampton. This puts it as generating the fifth highest level of retail sales in Greater London, passing Croydon, with just four West End alternatives ahead. In 2005, Kingston was 24th with £864 million, and 3rd in London. In a 2015 study by CACI, Kingston was ranked 28th in the UK in the Hot 100 Retail Locations - and the second highest in Greater London after Croydon. In 2018, Kingston was ranked joint 5th in the UK by Knight Frank in the &quot;High Street Investment Ranking&quot;, only bettered by Cambridge, Bath, Chichester and Reading.

In 2013 Kingston became the location for a local currency scheme, designed to boost and strengthen the local economy in Kingston,
 as part of the Transition towns initiative. The Kingston pound began as a digital currency, and from 2018 existed in paper format, with denominations of K£1;K£5;K£10;and K£20 designed by graphic design students from Kingston University. These were taken out of circulation in 2021, but have been sold to many collectors all over the world. The Kingston Pound is a &#x27;tagged&#x27; sterling that can be exchanged either way on a 1 for 1 basis without any penalty.

As of 2011, Kingston upon Thames has the fourth highest retail turnover for comparison goods in Greater London, £432 million annually, only bettered by the West End, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Stratford. As of 2012, Kingston has of total town centre floorspace, the 3rd highest in London.

==Culture==
A notable dramatic arts venue is the Rose Theatre, opened on 16 January 2008 and seating about 900 people. The audience are arranged around the semi-circular stage. All Saints Church is host to classical choral and music concerts mostly on Saturdays and houses a Frobenius organ. There are a number of choral societies including the Kingston Orpheus Choir and the Kingston Choral Society, an amateur symphony orchestra the Kingston Philharmonia, and the Kingston and District Chamber Music Society. A number of annual festivals are organised by the Council and Kingston Arts Council including Kingston Readers&#x27; Festival, Think-in-Kingston and the Festival of the Voice. Kingston University runs the Stanley Picker Gallery and Kingston Museum has a changing gallery on the first floor. A regular singing group at the Rose Theatre caters to schools and families.
John Galsworthy the author was born on Kingston Hill and Jacqueline Wilson grew up, and went to school in Kingston and still lives there today. Both are commemorated at Kingston University – Galsworthy in the newest building and Wilson in the main hall. Also commemorated at the university is photographer Eadweard Muybridge who was born at Kingston and changed the spelling of his first name in reference to the name of the Saxon king on the Coronation Stone. He was a pioneer in the photography of the moving image. R. C. Sherriff the playwright is also associated with Kingston, writing his first play to support Kingston Rowing Club. An earlier writer born in Kingston was John Cleland.

Kingston has been covered in literature, film and television. It is where the comic Victorian novel &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; by Jerome K. Jerome begins; cannons aimed against the Martians in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; are positioned on Kingston Hill; in &quot;The Rainbow&quot; by D. H. Lawrence the youngest Brangwen dreams of a job in Kingston upon Thames in a long, lyrical passage; Mr. Knightly in &quot;Emma&quot; by Jane Austen regularly visits Kingston, although the narrative never follows him there.

Fine art is also a prominent feature in the history of Kingston. Both John Hoyland and Jeremy Moon worked from permanent studios in Kingston and many artists and designers have studied at the university including Fiona Banner, John Bratby, David Nash and Jasper Morrison.

Early in his music career, the guitarist and singer-songwriter Eric Clapton spent time busking in Kingston upon Thames, having grown up and studied in the area. Rock band Cardiacs were formed in the town.

Recently, a scene from &quot;Mujhse Dosti Karoge&quot;, a Bollywood film starring Hrithik Roshan as the leading actor, was filmed by the toppled telephone boxes sculpture in Old London Road.

The 1974 Doctor Who story &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; used several locations in the town for filming. The 2008 series of &quot;Primeval&quot;, shown on ITV1 in January, featured almost an entire episode filmed inside the Bentall Centre and John Lewis department stores. Kingston featured in &quot;Primeval&quot; again in May 2009 with several scenes shot in and around the Market Place. Nipper, the famous &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; (HMV) dog, is buried in the town under Lloyds Bank. His owners lived nearby in Fife Road.

Kingston Green Fair was held annually from 1987 to 2008 in Canbury Gardens, next to the river, on the Spring Bank Holiday. The word &quot;Green&quot; in the title refers to the ethos of the fair as promoting sustainable development. For instance no meat or other products derived from dead animals were allowed to be sold, and no electricity was permitted on the site unless generated by wind, sun, or bicycle power.

===Public art===

One of the more unusual sights in Kingston is &quot;Out of Order&quot; by David Mach, a sculpture in the form of twelve disused red telephone boxes that have been tipped up to lean against one another in an arrangement resembling dominoes. The work was commissioned in 1988 as part of the landscaping for the new Relief Road, and was described by its creator as &quot;anti-minimalist&quot;.

==Transport==
=== Rail ===
Kingston is principally served by Kingston railway station, which opened in 1863.

The station is in London fare zone 6 and is served by South Western Railway trains from London Waterloo. Trains to Waterloo link Kingston directly to destinations such as Wimbledon, Clapham Junction and Vauxhall. Eastbound trains travel to Shepperton via Teddington, Hampton and Sunbury. Eastbound trains also travel on the Kingston loop line towards Teddington, Strawberry Hill, Twickenham and Richmond, after which trains continue towards Waterloo. From Waterloo, trains to Kingston are advertised towards &quot;Shepperton&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Hill&quot;.

A nearby station in Norbiton (in fare zone 5) is on the same lines.

Nearby Surbiton station – originally named Kingston when it opened in 1838 – is on the South West Main Line in London fare zone 6. Surbiton is also served by South Western Railway trains from Waterloo. Southbound services link Surbiton to destinations in Surrey and Hampshire, such as Hampton Court, Guildford, Woking and Basingstoke. The station building at Surbiton was built in 1937, designed in an Art Deco style by James Robb Scott. It has been Grade II listed since 1983.

=== Bus ===
Kingston is served by two bus stations, Cromwell Road and Fairfield, and a large number of bus stops, with destinations across Greater London and Surrey including links directly to Heathrow Airport.

=== Road ===
The Kingston Bypass passes to the south and east of Kingston. The bypass carries the A3, which links the area to Merton, Wandsworth, Clapham and the City of London to the north. To the south, the A3 runs to Portsmouth via Guildford and Petersfield.

A portion of the bypass carries the A309 to Thames Ditton, Hampton Court and the A308.

==== Kingston Relief Road ====
In the 1960s, planners proposed a partially elevated ring road encircling the town centre, to alleviate congestion on major shopping streets and traffic heading towards Kingston Bridge. After objections from local residents, an interim one-way system was implemented in July 1963. Following this, the Kingston Relief Road was constructed in Kingston town centre in the late 1980s. Commonly known as the &quot;Kingston one-way system&quot;, the road encircles the town centre, allowing for major shopping streets such as Clarence Street to be pedestrianised. On the western side of the town centre, the road passes underneath John Lewis Kingston before crossing the River Thames via Kingston Bridge. As part of the project, two bus stations were constructed, cycle lanes installed and several artworks commissioned including &quot;Out of Order&quot; by David Mach and &quot;River Celebration&quot; by Carole Hodgson.

=== River ===
Kingston Town End and Kingston Turks piers are situated in Kingston. Turk Launches operates a Summer-only river tour between Hampton Court and Richmond St Helena.

=== Cycling ===
There is a network of cycle lanes throughout Kingston linking the area to destinations throughout south-west London and England.

Key routes include:

* National Cycle Route 4 - A route from Greenwich in south-east London to St David&#x27;s in west Wales. NCR4 follows the route of the River Thames near Kingston, crossing from the south side of the river to the north over Kingston Bridge. Northbound, the route runs towards Central London and Greenwich via Ham, Richmond Park and Barnes. Westbound, NCR4 runs towards Reading via Walton, Egham and Eton. The route is part of EuroVelo 2, a route from Moscow to Galway.
* Cycleway 28 - A two-way, segregated cycle track between Kingston and Seething Wells along Portsmouth Road.
* Cycleway 29 - A cycle route, much of which is two-way and segregated from other road traffic between Kingston and Fishponds Park. Much of the route follows Penrhyn Road and Ewell Road.
* Cycleway 30 - A segregated cycle track between C29 at Kingston to Putney Vale, following the route of A308 London Road.

The growth and development of Kingston Polytechnic, and its transformation into Kingston University in 1992, has made Kingston a university town.

==Religious sites==
The 12th-century All Saints Church serves the Church of England parish of Kingston which lies ecclesiastically in the Diocese of Southwark, although there has been a church in Kingston since at least 838. The suffragan or Area Bishop of Kingston is the Rt Rev Dr Richard Cheetham. Other Anglican churches in Kingston, of more recent date, are St John the Evangelist and St Luke.

Kingston lies in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark, and there is a Roman Catholic Church dedicated to Saint Agatha.

Kingston is also the home of the Kingston Surbiton &amp; District Synagogue. It also has a Quaker meeting house, a Mosque and a Sikh Gurdwara.

Lady Booth Road, formerly Fairfield Road, is named to commemorate the former location of the Salvation Army citadel.

Kingston is the home of four association football clubs, Chelsea F.C. Women who play at the Kingsmeadow Stadium, Corinthian-Casuals and Kingstonian who play in Tolworth, and Chessington &amp; Hook United who play in Chessington. Chelsea F.C. Women play in the FA Women&#x27;s Super League, whereas Kingstonian, Corinthian-Casuals and Chessington &amp; Hook United are non-league clubs.

Kingston Athletic Club and Polytechnic Harriers are based at the neighbouring Kingsmeadow athletics stadium. This stadium has a 400m track which is floodlit, a gym and 5-a-side football facilities. Kingston Rugby Club is based on the outskirts of the town, and Kingston Rowing Club (founded in 1858) is based in Canbury Gardens on the River Thames. The Club holds two large timed race events (HEADs) in the Spring and Autumn. Kingston Regatta takes place on the river just above the bridge over a weekend in early July.

===London 2012 Summer Olympics===

Prior to the opening of the games, Kingston hosted the 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay on two occasions with the flame travelling through the borough on 24 July 2012 and aboard the &quot;Gloriana&quot; in a cauldron on 27 July 2012 en route to the Olympic Stadium for the opening ceremony. The borough was the setting for four cycling events during the Olympics, the men&#x27;s road race, women&#x27;s road race, men&#x27;s road time trial and women&#x27;s road time trial.

Following the games, the London–Surrey Classic professional road bicycle race ran through the town from 2013 to 2018, using a similar course to the Olympic road race. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the race will not return to Kingston, with the RideLondon festival using the roads of Essex instead.

<text>Karnataka ( ; ISO: , ) is a state in the southwestern region of India. It was formed as Mysore State on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, and renamed &quot;Karnataka&quot; in 1973. The state is bordered by the Lakshadweep Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth-largest state by population, comprising 31 districts. With 15,257,000 residents, the state capital Bengaluru is the largest city of Karnataka.

The economy of Karnataka is among the most productive in the country with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of and a per capita GSDP of for the financial year 2023–24. The state experience a GSDP growth of 10.2% for the same fiscal year. After Bangalore Urban, Dakshina Kannada, Hubli–Dharwad, and Belagavi districts contribute the highest revenue to the state respectively. The capital of the state, Bengaluru, is known as the Silicon Valley of India, for its immense contributions to the country&#x27;s information technology sector. A total of 1,973 companies in the state were found to have been involved in the IT sector as of 2007.

Karnataka is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other four southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of , or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. It is the sixth-largest Indian state by area. Kannada, one of the classical languages of India, is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include Urdu, Konkani, Marathi, Tulu, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kodava and Beary. Karnataka also contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily spoken.

Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that &quot;Karnataka&quot; is derived from the Kannada words &quot;karu&quot; and &quot;nādu&quot;, meaning &quot;elevated land&quot;. &quot;Karu Nadu&quot; may also be read as &quot;karu&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot; and &quot;nadu&quot;, meaning &quot;region&quot;, as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic, sometimes &quot;Karnatak&quot;, to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna. With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.

==Etymology==
== History ==

Karnataka&#x27;s pre-history goes back to a paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley civilisation .

Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka. Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas, marking the region&#x27;s emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty, founded by Mayurasharma, had its capital at Banavasi; the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital.

These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi. These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas, the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta and the Western Chalukya Empire, which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of the 12th century. Parts of modern-day Southern Karnataka (Gangavadi) were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of the 11th century. The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule.

At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, &quot;Hosapattana&quot; (later named Vijayanagara), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. Under the rule of Krishnadevaraya, a distinct form of literature and architecture evolved. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries. In 1537, Kempe Gowda I, a chieftain of the Vijayanagara Empire, widely held as the founder of modern Bengaluru, built a fort and established the area around it as Bengaluru Pete.

In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota. The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of much of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Mughals in the late 17th century. The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style. During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette, Goa, while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara, especially from Bardes, Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese.

In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maratha Empire, the British, and other powers. In the south, the Mysore Kingdom, a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent. With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haidar Ali, the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan. To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan&#x27;s death and the incorporation of Mysore into British India in 1799. Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars, and the Kingdom of Mysore became a princely state outside but in a subsidiary alliance with British India.
As the &quot;doctrine of lapse&quot; gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, Kittur Chennamma, Queen of Kittur, her military leader Sangolli Rayanna, and others, spearheaded rebellions in part of what is now Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, Kitturu was taken over by the British East India Company even before the doctrine was officially articulated by Lord Dalhousie in 1848. Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at Supa, Bagalkot, Shorapur, Nargund and Dandeli. These rebellions—which coincided with the Indian Rebellion of 1857—were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave, the Halagali Bedas, Raja Venkatappa Nayaka and others. By the late 19th century, the independence movement had gained momentum; Karnad Sadashiva Rao, Aluru Venkata Raya, S. Nijalingappa, Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.

After the independence of British India, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, signed an instrument of accession to accede his state to the new India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its &quot;Rajpramukh&quot; (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement, Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamed Karnataka, seventeen years later, on 1 November 1973. In the early 1900s through the post-independence era, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, played an important role in the development of Karnataka&#x27;s strong manufacturing and industrial base.

== Geography ==

The state has three principal geographical zones:

# The coastal region of Karavali and Tulu Nadu
# The hilly Malenadu region comprising the Western Ghats
# The Bayaluseeme region comprising the plains of the Deccan Plateau

The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second-largest arid region in India. The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in Chikmagalur district which has an altitude of . The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha and Tungabhadra in North Karnataka, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in South Karnataka. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the Bay of Bengal. Other prominent rivers such as the Sharavati in Shimoga and Netravati in Dakshina Kannada flow westward to the Lakshadweep Sea. A large number of dams and reservoirs are constructed across these rivers which richly add to the irrigation and hydroelectricity power generation capacities of the state.

Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations – the &quot;Archean complex&quot; made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the &quot;Proterozoic&quot; non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the &quot;Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits&quot; and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, &quot;viz.&quot; red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.

About of Karnataka (i.e. 16% of the state&#x27;s geographic area) is covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests. The percentage of forested area is slightly less than the all-India average of about 23%, and significantly less than the 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy.

=== Climate ===
Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. Meteorologically, Karnataka is divided into three zones – coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about per annum, far in excess of the state average of . Amagaon in Khanapura taluka of Belgaum district received of rainfall in 2010. In 2014 Kokalli in Sirsi taluka of Uttara Kannada district received of rainfall. Agumbe in Thirthahalli taluka and Hulikal of Hosanagara taluka in Shimoga district were the rainiest cities in Karnataka, situated in one of the wettest regions in the world.

The state is projected to warm about by 2030. The monsoon is set to provide less rainfall. Agriculture in Karnataka is mostly rainfed as opposed to irrigated, making it highly vulnerable to expected changes in the monsoon. The highest recorded temperature was in Raichuru district. The lowest recorded temperature was at Bidar district.

=== Flora and fauna ===


Karnataka is home to a variety of wildlife. It has a recorded forest area of which constitutes 12.3% of the total geographical area of the state. These forests support 25% of the elephant and 10% of the tiger population of India. Many regions of Karnataka are as yet unexplored, so new species of flora and fauna are found periodically. The Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot, includes the western region of Karnataka. The Bandipur and Nagarahole National Parks were included in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in 1986, a UNESCO designation. The Indian roller and the Indian elephant are recognised as the state bird and animal while sandalwood and the lotus are recognised as the state tree and flower respectively. Karnataka has five national parks: Anshi, Bandipur, Bannerghatta, Kudremukh and Nagarhole. It also has 27 wildlife sanctuaries of which seven are bird sanctuaries.

Wild animals that are found in Karnataka include the elephant, the tiger, the leopard, the gaur, the sambar deer, the chital or spotted deer, the muntjac, the bonnet macaque, the slender loris, the common palm civet, the small Indian civet, the sloth bear, the dhole, the striped hyena, the Bengal fox and the golden jackal. Some of the birds found here are the great hornbill, the Malabar pied hornbill, the Ceylon frogmouth, herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias. Some species of trees found in Karnataka are &quot;Calophyllum tomentosum&quot;, &quot;Calophyllum apetalum&quot;, &quot;Garcinia cambogia&quot;, &quot;Garcinia morella&quot;, &quot;Alstonia scholaris&quot;, &quot;Flacourtia montana&quot;, &quot;Artocarpus hirsutus&quot;, &quot;Artocarpus lacucha&quot;, &quot;Cinnamomum zeylanicum&quot;, &quot;Grewia tiliifolia&quot;, &quot;Santalum album&quot;, &quot;Shorea talura&quot;, &quot;Emblica officinalis&quot;, &quot;Vitex altissima&quot; and &quot;Wrightia tinctoria&quot;. Wildlife in Karnataka is threatened by poaching, habitat destruction, human-wildlife conflict and pollution.

== Sub-divisions ==

There are 31 districts in Karnataka. Each district (&quot;zila&quot;) is governed by a district commissioner (&quot;ziladar&quot;). The districts are further divided into sub-districts (&quot;talukas&quot;), which are governed by sub-commissioners (&quot;talukdars&quot;); sub-divisions comprise blocks (&quot;tehsils&quot;/&quot;hobli&quot;), which are governed by block development officers (&quot;tehsildars&quot;), which contain village councils (&quot;panchayats&quot;), town municipal councils (&quot;purasabhe&quot;), city municipal councils (&quot;nagarasabhe&quot;), and city municipal corporations (&quot;mahanagara palike&quot;).
== Demographics ==
According to the 2011 census of India, the total population of Karnataka was 61,095,297 of which 30,966,657 (50.7%) were male and 30,128,640 (49.3%) were female, or 1000 males for every 973 females. This represents a 15.60% increase over the population in 2001. The population density was 319 per km2 and 38.67% of the people lived in urban areas.

Karnataka ranked tenth in the Fiscal Health Index (FHI) 2025, with a score of 40.8.

=== Religion ===

Adi Shankara (788–820 CE) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to establish the first of his four &quot;mathas&quot; (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (philosophy of reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy – one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima. The Haridasa devotional movement is considered one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.

This movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally &quot;servants of Hari&quot;) and took shape in the 13th century – 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as Dasa Sahitya. Purandara dasa is widely recognised as the &quot;Pithamaha&quot; of Carnatic Music for his immense contribution. Ramanuja, the leading expounder of &quot;Vishishtadvaita&quot;, spent many years in Melkote. He came to Karnataka in 1098 CE and lived here until 1122 CE. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple and a well-organised &quot;matha&quot; were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana.

In the twelfth century, Lingayatism emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were Basava, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu, who established the Anubhava Mantapa which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of &quot;Vachana Sahitya&quot; which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear &quot;Ishtalinga&quot; i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. Basava shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaay Ta tTatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the Lingayat faith which today counts millions among its followers.

The Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka.

Islam, which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.

Buddhism was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as Gulbarga and Banavasi. A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in Kalaburagi district in 1986 has proven that the Krishna River basin was once home to both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism. There are Tibetan refugee camps in Karnataka.

==== Festivals ====
Mysore Dasara is celebrated as the &quot;Nada habba&quot; (state festival) and this is marked by major festivities at Mysore.

=== Language ===



Kannada is the official language of the state of Karnataka, as the native language of 66.46% of its population as of 2011 and is one of the classical languages of India. Urdu is the second largest language, spoken by 10.83% of the population, and is the language of Muslims outside the coastal region. Telugu (5.84%) is a major language in areas bordering Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka as well as Bengaluru, while Tamil (3.45%) is a major language of Bengaluru and in the Kolar district. Marathi (3.29%) is concentrated in areas of Uttara Kannada, Belgaum and Bidar districts bordering Maharashtra. Lambadi is spoken by the Lambadis scattered throughout North Karnataka, while Hindi is spoken in Bengaluru. Tulu (2.61%), Konkani (1.29%), and Malayalam (1.27%) are all found in linguistically diverse Coastal Karnataka, where a number of mixed and distinct dialects such as Are Bhashe, Beary Bhashe, and Nawayathi are found. Kodava Takk is the language of Kodagu.

Kannada played a crucial role in the creation of Karnataka: linguistic demographics played a major role in defining the new state in 1956. Tulu, Konkani and Kodava are other minor native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain languages such as Sankethi. Some of the regional languages in Karnataka are Tulu, Kodava, Konkani and Beary.

Kannada features a rich and ancient body of literature including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as Jainism (such as &quot;Puranas&quot;), Lingayatism (such as Vachanas), Vaishnavism (such as &quot;Haridasa Sahitya&quot;) and modern literature. Evidence from edicts during the time of Ashoka (reigned 274–232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the Kannada script and its literature. The Halmidi inscription, the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot;, has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot;, however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the native composition metres such as &quot;Chattana&quot;, &quot;Beddande&quot; and &quot;Melvadu&quot; during earlier centuries. The classic refers to several earlier greats (&quot;purvacharyar&quot;) of Kannada poetry and prose.
Kuvempu, the renowned Kannada poet and writer who wrote Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate, the state anthem of Karnataka
was the first recipient of the Karnataka Ratna, the highest civilian award bestowed by the Government of Karnataka. Contemporary Kannada literature has received considerable acknowledgement in the arena of Indian literature, with eight Kannada writers winning India&#x27;s highest literary honour, the Jnanpith award.

Tulu is the majority language in the coastal district of Dakshina Kannada and is the second most spoken in the Udupi district. This region is also known as Tulu Nadu. &quot;Tulu Mahabharato&quot;, written by Arunabja in the Tigalari script, is the oldest surviving Tulu text. Tigalari script was used by Brahmins to write Sanskrit language. The use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in Tigalari script contributed to the marginalisation of Tigalari script.
In Karnataka Konkani is mostly spoken in the Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada districts and in parts of Udupi, Konkani use the Devanagari Script (which is official)/Kannada script( Optional ) for writing as identified by government of Karnataka.

The Kodavas who mainly reside in the Kodagu district, speak Kodava Takk. Kodagu was a separate State with its own Chief Minister and Council of Ministers till 1956. Two regional variations of the language exist, the northern &quot;Mendale Takka&quot; and the southern &quot;Kiggaati Takka&quot;. Kodava Takk has its own script, &quot;Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy&quot; has accepted I. M. Muthanna&#x27;s script which was developed in 1970 as the official script of Kodava Thakk. English is the medium of education in many schools and widely used for business communication in most private companies.
All of the state&#x27;s languages are patronised and promoted by governmental and quasi-governmental bodies. The &quot;Kannada Sahitya Parishat&quot; and the &quot;Kannada Sahitya Akademi&quot; are responsible for the promotion of Kannada while the &quot;Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademi&quot;, the &quot;Tulu Sahitya Akademi&quot; and the &quot;Kodava Sahitya Akademi&quot; promote their respective languages.

<doc id="16881" wikidata="Q191498" url="?curid=16881" title="Kashrut">
<text>&#x27; (also &#x27; or , ) is a set of dietary laws dealing with the foods that Jewish people are permitted to eat and how those foods must be prepared according to Jewish law. Food that may be consumed is deemed kosher ( in English, ), from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the term that in Sephardi or Modern Hebrew is pronounced &quot;kashér&quot; (), meaning &quot;fit&quot; (in this context: &quot;fit for consumption&quot;). Food that may not be consumed, however, is deemed treif ( in English, ), also spelled treyf (). In case of objects the opposite of kosher is pasúl ( in English, Yiddish: פָּסוּל).

Although the details of the laws of are numerous and complex, they rest on a few basic principles:

* Only certain types of mammals, birds, and fish, meeting specific criteria are kosher; the consumption of the flesh of any animals that do not meet these criteria, such as pork, frogs, and shellfish, is forbidden, except for locusts, which are the only kosher invertebrate.
* The most basic eating rule in the Torah is that blood is not to be consumed; therefore, as a step to being kosher, mammals and birds must be slaughtered according to a process known as , in which a certified ritual slaughterer, called a &quot;shochet&quot;, severs the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, and jugular veins in a single, quick cut using an ultra-sharp instrument called a &quot;chalaf&quot;; doing so causes rapid and massive blood loss.
* The meat must still go through a process known as &quot;koshering&quot; or &quot;kashering&quot; to be considered fit for consumption. The three approved methods are broiling, roasting, and soaking &amp; salting. 
* Meat and meat derivatives may never be mixed with milk and milk derivatives. Separate equipment must be used for the storage and preparation of meat-based and dairy-based foods.

Every food that is considered kosher is also categorized as follows:

* Meat products, (also called or ), are those that contain kosher meat, such as beef, lamb, or venison; kosher poultry, such as chicken, goose, duck, or turkey; or derivatives of meat such as animal gelatin; additionally, non-animal products that were processed on equipment used for meat or meat-derived products must also be considered as meat ().
* Dairy products, (also called or ), contain milk or any derivatives such as butter or cheese; additionally, non-dairy products that were processed on equipment used for milk or milk-derived products must also be considered as milk ().
* [[Pareve]] (also called &quot;parve&quot;, &quot;parveh&quot; meaning &quot;neutral&quot;), products contain neither meat, milk, nor their respective derivatives; they include foods such as kosher fish, eggs from permitted birds, grains, produce, and other edible vegetation. They remain pareve if they are not mixed with or processed using equipment that is used for any meat or dairy products.

While any produce that grows from the earth, such as fruits, grains, vegetables, and mushrooms, is always permissible, laws regarding the status of certain agricultural produce, especially that grown in the Land of Israel such as tithes and produce of the Sabbatical year, impact their permissibility for consumption.

Most of the basic laws of are derived from the Torah&#x27;s books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Their details and practical application, however, are set down in the Oral Torah, (eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud), and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature. Although the Torah does not state the rationale for most laws, some suggest that they are only tests of obedience, while others have suggested philosophical, practical, and hygienic reasons.

Over the past century, many certification agencies have started to certify products, manufacturers, and restaurants as kosher, usually authorizing the use of a proprietary symbol or certificate, called a , to be displayed by the food establishment or on the product, which indicates that they are in compliance with the kosher laws. This labeling is also used by some non-Jewish people, examples of which include those whose religions (including Islam) expect adherence to a similar set of dietary laws, people with allergies to dairy foods, and vegans, who use the various kosher designations to determine whether a food contains meat or dairy-derived ingredients.

The laws of Kashrut are a major area covered in traditional rabbinic ordination; see and . And numerous scholarly and popular works exist on these topics, covering both practice and theory.

==Explanations==

===Philosophical===
Jewish philosophy divides the 613 commandments (or ) into three groups—laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (), laws that are understood after being explained, but would not be legislated without the Torah&#x27;s command (), and laws that do not have a rational explanation ().

Some Jewish scholars say that should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God&#x27;s authority, and man must obey without asking why. Although Maimonides concurs that all the statutes of the Torah are decrees, he is of the view that whenever possible, one should seek out reasons for the Torah&#x27;s commandments.

Some theologians have said that the laws of are symbolic in character: kosher animals represent virtues, while non-kosher animals represent vices. The 1st-century BCE Letter of Aristeas argues that the laws &quot;have been given [...] to awake pious thoughts and to form the character&quot;. This view reappears in the work of the 19th-century Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch.

The Torah prohibits &quot;cooking the kid (goat, sheep, calf) in its mother&#x27;s milk&quot;. While the Torah does not provide a reason, it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive.

Hasidic Judaism believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with Divinity, the activation of which it sees as helping the Divine Presence to be drawn into the physical world; Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels, termed &#x27;sparks of holiness&#x27;, interact with various animals. These &#x27;sparks of holiness&#x27; are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a &#x27;holy reason&#x27;, (which includes eating); however, not all animal products are capable of releasing their &#x27;sparks of holiness&#x27;. The Hasidic argument is that animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks, and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually &#x27;clean&#x27; and ritually &#x27;unclean&#x27;.

===Medical===
Although the reason for is that it is a decree from the Torah, there have been attempts to provide scientific support for the view that Jewish food laws have an incidental health benefit. One of the earliest is that of Maimonides in &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; (c. 1190).

In 1953, David Macht, an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the theory of biblical scientific foresight, conducted toxicity experiments on many kinds of animals and fish. His experiment involved lupin seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals; Macht reported that in 100% of cases, extracts from ritually &#x27;unclean&#x27; meat inhibited the seedling&#x27;s growth more than that from ritually &#x27;clean&#x27; meats.

At the same time, these explanations are controversial. Scholar Lester L. Grabbe, writing in the &quot;Oxford Bible Commentary&quot; on Leviticus, says &quot;[a]n explanation now almost universally rejected is that the laws in this section have hygiene as their basis. Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness, many of them have little to do with hygiene. For example, there is no evidence that the &#x27;unclean&#x27; animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate, as is sometimes asserted.&quot;

==Rules==
===Prohibited foods===
The laws of can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition (Biblical or rabbinical) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods.

Biblically prohibited foods include:
* Non-kosher animals—any mammals without certain identifying characteristics (cloven hooves and rumination); any birds of prey; any fish without fins or scales (thus excluding catfish, for instance). All invertebrates are non-kosher apart from certain types of locust, on which most communities lack a clear tradition. No reptiles or amphibians are kosher. There are also no rodents that are kosher.
* Carrion ()—meat from a kosher animal that has not been slaughtered according to the laws of . This prohibition includes animals that have been slaughtered by non-Jews.
* Injured ()—an animal with a significant defect or injury, such as a fractured bone or particular types of lung adhesions.
* Blood ()—the blood of kosher mammals and fowl is removed through salting, with special procedures for the liver, which is very rich in blood.
* Particular fats ()—particular parts of the abdominal fat of cattle, goats and sheep must be removed by a process called .
* The twisted nerve ()—the sciatic nerve, as according to Genesis 32:32 the patriarch Jacob&#x27;s was damaged when he fought with an angel, so may not be eaten and is removed by .
* A limb of a living animal ()—according to Jewish law, God forbade Noah and his descendants to consume flesh torn from a live animal. Hence, Jewish law considers this prohibition applicable even to non-Jews, and therefore, a Jew may not give or sell such meat to a non-Jew.
* Untithed food ()—produce of the Land of Israel requires the removal of certain tithes, which in ancient times were given to the (priests), Levites and the poor (, and respectively) or taken to the Old City of Jerusalem to be eaten there ().
* Fruit during the first three years ()—according to Leviticus 19:23, fruit from a tree in the first three years after planting may not be consumed (both in the Land of Israel and the diaspora). This applies also to the fruit of the vine—grapes, and wine produced from them.
* New grain ()—the Bible prohibits newly grown grain (planted after Passover the previous year) until the second day of Passover; there is debate as to whether this law applies to grain grown outside the Land of Israel.
* Wine of libation ()—wine that may have been dedicated to idolatrous practices.

Biblically prohibited mixtures include:
* Mixtures of meat and milk ()—this law derives from the broad interpretation of the commandment not to &quot;cook a kid in its mother&#x27;s milk&quot;; other non-kosher foods are permitted for non-dietary use (e.g. to be sold to non-Jews), but Jews are forbidden to benefit from mixtures of meat and milk in any way.
* Different species of plants grown together ()—in the Land of Israel different species of plants are to be grown separately and not in close proximity according to Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:9–11.
** A specific subdivision of this law is , the prohibition of planting any grain or vegetable near a grapevine; this law applies to Jews throughout the world, and a Jew may not derive benefit from such produce.

Rabbinically prohibited foods include:

* Non-Jewish milk ()—milk that may have an admixture of milk from non-kosher animals (see below for current views on this prohibition).
* Non-Jewish cheese ()—cheese that may have been produced with non-kosher rennet.
* Non-Jewish wine ()—wine that while not produced for idolatrous purposes may otherwise have been poured for such a purpose or alternatively when consumed will lead to intermarriage.
* Food cooked by a non-Jew ()—this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage. (Minor)
* Non-Jewish bread ()—this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage.
* Health risk ()—certain foods and mixtures are considered a health risk, such as mixtures of fish and meat.

===Permitted and forbidden animals===

Only meat from particular species is permissible. Mammals that both chew their cud (ruminate) and have cloven hooves can be kosher. Animals with one characteristic but not the other (the camel, the hyrax, and the hare because they have no cloven hooves, and the pig because it does not ruminate) are specifically excluded.

In 2008, a rabbinical ruling determined that giraffes and their milk are eligible to be considered kosher. The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud, characteristics of animals considered kosher. Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk curdles, meeting kosher standards. Although kosher, the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly. Giraffes are difficult to restrain, and their use for food could cause the species to become endangered.

Non-kosher birds are listed outright in the Torah, but the exact zoological references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are mentioned). The Mishnah refers to four signs provided by the sages. First, a (predatory bird) is not kosher. Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics: an extra toe in the back (which does not join the other toes in supporting the leg), a (crop), and a (gizzard) with a peelable lumen. However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition () is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is the turkey. There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs sufficient, so Jews started eating this bird without a because it possesses all the signs () in Hebrew.

Fish must have fins and scales to be kosher. Shellfish and other non-fish water fauna are not kosher. (See kosher species of fish.) Insects are not kosher, except for certain species of kosher locust. Any animal that eats other animals, whether they kill their food or eat carrion, is generally not kosher, as well as any animal that has been partially eaten by other animals.

===Separation of meat and milk===

Meat and milk (or derivatives) may not be mixed in the sense that meat and dairy products are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together.

Observant Jews have separate sets of dishes, and sometimes different kitchens, for meat and milk, and wait anywhere between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products. The and (literally &quot;milky&quot; and &quot;meaty&quot;) utensils and dishes are the commonly referred-to Yiddish delineations between dairy and meat ones, respectively.

According to the Shulchan Aruch, a six-hour waiting period is recommended between consuming meat and dairy. During this time, it is generally advised to abstain from brushing and rinsing the mouth.

Shelomo Dov Goitein writes, &quot;the dichotomy of the kitchen into a meat and a milk section, so basic in an observant Jewish household, is [...] never mentioned in the Geniza.&quot; Goitein believed that in the early Middle Ages Jewish families kept only one set of cutlery and cooking ware. According to David C. Kraemer, the practice of keeping separate sets of dishes developed only in the late 14th and 15th centuries. It is possible observant Jews before then waited overnight for the meat or dairy gravy absorbed in a pot&#x27;s walls to become insignificant () before using the pot for the other foodstuff (meat or dairy).

===Kosher slaughter===
Mammals and fowl must be slaughtered by a trained individual (a ) using a special method of slaughter, . slaughter severs the jugular vein, carotid artery, esophagus, and trachea in a single continuous cutting movement with an unserrated, sharp knife. Failure to meet any of these criteria renders the meat of the animal non-kosher.

The body of the slaughtered animal must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year, which would make the meat unsuitable.

These conditions () include 70 different categories of injuries, diseases, and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non-kosher.

It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal, such as certain fats () and the sciatic nerves from the legs, the process of excision being done by experts before the meat is sold.

As much blood as possible must be removed through the process; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat, but the liver, as it is rich in blood, is grilled over an open flame.

Fish (and kosher locusts, for those who follow the traditions permitting them) must be killed before being eaten, but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law. Legal aspects of ritual slaughter are governed not only by Jewish law but civil law as well.

Some believe that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, claiming that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called for it to be banned.

====Preparation of meats====
When an animal is ritually slaughtered () the raw meat is traditionally cut, salted, and rinsed, prior to cooking. Salting of raw meat draws out the blood that lodges on the inner surface of the meat. The salting is done with coarse grain salt, commonly referred to as kosher salt, after which the meat is laid over a grating or colander to allow for drainage, remaining so for the duration of time that it takes to walk one biblical mile (approximately 18–24 minutes). Afterwards, the residue of salt is rinsed away with water, and the meat cooked.

Meat that is roasted requires no prior salting, as fire causes a natural purging of blood.

 (&quot;Taz&quot;), a 17th-century commentary on the &quot;Shulchan Arukh&quot;, ruled that the pieces of meat can be &quot;very thick&quot; when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Saadiah Gaon, who required that the meat not be larger than half a &quot;rotal&quot; (i.e. roughly ) when salting. This allows the effects of the salt to penetrate.

Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as (), &quot;blanching.&quot; This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent it from oozing out when the meat was eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water for as long as it takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer.

If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making in the same pot, they could simply scoop out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water.

 is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.

===Kosher utensils===

Utensils used for non-kosher foods become non-kosher, and make even otherwise kosher food prepared with them non-kosher.

Some such utensils, depending on the material they are made from, can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch.

Food prepared in a manner that violates the (Sabbath) may not be eaten; although in certain instances it is permitted after the is over.

===Passover laws===

Passover has stricter dietary rules, the most important of which is the prohibition on eating leavened bread or derivatives of this, which are known as . This prohibition is derived from Exodus 12:15.

Utensils used in preparing and serving are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been ritually cleansed ().

Observant Jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of , such as not eating , or garlic.

===Produce of the Land of Israel===
Biblical rules also control the use of agriculture produce, for example, with respect to their tithing, or when it is permitted to eat them or to harvest them, and what must be done to make them suitable for human consumption.

For produce grown in the Land of Israel a modified version of the biblical tithes must be applied, including , , , and (untithed produce is called ); the fruit of the first three years of a tree&#x27;s growth or replanting are forbidden for eating or any other use as ; produce grown in the Land of Israel on the seventh year obtains , and unless managed carefully is forbidden as a violation of the (Sabbatical Year).

Some rules of are subject to different rabbinical opinions. For example, many hold that the rule against eating (new grain) before the 16th of the month Nisan does not apply outside the Land of Israel.

===Vegetables===

Although plants and minerals are nearly always kosher, vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods are required to obtain a , certifying that a rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher, because the usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of . Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation. The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species, growing conditions, and views of individual rabbis.

===Pareve foods===

A pareve food is one which is neither meat nor dairy. Fish fall into this category, as well as any food that is not animal-derived. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.

Some processes convert a meat- or dairy-derived product into a pareve one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese. Gelatins derived from kosher animal sources (which were ritually slaughtered) are also pareve. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin, like all kosher fish products, is pareve.

Jewish law generally requires that bread be kept pareve (i.e., not kneaded with meat or dairy products nor made on meat or dairy equipment).

 has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non-kosher or meat/dairy use, but those may be inadequate for vegetarians, those with allergies, or adherents to other religious laws.

For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it but someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue. This is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry &quot;milk&quot; warnings.

===Cannabis===
For cannabis grown in Israel, the plants must observe , but this does not apply to cannabis from elsewhere. At least one brand of cannabis edibles is certified to follow the laws of .

===Tobacco===

Although it is not a food product, some tobacco receives a year-long kosher for Passover certification. This year-long certification means that the tobacco is certified also for Passover where different restrictions may be in place. Tobacco may, for example, come into contact with some grains that are strictly forbidden during Passover and the certification is a guarantee that it is free from this type of contamination.

In Israel, this certification is given by a private rabbinic group Beit Yosef, but the Chief Rabbinate has objected to granting of any certification by rabbis because of health risks from tobacco.

===Genetically modified foods===
With the advent of genetic engineering, scholars in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the AquAdvantage salmon and, while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a non-kosher organism.

In 2015, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly released a document regarding genetically modified organisms, stating that modification of gene sequences via the introduction of foreign DNA in order to convey a specific capability in the new organism is allowable, that entirely new species should not be intentionally created, and that the health implications of genetically modified foods must be considered on an individual basis.

Some put forth that this intermixing of species is against the teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and non-kosher. Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of is of significance, and that the foreign gene accounts for less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.

==Supervision and marketing==
===&quot;Hashgacha&quot;===
Certain foods must be prepared in whole or in part by Jews. This includes grape wine, certain cooked foods (&quot;bishul akum&quot;), cheese (&quot;g&#x27;vinat akum&quot;), and according to some also butter (&quot;chem&#x27;at akum&quot;), dairy products (Hebrew: חלב ישראל chalav Yisrael &quot;milk of Israel&quot;), and bread (Pas Yisroel).

===Product labeling standards===


Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non-kosher ingredients, some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients. Such &quot;hidden&quot; ingredients may include lubricants and flavorings, among other additives; in some cases, for instance, the use of &quot;natural&quot; flavorings, these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non-kosher substances. Furthermore, certain products, such as fish, have a high rate of mislabeling, which may result in a non-kosher fish being sold in a package labeled as a species of kosher fish.

Producers of foods and food additives can contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as &quot;kosher&quot;: this involves a visit to the manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization, who will inspect the production methods and contents and, if everything is sufficiently &quot;kosher&quot; a certificate would be issued.

Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label. These symbols are known in Judaism as &quot;hechsherim&quot;. Due to differences in &quot;kashrut&quot; standards held by different organizations, the &quot;hechsheirim&quot; of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities. The certification marks of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list, but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the Union of Orthodox Congregations, who use a &quot;U&quot; inside a circle (&quot;O-U&quot;), symbolising the initials of &quot;Orthodox Union&quot;. In Britain, commonly used symbols are the &quot;KLBD&quot; logo of the London Beth Din and the &quot;MK&quot; logo of the Manchester Beth Din. A single &quot;K&quot; is sometimes used as a symbol for &quot;kosher&quot;, but since many countries do not allow letters to be trademarked (the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse), it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher.

Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or words to indicate the category of the product, according to Jewish law; the categorization may conflict with legal classifications, especially in the case of food that Jewish law regards as &quot;dairy&quot;, but legal classification does not.

* D: Dairy
* DE: Dairy equipment
* M: Meat, including poultry
*&quot;Pareve&quot;: Food that is neither meat nor dairy
* Fish
* P: Passover-related (&quot;P&quot; is not used for &quot;Pareve&quot;)

In many cases constant supervision is required because, for various reasons such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may cease to be so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often coordinated with the supervising rabbi or supervising organization to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any &quot;hechsher&quot; or &quot;kashrut&quot;. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the &quot;hechsher&quot; may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the &quot;hechsher&quot;. Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss &quot;kashrut&quot; products.

Products labeled kosher-style are non-kosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods, such as all-beef hot dogs, or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with Ashkenazi practices, like dill pickles. The designation usually refers to delicatessen items.

===History of kosher supervision and marketing===
Food producers often look to expand their markets or marketing potential, and offering kosher food has become a way to do that. The uniqueness of kosher food was advertised as early as 1849. In 1911 Procter &amp; Gamble became the first company to advertise one of their products, Crisco, as kosher. Over the next two decades, companies such as Lender&#x27;s Bagels, Maxwell House, Manischewitz, and Empire evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf-space. In the 1960s, Hebrew National hotdogs launched a &quot;we answer to a higher authority&quot; campaign to appeal to Jews and non-Jews alike. From that point on, &quot;kosher&quot; became a symbol for both quality and value. The kosher market quickly expanded, and with it more opportunities for kosher products. Menachem Lubinsky, founder of the Kosherfest trade fair, estimates as many as kosher consumers and in sales of kosher products in the U.S.

In 2014 the Israeli Defense Forces decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases, and the first women kosher inspectors were certified in Israel.

===Legal usage===
Advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase &quot;kosher&quot; in a product&#x27;s labeling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the &quot;kashrut&quot; nature, in others the rules of &quot;kosher&quot; are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting the use of the term &quot;kosher&quot; have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.

===Costs===
In the United States, the cost of certification for mass-produced items is typically miniscule and is usually more than offset by the advantages of being certified. In 1975 &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated the cost per item for obtaining kosher certification at 6.5 millionths of a cent ($0.000000065) per item for a General Foods frozen-food item. According to a 2005 report by Burns &amp; McDonnell, most U.S. national certifying agencies are non-profit, only charging for supervision and on-site work, for which the on-site supervisor &quot;typically makes less per visit than an auto mechanic does per hour&quot;. However, re-engineering an existing manufacturing process can be costly. Certification usually leads to increased revenues by opening up additional markets to Jews who keep kosher, Muslims who keep halal, Seventh-day Adventists who keep the main laws of Kosher Diet, vegetarians, and the lactose-intolerant who wish to avoid dairy products (products that are reliably certified as &quot;pareve&quot; meet this criterion). The Orthodox Union, one of the largest &quot;kashrut&quot; organizations in the United States, claims that &quot;when positioned next to a competing non-kosher brand, a kosher product will do better by 20%&quot;.

In some European Jewish communities, kosher supervision of meat includes a &quot;tax&quot; used to fund Jewish education in the community, which makes kosher meat more expensive than the cost of supervision alone would imply.

==Society and culture==
===Adherence===
Many Jews partially observe &quot;kashrut,&quot; by abstaining from pork or shellfish or by not drinking milk with meat dishes. Some keep kosher at home but eat in non-kosher restaurants. In 2012, one analysis of the specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of kosher consumers were Jewish. Kosher meat is regularly consumed by Muslims when &quot;halal&quot; is not available. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the &quot;kosher-pareve&quot; designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since &quot;kosher-pareve&quot; foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, vegans cannot rely on the certification.

About a sixth of American Jews or 0.3% of the American population fully keep kosher, and many more of them do not strictly follow all of the rules but still abstain from some prohibited foods, especially pork. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, a Christian denomination, preaches a health message which expects adherence to the kosher dietary laws.

Surveys conducted in 2013 and 2020 found that 22% of American Jews by religion claimed to keep kosher in their homes. Pork consumption in particular seems to be a bigger taboo than other non-Kosher eating practices among Jews, with 41% claiming to at least abstain from eating pork. American Jews are generally less strict about Kosher laws when compared to Israeli Jews. Nearly three times as many Israeli Jews reported that they commit to keeping kosher in their homes and 84% do not eat pork.

==== Differentiations in practice ====
&quot;Kosher style&quot; allows for variation in adherence to kashrut, reflecting different practices within the Jewish community. For some, kosher style implies abstinence from non-kosher animals, like pork and shellfish, and the avoidance of mixing meat and dairy in meals. These individuals may consume meat from animals that are kosher but not necessarily slaughtered according to kashrut standards.

The notion of &quot;kosher style&quot; serves individuals and communities navigating between strict religious observance and cultural identification with Jewish culinary traditions. Hasia Diner, a professor of American Jewish history at New York University, suggests that &quot;kosher-style&quot; represents a balancing act between tradition and assimilation, providing a sense of Jewish identity through food without strict adherence to kashrut.

This flexible practice emerged in the 1920s amongst Jews assimilating into American society, who sought connection to their heritage without fully observing dietary laws. The term is broad and encompasses foods that could be kosher, like chicken noodle soup or pareve meals (neither meat nor dairy), even if they don&#x27;t meet halakhic standards. Diner points out the term is &quot;oxymoronic,&quot; creating an illusion of kashrut where the true emphasis is on a style of cuisine rather than compliance with religious dietary laws.

Over time, the meaning of &quot;kosher style&quot; has evolved and expanded, reflecting changes within Jewish communities and broader society. In contemporary practice, &quot;kosher style&quot; is often encountered at social events and gatherings, where meals might exclude certain non-kosher items but not adhere strictly to kashrut. The exact definition may vary between communities and individuals, reflecting diverse interpretations and practices related to Jewish dietary laws. The term also relates to products marketed as &quot;kosher style,&quot; prompting some regions to establish legislation to clarify labeling and prevent consumer misunderstanding. For instance, kosher-style pickles might be produced without kosher certification or supervision but are associated with Jewish culinary tradition.

===Linguistics===
====Etymology====

In Ancient Hebrew the word &quot;kosher&quot; () means &quot;be advantageous&quot;, &quot;proper&quot;, &quot;suitable&quot;, or &quot;succeed&quot;, according to the Brown–Driver–Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon. In Modern Hebrew it generally refers to &quot;kashrut&quot; but it can also sometimes mean &quot;proper&quot;. For example, the Babylonian Talmud uses &quot;kosher&quot; in the sense of &quot;virtuous&quot; when referring to Darius I as a &quot;kosher king&quot;; Darius, a Persian king (reigned 522–486 BCE), fostered the building of the Second Temple. In colloquial English, &quot;&quot; often means &quot;legitimate&quot;, &quot;acceptable&quot;, &quot;permissible&quot;, &quot;genuine&quot;, or &quot;authentic&quot;. The word &quot;kosher&quot; can also form part of some common product names.

====Kosher salt====
Sometimes &quot;kosher&quot; is used as an abbreviation of &quot;koshering&quot;, meaning the process for making something &quot;kosher&quot;; for example, &quot;kosher salt&quot; is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of &quot;kashrut&quot;, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. In this case the type of salt refers to kosher style salt. Salt may also be kosher certified salt, or both. Certified kosher salt follows &quot;kashrut&quot; guidelines. Sometimes the term &quot;coarse kosher salt&quot; is used to designate salt that is both kosher style and kosher certified. The term &quot;fine kosher salt&quot; is sometimes used for salt that is certified kosher but not kosher style.

====Pickles====
&quot;Kosher&quot; can occur as a synonym for &quot;Jewish tradition&quot;; for example, a &quot;kosher dill&quot; pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle-makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.

==Strictness degrees==
===&quot;Mehadrin&quot;===
&quot;Mehadrin&quot; is a term most commonly used with the meaning of enhanced or stricter kashrut rules. Its etymology is still debated, but its initial halachic use related specifically to lighting candles on Hanukkah. Later it became widely used in regard to dietary laws, and ended up loosely covering almost every aspect of Jewish observance (see mehadrin bus lines).

===&quot;Badatz&quot;===
&quot;Badatz&quot; is the Hebrew acronym of &quot;Beth Din Tsedek&quot; and is used as a name for organisations which supervise the production of kosher foods. They typically only certify &quot;mehadrin&quot;-level products, but are not the only agencies specialised in applying enhanced &quot;mehadrin&quot; rules, since there are non-badatz agencies also doing so.

==Suriname==
A treef (Surinamese Dutch, derived from Sranan Tongo &quot;trefu&quot;) is a food taboo.
In Suriname certain groups of people have long adhered to belief in treef, especially among people of African descent. The consumption of certain foods is prohibited, in the belief that it could cause major diseases, particularly leprosy. These prohibitions can vary individually, but it is inextricably related to conditions in the family. A treef is inherited from the father&#x27;s side, but it can be revealed in a dream, often by a woman. In addition, a woman must take into account special food taboos during pregnancy. There is great importance attached to the treef; if a child observes the treef of his father, and yet experiences a skin condition, this is seen as a strong indication that the child was begotten by the woman with another man. Finally treef also be acquired later in life by wearing certain charms that compel you to abstain from certain foods.

The word is derived from Hebrew, due to influence of Sephardi Jews who came to Suriname in the 17th century. This is also the source of Sranan &quot;kaseri&quot; &#x27;ritually clean, kosher&#x27;.

==Other uses==
Although the term &quot;kosher&quot; relates mainly to food, it sometimes occurs in other contexts. Some Orthodox retailers sell kosher cell phones—stripped-down devices with limited features.

<text>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, or simply KLM (an abbreviation for their official name [[Koninklijk]]e Luchtvaart Maatschappij [[Naamloze vennootschap|N.V.]] , ), is the flag carrier of the Netherlands. KLM’s headquarters are located in Amstelveen, with its hub at nearby Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. It is a subsidiary of the Air France–KLM group and a member of the SkyTeam airline alliance. Founded in 1919, KLM is the oldest operating airline in the world, and has 35,488 employees with a fleet of 110 aircraft (excluding subsidiaries) as of 2021. KLM operates scheduled passenger and cargo services to 145 destinations.
==History==
===Early years===
In 1919, a young aviator lieutenant named Albert Plesman sponsored the ELTA aviation exhibition in Amsterdam. Attendance at the exhibition was over half a million, and after it closed, several Dutch commercial interests intended to establish a Dutch airline, which Plesman was nominated to head. In September 1919, Queen Wilhelmina awarded the yet-to-be-founded KLM its &quot;Royal&quot; (&quot;Koninklijke&quot;) predicate. On 7 October 1919, eight Dutch businessmen, including Frits Fentener van Vlissingen, founded KLM as one of the first commercial airline companies. Plesman became its first administrator and director.

The first KLM flight took place on 17 May 1920. KNLM&#x27;s first pilot, Jerry Shaw, flew from Croydon Airport, London, to Amsterdam. The flight was flown using a leased Aircraft Transport and Travel de Havilland DH-16, registration G-EALU, which was carrying two British journalists and some newspapers. In 1920, KLM carried 440 passengers and 22 tons of freight. In April 1921, after a winter hiatus, KLM resumed its services using its pilots, and Fokker F.II and Fokker F.III aircraft. In 1921, KLM started scheduled services.
KLM&#x27;s first intercontinental experimental flight took off on 1 October 1924. The final destination was Jakarta (then called &#x27;Batavia&#x27;), Java, in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia); the flight used a Fokker F.VII with registration H-NACC and was piloted by Jan Thomassen à Thuessink van der Hoop. In 1927, Baltimore millionaire Van Lear Black, who had heard about the 1924 flight, chartered H-NADP to do the same flight, which departed June 15 and went successfully (16 days), and flew back to much rejoicing. This inspired KLM to make a second test flight, which left on 1 October, returning successfully with much experience gained. In September 1929, regular scheduled services between Amsterdam and Batavia commenced. Until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, this was the world&#x27;s longest-distance scheduled service by airplane. By 1926, it was offering flights to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, Bremen, Copenhagen, and Malmö, using primarily Fokker F.II and Fokker F.III aircraft.

In 1930, KLM carried 15,143 passengers. The Douglas DC-2 was introduced on the Batavia service in 1934. The first experimental transatlantic KLM flight was between Amsterdam and Curaçao in December 1934 using the Fokker F.XVIII &quot;Snip&quot;.

In July 1935 the KLM had three major international passenger flight crashes in one week. The &quot;Kwikstaart&quot; crashed in Amsterdam on 14 July, the &quot;Maraboe&quot; in Bushir and on 20 July and the “Gaai” crashed in San Giacomo. The week of 14 to 20 July 1935 is known as the &quot;black week&quot;. In these three crashes KLM lost three airplanes and lost crew in two crashes. With an earlierer crash in April of the &quot;Leeuwerik&quot;, KLM had lost in 1935 around 15% of its pilots. As a result there was a shortage of crew members and airplanes. The Amsterdam—Milan flight service was as a result taken over by Deutsche Lufthansa.

The first of the airline&#x27;s Douglas DC-3 aircraft were delivered in 1936; these replaced the DC-2s on the service via Batavia to Sydney. KLM was the first airline to serve Manchester&#x27;s new Ringway airport, starting in June 1938. KLM was the only civilian airline to receive the Douglas DC-5; the airline used two of them in the West Indies and sold two to the East Indies government, and is thus the only airline to have operated all Douglas &#x27;DC&#x27; models other than the DC-1.

====Second World War====
The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 restricted KLM&#x27;s operations, with flights over France and Germany prohibited, and many of its aircraft painted in overall orange to limit the potential for confusion with military aircraft. European routes were limited to services to Scandinavia, Belgium and the UK, with flights to Lisbon (bypassing both British and French airspace) starting in April 1940.

When Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, several KLM aircraft—mostly DC-3s and a few DC-2s—were en route to or from the Far East, or were operating services in Europe. Five DC-3s and one DC-2 were taken to Britain. During the war, these aircraft and crew members flew scheduled passenger flights between Bristol and Lisbon under BOAC flight numbers and registration.

On 3 March 1942, Douglas DC-3 PH-ALP &quot;&quot;Pelikaan&quot;, then registered as PK-AFV, was shot down over Western Australia by Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service Mitsubishi A6M Zeros during the attack on Broome while carrying a package of diamonds. The DC-3 crash landed at Carnot Bay, 80 kilometers from Broome. &quot;Pelikaan&quot; was subsequently strafed by the Zeros that had shot it down, killing three passengers and the flight engineer. Diamonds worth an estimated 150,000–300,000 Australian pounds were stolen from the wreckage of the aircraft, and nobody has been convicted of the crime.

Douglas DC-3 PH-ALI &quot;Ibis&quot;&quot;, then registered as G-AGBB, was attacked by the Luftwaffe on 15 November 1942, 19 April 1943, and finally shot down on 1 June 1943 as BOAC Flight 777, killing all passengers and crew.

Some KLM aircraft and their crews ended up in the Australia-Dutch East Indies region, where they helped transport refugees from Japanese aggression in that area.

Although operations paused in Europe, KLM continued to fly and expand in the Caribbean.

==== Post-World War II ====
After the end of the Second World War in August 1945, KLM immediately started to rebuild its network. Since the Dutch East Indies were in a state of revolt, Plesman prioritised re-establishing KLM&#x27;s route to Batavia. This service was reinstated by the end of 1945. Domestic and European flights resumed in September 1945, initially with a fleet of Douglas DC-3s and Douglas DC-4s. On 21 May 1946, KLM was the first continental European airline to start scheduled transatlantic flights between Amsterdam and New York City using Douglas DC-4 aircraft. By 1948, KLM had reconstructed its network and services to Africa, North and South America, and the Caribbean resumed.

Long-range, pressurized Lockheed Constellations and Douglas DC-6s joined KLM&#x27;s fleet in the late 1940s; the Convair 240 short-range pressurized twin-engine airliner began European flights for the company in late 1948.

During the immediate post-war period, the Dutch government expressed interest in gaining a majority stake in KLM, thus partially nationalizing it. Plesman wanted KLM to remain a private company under private control; he allowed the Dutch government to acquire a minority stake in the airline. In 1950, KLM carried 356,069 passengers. The expansion of the network continued in the 1950s with the addition of several destinations in western North America. KLM&#x27;s fleet expanded with the addition of new versions of the Lockheed Constellation and Lockheed Electra, of which KLM was the first European airline to fly.
On 31 December 1953, the founder and president of KLM, Albert Plesman, died at the age of 64. He was succeeded as president by Fons Aler. After Plesman&#x27;s death, the company and other airlines entered a difficult economic period. The conversion to jet aircraft placed a further financial burden on KLM. The Netherlands government increased its ownership of the company to two-thirds, thus partly nationalizing it. The board of directors remained under the control of private shareholders.

On 25 July 1957, the airline introduced its flight simulator for the Douglas DC-7C – the last KLM aircraft with piston engines – which opened the transpolar route from Amsterdam via Anchorage to Tokyo on 1 November 1958. Each crew flying the transpolar route over the Arctic was equipped with a winter survival kit, including a 7.62 mm selective-fire AR-10 carbine for use against polar bears, in the event the plane was forced down onto the polar ice. The four-engine turboprop Vickers Viscount 800 was introduced on European routes in 1957. Beginning in September 1959, KLM introduced the four-engine turboprop Lockheed L-188 Electra onto some of its European and Middle Eastern routes.

===1960s-1970s: Jet age===

In March 1960, the airline introduced the first Douglas DC-8 jet into its fleet. In 1961, KLM reported its first year of losses. In 1961, the airline&#x27;s president Fons Aler was succeeded by Ernst van der Beugel. However, This leadership change did not lead to a reversal of KLM&#x27;s financial difficulties. Van der Beugel resigned as president in 1963 for health reasons. Horatius Albarda was appointed to succeed Ernst van der Beugel as president of KLM in 1963. Albarda initiated a reorganization of the company, which led to the reduction of staff and air services. In 1965, Albarda died in an air crash and was succeeded as president by Dr. Gerrit van der Wal. Van der Wal forged an agreement with the Dutch government that KLM would be once again run as a private company. By 1966, the stake of the Dutch government in KLM was reduced to a minority stake of 49.5%. In 1966, KLM introduced the Douglas DC-9 on European and Middle East routes.
The new terminal buildings at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol opened in April 1967, and in 1968 the stretched Douglas DC-8-63 (&quot;Super DC-8&quot;) entered service. With 244 seats, the Super DC-8 was the largest airliner in scheduled passenger service at the time, although its size was surpassed by that of the Boeing 747 first flown in 1969. On 6 March 1967, KLM ordered the 747 as its first Boeing aircraft, which marked the beginning of its use of widebody aircraft and an improved relationship between the airline and Boeing since the 1939 crash of a Boeing 307 Stratoliner carrying KLM representatives on a demonstration flight. To negotiate for lower unit prices and form a maintenance pool for its 747 fleet, KLM formed the KSS maintenance consortium in 1969 with Scandinavian Airlines and Swissair. Despite showing initial interest in the prototype 747-100 variant, KLM instead acquired the higher-gross-weight 747-200B powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines, becoming the first airline to put the type into service on 14 February 1971. In March 1971, KLM opened its current headquarters in Amstelveen. In 1972, it purchased the first of several McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aircraft—McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s response to the 747.

In 1973, Sergio Orlandini was appointed to succeed Gerrit van der Wal as president of KLM. At the time, KLM, as well as other airlines, had to deal with overcapacity. Orlandini proposed to convert KLM 747s to &quot;combis&quot; that could carry a combination of passengers and freight in a mixed configuration on the main deck of the aircraft. In November 1975, the first of these seven Boeing 747-200BM Combi aircraft were added to the KLM fleet. The airline previously operated DC-8 passenger and freight combi aircraft as well and later operated Boeing 747-400 combi aircraft.

The 1973 oil crisis, which caused difficult economic conditions, led KLM to seek government assistance in arranging debt refinancing. The airline issued additional shares of stock to the government in return for its money. In the late 1970s, the government&#x27;s stake had again increased to a majority of 78%, effectively re-nationalizing it. The company management remained under the control of private stakeholders.

=== 1980s-1990s: International expansion ===

In 1980, KLM carried 9,715,069 passengers. In 1983, it reached an agreement with Boeing to upgrade ten of its Boeing 747-200 aircraft (Three 747-200Bs and seven 747-200Ms) with the stretched-upper-deck modification. The work started in 1984 at the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, and finished in 1986. The converted aircraft were called Boeing 747-200SUD or 747-300, which the airline operated in addition to three newly built Boeing 747-300s manufactured from the ground up. In 1983, KLM took delivery of the first of ten Airbus A310 passenger jets. Sergio Orlandini retired in 1987 and was succeeded as president of KLM by Jan de Soet. In 1986, the Dutch government&#x27;s shareholding in KLM was reduced to 54.8 percent. It was expected that this share would be further reduced during the decade. The Boeing 747-400 was introduced into KLM&#x27;s fleet in June 1989.

With the liberalization of the European market, KLM started developing its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by feeding its network with traffic from affiliated airlines. As part of its development of a worldwide network, KLM acquired a 20% stake in Northwest Airlines in July 1989. In 1990, KLM carried 16,000,000 passengers. KLM president Jan de Soet retired at the end of 1990 and was succeeded in 1991 by Pieter Bouw. In December 1991, KLM was the first European airline to introduce a frequent flyer loyalty program, which was called &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;.

==== Joint venture with Northwest Airlines ====

In January 1993 the United States Department of Transportation granted KLM and Northwest Airlines anti-trust immunity, which allowed them to intensify their partnership. As of September 1993, the airlines operated their flights between the United States and Europe as part of a joint venture. In March 1994, KLM and Northwest Airlines introduced World Business Class on intercontinental routes. KLM&#x27;s stake in Northwest Airlines was increased to 25% in 1994.

KLM introduced the Boeing 767-300ER in July 1995. In January 1996, KLM acquired a 26% share in Kenya Airways, the flag-carrier airline of Kenya. In 1997, Pieter Bouw resigned as president of KLM and was succeeded by Leo van Wijk. In August 1998, KLM repurchased all regular shares from the Dutch government to make KLM a private company. On 1 November 1999, KLM founded AirCares, a communication and fundraising platform supporting worthy causes and focusing on underprivileged children.

KLM renewed its intercontinental fleets by replacing the Boeing 767s, Boeing 747-300s, and eventually, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11s with Boeing 777-200ERs and Airbus A330-200s. Some 747s were withdrawn from service first. The MD-11s remained in service until October 2014. The first Boeing 777 was received on 25 October 2003, while the first Airbus A330-200 was introduced on 25 August 2005.

===2000s: Air France-KLM merger ===
On 30 September 2003 Air France and KLM agreed to a merger plan in which Air France and KLM would become subsidiaries of a holding company called Air France-KLM. Both airlines would retain their own brands; both Charles de Gaulle Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol would become key hubs. In February 2004 the European Commission and United States Department of Justice approved the proposed merger of the airlines. In April 2004 an exchange offer in which KLM shareholders exchanged their KLM shares for Air France shares took place. Since 5 May 2004 Air France-KLM has been listed on the Euronext exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and New York. In September 2004, the merger was completed by creation of the Air France-KLM holding company. The merger resulted in the world&#x27;s largest airline group and should have led to an estimated annual cost-saving of between €400 million and €500 million.

It did not appear that KLM&#x27;s longstanding joint venture with Northwest Airlines—which merged with Delta Air Lines in 2008—was affected by the merger with Air France. KLM and Northwest joined the SkyTeam alliance in September 2004. Also in 2004, senior management came under fire for providing itself with controversial bonuses after the merger with Air France, while 4,500 jobs were lost at KLM. After external pressure, management gave up on these bonuses.

In March 2007 KLM started to use the Amadeus CRS reservation system, along with partner Kenya Airways. After 10 years as president of the airline, Leo van Wijk resigned from his position and was succeeded by Peter Hartman.

=== 2010s ===

Beginning in September 2010, KLM integrated the passenger division of Martinair into KLM, transferring all personnel and routes. By November 2011, Martinair consisted of only the cargo and maintenance division. In March 2011, KLM and InselAir reached an agreement for cooperation on InselAir destinations, thus expanding its passenger services. Beginning 27 March 2011, KLM passengers could fly to all InselAir destinations through InselAir&#x27;s hubs in Curaçao and Sint Maarten. This cooperation was extended to a code share agreement in 2012. In early 2018, the cooperation with Inselair was terminated, including any interlining agreements, after Inselair found itself in financial difficulties which forced the airline to sell off part of its fleet and cancel some of its routes.

On 20 February 2013, KLM announced that Peter Hartman would resign as president and CEO of KLM on 1 July 2013. He was succeeded by Camiel Eurlings. Hartman remained employed by the company until he retired on 1 January 2014. On 15 October 2014, KLM announced that Eurlings, in joint consultation with the supervisory board, had decided to immediately resign as president and CEO. As of this date, he was succeeded by Pieter Elbers. KLM received the award for &quot;Best Airline Staff Service&quot; in Europe at the World Airline Awards 2013. This award represents the rating for an airline&#x27;s performance across both airport staff and cabin staff combined. It is the second consecutive year that KLM won this award; in 2012 it was awarded this title as well. On 19 June 2012, KLM made the first transatlantic flight fueled partly by sustainable biofuels to Rio de Janeiro. This was the longest distance any aircraft had flown on biofuels.

In 2019, KLM celebrated its centennial, as it was founded in 1919. Since it is the oldest airline still operating under its original name, it was the first airline to achieve this feat.

=== 2020s ===
Being heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, KLM cut at least 6,000 jobs in total. It also said that the decision of the government to have all the passengers and crew COVID-19 tested before flying will have an impact on its flights. On 16 December 2021, Air France-KLM announced an order for 100 Airbus A320neos to be divided between Transavia and KLM. In July 2022, KLM was forced to cut their summer schedule due to disruption at airports across Europe.

==Corporate affairs and identity==
===Business trends===

Key business and operating results of KLM are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):
===Management===
, KLM&#x27;s corporate leader is its president and chief executive officer (CEO) Marjan Rintel, who succeeded Pieter Elbers. The president and CEO is part of the larger Executive Committee, which manages KLM and consists of the statutory managing directors and executive vice-presidents of KLM&#x27;s business units that are represented in the Executive Committee. The supervision and management of KLM are structured following the &quot;two-tier model&quot;; the Board of Managing Directors is supervised by a separate and independent Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also supervises the general performance of KLM. The Board of Managing Directors is formed by the four Managing Directors, including the CEO. Nine Supervisory Directors compose the Supervisory Board.

===Head office===

KLM&#x27;s head office is located in Amstelveen, on a site near Schiphol Airport. The airline&#x27;s current headquarters was built between 1968 and 1970. Before the opening of the new headquarters, the airline&#x27;s head office was on the property of Schiphol Airport in Haarlemmermeer.

===Subsidiaries===
Companies in which KLM has a stake include:

===Former subsidiaries===
Subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures of KLM in the past include:

KLM also worked closely with ALM Antillean Airlines in the Caribbean to provide air service for the Dutch-controlled islands in the region with KLM aircraft such as the Douglas DC-8 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 being operated by KLM flight crews on behalf of ALM.

===KLM Asia===
KLM Asia () is a wholly owned subsidiary registered in Taiwan. The subsidiary was established in 1995 to allow KLM to continue operating flights to Taipei without compromising the mainline KLM&#x27;s traffic rights for destinations in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Aircraft operated by the subsidiary retain their Dutch registration and the basic KLM livery but receive several modifications: the flags of both the Netherlands and European Union are removed while the Dutch Crown logo is replaced with the KLM Asia wordmark.
The fleet of aircraft operated by the subsidiary consists of seven Boeing 777-200ER and two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft as of March 2020. As of 2012, KLM used the &quot;KLM Asia&quot; brand to fly to Taipei and the aircraft had to fly over China. Previously KLM used Boeing 747s for its services to Taiwan. In 2012, it started operating the revised Amsterdam-Taipei-Manila route with Boeing 777-200ER aircraft.

KLM Asia aircraft are also occasionally used in services to other destinations, including China, in the wider KLM network.

===Branding===
Dirk Roosenburg designed the KLM logo at its establishment in 1919; he intertwined the letters K, L, and M, and gave them wings and a crown. The crown was depicted to denote KLM&#x27;s royal status, which was granted at KLM&#x27;s establishment. The logo became known as the &quot;vinklogo&quot; in reference to the common chaffinch. The KLM logo was largely redesigned in 1961 by F.H.K. Henrion. The crown, redesigned using a line, four blue circles and a cross, was retained. In 1991, the logo was further revised by Chris Ludlow of Henrion, Ludlow &amp; Schmidt. In addition to its main logo, KLM displays its alliance status in its branding, including &quot;Worldwide Reliability&quot; with Northwest Airlines (1993–2002) and the SkyTeam alliance (2004–present).

====Livery and uniforms====


KLM has utilized several major liveries since its founding, with numerous variations on each. Initially, many aircraft featured a bare-metal fuselage with a stripe above the windows bearing the phrase &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;. The rudder was divided into three segments and painted to match the Dutch flag. Later aircraft types sometimes bore a white upper fuselage, and additional detail striping and titling. In the mid-1950s, the livery was changed to feature a split cheatline in two shades of blue on a white upper fuselage and angled blue stripes on the vertical stabilizer. The tail stripes were later enlarged and made horizontal, and the then-new crown logo was placed in a white circle. The final major variation of this livery saw the vertical stabilizer painted completely white with the crown logo in the center. All versions of this livery had small &quot;KLM Royal Dutch Airlines&quot; titles, first in red, and later in blue.

Since 1971, the KLM livery has primarily featured a bright blue fuselage, with variations on the striping and details. Originally a wide, dark blue cheatline covered the windows and was separated from the light grey lower fuselage by a thin white stripe. The KLM logo was placed centrally on the white tail and the front of the fuselage. In December 2002, KLM introduced an updated livery in which the white strip was removed and the dark-blue cheatline was significantly narrowed. The bright blue colour was retained and now covers most of the fuselage. The KLM logo was placed more centrally on the fuselage while its position on the tail and the tail design remained the same. In 2014, KLM modified its livery with a swooping cheatline that wraps around the entire forward fuselage. The livery was first introduced on Embraer 190s.

In April 2010, KLM introduced new uniforms for its female cabin attendants, ground attendants and pilots at KLM and KLM Cityhopper. The new uniform was designed by Dutch couturier Mart Visser. It retains the KLM blue colour that was introduced in 1971 and adds a touch of orange—the national colour of the Netherlands.

====Marketing slogans====
KLM has used several slogans for marketing throughout its operational history:
* &quot;&quot;The businessman travels, sends, and receives by KLM&quot; (translated from Dutch) (1920s)
* &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;
* &quot;Bridging the World&quot; (1994)
* &quot;The Reliable Airline&quot;
* &quot;Journeys of Inspiration&quot;&quot; (2009–present)

===Social media===
KLM has an extensive presence on social media platforms and also runs a blog. Customers can make inquiries through these channels. The airline also uses these networks to inform customers of KLM news, marketing campaigns and promotions.

The airline&#x27;s use of social media platforms to reach customers peaked when the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted in April 2010, causing widespread disruption to air traffic. Customers used the social networks to contact the airline, which used them to provide information about the situation. Following the increased use of social media, KLM created a centralized, public social media website named the Social Media Hub in October 2010.

KLM has developed several services based on these social platforms, including:
* &quot;Meet &amp; Seat&quot;; this service allows passengers to find information about people who will be on the same KLM flight by connecting their Facebook or LinkedIn profiles to the flight. Meet &amp; Seat facilitates contact with fellow travellers who have the same background or interests. By launching Meet &amp; Seat, KLM became the first airline to integrate social networking into its regular flight process.
* &quot;Trip Planner&quot;; this platform uses Facebook to organize a trip with Facebook friends.
* Twitterbots; KLM operates several Twitterbots, including one to request the current status of a flight and one to request the lowest KLM fares to a destination on a specified date or month.

In June 2013, KLM launched its own 3D strategy game &quot;Aviation Empire&quot; for iOS and Android platforms. The game allows users to experience airline management. Players manage KLM from its establishment until the present; they can invest in a fleet, build a network with international destinations and develop airports. The game combines the digital world with the real world by enabling the unlocking of airports by GPS check-ins.

===Philanthropy===
KLM started KLM AirCares, a program that aids underprivileged children in developing countries to which KLM flies, in 1999. The airline collects money and airmiles from passengers. In 2012, new applications for support from the program were suspended because it needed an overhaul.

==Destinations==

KLM and its partners serve 163 destinations in 70 countries on five continents from their hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Codeshare agreements bring the total amount of destinations available via KLM to 826.

In November 2024, KLM announced additional three new routes from Amsterdam; San Diego, Georgetown and Hyderabad which will commence in May, June and September respectively. The route to San Diego and Hyderabad will be direct flights connecting the two cities, while the flights to Georgetown will have a brief stopover in Sint Maarten.

===Fleet strategy===
KLM&#x27;s first of eight Boeing 787-10 aircraft was delivered on 28 June 2019; it featured centennial markings.

On 19 June 2013, KLM ordered seven Airbus A350-900s. In June 2019, Air France-KLM announced that KLM will not take up any of the group&#x27;s ordered A350s, because of fleet rationalization purposes.

CEO Ben Smith announced at Air France&#x27;s Investor Day (5 November 2019) in Paris that &quot;in the near future&quot;, KLM will only use the 777 and 787 as their long-haul fleet, retiring their thirteen A330&#x27;s.

In December 2021, Air France-KLM ordered 100 Airbus A320neo family aircraft to replace KLM and Transavia&#x27;s Boeing 737 Next Generation.

On 25 September 2023, Air France-KLM announced that they had signed an agreement with Airbus for a total of 50 Airbus A350-900 and A350-1000 aircraft, with an option for 40 more. The type is set to serve intercontinental flights from 2026, replacing its fleet of Boeing 777-200ERs, Airbus A330-200s and Airbus A330-300s.

===Special liveries===

KLM has several aircraft painted in special liveries; they include:
* PH-BVA, a Boeing 777-300ER, features an orange forward fuselage that fades into the standard blue to commemorate the Netherlands national team&#x27;s participation in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. On 20 November 2023 KLM launched a new version of this livery in which the fade was replaced by a Dutch flag.
* PH-KZU, a Fokker F70, had been applied with a special livery featuring Anthony Fokker before its phase-out, the founder of Fokker, commemorating the airline&#x27;s long-standing history with Fokker aircraft and the phase-out of the Fokker 70 aircraft in October 2017.
* Several aircraft bear the silver SkyTeam alliance livery, including PH-BVD (a 777-300ER), PH-BXO (a 737-900), and PH-EZX (a KLM Cityhopper ERJ-190).
*PH-BKA, a Boeing 787-10, features the standard KLM livery with a 100 wrapped around its lettering on the plane, this was to celebrate KLM&#x27;s centennial as an established airline.

==Cabin==
KLM has three cabin classes for international long-haul routes; World Business Class, Premium Comfort and Economy. Part of the Economy cabin has a higher seat pitch and is sold as Economy Comfort. Personal screens with audio-video on-demand, satellite telephone, SMS, and e-mail services are available in all cabins on all long-haul aircraft. European short-haul and medium-haul flights have Economy seats in the rear cabin, and Economy Comfort and Europe Business in the forward cabin.

===World Business Class===

Seats are equipped with a personal entertainment system with audio and video on demand in the armrest, privacy canopy, massage function and laptop power ports. World Business Class seating is in a 2–2–2 abreast arrangement on all Airbus A330s.

In March 2013, KLM introduced a new World Business Class seat to the long-haul fleet. Dutch designer Hella Jongerius designed the new cabin. The diamond-type seat is manufactured by B/E Aerospace and is currently installed on all Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s. The seats were also refurbished on former KLM Boeing 747-400s between 2013 and 2014. The new seats are fully flat and offer -high definition personal entertainment systems. When fully flat, the bed is about long. The cabin features a cradle-to-cradle carpet made from old uniforms woven in an intricate pattern, which is combined with new pillows and curtains with a similar design.

A completely new design of Business Class seats was introduced with the launch of KLM&#x27;s Boeing 787; this aircraft&#x27;s business class seats are based on the Zodiac Cirrus platform used by Air France. The new seats lie fully flat, with a 1-2-1 layout so every passenger has direct aisle access, a large side-storage area and HD video screen.

The tableware and cutlery for business class in-flight service was designed by Marcel Wanders. Dutch fashion stylists Viktor &amp; Rolf designed amenity kits for World Business Class passengers. A new design will be introduced each year and the color of the kits will change every six months. The kit contains socks, an eye mask, a toothbrush, toothpaste, earplugs and Viktor &amp; Rolf lip balm.

In 2022, KLM announced they would retrofit Boeing 777 aircraft in their fleet (notably, the 777-300 and 777-200) with seats in a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone configuration while installing Premium Comfort seats. These new seats will feature a &quot;door&quot; for extra privacy.

==Services==

===In-flight entertainment===
KLM&#x27;s in-flight entertainment system is available in all classes on all widebody aircraft; it provides all passengers with Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD). The system includes interactive entertainment including movies, television programs, music, games, and language courses. About 80 movies including recent releases, classics and world cinema are available in several languages. The selection is changed every month. The in-flight entertainment system can be used to send SMS text messages and emails to the ground. Panasonic&#x27;s 3000i system is installed on all Boeing 747-400, Boeing 777-200ER, and on most of the Airbus A330-200 aircraft. All Airbus A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, and some Airbus A330-200 aircraft are fitted with the Panasonic eX2 in-flight entertainment system.

KLM provides a selection of international newspapers to its passengers on long-haul flights; on short-haul flights, they are offered only to Europe Business Class passengers. A selection of international magazines is available for World Business Class passengers on long-haul flights. All passengers are provided with KLM&#x27;s in-flight magazine, the &quot;Holland Herald.&quot; On board flights to China, South Korea and Japan, the airline offers in-flight magazines &quot;EuroSky&quot; (China and Japan), in either Chinese or Japanese, and &quot;Wings of Europe&quot; (South Korea) in Korean. On 29 May 2013, KLM and Air France launched a pilot scheme to test in-flight WiFi internet access. Each airline equipped one Boeing 777-300ER in its fleet with WiFi, which passengers can use with their WiFi-enabled devices. Wireless service was available after the aircraft reached in altitude.

===Catering===
World Business Class passengers are served a three-course meal. Each year KLM partners with a leading Dutch chef to develop the dishes that are served on board. Passengers in Europe Business Class are served either a cold meal, a hot main course, or a three-course meal depending on the duration of the flight. All chicken served in World and Europe Business Class meets the standards of the Dutch Beter Leven Keurmerk (Better Life Quality Mark). KLM partnered with Dutch designer Marcel Wanders to design the tableware of World and European Business Class.

Economy Class passengers on long-haul flights are served a hot meal and a snack, and a second hot meal or breakfast, depending on the duration of the flight. On short-haul flights, passengers are served sandwiches or a choice of sweet or savoury snack, depending on the duration and time of the day. If the flight is at least two hours long, &quot;stroopwafel&quot; cookies are served before the descent. Most alcoholic beverages are free-of-charge for all passengers. After a successful trial period, KLM introduced à la carte meals in Economy Class on 14 September 2011; Dutch, Japanese, Italian, cold delicacies, and Indonesian meals are offered.

Special meals, including children&#x27;s, vegetarian, medical, and religious meals, can be requested in each class up to 24 or 36 hours before departure. On flights to India, China, South Korea, and Japan, KLM offers authentic Asian meals in all classes. Meals served on KLM flights departing from Amsterdam are provided by KLM Catering Services.

In September 2016, KLM launched the world&#x27;s first in-flight draft beer under the partnership with Heineken. The new service made its premiere aboard a flight to Curaçao in the airline&#x27;s World Business Class cabin.

===Delft Blue houses===

Since the 1950s, KLM has presented its World Business Class passengers with a Delft blue miniature traditional Dutch house. These miniatures are reproductions of real Dutch houses and are filled with Dutch genever. Initially the houses were filled with Bols liqueur, which in 1986 was changed to Bols young genever.

In 1952, KLM started to give the houses to its First Class passengers. With the elimination of First Class in 1993, the houses were handed out to all Business Class passengers. The impetus for these houses was a rule aimed at curtailing a previously widespread practise of offering incentives to passengers by limiting the value of gifts given by airlines to US$0.75. KLM did not bill the Delft Blue houses as a gift but as a last drink free of charge, which was served in the house.

Every year, a new house is presented on 7 October, the anniversary of KLM&#x27;s founding in 1919. The number on the last-presented house thus represents the number of years KLM has been in operation. Special edition houses—the Royal Palace of Amsterdam and the 17th century Cheese Weighing House &quot;De Waag&quot; in Gouda—are offered to special guests, such as VIPs and honeymoon couples.

===Ground services===
KLM offers various check-in methods to its passengers, who can check in for their flights at self-service check-in kiosks at the airport, via the Internet, or a mobile telephone or tablet. At destinations where these facilities are not available, check-in is by an airline representative at the counter. Electronic boarding passes can be received on a mobile device while boarding passes can be printed at airport kiosks.

Since 4 July 2008 KLM, in cooperation with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, has been offering self-service baggage drop-off to its passengers. The project started with a trial that included one drop-off point. The number of these points has gradually increased; there are 12 of them. KLM passengers can now drop off their bags themselves. Before they are allowed to do that they are being checked by a KLM employee.

In November 2012, KLM started a pilot scheme at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to test self-service boarding. Passengers boarded the aircraft without any interference of a gate agent by scanning their boarding passes, which opened a gate. KLM partner airline Air France ran the same pilot at its hub at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. The pilot ran until March 2013, which was followed by an evaluation.

KLM is the first airline to offer self-service transfer kiosks on its European and intercontinental routes for passengers connecting through Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The kiosks enable connecting passengers to view flight details of connecting flights, to change seat assignments or upgrade to a more comfortable seat. When a passenger misses a connecting flight, details about alternative flights can be viewed on the kiosk and a new boarding pass can be printed. Passengers who are entitled to coupons for a beverage, meal, the use of a telephone, or a travel discount can have these printed at the kiosk.

===Flying Blue===

Air France-KLM&#x27;s frequent flyer program, Flying Blue, awards miles based on the distance travelled, ticket fare and class of service. As well as KLM and Air France, other airlines that adopted the Flying Blue programme include Transavia, Aircalin, and TAROM. Membership in the program is free. When flying, members earn Experience Points (XP) and Award Miles.

Experience Points are used to determine membership level and remain valid until the end of the qualification period, which lasts for 1 year from counting from the member&#x27;s first flight. XP can be earned with KLM, Air France, Transavia, Aircalin, TAROM, and other SkyTeam partners. The Flying Blue programme is divided into four tiers: Explorer, Silver (SkyTeam Elite), Gold (SkyTeam Elite Plus) and Platinum (SkyTeam Elite Plus). The membership tier depends on the number of Experience Points earned and is recalculated each qualification period. Flying Blue privileges are additive by membership tier; higher tiers include all benefits listed for prior tiers. There is an additional fifth tier, Platinum for Life, which can be obtained after 10 consecutive years of Platinum membership. After the Platinum for Life status is obtained, re-qualification is not required.

Award Miles can be exchanged for rewards and expire after 24 months without flying. Award Miles can be earned on flights with SkyTeam member airlines as well as on other Flying Blue partners including Air Corsica, Air Mauritius, airBaltic, Aircalin, Bangkok Airways, Chalair Aviation, China Southern Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes Aéreos, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Transavia, Twin Jet, WestJet and Winair. Award Miles are redeemable for free tickets, upgrades to a more expensive seating class, extra baggage allowance, wifi on board, and lounge access. They can also be donated to various charities, or can be spent in the Flying Blue Store.

In June 2022, Brim Financial announced it will launch an Air France-KLM co-branded credit card in Canada.

==Sustainability==
In 2022, parent company Air France-KLM published a report of emission reduction targets for 2030 that were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative to be in line with the Paris Agreement. This includes offering options for consumers to contribute to sustainability programs offered by the airline. On their website, KLM detail many sustainability initiatives, including use of sustainable aviation fuels, reforestation programs, and reducing the weight of on board items to save fuel. 

A report by the Breda University of Applied Sciences stated that the measures set by KLM in the 2022 report will not achieve the targets set out. In 2024, it was ruled that 15 of 19 claims submitted by KLM, including being on their way to &quot;a more sustainable future&quot; were based on vague and general statements, and overexaggerated the potential effects of the measures put in place. These were deemed misleading and therefore unlawful, and has been described by activists as Greenwashing.

Meanwhile, Air France-KLM have been heavily involved in lobbying against European climate policy, and have actively opposed measures such as a kerosine tax and a flight cap at Schipol Airport.

===Sustainable Aviation Fuels===
The main measure mentioned by KLM in its emissions reduction programme is the addition of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to jet fuel. KLM offers customers the option to pay extra to contribute to the SAF programme, stating that the fuel will be added to the system at Schipol. The report by Breda University stated that KLM&#x27;s target for SAF share by 2030 was not realistic given the scarcity of the fuel and the expected global availability.

===Compensation through reforestation===
KLM offers customers the opportunity to offset their flight emissions by contributing to reforestation programs. They initially used the slogan “Be a hero, fly CO2 zero” to promote this. However in 2022, the Dutch agency RCC (Advertising Code Committee) indicated to KLM that this claim was not sufficiently substantiated and that it was wrong to state that it was possible to fly CO2 neutral.

==Accidents and incidents==
===Tenerife airport disaster===


The Tenerife disaster, which occurred on 27 March 1977, remains the accident with the highest number of airliner passenger fatalities, as well as the most recent fatal and notable incident involving a KLM aircraft. 583 people died when a KLM Boeing 747-200B attempted to take off without clearance and collided with a taxiing Pan Am Boeing 747-100 at Los Rodeos Airport on the Canary Island of Tenerife, Spain. No one on the KLM 747 survived (14 crew, 234 passengers were killed) while 61 of the 396 passengers and crew on the Pan Am aircraft survived. Pilot error from the KLM aircraft was the primary cause. Owing to a communication misunderstanding, the KLM captain thought he had clearance for takeoff. Another cause was dense fog, meaning the KLM flight crew was unable to see the Pan Am aircraft on the runway until immediately before the collision. The accident had a lasting influence on the industry, particularly in the area of communication. An increased emphasis was placed on using standardized phraseology in air traffic control (ATC) communication by both controllers and pilots alike, thereby reducing the chance for misunderstandings. As part of these changes, the word &quot;takeoff&quot; was removed from general usage, and is only spoken by ATC when clearing an aircraft to take off.

<text>The Kansas City Royals are an American professional baseball team based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Royals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central Division. The team was founded as an expansion franchise in 1969, and have made four World Series trips, winning in and , and losing in and . Outside of a dominant 10-year stretch between 1976 and 1985, and a brief, albeit dominant, resurgence from 2013 to 2015, the Royals have combined for a bottom-ten all time winning percentage in MLB history.

The name &quot;Royals&quot; pays homage to the American Royal, a livestock show, horse show, rodeo, and championship barbecue competition held annually in Kansas City since 1899, as well as the identical names of two former Negro league baseball teams that played in the first half of the 20th century (one was a semi-pro team based in Kansas City in the 1910s and 1920s that toured the Midwest and the other was a California Winter League team based in Los Angeles in the 1940s that was managed by Chet Brewer and included Satchel Paige and Jackie Robinson on its roster). The Los Angeles team had personnel connections to the Monarchs but could not use the Monarchs name. The name also fits into something of a theme for other professional sports franchises in the city, including the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL, the former Kansas City Kings of the NBA, and the former Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League.

In 1968, the team held a name-the-team contest that received more than 17,000 entries. Sanford Porte, a bridge engineer from the suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, was named the winner for his “Royals” entry. His reason had nothing to do with royalty. “Kansas City’s new baseball team should be called the Royals because of Missouri’s billion-dollar livestock income, Kansas City’s position as the nation’s leading stocker and feeder market and the nationally known American Royal parade and pageant,” Porte wrote. The team&#x27;s board voted 6–1 on the name, with the only opposition coming from team owner Ewing Kauffman, who eventually changed his vote and said the name had grown on him.

Entering the American League in 1969 along with the Seattle Pilots, the club was founded by Kansas City businessman Ewing Kauffman. The franchise was established following the actions of Stuart Symington, then-U.S. Senator from Missouri, who demanded a new franchise for the city after the Athletics (Kansas City&#x27;s previous major league team that played from 1955 to 1967) moved to Oakland, California, in 1968. Since April 10, 1973, the Royals have played at Kauffman Stadium, formerly known as Royals Stadium.

The new team quickly became a powerhouse, appearing in the playoffs seven times from 1976 to 1985, winning one World Series championship and another AL pennant, led by stars such as Amos Otis, Hal McRae, John Mayberry, George Brett, Frank White, Willie Wilson, and Bret Saberhagen. The team remained competitive throughout the early 1990s, but then had only one winning season from 1995 to 2012. For 28 consecutive seasons (1986–2013), the Royals did not qualify to play in the MLB postseason, one of the longest postseason droughts during baseball&#x27;s current wild-card era. The team broke this streak in 2014 by securing the franchise&#x27;s first wild card berth and advancing to the 2014 World Series, where they lost to the San Francisco Giants in seven games. The Royals, led by players like Salvador Perez, Alex Gordon, Johnny Cueto, Danny Duffy, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain, and an elite group of bullpen pitchers, followed this up by winning the team&#x27;s first AL Central division title in 2015 and defeating the New York Mets in five games in the 2015 World Series to win their second World Series championship.

From 1969 to 2024, the Royals have an all time win–loss record of (). Entering the 2023 season, the team is valued at US$1.2 billion, placing them 27th out of MLB&#x27;s 30 teams. Since 2019, the team has been owned by majority owner John Sherman, amongst many other Kansas City business owners and entrepreneurs.

==Franchise history==

===Baseball returns to Kansas City===
When the Kansas City Athletics moved to Oakland after the 1967 season, Kansas City was left without major league baseball or, for the first time since 1883, professional baseball at all. The team was led by Charlie Finley, who explored many elaborate relocation plans and essentially shunned Kansas City before the team even relocated. An enraged Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri threatened to introduce legislation removing baseball&#x27;s antitrust exemption unless Kansas City was granted a team in the next round of expansion. Major League Baseball complied with a hasty round of expansion at the 1967 winter meetings. Kansas City was awarded one of four teams to begin play in 1971. However, Symington was not satisfied with having Kansas City wait three years for baseball to return, and pressured MLB to allow the new teams to start play in 1969. Symington&#x27;s intervention may have contributed to the financial collapse of the Royals&#x27; companion expansion team, the Seattle Pilots, who had to begin play in 1969 before they were ready (the league required new franchises to enter in pairs to preserve symmetry for scheduling purposes).

Pharmaceutical executive Ewing Kauffman won the bidding for the new Kansas City team. He conducted a contest to determine the best and most appropriate name for the new franchise. Sanford Porte from Overland Park, Kansas submitted the name Royals, in recognition of Missouri&#x27;s billion-dollar livestock industry. His suggestion was that the American Royal best exemplified Kansas City through its pageantry and parade, so the new team should be named the Royals. The name was selected out of 17,000 submissions and the Royals Board voted 6–1 to adopt the name. The one dissenting vote was Kauffman&#x27;s. He eventually changed his mind after the name grew on him. (Some sources say it was in honor of the Kansas City Monarchs, a Negro leagues team.) The team&#x27;s logo, a crown atop a shield with the letters &quot;KC&quot; inside the shield, was created by Shannon Manning, an artist at Hallmark Cards, based in Kansas City.

===1969–1979: Taking Off===

The Royals began play in 1969 in Kansas City, Missouri. In their inaugural game, on April 8, 1969, the Royals defeated the Minnesota Twins 4–3 in 12 innings. The Royals went 69–93 in their first season, highlighted by Lou Piniella, who won the AL Rookie of the Year Award.

The team was quickly built through a number of trades engineered by its first General Manager, Cedric Tallis, who picked up center fielder Amos Otis, who became the team&#x27;s first star, first baseman John Mayberry, who provided power, second baseman Cookie Rojas, shortstop Fred Patek, and designated hitter Hal McRae. The Royals also invested in a strong farm system and developed future star pitchers Paul Splittorff, Dennis Leonard, and Steve Busby, infielders George Brett and Frank White, and outfielder Al Cowens. Under these young players, the Royals built a core set up for future success.

In 1971, the Royals had their first winning season, with manager Bob Lemon leading them to a second-place finish. In 1973, under manager Jack McKeon, the Royals adopted their iconic &quot;powder blue&quot; road uniforms and moved from Municipal Stadium to the brand-new Royals Stadium (now known as Kauffman Stadium).

The 1973 All-Star Game was hosted at Royals Stadium, with Otis and Mayberry in the AL starting lineup. The event was previously held at Municipal Stadium in 1960, when the Athletics were based in Kansas City.

Manager Whitey Herzog replaced McKeon in 1975, and the Royals quickly became the dominant franchise in the American League&#x27;s Western Division. After a second-place, 91 win season, they won three straight division championships from 1976 to 1978, including the franchise&#x27;s only 100-win season in 1977. However, the Royals lost to the New York Yankees in three straight American League Championship Series encounters.

===1980–1984: From Pennant to Pine Tar Incident===
After the Royals finished in second place in 1979, Herzog was fired and replaced by Jim Frey. Under Frey and a legendary .390 season from George Brett, the Royals rebounded in 1980 and advanced to the ALCS, where they again faced the Yankees. The Royals vanquished the Yankees in a three-game sweep punctuated by Brett&#x27;s home run off of Yankees&#x27; star relief pitcher Goose Gossage. After reaching their first World Series, the Royals fell to the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. Game 6 was also significant because it remains the most-watched game in World Series history with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers.

In July 1983, while the Royals were headed for a second-place finish behind the Chicago White Sox another chapter in the team&#x27;s rivalry with the New York Yankees occurred. In what has come to be known as &quot;the Pine Tar Incident&quot;, umpires discovered illegal placement of pine tar (more than 18 inches up the handle) on third baseman George Brett&#x27;s bat after he had hit a two-run home run off Gossage that put the Royals up 5–4 in the top of the 9th. After Yankee Manager Billy Martin came out of the dugout to talk to home plate umpire Tim McClelland, McClelland and the other umpires mulled over the bat (measuring it over home plate, touching it, etc.). McClelland then pointed to Brett in the dugout and gave the &quot;out&quot; sign, disallowing the home run. Enraged, Brett stormed out of the dugout toward McClelland and Martin, and McClelland ejected Brett. The homer was later reinstated by AL President Lee MacPhail, and the Royals won the game after it was resumed several weeks later.

The 1983 season was also notable for some transitional changes in the Royals organization. First, owner Ewing Kauffman sold 49% of his interest to Memphis developer Avron Fogelman. Second, John Schuerholz was named general manager. Schuerholz soon bolstered the farm system with pitchers Bud Black, Danny Jackson, Mark Gubicza, David Cone, and Bret Saberhagen, as well as hitters such as Kevin Seitzer.

Thanks to the sudden and surprising maturation (specifically, in pitching) of most of the aforementioned players, the Royals won their fifth division championship in 1984, relying on Brett&#x27;s bat and the young pitching staff of Saberhagen, Gubicza, Charlie Leibrandt, Black and Jackson. The Royals were then swept by the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series. The Tigers went on to win the World Series.

===1985: &quot;The I-70 Series&quot;===

In the 1985 regular season the Royals topped the Western Division for the sixth time in ten years, led by Bret Saberhagen&#x27;s Cy Young Award-winning performance and George Brett&#x27;s self-described best &quot;all around year.&quot; Throughout the ensuing playoffs, the Royals incurred both a 2-0 and a 3–1 series deficit in both rounds of the playoffs, but always managed to claw their way back into the series. In game three of the American League Championship Series, with KC down 2 games to 0, George Brett homered twice and doubled off the fence in right field to put Kansas City back into the series. With the Royals down three games to one in the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Royals eventually rallied to win the series 4–3, highlighted by a go-ahead 3-run triple from Jim Sundberg against Blue Jay&#x27;s ace Dave Stieb in Game 7.

====1985 World Series====
In the 1985 World Series (nicknamed the &quot;I-70 Series&quot; because the two teams are both located in the state of Missouri and connected by Interstate 70) against the cross-state St. Louis Cardinals, the Royals again fell behind, three games to one. After Danny Jackson pitched the Royals to a 6–1 win in game five, the Cardinals and Royals headed back to Kansas City for game six. Facing elimination, the Royals trailed 1–0 in the bottom of the 9th inning, when Jorge Orta led off, hitting a bouncing ground ball to Cardinals 1st basemen Jack Clark, who flipped the ball back to pitcher Todd Worrell at first base. The ball beat Orta to the bag, but umpire Don Denkinger called him safe, and following a dropped popup by Clark and a passed ball, the Royals rallied to score two runs, winning on a walk-off single from pinch hitter Dane Iorg to send the series to game seven. In game seven Bret Saberhagen shutout the Cardinals as Kansas City dominated the Cardinals 11–0, clinching their first title in franchise history.

===1986–1994: Staying in the Picture===
The Royals maintained a reputation as one of the American League West&#x27;s top teams throughout the late 1980s. The club posted a winning record in three of the four seasons following its 1985 World Series championship, while developing young stars such as Bo Jackson, Tom Gordon, and Kevin Seitzer. The Royals finished the 1989 season with a 92–70 record (third-best in the major leagues) but did not qualify for the playoffs, finishing second in their division behind the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics.

At the end of the 1989 season, the team boasted a powerhouse pitching rotation, including the AL Cy Young Award-winner Bret Saberhagen (who set franchise record 23 wins that year), two-time All-Star Mark Gubicza (a 15-game winner in 1989) and 1989 AL Rookie of the Year runner-up Tom Gordon (who won 17 games that year). But the organization felt it was still missing a few necessary pieces to give its divisional rival Oakland Athletics a run for their money. So prior to the 1990 season, the Royals acquired Mark Davis, the 1989 National League Cy Young Award-winner and league leader in saves, signing him to a 4-year, $13 million contract (the largest annual salary in baseball history at the time). The Royals also signed starting pitcher Storm Davis, who was coming off a career-high 19-game win season (third-best in the AL), to a three-year $6 million contract. Despite the promising off-season moves, the team suffered critical bullpen injuries while both newly signed Davises experienced lackluster seasons in 1990. The Royals concluded the season with a 75–86 record, in second-to-last place in the AL West (and with the worst franchise record since 1970). Bo Jackson—the team&#x27;s potential future franchise player—suffered a devastating hip injury while playing football in the off-season, so the Royals waived him during spring training in 1991.

Though the team dropped out of contention from 1990 to 1992, the Royals still could generally be counted on to post winning records through the strike-shortened 1994 season. With no playoff appearances despite the winning records during this era, many of the team&#x27;s highlights instead centered around the end of George Brett&#x27;s career, such as his third and final batting title in 1990—which made him the first player to win batting titles in three different decades—and his 3,000th hit.

In 1994, the Royals moved from the AL West to the newly created AL Central along with the Chicago White Sox and Minnesota Twins, joined by the Cleveland Indians and Milwaukee Brewers from the AL East. The Brewers left for the NL Central in 1998, replaced by the Detroit Tigers that moved from the AL East.

===1995–2002: Decline in the Post-Kauffman Era===
At the start of the 1990s, the Royals had been hit with a double-whammy when General Manager John Schuerholz departed in 1990 and team owner Ewing Kauffman died in 1993. Shortly before Kauffman&#x27;s death, he set up an unprecedented complex succession plan to keep the team in Kansas City. The team was donated at his death to the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation and Affiliated Trusts with operating decisions of the team decided by a five-member group chaired by Wal-Mart executive David Glass. According to the plan the Royals had six years to find a local owner for the team before opening ownership to an outside bidder. The new owners would be required to say they would keep the team in Kansas City. Kauffman had feared that new owners would move it noting, &quot;No one would want to buy a baseball team that consistently loses millions of dollars and had little prospect of making money because it was in a small city.&quot; If no owner could be found the Kauffman restrictions were to end on January 1, 2002, and the team was to be sold to the highest bidder. In 1999, New York City lawyer and minor league baseball owner Miles Prentice, vowing not to move the team, bid $75 million for the team. This was the minimum amount Kauffman had stipulated the team could be sold for. MLB rejected Prentice&#x27;s first bid without specifying any reason. In a final round of bids on March 13, 2000, the Foundation voted to accept Glass&#x27; bid of $96 million, rejecting Prentice&#x27;s revised bid of $115 million.

During the interregnum under Foundation ownership, the team declined. In the 1994 season, the Royals reduced payroll by trading pitcher David Cone and outfielder Brian McRae, then continued their salary dump in the 1995 season. The team payroll, which had previously remained among the league&#x27;s highest, was sliced in half from $40.5 million in 1994 (fourth-highest in the major leagues) to $18.5 million in 1996 (second-lowest in the major leagues).

As attendance slid and the average MLB salary continued to rise, rather than pay higher salaries or lose their players to free agency, the Royals traded their remaining stars such as Kevin Appier, Johnny Damon and Jermaine Dye. By 1999, the team&#x27;s payroll had fallen again to $16.5 million. Making matters worse, most of the younger players that the Royals received in exchange for these All-Stars proved of little value, setting the stage for an extended downward spiral. Indeed, the Royals set a franchise-low with a .398 winning percentage (64–97 record) in 1999, and lost 97 games again in 2001.

In the middle of this era, in 1997, the Royals declined the opportunity to switch to the National League as part of a realignment plan to introduce the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays as expansion teams. The Milwaukee Brewers made the switch instead.

In 2002, the Royals set a new team record for futility, losing 100 games for the first time in franchise history. They fired manager Tony Muser, and he was replaced by Tony Peña.

===2003: A Winning Season===
The 2003 season saw a temporary end to the losing, when manager Tony Peña, in his first full season with the club, guided the team to its first winning record (83–79) since 1994 and finished in third place in the AL Central. He was named the American League Manager of the Year for his efforts and shortstop Ángel Berroa was named AL Rookie of the Year.

===2004–2008: Rock Bottom===
From the 2004 season through the 2012 season, the Royals posted nine consecutive losing records, the longest streak in team history. In six of those seasons, the team finished in last place in the American League Central, and in eight of those nine seasons the team lost at least 90 games. The worst seasons came in 2004–2006, when the Royals lost at least 100 games each year and set the franchise&#x27;s all-time record for losses (56–106 in 2005).

Picked by many to win their division in 2004 after faring well in the free agent market, the Royals got off to a disappointing start and by late June were back in a rebuilding mode, releasing veteran reliever Curtis Leskanic and trading veteran reliever Jason Grimsley and superstar center fielder Carlos Beltrán for prospects, all within a week of each other.

The team subsequently fell apart completely, losing 104 games and breaking the franchise record set just two years earlier. The Royals did, however, see promising seasons from two rookies, center fielder David DeJesus and starting pitcher Zack Greinke. The team continued a youth movement in 2005, but finished with a 56–106 record (.346), a full 43 games out of first place, marking the third time in four seasons that the team reestablished the mark for worst record in franchise history. The season also saw the Royals lose 19 games in a row, a franchise record. During the season manager Tony Peña quit and was replaced by interim manager Bob Schaefer until the Indians&#x27; bench coach Buddy Bell was chosen as the next manager. Looking for a quick turnaround, general manager Allard Baird signed several veteran players prior to the 2006 season, including Doug Mientkiewicz, Mark Grudzielanek, Joe Mays and Scott Elarton. Nevertheless, the Royals struggled through another 100-loss season in 2006, becoming just the eleventh team in major league history to lose 100 games in three straight seasons. During the season Baird was fired as GM and replaced by Dayton Moore.

Kansas City entered the 2007 season looking to rebound from four out of five seasons ending with at least 100 losses. The Royals outbid the Cubs and Blue Jays for free agent righty Gil Meche, signing him to a five-year, $55 million contract, the largest contract in Royals history. Reliever Octavio Dotel also inked a one-year, $5 million contract. The team also added several new prospects, including Alex Gordon and Billy Butler. Among Dayton Moore&#x27;s first acts as General Manager was instating a new motto for the team: &quot;True. Blue. Tradition.&quot; In June 2007, the Royals had their first winning month since July 2003 and followed it up with a winning July. The Royals finished the season 69–93, but 2007 marked the club&#x27;s first season with fewer than 100 losses since 2003. Manager Buddy Bell resigned following the 2007 season.

The Royals hired Trey Hillman, formerly the manager of the Nippon Ham Fighters and a minor league manager with the New York Yankees, to be the 15th manager in franchise history. The 2008 season began with the release of fan-favorite Mike Sweeney and the trade of Ángel Berroa to the Dodgers. Through 13 games in 2008, the Royals were 8–5 and in first place in the AL Central, a vast improvement over their start from the previous season. However, by the All-Star break, the Royals were again in losing territory, with their record buoyed only by a 13–5 record in interleague play, the best in the American League. The team finished the season in fourth place in the division with a 75–87 record.

===2009–2012: Kauffman Renovations and Further Rebuilding===

Prior to the 2009 season, the Royals renovated Kauffman Stadium, and after the season began, the Royals ended April at the top of the AL Central, both of which raised excitement levels among fans. However, the team faded as the season progressed and finished the year with a final record of 65–97, in a tie for fourth place in the AL Central. The season was highlighted by starter Zack Greinke, who did not allow an earned run in the first 24 innings of the season, went on to finish the year with a Major League-leading 2.16 earned run average, and won the American League Cy Young Award. Greinke joined Bret Saberhagen (in 1985 and 1989) and David Cone (in 1994) as only the third player in Royals history to receive the award.

The Royals began the 2010 season with a rocky start, and after the team&#x27;s record fell to 12–23, manager Trey Hillman was fired. Former Milwaukee Brewers skipper Ned Yost took over as the 16th manager in franchise history, At the end of the 2010 season, the Royals finished with a 67–95 record, in last place in the division for the sixth time in seven years. The Royals also set a dubious franchise record during the season, allowing 42 runs in a three-day span from July 25 to 27. The Royals began 2011 with a hot start, compiling 10–4 record after 14 games, but success faded as the season progressed. The Royals last had a .500 record at 22–22, and by the All-Star break, the Royals had a record of 37–54, the worst in the American League. Almost all of the Royals&#x27; bullpen was made up of 2011 minor league call ups, in addition to the infielders Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Johnny Giavotella, and catchers Salvador Pérez and Manny Piña. Hosmer won the AL Rookie of the Month award in July and September and finished the season with 19 home runs. Moustakas collected a fifteen-game hitting streak, which tied the longest such streak by a Royals rookie. The Royals finished the 2011 season with a 71–91 record, in fourth place in the AL Central. The 2012 team saw more of the same, as they improved by one game to 72–90, but finished one spot better in the division.

The 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was hosted by the Royals at Kauffman Stadium on July 10, 2012 (in addition to the 2012 Home Run Derby, All-Star Futures Game and Taco Bell All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game during the All-Star break), which the National League won 8–0. The 2012 season marked the third time the &quot;Midsummer Classic&quot; was held in Kansas City.

===2013: Return to Respectability===

On December 10, 2012, in an attempt to strengthen the pitching staff (which was among the worst in baseball in 2012), the Royals traded for Rays pitchers James Shields and Wade Davis, giving Tampa top prospects Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery, and Patrick Leonard in return. This trade helped catalyze a return to winning records.

For most of the 2013 season, the Royals hovered near .500. The team also did not commit an error in its first seven games (for innings) for the first time in team history. On September 22, the Royals won their 82nd game of the season to clinch the franchise&#x27;s first winning season since 2003. The Royals finished the season 86–76 and in third place in the AL Central, securing the team&#x27;s best winning percentage since 1994.

===2014: Return to the World Series===

The 2014 season featured a return to the postseason for the first time in 29 years, and what would unfold as a historic playoff run from the Wild Card all the way to the 2014 World Series.

Anchored by the &quot;HDH&quot; trio of Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis, and Greg Holland, the bullpen became one of the most dominant in MLB history.

Entering the 2014 season, the Royals had the longest playoff drought of any team in the four main American professional sports leagues (NFL, MLB, NHL, and NBA). On July 21, 2014, the Royals had a losing record (48–50) and were eight games behind the Detroit Tigers in the AL Central standings. But spurred by a 22–5 record from July 22 to August 19 coinciding with a mediocre 12–15 stretch by the Tigers, the team surged into first place in the AL Central. The Royals reached the top of the division standings on August 11, after winning their eighth game in a row. This marked the latest date the Royals had led their division since August 29, 2003. The team retained its division lead for a month, before falling out of first-place permanently on September 12. They finished the 2014 regular season with a record 89–73, still the most wins for the Royals since 1989. Though the team finished one game behind Detroit in the AL Central, the Royals secured their first-ever wild card berth.

After qualifying for the postseason, the Royals embarked on a record-setting eight-game winning streak. They hosted the Oakland Athletics in the 2014 American League Wild Card Game and won 9–8 on a Salvador Pérez walk-off single in the 12th inning, having earlier rallied back from a 7–3 deficit in the eighth. The Royals then swept the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the 2014 American League Division Series. In Game 1 of the ALDS, the score was 2–2 going into the 11th inning, when Mike Moustakas hit a game-winning solo home run. The next day, Kansas City beat the Angels 4–1 in another extra-innings affair, in the process setting an MLB postseason record of three straight extra-inning wins. The Royals then completed the sweep at home, winning 8–3 in game three and advancing to the 2014 American League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles.

In the opening game of the ALCS on October 11, 2014, the Royals defeated the Orioles 8–6, with two home runs in the 10th inning. Thus, in eight extra innings over five postseason games in 2014, they succeeded in hitting four homers in extra innings, more than any team in the history of Major League Baseball. In the second ALCS game, the Royals again beat the Orioles 6–4, behind Lorenzo Cain&#x27;s four hits, including an RBI single. After game three, the ALCS was delayed one day due to rainy weather, when the Royals hosted the Orioles at Kauffman Stadium on October 14, 2014. Pitcher Jeremy Guthrie allowed only one run as KC beat the Orioles 2–1, taking a 3–0 lead in the series. In game four, the Royals completed the sweep of the Orioles with another 2–1 win to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1985. The win marked the team&#x27;s eighth consecutive postseason win in one year, breaking a major league record previously held by the Colorado Rockies in 2007 and Cincinnati Reds in 1976. It also marked the Royals&#x27; 11th win in a row overall in postseason play, dating back to the franchise&#x27;s final three wins of the 1985 Series, the third-longest multi-year postseason streak in baseball history.

The Royals faced the San Francisco Giants in the 2014 World Series. They had home-field advantage, due to the American League&#x27;s win in the 2014 All-Star Game.

After setting an AL record by winning eight straight games to reach the World Series, the Royals opened the series by losing 7–1 in the first game against starter Madison Bumgarner. The Royals bounced back with a 7–2 win in game two to tie the series at 1–1. The Royals won game three in San Francisco 3–2 to take the series lead for the first time. In game four, the Royals lost 11–4, which tied the series with the Giants. In game five, they lost 5–0 to the Giants against starter Madison Bumgarner. In game six, the Royals beat the Giants 10–0. In game seven, the Royals started Jeremy Guthrie against Giants pitcher Tim Hudson. Guthrie lasted innings before he was replaced by Kelvin Herrera, who himself lasted innings. He was then replaced by Wade Davis, who pitched in two innings. Closer Greg Holland ended the game. On the Giants side, Hudson lasted only innings before he was replaced by Jeremy Affeldt, who was later replaced by Madison Bumgarner. The Royals lost game seven, 3–2, with the tying run (Alex Gordon) on third base in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, when Salvador Pérez fouled out to Pablo Sandoval to end the game and the series.

===2015: World Series Champions===
After earning a wild card entry to the playoffs in 2014, in 2015, the Royals won the franchise&#x27;s first division title since 1985 and first Central division title ever. The Royals went on to win the 2015 World Series – the first championship for the Royals since 1985 – beating the New York Mets four games to one.

The Royals entered the 2015 All-Star break with the best record in the American League at 52–34. The team continued its momentum into the second half of the season, and on July 26, Royals management traded three prospects Brandon Finnegan, John Lamb , and Cody Reed for 2014 All-Star pitcher Johnny Cueto to help bolster its starting pitching rotation, as well as trading two pitchers to the Oakland Athletics for super-utility player Ben Zobrist. The team ended the regular season with a record of 95–67, the best in the entire American League, and the organization&#x27;s best record since 1980.

The Royals faced the Houston Astros in the ALDS. Down 2–1 in the series and trailing 6–2 in the 8th inning of Game 4, the Royals rallied for 5 runs en route to a 9–6 win before Cueto&#x27;s gem in Game 5 powered the Royals to a second consecutive ALCS. The Royals defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 6, to win the 2015 ALCS and earn a trip to face the New York Mets in the 2015 World Series.

The Royals beat the New York Mets 4 games to 1 to become the 2015 World Series champions. It was the Royals&#x27; first World Series title since 1985. The series win was sealed after the Royals beat the Mets 7–2 in the 12th inning of Game 5. The Royals rallied in the 9th inning down 2–0 to tie the score 2–2, forcing the game into extra innings. The five-run 12th inning was initiated by a Salvador Pérez single, with Jarrod Dyson pinch-running for him. This was followed by a single from Christian Colon and doubles from both Alcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain, scoring runs from Jarrod Dyson, Colon, Paulo Orlando (who reached base on an error by Daniel Murphy), Escobar and Ben Zobrist (who was intentionally walked). Wade Davis, who hadn&#x27;t allowed a run yet that postseason, closed out the game with a flawless 12th, allowing one hit and striking out Wilmer Flores to end the game and win the World Series for the Royals. Upon conclusion of the final game, catcher Salvador Perez was named World Series MVP.

===2016–2017: End of an Era===
The Royals followed up their World Series victory with an underachieving, injury-riddled campaign in 2016. The Royals had an inconsistent season in which they ultimately finished 81–81, third place in the division and out of playoff contention. This season is notable for the debut of future star Whit Merrifield. The 2017 season marked the end of the World Series core: pitcher Yordano Ventura was killed in a car accident on January 22, and the Royals wore patches that said &#x27;ACE 30&#x27; on their jerseys for the 2017 season to honor him; Wade Davis was traded in the offseason. In 2017, the Royals finished similarly to 2016 at 80–82, third place in the division, and missed the playoffs for a second consecutive year. Stars Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer became free agents after the season and signed contracts with the Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres, respectively. However, through both of these years the Royals were one of the most successful teams in the league at challenging umpire calls via instant replay thanks to the work of replay coordinator Bill Duplissea.

===2018–present: John Sherman era===

Although Eric Hosmer and Lorenzo Cain left in free agency, the Royals were able to re-sign Mike Moustakas and Alcides Escobar. In 2018, the team started a new rebuild, trading Moustakas mid-season for prospects, and giving playing time to young players like Adalberto Mondesi, Ryan O&#x27;Hearn, and Brad Keller. Despite this, the team finished with only 58 wins, the team&#x27;s lowest win total since 2005. The 2018 season also marked the emergence of Whit Merrifield as a star, as he led MLB in hits (192) and stolen bases (45).

On June 3, 2019, the Royals selected Bobby Witt Jr. with the second pick in the MLB draft. Widely considered one of the top prospects in baseball, Witt is regarded as one of the biggest prospects to be drafted by Kansas City since Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas.

On August 30, 2019, it was announced that John Sherman, a minority owner of the Cleveland Indians, had agreed to purchase the team from David Glass for a reported amount of $1 billion. In September, manager Ned Yost announced that he would retire at the end of the season after ten seasons and a franchise-record 746 wins. The Royals finished the 2019 season one game better than 2018, at 59–103. Whit Merrifield once again led the league in hits, while Jorge Soler led the American League with 48 home runs and three Royals players paced the league in triples (Mondesi, Merrifield and Hunter Dozier, with 10 apiece). On October 31, 2019, the Royals announced the hiring of former St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny to replace Ned Yost. In 2020, the season was shortened to 60 games because of the COVID-19 pandemic; the Royals finished with a 26–34 record (a .433 winning percentage), good for fourth place in the AL Central. Overall in 2021, the Royals finished with a 74–88 record (a .457 winning percentage), landing in fourth place in the AL Central but seeing improvement over both 2019 and 2020, as catcher Salvador Pérez led MLB in both home runs and runs batted in and Bobby Witt Jr. continued to emerge as one of the top prospects in Minor League Baseball.

Beginning with the 2022 season, Dayton Moore was promoted to the team&#x27;s President of Baseball Operations and J. J. Picollo began his tenure as general manager. Moore was fired by the end of the season. The Royals spent 2022 blending their roster with several rookies (including Bobby Witt Jr., MJ Melendez, and Vinnie Pasquantino among others), often fielding lineups with six or more rookies on a given night. The team finished in fourth place of the AL Central with a 65–97 record, and Mike Matheny was fired after their season finale in Cleveland.

Matt Quatraro was hired as manager for the 2023 season, and the team finished with a record of 56–106. Leading into the 2024 season, the Royals were aggressive in the offseason signing pitchers such as Michael Wacha and Seth Lugo. The 2024 Royals became the second team ever to go from over 100 losses from the season prior to a playoff berth in the next. They clinched their first playoff berth since 2015 on September 27, 2024. They swept the Baltimore Orioles in the Wild Card round and lost to the New York Yankees in the American League Division series.

====Future stadium plans====

Team owner John Sherman announced in November 2022 that the team plans to leave Kauffman Stadium prior to the end of their lease which expires at the end of the 2030 MLB season. The team announced in June 2023 that the two final sites under consideration for the stadium district were the East Village neighborhood and North Kansas City, but a third site in the Crossroads district emerged as the final site chosen by the team in February 2024. In April 2024, Jackson County voters rejected a ballot initiative to help fund the stadium. The Royals, who had pledged at least $1 billion from ownership for their project, wanted to use their share of the tax revenue to help fund a $2 billion-plus ballpark district. The team plans to open a new stadium by the start of the 2027 or 2028 MLB season, and it would have a seating capacity of about 34,000. The Royals are also considering relocating across the state border to Kansas City, Kansas, as well as considering building a downtown ballpark in Washington Square Park, an area located between Union Station and Crown Center on the Missouri side. In November 2024, it was reported that the Royals were also examining &quot;two or three&quot; potential stadium sites in Johnson County, Kansas.

==Uniform history==

===1969–1972: Original look===
The Royals&#x27; home uniform remained almost unchanged from its first season. The original design featured blue arm and neck piping, along with &quot;Royals&quot; in blue and in script lettering. The road uniform was inverted from the home uniform, with &quot;Kansas City&quot; written in blue, in script lettering and in an arch arrangement. For the 1971 season the &quot;Kansas City&quot; on the road uniforms were changed to block lettering, while both uniforms added a roundel containing the team logo on the left sleeve. The blue cap with &quot;KC&quot; stitched in front was also introduced and remains in use today.

===1973–1982: Pullover and powder blue uniforms===
The Royals switched to pullover uniforms for the 1973 season. While the home uniform did not deviate much from its original design, the road uniform changed to a powder blue base and white letters. Names were added in the 1978 season.

===1983–1991: Return to button-down style===
The Royals returned to wearing buttoned uniforms for the 1983 season. The most notable change came on the powder blue uniform, where &quot;Royals&quot; in script replaced &quot;Kansas City&quot;. Both uniforms added numbers on the left chest.

===1992–2001: Return to grey uniforms and alternate blue uniforms===
For the 1992 season, the Royals resumed wearing grey uniforms on the road, but the uniforms retained the &quot;Royals&quot; script and letters in blue with white trim. In 1994 a blue alternate uniform was introduced, with &quot;Royals&quot; script and letters in white. The following season, the road uniforms were tweaked to feature &quot;Kansas City&quot; in block letters, while neck piping was removed. A grey cap with blue brim and &quot;KC&quot; in blue was also used for a few games.

===2002–2005: Addition of black===
Before the 2002 season, the Royals added black to the color scheme, and this was also reflected on the team&#x27;s uniforms. Initially, the home uniforms were only updated to remove blue piping and include black drop shadows, but in 2003, the Royals went with sleeveless uniforms with blue undershirts. The grey uniforms also removed the sleeves and piping, and were paired with black undershirts and a black cap with blue brim. Letters were also given black drop shadows. The Royals also went with a black alternate uniform, featuring blue piping and &quot;Royals&quot; written in blue with white trim. The sleeve patch was updated without the roundel on the home and blue alternate uniforms, while a new &quot;Royals&quot; roundel logo was placed on the grey undershirt and black alternates. The logo removed the &quot;R&quot; from the shield, enlarged the &quot;KC&quot; and added black drop shadows, and the crown was changed to black.

===2006–2021: New alternates and return to powder blue===
In 2006, black was eliminated from the uniforms, and the Royals returned to wearing sleeved uniforms with arm piping. The crown on the &quot;KC&quot; shield logo reverted back to gold, but the black drop shadows were not removed until 2019. The road uniforms brought back the &quot;Kansas City&quot; script, albeit written diagonally, with a slight adjustment in size prior to the 2012 season. For a few games in 2006, the black uniforms were used, albeit with the &quot;Kansas City&quot; script, before it was retired. In 2008, the Royals introduced a new powder blue alternate with &quot;Royals&quot; in blue with white trim, and letters in white with blue trim; the color lettering scheme in front was reversed starting in 2012. The uniforms were briefly paired with a powder blue cap with blue brim in 2010. Unlike the previous powder blue uniform, this set is paired with the home white pants. As a result, the royal blue alternates were worn exclusively on select road games.

Powder blue was added as a trim color when the Royals issued a new blue alternate in 2014. The &quot;KC&quot; insignia replaced &quot;Royals&quot; and the number in front, while piping was added. After winning the 2015 World Series, the Royals began wearing an alternate white uniform, featuring &quot;Royals&quot; in metallic gold with blue trim. In 2017, the uniform was updated with the team name in blue with gold trim, and numbers in gold and blue trim. A new blue cap with &quot;KC&quot; in gold was paired with this uniform.

===2022–present: Block road letters return; City Connect===
The Royals unveiled a fresh uniform set for the 2022 season. The primary home uniform remained the same save for the thicker sleeve stripes. The road primary and blue road alternate returned to the block &quot;Kansas City&quot; wordmark the team used from 1971 to 1982, adding chest numbers on both uniforms. The alternate home powder blue uniform removed the royal blue elements, with the numbers taking the same color as the &quot;Royals&quot; script.

Also in 2022, the Royals wore &quot;City Connect&quot; uniforms in homage to Kansas City&#x27;s &quot;City of Fountains&quot; moniker. The top of the uniform is navy blue with powder blue accents, with a stylized &quot;KC&quot; insignia on the left chest. The &quot;KC&quot; insignia was shaped to resemble a fountain of water shooting up. Pants worn are white with a powder blue stripe on each side. Caps are all-navy while helmets are navy with powder blue brim; both designs incorporate the &quot;KC&quot; in front.

Beginning in 2023, the Royals&#x27; powder blue alternate uniform would be worn with powder blue pants for select games, a combination not worn since the 1991 season.

==Rivalries==

===St. Louis Cardinals===
The Royals&#x27; most prominent rivalry is with the intrastate St. Louis Cardinals. For geographic reasons, the teams long played exhibition games, but a true rivalry began with the Royals&#x27; victory over the Cardinals in the 1985 World Series, known as the &quot;I-70 Series.&quot; Notably, the manager for the Cardinals in the series was Whitey Herzog, who had been the Royals&#x27; manager from 1975 to 1979, and led Kansas City to the franchise&#x27;s first three playoff appearances – in 1976, 1977, and 1978 – before getting fired just shortly after the Royals were eliminated from playoff contention in 1979. Interleague play in 1997 allowed the I-70 Series to be revived in non-exhibition games. The first few seasons of the series were rather even, with the Cardinals holding a slight advantage with a 14–13 record through the 2003 season. Through the 2023 season, the Cardinals hold the series advantage 75–49.

===New York Yankees===
From 1976 to 1980, the Royals faced the New York Yankees four times in five years in the American League Championship Series. The Yankees won in 1976, 1977 and 1978, while the Royals won in 1980. The teams did not face each other in the postseason again until the 2024 American League Division Series, with the Yankees winning in four games. In a 2013 article about the 1983 Pine Tar Incident involving the two teams, Lou Pinella said: &quot;As a team, we didn&#x27;t really like Kansas City. We had played them in the &#x27;76, &#x27;77 and &#x27;78 postseason and beaten them every time. There was no love lost between the teams. We didn&#x27;t like each other. They were our big rivals...&quot; George Brett agreed: &quot;I hated everyone on the Yankees, I really did. I hated &#x27;em all, back in that era.&quot; Kansas City also held historic grudges against the Yankees in general, as during the Athletics&#x27; residency under Arnold Johnson&#x27;s ownership, it was effectively a &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;farm team&quot; for the Bronx Bombers due to lopsided trades in favor of New York.

<text>The Klingon language (, &quot;&quot;: , ) is the constructed language spoken by a fictional alien race called the Klingons in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

Described in the 1985 book &quot;The Klingon Dictionary&quot; by Marc Okrand and deliberately designed to sound &quot;alien&quot;, it has a number of typologically uncommon features. The language&#x27;s basic sound, along with a few words, was devised by actor James Doohan (&quot;Scotty&quot;) and producer Jon Povill for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. The film marked the first time the language had been heard. In all previous appearances, Klingons spoke in English, even to each other. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a full-fledged language.

Klingon is sometimes referred to as Klingonese (most notably in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;, where it was actually pronounced by a Klingon character as &quot;Klingonee&quot; ), but among the Klingon-speaking community, this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language called Klingonaase that was introduced in John M. Ford&#x27;s 1984 &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;The Final Reflection,&quot; and appears in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels by Ford.

The play &quot;A Klingon Christmas Carol&quot; is the first production that is primarily in Klingon (only the narrator speaks English). The opera is entirely in Klingon.

A small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Because its vocabulary is heavily centered on &quot;Star Trek&quot;-Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, it can be hard for everyday use because of the lack of words for a casual conversation.

==History==
The language is first mentioned in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; (1967), but is not heard until &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979). According to the actor who spoke the lines, Mark Lenard, James Doohan recorded the lines he had written on a tape, and Lenard transcribed the recorded lines in a way he found useful in learning them.

For &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), director Leonard Nimoy and writer-producer Harve Bennett wanted the Klingons to speak a structured language instead of random gibberish, and so commissioned a full language, based on the phrases Doohan had originated, from Marc Okrand, who had earlier constructed four lines of Vulcan dialogue for &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;.

Okrand enlarged the lexicon and developed a grammar based on Doohan&#x27;s original dozen words. The language appeared intermittently in later films featuring the original cast; for example, in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989) and in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), where translation difficulties served as a plot device.

Two &quot;non-canon&quot; dialects of Klingon are hinted at in the novelization of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, as Saavik speaks in Klingon to the only Klingon officer aboard Cpt. Kruge&#x27;s starship after his death, as the survivors of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s self-destruction transport up from the crumbling Genesis Planet to the Klingon ship. The surviving officer, Maltz, states that he speaks the &quot;Rumaiy&quot; dialect, while Saavik is speaking to him in the &quot;Kumburan&quot; dialect of Klingon, per Maltz&#x27;s spoken reply to her.

With the advent of the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987)—in which one of the main characters, Worf, was a Klingon—and successors, the language and various cultural aspects for the fictional species were expanded. In the episode &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot;, several members of a Klingon ship&#x27;s crew speak a language that is not translated for the benefit of the viewer (even Commander Riker, enjoying the benefits of a universal translator, is unable to understand) until one Klingon orders the others to &quot;speak their [i.e., human] language&quot;.

A small number of non-Klingon characters were later depicted in &quot;Star Trek&quot; as having learned to speak Klingon, notably Jean-Luc Picard and Dax.

==Language==
Hobbyists around the world have studied the Klingon language. At least nine Klingon translations of works of world literature have been published, among which are: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Hamlet&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;Much Ado About Nothing)&quot;, &#x27; (&quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;The Art of War&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;The Little Prince&quot;), and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;). The Shakespearean choices were inspired by a remark from High Chancellor Gorkon in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, who said, &quot;You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.&quot; In the bonus material on the DVD, screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and actor William Shatner both explain that this was an allusion to the German myth that Shakespeare was in fact German.

The Klingon Language Institute exists to promote the language.

CBS Studios owns the copyright on the official dictionary and other canonical descriptions of the language. While constructed languages (&quot;conlangs&quot;) are viewed as creations with copyright protection, natural languages are not protected, excluding dictionaries and other works created with them. Mizuki Miyashita and Laura Moll note, &quot;Copyrights on dictionaries are unusual because the entries in the dictionary are not copyrightable as the words themselves are facts, and facts can not be copyrighted. However, the formatting, example sentences, and instructions for dictionary use are created by the author, so they are copyrightable.&quot;

Okrand had studied some Native American and Southeast Asian languages, and phonological and grammatical features of these languages &quot;worked their way into Klingon, but for the most part, not by design.&quot; Okrand himself has stated that a design principle of the Klingon language was dissimilarity to existing natural languages in general, and English in particular. He therefore avoided patterns that are typologically common and deliberately chose features that occur relatively infrequently in human languages. This includes above all the highly asymmetric consonant inventory and the basic word order.

==Speakers==
A small number of people are capable of conversing in Klingon. Arika Okrent guessed in her 2009 book &quot;In the Land of Invented Languages&quot; that there might be 20–30 fluent speakers. Its vocabulary, heavily centered on &quot;Star Trek&quot;–Klingon concepts such as spacecraft or warfare, can sometimes make it cumbersome for everyday use. For instance, while words for &quot;transporter ionizer unit&quot; (&#x27;) or &quot;bridge&quot; (of a ship) (&#x27;) have been known since close to the language&#x27;s inception, the word for &quot;bridge&quot; in the sense of a crossing over water (&quot;&quot;) was unknown until August 2012. Nonetheless, mundane conversations are possible among skilled speakers.

One Klingon speaker, d&#x27;Armond Speers, raised his son Alec to speak Klingon as a first language, while the boy&#x27;s mother communicated with him in English. Alec rarely responded to his father in Klingon, although when he did, his pronunciation was &quot;excellent&quot;. After Alec&#x27;s fifth birthday, Speers reported that his son eventually stopped responding to him when spoken to in Klingon as he clearly did not enjoy it, so Speers switched to English.

In 2007, a report surfaced that Multnomah County, Oregon, was hiring Klingon translators for its mental health program in case patients came into a psychiatric hospital speaking nothing but Klingon. Most circulations of the report seemingly implied that this was a problem that health officials faced before; however, the original report indicated that this was just a precaution for a hypothetical and that said translator would only be paid on an as needed basis. After the report was misinterpreted, the County issued another release noting that releasing the original report was a &quot;mistake&quot;.

In May 2009, Simon &amp; Schuster, in collaboration with Ultralingua Inc., a developer of electronic dictionary applications, announced the release of a suite of electronic Klingon language software for most computer platforms including a dictionary, a phrasebook, and an audio learning tool.

In September 2011, Eurotalk released the &quot;Learn Klingon&quot; course in its &quot;Talk Now!&quot; series. The language is displayed in both Latin and pIqaD fonts, making this the first language course written in pIqaD and approved by CBS and Marc Okrand. It was translated by Jonathan Brown and Okrand and uses the TrueType font.

In August 2016, a company in the United Kingdom, Bidvine, began offering Klingon lessons as one of their services.

In March 2018, the popular language learning site Duolingo opened a beta course in Klingon. After proving popular, the company offered to promote it from beta status, but due to ongoing software issues regarding Klingon&#x27;s unexpected use of upper- and lower-case letters and the apostrophe as a consonant instead of punctuation, the course developers chose not to accept the offer until the problems were addressed.

There are Klingon language meetings and linguists or students are interested in researching this topic, even writing essays about the language or its users.

Klingon speakers are also referred to in non-&quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series, including &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and were heavily featured in the &quot;My Big Fat Geek Wedding&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In the 2017 film &quot;Please Stand By&quot;, in which a young autistic woman played by Dakota Fanning leaves her group home in San Francisco to deliver a &quot;Star Trek&quot; screenplay she wrote to Paramount Pictures, a Los Angeles police officer played by Patton Oswalt coaxes her out of hiding by speaking with her in Klingon.

== Real world usage ==
In July 2015, the Welsh Government issued a written statement in the Klingon language. Following a formal questioning of the Economy Minister Edwina Hart regarding the funding of research into UFO sightings around Cardiff Airport by Member of the Senedd Darren Millar, a press officer in the Minister&#x27;s office issued the reply: 

which was translated as: &quot;The minister will reply in due course. However this is a non-devolved matter.&quot;

== Use in other media ==
In the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; (2003), the opening of the film cites &#x27;Revenge is a dish best served cold&#x27; as an &#x27;old Klingon proverb&#x27;.

In 2010, a Chicago Theatre company presented a version of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in Klingon language and a Klingon setting. On September 25, 2010, the Washington Shakespeare Company (now known as WSC Avant Bard) performed selections from &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; in the Klingon language in Arlington County, Virginia. The performance was proposed by Okrand in his capacity as chairman of the group&#x27;s board. This performance was reprised on February 27, 2011 featuring Stephen Fry as the Klingon Osric and was filmed by the BBC as part of a 5-part documentary on language entitled &quot;Fry&#x27;s Planet Word&quot;.

The Java edition of &quot;Minecraft&quot; has a Klingon language setting.

The 2003–2010 version of the puzzle globe logo of Wikipedia, representing its multilingualism, contained a Klingon character. When updated in 2010, the Klingon character was removed from the logo, and substituted with one from the Ge&#x27;ez script. A was started in June 2004 at &quot;tlh.wikipedia.org&quot;. It was permanently locked in August 2005 and moved to Wikia. The Klingon Wiktionary was closed in 2008.

In the 2010 &quot;Dragon Ball Z Abridged&quot; episode &quot;Episode 16&quot;, the Klingon language is used as the same language as the Namekian language.

The file management software XYplorer has been translated into Klingon by its developer.

Microsoft&#x27;s Bing Translator attempts to translate Klingon from and to other languages. It can do a good job with individual words, and with phrases included in its training corpus, but it is not well tuned for Klingon&#x27;s system of prefixes and suffixes. For example, &quot;You must study it&quot; is rendered instead as &quot;They Must Study.&quot;

With the digital-only release of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; in 2017, streaming service Netflix announced it would provide Klingon subtitles for the entire first season, translated by Klingon language expert Lieven L. Litaer. They can be enabled like any other language provided by the streaming service, and are shown using romanized transliteration rather than Klingon script.

In 2020 the German artist Hans Solo (Äi-Tiem) released an EP &quot;NuqneH&quot;, whose 5 tracks are completely rapped in Klingon language.

==Canon==
An important concept to spoken and written Klingon is canonicity. Only words and grammatical forms introduced by Marc Okrand are considered canonical Klingon by the KLI and most Klingonists. However, as the growing number of speakers employ different strategies to express themselves, it is often unclear as to what level of neologism is permissible. New vocabulary has been collected in a list maintained by the KLI until 2005 and has since then been followed up by Klingon expert Lieven Litaer until the KLI&#x27;s website was renewed in 2015.

===Internal history===
Within the fictional universe of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Klingon is derived from the original language spoken by the messianic figure Kahless the Unforgettable, who united the Klingon home-world of under one empire more than 1500 years ago.

==Phonology==

Klingon has been developed with a phonology that, while based on human natural languages, is intended to sound alien to human ears. When initially developed, Paramount Pictures (owners of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise) wanted the Klingon language to be guttural and harsh and Okrand wanted it to be unusual, so he selected sounds that combined in ways not generally found in other languages. The effect is mainly achieved by the use of a number of retroflex and uvular consonants in the language&#x27;s inventory. Klingon has twenty-one consonants and five vowels. Klingon is normally written in a variant of the Latin alphabet. The orthography of this transliteration is case-sensitive, that is, upper and lower case letters are not interchangeable (uppercase letters mostly represent sounds different from those expected by English speakers), although with the exception of Q/q there are no minimal pairs between case. In other words, while is incorrect Klingon, it cannot be misread as anything but an erroneous form of (which means &quot;language&quot;); on the other hand, and are two different words, the first meaning &quot;be popular&quot; and the second meaning &quot;accompany&quot;. In the discussion below, standard Klingon orthography appears in &quot;&quot;, and the phonemic transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet is written between &quot;/slashes/&quot;.

===Consonants===
The inventory of consonants in Klingon is spread over a number of places of articulation. In spite of this, the inventory has many gaps: Klingon has no velar plosives, and only one sibilant fricative; common consonants absent in Klingon include . Deliberately, this arrangement is very different from that of most human languages. The combination of an aspirated voiceless alveolar plosive and a voiced retroflex plosive is particularly unusual.

There are a few dialectal pronunciation differences (it is not known if the aforementioned non-canon &quot;Kumburan&quot; or &quot;Rumaiy&quot; dialects of &quot;&quot; hinted at in the novelization of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; might differ):

* In the Krotmag dialect and are realized as nasal stops and 
* In the Tak&#x27;ev dialect and are pre-nasalized oral stops and 
In the Morskan dialect:
* is a central affricate 
* is realized as glottal syllable-initially and deleted syllable-finally
* is realized as a velar fricative 

===Vowels===
In contrast to its consonants, Klingon&#x27;s inventory of vowels is simple, and similar to those of many human languages, such as Spanish or Japanese. There are five vowels spaced more or less evenly around the vowel space, with two back rounded vowels, one back unrounded vowel, and two front or near-front unrounded vowels. The vowel inventory is asymmetrical in that the back rounded vowels are tense and the front vowels are lax.

The two front vowels, and , represent sounds that are found in English, but are more open and lax than a typical English speaker might assume when reading Klingon text written in the Latin alphabet, thus causing the consonants of a word to be more prominent. This enhances the sense that Klingon is a clipped and harsh-sounding language.

; Vowels
:open back unrounded vowel (in English &quot;spa&quot;)
:open-mid front unrounded vowel (in English &quot;bed&quot;)
:near-close near-front unrounded vowel (in English &quot;bit&quot;)
:close-mid back rounded vowel (in French &quot;eau&quot; and English &quot;snow&quot;)
:close back rounded vowel (in Spanish &quot;tu&quot; and English &quot;you&quot;)

Diphthongs can be analyzed phonetically as the combination of the five vowels plus one of the two semivowels and (represented by and , respectively). Thus, the combinations , , , , , , and are possible. There are no words in the Klingon language that contain * or *.

===Syllable structure===
Klingon follows a strict syllable structure. A syllable must start with a consonant (including the glottal stop) followed by one vowel. In prefixes and rare other syllables, this is enough. More commonly, this consonant-vowel pair is followed by one consonant or one of three biconsonantal codas: /- -&#x27; -&quot;/. Thus, &#x27; &quot;record&quot;, &#x27; &quot;poison&quot; and &#x27; &quot;targ&quot; (a type of animal) are all legal syllable forms, but *&#x27; and *&#x27; are not. Despite this, one suffix takes the shape vowel+consonant: the endearment suffix .

===Stress===
In verbs, the stressed syllable is usually the verbal stem itself, as opposed to a prefix or any suffixes, except when a suffix ending with is separated from the verb by at least one other suffix, in which case the suffix ending in is also stressed. In addition, stress may shift to a suffix that is meant to be emphasized.

In nouns, the final syllable of the stem (the noun itself, excluding any affixes) is stressed. If any syllables ending in are present, the stress shifts to those syllables.

The stress in other words seems to be variable, but this is not a serious issue because most of these words are only one syllable in length. There are some words which should fall under the rules above, but do not, although using the standard rules would still be acceptable.

==Grammar==

Klingon is an agglutinative language, using mainly affixes in order to alter the function or meaning of words. Some nouns have inherently plural forms, such as &#x27; &quot;plate&quot; (vs. &quot;plates&quot;), but most nouns require a suffix to express plurality explicitly. Depending on the type of noun (body part, being capable of using language, or neither) the suffix changes. For beings capable of using language, the suffix is &quot;,&quot; as in &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;Klingons,&quot; or &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;enemies&quot;. For body parts, the plural suffix is &quot;,&quot; as in &quot;,&quot; &quot;eyes&quot;. For items that are neither body parts nor capable of speech, the suffix is &quot;,&quot; such as in &#x27; (&quot;stars&quot;), or &#x27; (&quot;targs&quot;) for a Klingon animal somewhat resembling a boar. (However, a plural suffix is never obligatory. To say &quot;The stars are beautiful&quot;, &#x27; and &quot;&quot; are equally grammatical, although the second can also mean &quot;The star is beautiful&quot;.)

The words &#x27; and &#x27;, which on their own mean &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; respectively, can be used in compound words to refer to the referent&#x27;s sex. For example, from &#x27; (&quot;child&quot;) this process derives &#x27; (&quot;son&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;daughter&quot;).

Klingon nouns take suffixes to indicate grammatical number. There are three noun classes, two levels of deixis, and a possession and syntactic function. In all, twenty-nine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: &quot;&quot; &quot;for my beloved true friends&quot;. A word may carry no more than one suffix from each class, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.

Verbs in Klingon take a prefix indicating the number and person of the subject and object, whereas suffixes are taken from nine ordered classes and a special suffix class called rovers. Each of the four known rovers has a unique rule controlling its position among the suffixes in the verb. Verbs are marked for aspect, certainty, predisposition and volition, dynamic, causative, mood, negation, and honorific. The Klingon verb has two moods: indicative and imperative.

The most common word order in Klingon is object–verb–subject, and, in most cases, the word order is the exact reverse of English for an equivalent sentence:

(Hyphens are used in the above only to illustrate the use of affixes. Hyphens are not used in Klingon.)

An important aspect of Klingon grammar is its &quot;ungrammaticality&quot;. As with for example Japanese, shortening of communicative statements is common, and is called &quot;Clipped Klingon&quot; (&#x27; or, more simply, &#x27;) and Ritualized Speech. Clipped Klingon is especially useful in situations where speed is a decisive factor. Grammar is abbreviated, and sentence parts deemed to be superfluous are dropped. Intentional ungrammaticality is widespread, and it takes many forms. It is exemplified by the practice of &quot;&quot;, which Marc Okrand translates as &quot;to misfollow the rules&quot; or &quot;to follow the rules wrongly&quot;.

==Writing systems==

When written in the Latin alphabet, Klingon is unusual in being case-sensitive, with some letters written in capitals and others in lowercase. In one contrast, &#x27; and &#x27;, there is an actual case-sensitive pair representing two different consonants. Capitals are generally reserved for uvular or retroflex consonants pronounced further back in the mouth or throat than is normal for the corresponding English sounds, as with &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;. However, &#x27;, pronounced like the in German &quot;ach&quot; or Scottish &quot;loch&quot;, is further forward in the throat than English /h/. One phoneme, the vowel &#x27;, is written capital to look more like the IPA symbol for the sound /ɪ/, and can pose problems when writing Klingon in sans-serif fonts such as Arial, as it looks almost the same as the consonant &#x27;.

This has led some Klingon enthusiasts to write it lowercase like the other vowels (&quot;i&quot;) to prevent confusion, but this use is non-canonical. Instead, a serif font that clearly distinguishes &quot; and &quot;, such as Courier or Courier New, has traditionally been employed for writing Klingon in the Latin alphabet. In any case, it can be disambiguated through context, as never occurs next to another vowel, while always does. The apostrophe, denoting the glottal stop, is considered a letter, not a punctuation mark, as with a Hawaiian &#x27;okina.

Klingon is often written in (in-universe, &quot;transliterated to&quot;) the Latin alphabet as used above, but on the television series, the Klingons use their own alien writing system. In &quot;The Klingon Dictionary&quot;, this alphabet is named as &#x27;, but no information is given about it. When Klingon symbols are used in &quot;Star Trek&quot; productions, they are merely decorative graphic elements, designed to emulate real writing and create an appropriate atmosphere. Enthusiasts have settled on the name &#x27; for this writing system.

The Astra Image Corporation designed the symbols currently used to &quot;write&quot; Klingon for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to Michael Okuda. They based the letters on the Klingon battlecruiser hull markings (three letters) first created by Matt Jefferies and on Tibetan writing because the script has sharp letter forms—used as a testament to the Klingons&#x27; love for knives and blades.

For April Fools&#x27; Day in 2013, Nokia and typography company Dalton Maag claimed to have used &quot;communication devices to far-flung star systems&quot; to assist them in localizing the Nokia Pure font to the Klingon writing system. Though the explanation was of course humorous in nature, as part of the practical joke a series of real fonts based upon the most commonly used &quot;&quot; character mapping were in fact developed, and have been made available for free download.

==Vocabulary==
A design principle of the Klingon language is the great degree of lexical-cultural correlation in the vocabulary. For example, there are several words meaning &quot;to fight&quot; or &quot;to clash against&quot;, each having a different degree of intensity. There is an abundance of words relating to warfare and weaponry and also a great variety of curses (cursing is considered a fine art in Klingon culture). This helps lend a particular character to the language.

There are many in-jokes built into the language. For example, the word for &quot;pair&quot; is , a reference to the original &quot;Siamese twins&quot; Chang and Eng Bunker; a is a mid-size stringed instrument, comparable to a guitar (i.e. Les Paul); a &quot;chronometer&quot; is (pronounced similar to &quot;clock&quot;); the word for &quot;torture&quot; is ; &quot;hangover&quot; is , and the word for &quot;fish&quot; is &quot;&quot;.

Sources for the vocabulary include English (albeit heavily disguised), and also Yiddish: for &quot;buttocks&quot; (from &quot;tuches&quot; spelled backwards), and for &quot;ache, pain, sore&quot; (cf. &quot;oy vey&quot;).

Many English words do not have direct translations into Klingon. To express &quot;hello&quot;, the nearest equivalent is , meaning &quot;What do you want?&quot;, with &quot;goodbye&quot; translated as , &quot;Success!&quot;.

==Example sentences==
:Do you speak Klingon?
:I don&#x27;t understand.
:I can&#x27;t eat that thing.
:You are wrong.
:Revenge is a dish best served cold. (lit: When cold revenge is served, the dish is always very good)
:Today is a good day to die.
