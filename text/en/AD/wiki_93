<text>Demographic features of the population of Malta include population density, ethnicity, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Characteristics==

Malta is the most densely populated country in the EU and one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with about . This compares with about 32 per square kilometre (85 per square mile) for the United States. A census (held every 10 years) was held in November 2005.

Inhabited since prehistoric times, Malta was first colonized by Sicilians. Subsequently, Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs in 870 AD who may have completely depopulated the islands but in 1224 were themselves expelled from Malta, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, French and the British have influenced Maltese life and culture to varying degrees.

Roman Catholicism is established by law as the religion of Malta with 98%; however, full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship is guaranteed, and a number of faiths have places of worship on the island (rather small groups, a combined total of 2% of the people are Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, Muslims and Jews).

Malta has two official languages--Maltese (a Semitic language derived from Siculo-Arabic and heavily influenced by Sicilian and Italian), and English, which includes a local dialect, Maltese English. Both languages are compulsory subjects in Maltese primary and secondary schools. A large portion of the population is also fluent in Italian, which was, until 1936, the national language of Malta. The literacy rate has reached 93%, compared to 63% in 1946. Schooling is compulsory until age 16.

===Age distribution===
Since 2000, the shift in the age composition towards an older population continued to materialise. In fact, the average age of the Maltese population increased from 38.5 in 2005 to 40.5 in 2011. This resulted from the increase in the number of persons aged 55 and over, together with a decrease in the number of persons under 25 years of age. The average in Gozo and Comino (41.6 years) was higher than that observed for Malta.
Persons aged 65 and over more represent 16.3% of the total population in 2011, compared to 13.7% in 2005. In contrast, persons aged 14 and under make up 14.8% of the population in 2011, compared to 17.2% in 2005.

=== Migrant background and foreign nationality ===
Foreign nationals in Malta

As of 2016 and 2017, the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Malta were as follows:

This list does not include foreign nationals who acquired Maltese nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.
=== Emigration ===

Malta has long been a country of emigration, with big Maltese communities in English-speaking countries abroad.
Mass emigration picked up in the 19th century, reaching its peak in the decades after World War II.

In the nineteenth century, most migration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East (particularly Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt), although rates of return migration to Malta were high. Nonetheless, Maltese communities formed in these regions. By 1900, for example, British consular estimates suggest that there were 15,326 Maltese in Tunisia.
There is little trace left of the Maltese communities in North Africa, most of them having been displaced, after the rise of independence movements, to places like Marseille, the United Kingdom or Australia.

After World War II, Malta&#x27;s Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 per cent of the population emigrated. Between 1946 and the late 1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6 per cent migrating to Australia, 22 per cent to the UK, 13 per cent to Canada and 7 per cent to the United States. (See also Maltese Australians; Maltese people in the United Kingdom)

46,998 Maltese-born residents were recorded by the 2001 Australian Census, 30,178 by the 2001 UK Census, 9,525 by the 2001 Canadian Census and 9,080 by the 2000 United States Census.

Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg. At the same time, Malta is becoming more and more attractive for communities of immigrants, both from Western and Northern Europe (Italians, British) and from Eastern Europe (Serbians).

=== Immigration ===


Most of the foreign community in Malta, predominantly active or retired British nationals and their dependents, is centred on Sliema and surrounding modern suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, French, and Lebanese, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades.

Since the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe.
As a member of the European Union and of the Schengen agreement, Malta is bound by the Dublin Regulation to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta.

Irregular migrants (formal Maltese: &quot;immigranti irregolari&quot;, informal: &quot;klandestini&quot;) who land in Malta are subject to a compulsory detention policy, being held in several camps organised by the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM), including those near Ħal Far and Ħal Safi. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Malta&#x27;s detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Very few migrants arrived in Malta in 2015, despite the fact that the rest Europe was experiencing a migrant crisis. Most migrants who were rescued between Libya and Malta were taken to Italy, and some refused to be brought to Malta.

<doc id="19141" wikidata="Q1154870" url="?curid=19141" title="Politics of Malta">
<text>The politics of Malta takes place within a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the president of Malta is the constitutional head of state. Executive authority is vested in the president of Malta, with the general direction and control of the Government of Malta remaining with the prime minister of Malta, who is the head of government and the cabinet. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Malta, which consists of the president of Malta and the unicameral House of Representatives of Malta with the speaker as the presiding officer of the legislative body. Judicial power remains with the chief justice and the judiciary of Malta. Since independence, the party electoral system has been dominated by the Christian democratic Nationalist Party (&quot;Partit Nazzjonalista&quot;) and the social democratic Labour Party (&quot;Partit Laburista&quot;).

==Political developments since independence==

Since independence, two parties have dominated Malta&#x27;s polarized and evenly divided politics during this period: the centre-right Nationalist Party and the centre-left Labour Party. From the pre-independence 1962 general election until 2017, third parties failed to score any electoral success. In the 2013 election, the Democratic Alternative (a green party established in 1989) managed to secure only 1.8% of the first preference votes nationwide.

The 1996 elections resulted in the election of the Labour Party, by 8,000 votes, to replace the Nationalists, who had won in 1987 and 1992. Voter turnout was characteristically high at 96%, with the Labour Party receiving 50.72%, the Nationalist Party 47.8%, the Democratic Alternative 1.46%, and independent candidates 0.02%. 

In 1998, the Labour Party&#x27;s loss in a parliamentary vote led the prime minister to call an early election. The Nationalist Party was returned to office in September 1998 by a majority of 13,000 votes, holding a five-seat majority in Parliament. Voter turnout was 95%, with the Nationalist Party receiving 51.81%, the Labour Party 46.97%, the Democratic Alternative 1.21%, and independent candidates 0.01%.

By the end of 2002 the Nationalist government wrapped up negotiations for European Union membership. A referendum on the issue was called in March 2003, for which the Nationalists and the Democratic Alternative campaigned for a &quot;yes&quot; vote while Labour campaigned heavily for &quot;no&quot; vote, invalidate their vote or abstain. Turnout was 91%, with more than 53% voting &quot;yes&quot;.

The Labour Party argued that the &quot;yes&quot; votes amounted to less than 50% of the overall votes, hence, and citing the 1956 Maltese United Kingdom integration referendum as an example, they claimed that the &quot;yes&quot; had not in fact won the referendum. The then MLP Leader Alfred Sant said that the general election which was to be held within a month would settle the affair. In the general elections the Nationalists were returned to office with 51.79% of the vote to Labour&#x27;s 47.51%. The Democratic Alternative polled 0.68%. The Nationalists were thus able to form a government and sign and ratify the EU Accession Treaty on 16 April 2003.

On 1 May 2004 Malta joined the EU and on 1 January 2008, the Eurozone with the euro as the national currency. The first elections after membership were held in March 2008 resulting in a narrow victory for the Nationalist Party with 49.34% of first preference votes. In May 2011, a nationwide referendum was held on the introduction of divorce. This was the first time in the history of parliament that Parliament approved a motion originating outside from the Cabinet.

In March 2013, the Labour Party returned to government after fifteen years in opposition with a record-breaking lead of 36,000 votes leading to the resignation of the Nationalist leader Lawrence Gonzi, and Joseph Muscat became prime minister. In June 2017, the Labour Party called in a snap election on its May Day celebrations and increased its vote disparity to around 40,000 votes. The then leader of the opposition, Simon Busuttil, announced his resignation shortly thereafter. This election saw the first third party elected to Malta&#x27;s Parliament since independence, with the election of Marlene Farrugia in the 10th District representing the Democratic Party. Joseph Muscat continued to be prime minister In January 2020, he stepped down after the 2019 Malta political crisis surrounding the car bombing of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Robert Abela - the son of Malta&#x27;s former president George Abela - elected a new leader of Labour Party and new prime minister of Malta in January 2020.

Democratic Alternative and the Democratic Party merged into a new party, AD+PD, on 17 October 2020.

In March 2022, the ruling Labour party, led by Prime Minister Robert Abela, won its third successive election. It gained even bigger victory than in 2013 and in 2017.

==Executive branch==
Under its 1964 constitution, Malta became a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth. Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom was sovereign of Malta, and a governor-general exercised executive authority on her behalf, while the actual direction and control of the government and the nation&#x27;s affairs were in the hands of the cabinet under the leadership of a Maltese prime minister.

On December 13, 1974, the constitution was revised, and Malta became a republic within the Commonwealth, with executive authority vested in the president of Malta, which can be exercised directly or through officers subordinate to him. The president is elected by the House of Representatives for a five-year term. They appoint as prime minister the leader of the party with a majority of seats in the unicameral House of Representatives, known in Maltese as &quot;Kamra tar-Rappreżentanti&quot;.

The president also nominally appoints, upon recommendation of the prime minister, the individual ministers. Ministers are selected from among the members of the House of Representatives, which usually consists of 65 members unless bonus seats are given to a party which gains an absolute majority of votes but not a parliamentary majority. Elections must be held at least every five years and the electoral system used is single transferable vote.

Malta is divided into 68 elected local councils, with each council responsible for the administration of cities or regions of varying sizes. Administrative responsibility is distributed between the local councils and the central government in Valletta. The Local Councils Act, 1993 (Act XV of 1993), was published on June 30, 1993, subdividing Malta into 54 local councils in Malta and 14 in Gozo. The inhabitants who are registered elect the Council every three years, as voters in the Local Councils&#x27; Electoral Register. Elections are held by means of the system of proportional representation using the single transferable vote. The mayor is the head of the Local Council and the representative of the Council for all effects under the Act. The executive secretary, who is appointed by the Council, is the executive, administrative, and financial head of the Council. All decisions are taken collectively with the other members of the Council. Local councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality, local wardens, and refuse collection, and carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds, and answering government-related public inquiries.

There are also Administrative Committees elected with responsibility for smaller regions.

==Legislative branch==

Elections to the House of Representatives (&quot;Kamra tad-Deputati&quot;) are based on the single transferable vote system, a variant of the proportional representation electoral system. First, vacancies are filled through casual election and subsequent vacancies through co-option, meaning that no by-elections are held between one general election and the other. The parliamentary term cannot exceed five years.

Ordinarily, 65 members are elected to the House from 13 multi-seat constituencies each returning 5 MPs. Additional MPs are elected in two circumstances:

* When a party achieves 50%+1 of first-preference valid votes in the election but does not secure a parliamentary majority it is awarded enough seats (filled by the best runner-up candidates) to make a parliamentary majority
* When in an election contested by more than two parties only two parties are elected to Parliament and the relative parliamentary strength is not proportionate to the first preference votes obtained, additional seats are allocated to establish proportionality

A third electoral amendment has been enacted which guarantees strict-proportionality with respect to votes and seats to parliamentary political groups.

==Judicial branch==

The judicial system in Malta comprises inferior courts, civil and criminal courts of appeal, and a Constitutional Court. Inferior courts are presided over by magistrates which have original jurisdiction in criminal and civil actions. In the criminal courts, the presiding judge sits with a jury of nine. The Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal hear appeals from decisions of the civil and criminal actions respectively.

The highest court, the Constitutional Court, has both original and appellate jurisdiction. In its appellate jurisdiction it adjudicates cases involving violations of human rights and interpretation of the Constitution. It can also perform judicial review. In its original jurisdiction it has jurisdiction over disputed parliamentary elections and electoral corrupt practices.

There is a legal aid scheme offered to citizens lacking the means to afford legal defence.

According to the Constitution, the president appoints the chief justice of Malta acting in accordance with a resolution of the House supported by the votes of not less than two-thirds of all the members of the House of Representatives. The judges of the Superior Court and the magistrates of the inferior courts are appointed through the Judicial Appointments Committee of Malta.

Guarantees for the independence of the judiciary include the security of tenure for judges until their retiring age set at 65 (with a choice to extend retirement till 68), or until impeachment. The impeachment procedure for judges foresees a removal decision of the president upon request by the Commission for the Administration for Justice. 

The independence of the judiciary is also guaranteed by the constitutional requirement that the judges’ salaries are paid from the Consolidated Fund and thus the government may not diminish or amend them to their prejudice.

The Maltese system is considered in line with the principles of separation of powers and of independence of the judiciary. However, in its pre-accession evaluation reports, the European Commission has suggested in 2003 the need to reform the procedure for appointment of the members of the judiciary, currently &quot;controlled by political bodies&quot; (i.e. the Parliament and parties therein), in order to improve its objectivity. The Commission has also pointed to the need to check the compliance of the procedure for challenging judges and magistrates provided for by Article 738 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure with the principle of an impartial tribunal enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.

==International organization participation==
Malta is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, CE, EBRD, ECE, EU (member from 1 May 2004), FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICFTU, ICRM, IFAD, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IMO, Inmarsat, Intelsat, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WCL, WCO, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO, WTrO

<doc id="19142" wikidata="Q1354023" url="?curid=19142" title="Economy of Malta">
<text>The economy of Malta is a highly industrialised service-based economy. It is classified as an advanced economy by the International Monetary Fund and is considered a high-income country by the World Bank and an innovation-driven economy by the World Economic Forum. It is a member of the European Union and of the eurozone, having formally adopted the euro on 1 January 2008.

The strengths of Malta&#x27;s economy are its advantageous location, being situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea at a crossroads between Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, its fully developed open market economy, multilingual population (88% of Maltese people speak English), productive labour force, low corporate tax and well developed finance and ICT clusters. The economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially electronics), tourism and other services in the tertiary sector of the economy. In 2014, over 1.7 million tourists visited the island.

Malta&#x27;s GDP per capita in 2024, adjusted by purchasing power parity, stood at $67,682 and ranked 15th in the list of EU countries in terms of purchasing power standard. In the 2013 calendar year, Malta recorded a budget deficit of 2.7%, which is within the limits for eurozone countries imposed by the Maastricht criteria, and Government gross debt of 69.8%. At 5.9%, Malta had the sixth-lowest unemployment rate in the EU in 2015.

Malta is the 33rd-most democratic country in the world according to the Economist Intelligence Unit&#x27;s Democracy Index.

==Transport==

Malta has an airport, Luqa International Airport, and two majors ports, Malta Freeport and Valletta Cruise Port. Malta Freeport is used for all cargo ships and imports-exports while Valletta Cruise Port is only used by cruise ships. The Malta Freeport reported revenues of 170 million euros, while €90 million came from the Valletta Cruise Port, totaling €260 million. The Freeport connects Malta with 110 others ports in the world including 55 in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, 2,189 container ships carried 2.80 million TEU of container traffic in and out of Malta Freeport in 2022. The Valletta Cruise Port welcomed 900,000 passengers in 2023, contributing €53 million to the Maltese economy.
Luqa International Airport serves 35 different airlines with 115 destinations. In 2023, 7.8 million people travelled through the airport, providing $2.7 billion in revenues to the Maltese economy, equivalent to 24% of Malta&#x27;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Specifically, the former air flag carrier of Malta Air Malta, KM Malta Airlines since 2024, had a revenue of €679.4 million in 2022. Another new airline operating from Luqa Airport, Universal Air, started operations in April 2024 with a fleet of 6 aircraft. The airlines, airport, and surrounding businesses employ almost 7,000 people.

==History==
During the Napoleonic Wars (1800–1815), Malta&#x27;s economy prospered and became the focal point of a major trading system. In 1808, two-thirds of the cargo consigned from Malta went to Levant and Egypt. Later, one half of the cargo was usually destined for Trieste. Cargo consisted of largely British and colonial-manufactured goods. Malta&#x27;s economy became prosperous from this trade and many artisans, such as weavers, found new jobs in the port industry.

In 1820, during the Battle of Navarino, which took place in Greece, the British fleet was based in Malta. In 1839, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and East India Companies used Malta as a calling port on their Egypt and Levant runs.

In 1869, the opening of the Suez Canal benefited Malta&#x27;s economy greatly as there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered in the port. The economy had entered a special phase. The Mediterranean Sea became the &quot;world highway of trade&quot; and a number of ships called at Malta for coal and various supplies on their way to the Indian Ocean and the Far East. From 1871 to 1881, about 8,000 workers found jobs in the Malta docks and a number of banks opened in Malta. By 1882, Malta reached the height of its prosperity.

However, the boom did not last long. By the end of the 19th century, the economy began declining and by the 1940s, Malta&#x27;s economy was in serious crisis. This was primarily due to the invention of large ships which had become oil-fired and therefore had no need to stop in the Grand Harbor of Malta to refuel. The British Government had to extend the dockyard.

At the end of World War II, Malta&#x27;s strategic importance had reached a low point. Modern air warfare technology and the invention of the atomic bomb had changed the importance of the military base. The British lost control of the Suez Canal and withdrew from the naval dockyard, transforming it for commercial shipbuilding and ship repair purposes.

==Modern economy==
The Maltese economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially electronics and pharmaceuticals), and tourism. Malta adopted the Euro currency on 1 January 2008.

Tourist arrivals and foreign exchange earnings derived from tourism have steadily increased since 1987. Following the September 11 attacks, the tourist industry suffered a temporary setback. With the help of a favorable international economic climate, the availability of domestic resources, and industrial policies that support foreign export-oriented investment, the economy has been able to sustain a period of rapid growth. Growing public and private sector demand for credit has led — in the context of interest rate controls — to credit rationing to the private sector and the introduction of non-interest charges by banks. Despite these pressures, consumer price inflation has remained low (2.2% according to the Central Bank of Malta in 2007), reflecting the impact of a fixed exchange rate policy (100% hard peg to the euro, in preparation for currency changeover) and lingering price controls.

There is a strong manufacturing base for high value-added products like electronics and pharmaceuticals, and the manufacturing sector has more than 250 foreign-owned, export-oriented enterprises. Tourism generates around 15% of GDP. Film production in Malta is another growing industry (approx. 35 million euros between 1997 and 2011), despite stiff competition from other film locations in Eastern Europe and North Africa, with the Malta Film Commission providing support services to foreign film companies for the production of feature cinema, commercials and television series.

From 2001 to 2005 the mean GDP real growth was 0.4% due to Malta losing pace in tourism and other industries. Unemployment was down to 4.4%, its lowest level in 3 years. Many formerly state-owned companies are being privatised—and the market liberalised.

Fiscal policy has been directed toward bringing down the budget deficit after public debt grew from a negative figure in 1988 to 56% in 1999 and 69.1% in 2009. By 2007, the deficit-to-GDP ratio was comfortably below 3% as required for eurozone membership, but due to pre-election spending has gone up to 4.4% in 2008 and 3.8% in 2009.

=== Energy ===
Despite a great potential for solar and wind power, Malta produces almost all its electricity from oil, importing 100% of it. Energy and the cost of energy, which is oft-quoted as the highest in Europe, was a key issue in the 2013 election.

==Poverty==
Poverty and social exclusion are significant problems in Malta. As of 2008, an estimate of 15% of Malta&#x27;s citizens were living below the poverty line, which was slightly better than the EU average of 17% at the time. To address the issue of poverty, on 24 December 2014 Malta addressed poverty in the six branches of social services, health and environment, culture, income and social benefits, education and employment, by unveiling the National Strategic Policy for Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion; this will stay in effect from 2014 to 2024. Under this policy, stakeholders will be involved in the discussion of how to reduce hardships experienced by families living in Malta.

== Unemployment system ==
Benefits for unemployment are given out based on contributory and non-contributory schemes. Contributory schemes distribute unemployment benefits within 50 weeks of contribution. Non-contributory schemes a Social Unemployment Benefit is granted after a means test to the head of a household. In order to qualify for unemployment benefits, a person must be able to do work and have registered as unemployed.

There are three categories to the Malta registrar of unemployment. People who have never worked fall into category one. Those who quit or were dismissed from their jobs fall into category two. Category three is for people who are currently employed but are looking for other job prospects. Benefits for unemployment are given for 156 days after which a person may qualify for the means tested unemployment assistance. People eligible for unemployment benefits are Maltese citizens who are aged sixteen years or older, people signed up for eligible work-study programs, and citizens outside of Malta who are employed by foreign entities.

Some scholars have noted that Malta&#x27;s unemployment system has created a dependency on the benefits provided by the system. From 1992 to 2005, there was an increase in the number of recipients of both short-term and long-term benefits. Additionally, in 2016, 969 Maltese citizens were cut off the employment register for abusing the system. For these reasons, there has been movements from politicians to reduce and reshape the unemployment system. After the election of the Labour Party in 2013, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits dropped by 75%. This same government introduced the &quot;in-work&quot; benefit which forces more people to work while helping the most poor and desperate.

In order to be eligible for in-work benefit, applicants must first have children under the age of 23, and from that point, benefits vary depending on marital status and the number of people employed per family. For a single parent in employment who earns between €6,600-€16,500, they are eligible for a maximum payable rate of up to €1,250 annually per child. For a married couple whose collective income is between €10,000 and is less than €24,000 (the income of one of the spouses must be over €3,000), they are eligible for a maximum payment rate of up to €1,200 annually per child. In 2016, the in-work benefit was extended to married couples where only one parent works, extending the benefit to an additional 3,700 families. For a married couple with only one parent gainfully employed whose income is greater than €6,600 and less than €16,500, they are eligible for a maximum payable rate of up to €350 yearly per child. The in-work benefit is paid quarterly in January, April, July, and October.

At 42.3% in 2017, female workforce participation rate in Malta is relatively low. For over half of Maltese women who stay out of the workforce altogether, they do not receive direct unemployment benefits. Rather, most unemployment benefits are given to men because to receive unemployment benefits, one must first be employed. However, because older women tend to stay out of the workforce, those women who do participate in the workforce tend to be younger and have higher levels of education. This has led to a lower long-term unemployment rate amongst women than men. In 2011, the long-term unemployment rate of women was 2.5% while the long-term unemployment rate of men was 3.3%.

== Pensions system ==
Malta has public and private pension systems. There are two types of contributions for the public pension system: class one and class two. Employed people contribute to class one and those are self-employed contribute to class two. There was a gradual increase in pension age in Malta in the 1950s and 1960s; for example, someone who was born in 1953 needs to be 62 years old in order to collect pensions while another person born in 1960 would have to be 64 years old in order to collect pensions. Another requirement to qualify for a Malta pension program is that a person must have been contributing to the program for a certain time period or they will not be eligible..In Malta there is a state Malta Retirement Programme for foreign pensioners. According to the programme, a foreigner whose income is more than 75% from pension payments, can receive a residence permit in the country and a special tax status.

<text>The transport system in [[Malta]] is small but extensive, and the islands&#x27; domestic system of public transport is reliant on buses and taxis, although there was both a railway and a tramway in the past. Public transport in Malta has been free of charge since October 2022 for all residents with a Tallinja Card (a personalised public transport card), for which any resident of Malta can register.

Malta&#x27;s primary international connections are the Malta International Airport in Luqa and by sea the Valletta Ferry Terminal. Malta&#x27;s primary commercial connection is the Malta Freeport (the 3rd largest transshipment port in the Mediterranean Sea) in Birżebbuġa.

Created in 2010 the authority in charge of all Transport services in the country is Transport Malta, consumed the services of the Malta Maritime Authority, the Malta Transport Authority and the Director and Directorate of Civil Aviation.

The Ministry of Culture of Malta sanctioned Touring Club Malta to set up a Transport Museum.

==Land transport==

===Roads===
Traffic in Malta drives on the left, being one of only four countries in Europe to do so, along with the United Kingdom, Ireland and Cyprus. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high given the very small size of the islands. The country has a car ownership rate of 766 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. As of October 2021, the number of registered cars amounted to 411,056, giving an auto-mobile density of 1253.8 per km².

Malta has 3,096 kilometres of road, 2,704 km (87.3%) of which are paved and 392 km are unpaved as of 2008. 114 km of Malta&#x27;s roads are on the Trans-European Transport Network but it has no motorways. Roads in Malta are maintained and operated by Infrastructure Malta.

The official road user guide for Malta is &quot;The Highway Code&quot;.

===Buses===

Buses are the primary method of public transport for the Maltese Islands and have been in operation there since 1905, offering a cheap and frequent service to many parts of Malta and Gozo. The vast majority of buses on Malta depart from a terminus in Valletta. Malta&#x27;s buses carried over 40 million passengers in 2015.

The traditional classic Maltese buses, which were in operation until 2011 and still provide tourist-oriented services to this day, have become visitor attractions in their own right due to their uniqueness, and are depicted on many Maltese advertisements to promote tourism as well as on gifts and merchandise for tourists. Prior to their reform there were approximately 500 buses in public transit service, most of them privately owned by the bus drivers themselves, and operated to a unified timetable set by the transport authority. On any one day, half the bus fleet worked on the public transport network (called &quot;route buses&quot;), while the other half were used for private tours and school transport.

In July 2011 a new public transport network was installed by Transport Malta (the regulating authority) and on 3 July 2011 it started being operated by Arriva Malta, which was owned by Arriva (67%) and Tumas Group (33%), operating as the sole operator on a 10-year contract and running a new 264-strong fleet of buses in a turquoise and cream livery. Unlike the system it replaced, the buses were owned and operated by a single company with the drivers working as employees of Arriva Malta.

When Arriva ceased operations on 1 January 2014 due to financial difficulties, the company was nationalised as Malta Public Transport by the Maltese government as an interim measure while a new bus operator could be found. As of October 2014 the government has chosen Autobuses Urbanos de León (Alsa subsidiary) as its preferred bus operator for the country, and although the agreement has yet to be fully determined and signed, it is planned that they will being operation in January 2015.

During the closing days of December 2014, the Times of Malta and other newspapers were reporting that the company had now signed contracts and purchased the existing operation for 8 million euros. They duly took over the business on January 8, 2015 with their takeover being effected as a &quot;soft launch&quot;. The existing name - Malta Public Transport - is to be retained instead of using Autobuses Urbanos de León and nothing will have changed from a passenger perspective initially. The buses are to be repainted into a new livery of light green and white and during a press announcement to mark the formal takeover of operations on the day, several repainted buses were lined up for a photo call to show off the new livery, these being two of the leased in 2014 Optare Solos, one of the leased in 2014 Wright Volvos, one each of the new in 2011 King Long XMQ6900J and XMQ6127J buses. By February the sub contracted buses from UBS were replaced - temporarily - with 32 dual-door Mercedes-Benz Citaro buses operated by ALESA (as opposed to the situation until then of sub contracting of both bus and driver from UBS) until new Otokar Vectio C dual-door single deck buses currently on order have arrive later in 2015. These new buses will number 142 in total and used to augment the existing fleet as the revised route network is incrementally rolled out during the course of 2015 with the full service planned not expected to be fully realized until 2016, at which time the 23 million euro subsidy for 2015 will rise to 29 million thereafter.

In January 2019, the Government has said that young people who are between 16 and 20-years old in 2018 can now travel by bus for free. People between 17 and 19-years old will travel for free between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019. The government also said that those who will turn 16 this year will start travelling for free on their birthday and will keep benefiting from the scheme until their 17th birthday. 20-year-olds will benefit until they reach 21.

Since October 2022 public transport (which includes buses) in Malta and Gozo has been free of charge for all residents with a Tallinja Card (a personalised public transport card), of which any Malta resident can register for.

===Railway===

The Malta Railway was the only railway line ever on the island of Malta, and it consisted of a single railway line from Valletta to Mdina. It was a single-track line in metre gauge, operating from 1883 to 1931 between the capital city of Valletta and the army barracks at Mtarfa / Mdina. The railway was known in Maltese as &quot;il-vapur tal-art&quot; (the land ship).

=== Tramways ===
Electric tramways operated in Malta from 23 February 1905 till 1929.

The tramway was connected with two lines, considered to be a direct line:
# Valletta – Marsa – Paola – Cospicua
# Valletta – Ħamrun – Qormi – Żebbuġ
# Valletta – Ħamrun – Birkirkara
There was no immediate extension of the track to Mosta.

The tracks ran on the road parallel to the Valletta-Mdina railway line, which also allowed the traffic system to be used by cars and buses. The road operation was terminated after the bankruptcy of the company on December 15, 1929 and the infrastructure was rebuilt.

In 2008, the Halcrow report suggested the government to reintroduce two tram lines in Malta: Valletta to Sliema along the coast road, and Valletta to Ta&#x27; Qali. The report was largely overlooked, as the government focused on reforming the bus transport. In 2016 the government announced a new study on reintroducing the tram. The new study, which is expected by late 2020, should also look at metro and monorail options.

===Metro===
In 2021 the Maltese government unveiled a proposal for a €6.2 billion metro network, to consist of three lines and 25 stations, of which the majority would be underground.

==Maritime transport==
Malta has three large natural harbours on its main island. There are also two man-made harbours that connect the islands of Malta and Gozo.

*The Grand Harbour, located at the eastern side of the capital city of Valletta. The Grand Harbour, which has been used as a harbour since Roman times, has several extensive docks and wharves, as well as a cruise liner terminal.
*Marsamxett Harbour, located on the western side of Valletta, accommodate a number of yacht marinas.
*Marsaxlokk Harbour is sited at Marsaxlokk on the southeastern side of Malta, and is the location of the Malta Freeport, the islands&#x27; main cargo terminal.

===Ferry services===

A frequent daily passenger and car ferry service runs between the islands of Malta and Gozo between Ċirkewwa Harbour and Mġarr Harbour.

There is also a ferry terminal at the Grand Harbour that connects Malta to Pozzallo and Catania in Sicily.

===Merchant marine===
Malta is one of the ten largest ship registers in the world (6th in 2016) and the largest in the EU, with 66.2 million gt registered. At the end of 2015, there were also 501 yachts on the register.

==Air transport==

Malta International Airport is the only airport serving the Maltese Islands. It is built on the land formerly occupied by the RAF Luqa air base. A heliport is also located there, but the scheduled service to Gozo ceased in 2006. From June 2007 to August 2012, a three-times daily floatplane service, operated by HarbourAir Malta, linked the sea terminal in Grand Harbour to Mgarr harbour in Gozo.

In the past there were two further airfields which were in operation during World War II and into the 1960s, located at Ta&#x27;Qali and Ħal Far. They have now since been closed, the land on the former has now been converted into a national park, stadium and the Crafts Village visitor attraction. The Malta Aviation Museum is also situated here, preserving several aircraft including Hurricane and Spitfire fighters which defended the island in World War II. Ħal Far has been converted into an industrial estate, a race track and an immigration reception centre.

The national airline is KM Malta Airlines, which replaced Air Malta in March 2024.

<text>After independence in 1964, Malta followed a policy of close co-operation with NATO countries. Since 1971, the country sought relations with the rest of the world, including communist countries in Eastern Europe and the non-aligned countries.

After substantially increased financial contributions from several NATO countries (including the United States), the Royal Navy remained in the Malta Dockyard until 1979. Following their departure, Malta charted a new course of neutrality and became an active member of the Non-Aligned Movement. The country joined the Non-Aligned Movement in 1973 as the third European member state after Cyprus and SFR Yugoslavia. Malta is an active participant in the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the Council of Europe, OSCE, and various other international organisations. In these forums, Malta has frequently expressed its concern for the peace and economic development of the Mediterranean region.

On May 1, 2004, Malta withdrew from the Non-Aligned Movement and became a full member of the European Union, with which it had an association agreement since 1971. It was one of ten new members which joined on that date. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, at Palazzo Parisio, oversees the direction of Maltese foreign policy. The country has close relations with most sovereign countries, with an emphasis on increased trade and foreign direct investment.

<doc id="19147" wikidata="Q709" url="?curid=19147" title="Marshall Islands">
<text>The Marshall Islands (), officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands (), is an island country west of the International Date Line and north of the equator in the Micronesia region of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean. 

The territory consists of 29 coral atolls and five main islands as well as 1,220 other very small ones, divided across two island chains: Ratak in the east and Ralik in the west. 97.87% of its territory is water, the largest proportion of water to land of any sovereign state. The country shares maritime boundaries with Wake Island to the north, Kiribati to the southeast, Nauru to the south, and the Federated States of Micronesia to the west. The capital and largest city is Majuro, home to approximately half of the country&#x27;s population. The Marshall Islands are one of only four atoll based nations in the entire world.

Austronesian settlers reached the Marshall Islands as early as the 2nd millennium BC and introduced Southeast Asian crops, including coconuts, giant swamp taro, and breadfruit, as well as domesticated chickens, which made the islands permanently habitable. Several Spanish expeditions visited the islands in the mid-16th century, but Spanish galleons usually sailed a Pacific route farther north and avoided the Marshalls. European maps and charts named the group for British captain John Marshall, who explored the region in 1788. American Protestant missionaries and Western business interests began arriving in the 1850s. German copra traders dominated the economy in the 1870s and 1880s, and the German Empire annexed the Marshalls as a protectorate in 1885. 

The Empire of Japan occupied the islands in the autumn of 1914 at the beginning of World War I. After the war, the Marshalls and other former German Pacific colonies north of the equator became the Japanese South Seas Mandate. The United States occupied the islands during World War II and administered them as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands after the war. Between 1946 and 1958, the United States conducted 67 nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll.

The U.S. government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. In May 1979, the United States gave the Marshall Islands independence by recognizing its constitution and president, Amata Kabua. Full sovereignty or self-government was achieved in a Compact of Free Association with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a member of the Pacific Community (PC) since 1983 and a United Nations member state since 1991. 

Politically, the Marshall Islands is a parliamentary republic with an executive presidency in free association with the United States, with the U.S. providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Postal Service. With few natural resources, the islands&#x27; wealth is based on a service economy, as well as fishing and agriculture; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands&#x27; gross domestic product, and although most financial aid from the Compact of Free Association was set to expire in 2023, it was extended for another 20 years that same year. The country uses the United States dollar as its currency. In 2018, it also announced plans for a new cryptocurrency to be used as legal tender.

The majority of the citizens of the Republic of Marshall Islands are of Marshallese descent, though there are small numbers of immigrants from the United States, China, Philippines, and other Pacific islands. The two official languages are Marshallese, which is one of the Oceanic languages, and English. Almost the entire population of the islands practices some religion: three-quarters of the country follows either the United Church of Christ – Congregational in the Marshall Islands (UCCCMI) or the Assemblies of God.

== History==
===Prehistory===
Linguistic and anthropological studies have suggested that the first Austronesian settlers of the Marshall Islands arrived from the Solomon Islands. Radiocarbon dating suggests that Bikini Atoll may have been inhabited as early as 1200 BCE, though samples may not have been collected from secure stratigraphic contexts and older driftwood samples may have affected results. Archaeological digs on other atolls have found evidence of human habitation dating around the 1st century CE at the village of Laura on Majuro and on Kwajalein Atoll.

The Austronesian settlers introduced Southeast Asian crops, including coconuts, giant swamp taro, and breadfruit, as well as domesticated chickens throughout the Marshall Islands. They possibly seeded the islands by leaving coconuts at seasonal fishing camps before permanently settling years later. The southern islands receive heavier rainfall than the north, so communities in the wet south subsisted on prevalent taro and breadfruit, while northerners were more likely to subsist on pandanus and coconuts. Southern atolls probably supported larger, more dense populations.

The Marshallese sailed between islands on walaps made from breadfruit-tree wood and coconut-fiber rope. They navigated by using the stars for orientation and initial course setting, but also developed a piloting technique of interpreting disruptions in ocean swells to determine the location of low coral atolls below the horizon. They noticed that swells refracted around the undersea slope of atolls. When refracted swells from different directions met, they created noticeable disruption patterns, which Marshallese pilots could read to determine the direction of an island. When interviewed by anthropologists, some Marshallese sailors noted that they piloted their canoes by both sight and feeling changes in the motion of the boat. Sailors also invented stick charts to map the swell patterns, but unlike western navigational charts, the Marshallese stick charts were tools for teaching students and for consultation before embarking on a voyage; navigators did not take charts with them when they set sail.

When Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue visited the Marshalls in 1817, the islanders still showed few signs of western influence. He observed that the Marshallese lived in thatched-roof huts, but their villages did not include the large ornate meeting houses found in other parts of Micronesia. They did not have furniture, except for woven mats, which they used for both floor coverings and clothing. The Marshallese had pierced ears and tattoos. He learned that Marshallese families practiced infanticide after the birth of a third child as a form of population planning due to frequent famines. He also noted that Marshallese iroij held considerable authority and rights to all property, though he had a more favorable view of the condition of Marshallese commoners than of that of Polynesian commoners. The Marshalls&#x27; two island groups, the Ratak and Ralik chains, were each ruled by a paramount chief, or iroijlaplap, who held authority over the individual island iroij.

===European exploration===
On August 21, 1526, Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar was the first European to sight the Marshall Islands. While commanding the &quot;Santa Maria de la Victoria&quot;, he sighted an atoll with a green lagoon, which may have been Taongi. The crew could not land, because of strong currents and water too deep for the ship&#x27;s anchor, so the ship sailed for Guam two days later. 

On January 2, 1528, the expedition of Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón landed on an uninhabited island, possibly in Ailinginae Atoll, where they resupplied and stayed for six days. Natives from a neighboring island briefly met the Spanish. This expedition named the islands &#x27;Los Pintados&#x27; or &quot;the Painted Ones&quot; for the natives who wore tattoos. Later Spanish explorers of the Marshalls included Ruy López de Villalobos, Miguel López de Legazpi, Alonso de Arellano, and Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira, though coordinates and geographic descriptions in 16th century Spanish logs are sometimes imprecise, leaving uncertainty about the specific islands they sighted and visited. 

On July 6, 1565, the Spanish ship &quot;San Jeronimo&quot; nearly wrecked at Ujelang Atoll after the ship&#x27;s pilot Lope Martín led a mutiny. While the mutineers were resupplying at Ujelang, several crew members took back control of the ship and marooned Martín and twenty-six other mutineers in the Marshalls. By the late 16th century, Spanish galleons sailing between the Americas and the Philippines kept to a sea lane at 13°N and provisioned at Guam, avoiding the Marshalls, which Spanish sailors saw as unprofitable islands amid hazardous waters.

The British sea captains John Marshall and Thomas Gilbert visited the islands in 1788. Their vessels had been part of the First Fleet taking convicts from England to Botany Bay in New South Wales, and were en route to Guangzhou when they passed through the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. On June 25, 1788, the British ships had peaceful interactions and traded with islanders at Mili Atoll; their meeting may have been the first contact between Europeans and Marshallese since the Mendaña expedition of 1568. Subsequent navigational charts and maps named the islands for John Marshall.

From the 1820s through the 1850s, the Marshall Islanders became increasingly hostile to western vessels, possibly because of violent punishments that sea captains exacted for theft as well as the abduction of Marshallese people for sale into slavery on Pacific plantations. One of the earliest violent encounters occurred in February 1824, when the inhabitants of Mili Atoll massacred marooned sailors from the American whaler &quot;Globe&quot;. Similar encounters occurred as late as 1851 and 1852, when three separate Marshallese attacks on ships occurred at Ebon, Jaluit, and Namdrik Atolls.

===Colonial period===
In 1857, American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent two families to establish a mission church and school at Ebon. By 1875, the missionaries had established churches on five atolls and had baptized more than 200 islanders, and one traveler noted that most women on Ebon wore western clothes and many men wore trousers by the mid-1870s.

In 1859, Adolph Capelle and another merchant arrived at Ebon and set up a trading post for the German company Hoffschlaeger &amp; Stapenhorst. When the firm went bankrupt in 1863, Capelle partnered with Portuguese ex-whaler Anton Jose DeBrum to establish a copra trading firm: Capelle &amp; Co. In 1873, the company moved its headquarters to Jaluit, the home of Kabua, a powerful iroij and disputed successor for the paramount chieftainship of the southern Ralik Chain. In the 1870s, various other companies from Germany, Hawaii, New Zealand, and the United States engaged in the copra trade in the Marshall Islands. By 1885, the German firms Hernsheim &amp; Co. and Deutsche Handels- und Plantagen-Gesellschaft Der Südsee Inseln zu Hamburg controlled two-thirds of the trade.

Contact between the Marshallese and westerners led to sometimes lethal outbreaks of western diseases, including influenza, measles, syphilis, and typhoid fever. Increased access to alcohol led to social problems in some Marshallese communities, and on several atolls conflicts erupted between rival iroij with access to firearms.

====German protectorate====
In 1875, the British and German governments conducted a series of secret negotiations to divide the Western Pacific into spheres of influence. The German sphere included the Marshall Islands. On November 26, 1878, the German warship SMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; anchored at Jaluit to begin treaty negotiations with the chiefs to grant the German Empire &quot;most favored nation&quot; status in the Ralik Chain. During the second day of negotiations, Captain ordered his men to give military demonstrations which he later said were intended to &quot;show the islanders, who have not seen anything like it before, the power of the Europeans.&quot; On November 29, Werner signed a treaty with Kabua and several other Ralik Chain iroij which secured a German fuelling station at Jaluit and free use of the atoll&#x27;s harbor.

On August 29, 1885, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck authorized the annexation of the Marshall Islands as a protectorate following repeated petitions by German business interests. The German gunboat docked at Jaluit on October 13 to take control. On October 15, iroij Kabua, Loeak, Nelu, Lagajime, and Launa signed a protection treaty in German and Marshallese at the German consulate. While the Marshallese text made no distinction of rank among the five chiefs, the German text recognized Kabua as the King of the Marshall Islands, despite an ongoing dispute between Kabua and Loeak over the paramount chieftainship. A company of German marines hoisted the flag of the German Empire over Jaluit, and performed similar ceremonies at seven other atolls in the Marshalls, though several pro-American iroij refused to recognize the German protectorate until threatened with German naval force in mid-1886. Nauru was incorporated into the German Protectorate of the Marshall Islands in 1888, following the Anglo-German Declarations of April 1886.

The German commercial interests formed the joint-stock Jaluit Company, which was responsible for financing the colony&#x27;s administration. In addition to controlling two-thirds of the Marshallese copra trade, the company had the authority to collect commercial license fees and an annual poll tax. The company also had the right to be consulted on all new laws and ordinances and nominated all colonial administrative staff. The company&#x27;s licensing fees and legal advantages pushed out American and British competition, creating a monopoly in the German Pacific colonies. The British government protested the regulations benefiting the Jaluit Company as a violation of the Anglo-German Declarations&#x27; free-trade provision. On March 31, 1906, the German government assumed direct control and reorganized the Marshall Islands and Nauru as part of the protectorate of German New Guinea.

====Japanese mandate====
The Imperial Japanese Navy invaded Enewetak on September 29, 1914, and Jaluit on September 30 at the beginning of World War I. An occupation force was stationed on Jaluit on October 3. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonies north of the equator became the Japanese South Seas Mandate under the system of League of Nations mandates. Germany ceded the Marshall Islands to Japan with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919.

The Japanese navy administered the islands from late 1914 through 1921. The civilian set up its headquarters in Palau in April 1922 and administered the Marshalls until World War II. Japanese surveys determined that the Marshalls&#x27; value was primarily strategic, because they could enable future southward expansion. The Marshalls also continued to be a major producer of copra during the Japanese period, with the taking over the Jaluit Company&#x27;s operations and building upon the German colonial infrastructure. Other parts of the South Seas Mandate experienced heavy Japanese settlement, shifting the population to majority Japanese in the Northern Mariana Islands and Palau, but Japanese settlers remained a minority under 1,000 people in the Marshall Islands throughout the Japanese period, because the islands were distant from Japan and had the most limited economic potential in Micronesia.

On March 27, 1933, Japan declared its intentions to withdraw from the League of Nations, officially withdrawing in 1935 but continuing to control the territory of the South Seas Mandate. Japanese military planners initially discounted the Marshalls as too distant and indefensible for extensive fortification, but as Japan developed long-range bombers, the islands became useful as a forward base to attack Australia, British colonies, and the United States. In 1939 and 1940, the navy built military airfields on Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje Atolls as well as seaplane facilities at Jaluit.

After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the United States Pacific Fleet carried out the Marshalls–Gilberts raids, which struck Jaluit, Kwajalein, Maloelap, and Wotje on February 1, 1942. They were the first American air raids on Japanese territory. The United States invaded the Marshall Islands on January 31, 1944, during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. The Americans simultaneously invaded Majuro and Kwajalein. By autumn 1944, the Americans controlled all of the Marshall Islands, except for Jaluit, Maloelap, Mili, and Wotje. As the American campaign advanced through Micronesia and into the Ryukyu Islands, the four Japanese-held atolls were cut off from supplies and subject to American bombardment. The garrisons began running out of provisions in late 1944, leading to high casualties from starvation and disease.

====U.S. Trust Territory====

In 1947, the United States entered into an agreement with the UN Security Council to administer much of Micronesia, including the Marshall Islands, as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

From 1946 to 1958, it served as the Pacific Proving Grounds for the United States and was the site of 67 nuclear tests on various atolls.

Operation Crossroads atomic bomb testing began in 1946 on Bikini Atoll after some of the residents were forcibly evacuated.

The world&#x27;s first hydrogen bomb, codenamed &quot;Mike&quot;, was tested at the Enewetak atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1 (local date) in 1952, which produced significant fallout in the region.

Over the years just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the U.S. government, and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal. Many of the islanders and their descendants still live in exile, as the islands remain contaminated with high levels of radiation.

A significant radar installation was constructed on Kwajalein atoll.

===Independence===

On May 1, 1979, in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands, the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The constitution incorporates both American and British constitutional concepts.

There have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the 1999 parliamentary election, taking control of the presidency and cabinet.

The islands signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under United Nations Security Council Resolution 683 of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received US$180 million for continued American use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250 million in compensation for nuclear testing, and US$600 million in other payments under the compact.

Despite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij. It was not until 1999, following political corruption allegations, that the aristocratic government was overthrown, with Imata Kabua replaced by the commoner Kessai Note.

The Runit Dome was built on Runit Island to deposit U.S.-produced radioactive soil and debris, including lethal amounts of plutonium. There are ongoing concerns about deterioration of the waste site and a potential radioactive spill.

In February 2018, the Marshall Islands became the first country in the world to recognize its cryptocurrency as its own legal tender for digital currency.

In January 2020, David Kabua, son of founding president Amata Kabua, was elected as the new President of the Marshall Islands. His predecessor Hilda Heine lost the position after a vote.

Since the late 1980s, Marshallese have migrated to the US, with over 4,000 in Arkansas and over 7,000 in Hawaii in the 2010 US Census.

Following independence, the Marshall Islands continued to play a prominent role in the testing and launches of missiles and rockets for both military and commercial space purposes. All five of the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket flights were carried out on Omelek Island within the Kwajalein Atoll. The fourth launch of the Falcon 1 was successful, marking the first time in history a privately developed, fully liquid-fueled launch vehicle achieved orbit. SpaceX founder Elon Musk was present in Kwajalein for select launches.

==Geography==



The Marshall Islands sit atop ancient submerged volcanoes rising from the ocean floor, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, north of Nauru and Kiribati, east of the Federated States of Micronesia, and south of the disputed U.S. territory of Wake Island, to which it also lays claim. The atolls and islands form two groups: the Ratak (sunrise) and the Ralik (sunset). The two island chains lie approximately parallel to one another, running northwest to southeast, comprising about of ocean but only about of land mass. Each includes 15 to 18 islands and atolls.

The country consists of a total of 29 atolls and five individual islands situated in about of the Pacific. The largest atoll with a land area of is Kwajalein. It surrounds a lagoon.

Twenty-four of the atolls and islands are inhabited. The remaining atolls are uninhabited due to poor living conditions, lack of rain, or nuclear contamination. The uninhabited atolls are:

* Ailinginae Atoll
* Bikar (Bikaar) Atoll
* Bikini Atoll 
* Bokak Atoll
* Erikub Atoll
* Jemo Island
* Nadikdik Atoll
* Rongerik Atoll
* Toke Atoll
* Ujelang Atoll

The average altitude above sea level for the entire country is .

===Shark sanctuary===

In October 2011, the government declared that an area covering nearly of ocean shall be reserved as a shark sanctuary. This is the world&#x27;s largest shark sanctuary, extending the worldwide ocean area in which sharks are protected from . In protected waters, all shark fishing is banned and all by-catch must be released. However, some have questioned the ability of the Marshall Islands to enforce this zone.

===Territorial claim on Wake Island===

The Marshall Islands also lays claim to Wake Island based on oral legends. While Wake Island has been administered by the United States since 1899, the Marshallese government refers to it by the name &quot;Ānen Kio&quot; (new orthography) or &quot;Enen-kio&quot; (old orthography). The United States does not recognize this claim.

===Climate===
The climate has a relatively dry season from December to April and a wet season from May to November. Many Pacific typhoons begin as tropical storms in the Marshall Islands region and grow stronger as they move west toward the Mariana Islands and the Philippines.

Population has outstripped the supply of fresh water, usually from rainfall. The northern atolls get of rainfall annually; the southern atolls about twice that. The threat of drought is commonplace throughout the island chains.

==== Climate change====

Climate change is a threat to the Marshall Islands, with typhoons becoming stronger and sea levels rising. The sea around the Pacific islands has risen a year since 1993, which is more than twice the worldwide average rate. In Kwajalein, there is a high risk of permanent flooding; when sea level rises by , 37% of buildings will be permanently flooded. In Ebeye, the risk from sea level rise is even higher, with 50% of buildings being permanently flooded in the same scenario. With of sea level rise, parts of the Majuro atoll will be permanently flooded and other parts will have a high risk of flooding especially the eastern part of the atoll would be significantly at risk. With sea level rise all the buildings of Majuro will be permanently flooded or will be at a high risk of being flooded.

The per capita emissions were 2.56 t in 2020. The government of Marshall Islands pledged to be net zero in 2050, with a decrease of 32% in GHGs in 2025, 45% in 2030 and 58% in 2035, all compared to 2010 levels.

===Fauna===
====Birds====
Most birds found in the Marshall Islands, with the exception of those few introduced by humans, are either sea birds or migratory species. There are about 70 species of birds, including 31 seabirds. 15 of these species actually nest locally. Sea birds include the black noddy and the white tern. The only land bird is the house sparrow, introduced by humans.

====Marine====

There are about 300 species of fish, 250 of which are reef fish.
* Turtles: green turtles, hawksbill, Leatherback sea turtles, and Olive ridley sea turtles.
* Sharks: There are at least 22 shark species including: Blue shark, Silky shark, Bigeye thresher shark, Pelagic thresher shark, Oceanic whitetip shark, and Tawny nurse shark.

====Arthropods====

* Scorpions: dwarf wood scorpion, and Common house scorpion. Pseudoscorpions are occasionally found.
*Spiders: Two: &quot;Dictis striatipes&quot;; and &quot;Jaluiticola&quot;, a genus of jumping spiders endemic to the Marshall Islands. Its only species is &quot;Jaluiticola hesslei&quot;.
* Amphipod: One – &quot;Talorchestia spinipalma&quot;.
* Orthoptera: cockroaches, American cockroaches, short-horned grasshopper, crickets.
* Crabs include hermit crabs, and coconut crabs.

==Demographics==


Historical population figures for the Marshall Islands are unknown. In 1862, the population of the Islands was estimated at 10,000. In 1960, the population of the Islands was approximately 15,000. The 2021 census counted 42,418 residents, 23,156 of whom (approximately 54.6%) lived on Majuro. 77.7% of the population lived in an urban setting on Majuro or Ebeye, the country&#x27;s secondary urban center. This figure excludes Marshall Islands natives who have relocated elsewhere; the Compact of Free Association allows them to freely relocate to the United States and obtain work there. Approximately 4,300 Marshall Islands natives relocated to Springdale, Arkansas, in the United States. This figure represents the largest population concentration of Marshall Islands natives outside their island home.

Most residents of the Marshall Islands are Marshallese. Marshallese people are of Micronesian origin and are believed to have migrated from Asia to the Marshall Islands several thousand years ago. A minority of the Marshallese have Asian and European ancestry such as Japanese and German. A Majority have Polynesian and Melanesian ancestry. About one-half of the nation&#x27;s population lives in Majuro and Ebeye Atolls.

The official languages of the Marshall Islands are English and Marshallese. Both languages are widely spoken.

===Religion===

At the September 2021 census, approximately 96.2% of the population identified with one of fourteen Christian denominations in the Marshall Islands. The denominations with more than 1,000 adherents included the United Church of Christ - Congregational in the Marshall Islands (47.9%), the Assemblies of God (14.1%), the Catholic Church (9.3%), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (5.7%), the Full Gospel Church of the Marshall Islands (5%), and Bukot nan Jesus (3%). 

The remainder of denominations primarily included Protestant churches as well as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. 1,128 people, or 2.7% of respondents identified as belonging to a religion other than one of the fourteen denominations listed on the census form. 444 people, or 1.1% of respondents claimed to be irreligious. Majuro also has a Baháʼí community and a Muslim community. The country&#x27;s sole mosque is aligned with the Ahmadiyya movement.

Father A. Erdland, a Catholic priest of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Hiltrup (German Empire, called in German &quot;Herz-Jesu-Missionare&quot; and in Latin &quot;Missionarii Sacratissimi Cordis&quot;), lived in Jaluit between 1904 and 1914. After doing considerable research on Marshallese culture and language, he published a 376-page monograph on the islands in 1914. Father H. Linckens, another Sacred Heart missionary, visited the Marshall Islands in 1904 and 1911 for several weeks. In 1912, he published a small work on Catholic missionary activities and the people of the Marshall Islands. The Catholics are under the responsibility of the Apostolic Prefecture of the Marshall Islands (&quot;Praefectura Apostolica Insularum Marshallensium&quot;), with headquarters at the Cathedral of the Assumption in Majuro, which was created by Pope John Paul II in 1993 through the papal bull &quot;Quo expeditius&quot;.

===Health===
The Castle Bravo test of the first deployable thermonuclear bomb had an unforeseen additional nuclear reactions involving lithium-7 that resulted in the explosion being over twice as large as predicted. Resulting in a much larger nuclear fallout than expected. The nuclear fallout spread eastward onto the inhabited Rongelap and Rongerik Atolls. These islands were not evacuated before the explosion. Many of the Marshall Islands natives have since suffered from radiation burns and radioactive dusting, suffering similar fates as the Japanese fishermen aboard the &quot;Daigo Fukuryū Maru&quot;, but have received little, if any, compensation from the federal government.

In 2010, it was noted the Marshallese were having a problem finding land to bury their dead due to limited land. One solution they developed was to make a double grave by burying another on the same plot.

==Government==


The government of the Marshall Islands operates under a mixed parliamentary-presidential system as set forth in its 1979 Constitution. Elections are held every four years in universal suffrage (for all citizens above 18), with each of the twenty-four constituencies (see below) electing one or more representatives (senators) to the lower house of RMI&#x27;s unicameral legislature, the Nitijela. (Majuro, the capital atoll, elects five senators.) The President, who is head of state as well as head of government, is elected by the 33 senators of the Nitijela. Four of the five Marshallese presidents who have been elected since the Constitution was adopted in 1979 have been traditional paramount chiefs.
In January 2016, senator Hilda Heine was elected by Parliament as the first female president of the Marshall Islands; previous president Casten Nemra lost office in a vote of no confidence after serving two weeks.

Legislative power lies with the Nitijela. The Council of Iroij is an advisory body comprising twelve paramount chiefs. The executive branch consists of the President and the Presidential Cabinet, which consists of ten ministers appointed by the President with the approval of the Nitijela. The twenty-four electoral districts into which the country is divided correspond to the inhabited islands and atolls. There are currently four political parties in the Marshall Islands: Aelon̄ Kein Ad (AKA), United People&#x27;s Party (UPP), Kien Eo Am (KEA), and United Democratic Party (UDP). The AKA and the UDP share rulership. The following senators are in the legislative body:

* Ailinglaplap Atoll – Christopher Loeak (AKA), Alfred Alfred Jr. (IND)
* Ailuk Atoll – Maynard Alfred (UDP)
* Arno Atoll – Mike Halferty (KEA), Jejwadrik H. Anton (IND)
* Aur Atoll – Hilda Heine (AKA)
* Ebon Atoll – John M. Silk (UDP)
* Enewetak Atoll – Jack J. Ading (UPP)
* Jabat Island – Kessai Note (UDP)
* Jaluit Atoll – Casten Nemra (IND), Daisy Alik Momotaro (IND)
* Kili Island – Eldon H. Note (UDP)
* Kwajalein Atoll – Michael Kabua (AKA), David Paul (KEA), Alvin Jacklick (KEA)
* Lae Atoll – Thomas Heine (AKA)
* Lib Island – Jerakoj Jerry Bejang (AKA)
* Likiep Atoll – Leander Leander, Jr. (IND)
* Majuro Atoll – Sherwood M. Tibon (KEA), Anthony Muller (KEA), Brenson Wase (UDP), David Kramer (KEA), Kalani Kaneko (KEA)
* Maloelap Atoll – Bruce Bilimon (IND)
* Mejit Island – Dennis Momotaro (AKA)
* Mili Atoll – Wilbur Heine (AKA)
* Namdrik Atoll – Wisely Zackhras (IND)
* Namu Atoll – Tony Aiseia (AKA)
* Rongelap Atoll – Kenneth A. Kedi (IND)
* Ujae Atoll – Atbi Riklon (IND)
* Utirik Atoll – Amenta Matthew (KEA)
* Wotho Atoll – David Kabua (AKA)
* Wotje Atoll – Litokwa Tomeing (UPP)

===Foreign affairs and defense===

The Compact of Free Association with the United States gives the U.S. sole responsibility for international defense of the Marshall Islands. It gives the islanders (the Marshallese) the right to emigrate to the United States without any visa. However, as aliens, they can be placed in removal proceedings if convicted of certain criminal offenses.

The Marshall Islands was admitted to the United Nations based on the Security Council&#x27;s recommendation on August 9, 1991, in Resolution 704 and the General Assembly&#x27;s approval on September 17, 1991, in Resolution 46/3. In international politics within the United Nations, the Marshall Islands has often voted consistently with the United States with respect to General Assembly resolutions.

On April 28, 2015, the Iranian navy seized the Marshall Island-flagged MV &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot; near the Strait of Hormuz. The ship had been chartered by Germany&#x27;s Rickmers Ship Management, which stated that the ship contained no special cargo and no military weapons. The ship was reported to be under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the Pentagon. Tensions escalated in the region due to the intensifying of Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen. The Pentagon reported that the destroyer USS &quot;Farragut&quot; and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship &quot;Tigris&quot; and it was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained. US defense officials have said that they would review U.S. defense obligations to the Government of the Marshall Islands in the wake of recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as &quot;inappropriate&quot;. It was reported in May 2015 that Tehran would release the ship after it paid a penalty.

In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of the Marshall Islands and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in the Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963, and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report. Indonesia rejected allegations.

Since 1991 the Republic of Marshall Islands Sea Patrol, a division of Marshall Islands Police, has operated the 160-ton patrol vessel RMIS &quot;Lomor&quot;. &quot;Lomor&quot; is one of 22 Pacific Forum patrol vessels Australia provided to smaller nations in the Pacific Forum. While some other nations&#x27; missions for their vessels include sovereignty and protection, the terms of the Compact of Free Association restrict &quot;Lomor&quot; to civilian missions, like fishery protection and search and rescue.

In 2021, the governments of Australia and Japan decided to fund two major law enforcement developments in the Marshall Islands.

In February 2021, the Marshall Islands announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Kiribati, Nauru, and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna&#x27;s election as the forum&#x27;s secretary-general.

==Culture==

Although the ancient skills are now in decline, the Marshallese were once able navigators, using the stars and stick-and-shell charts.

== Sports==
Major sports played in the Marshall Islands include volleyball, basketball (primarily by men), baseball, soccer and a number of water sports. The Marshall Islands has been represented at the Olympics at all games since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the Marshall Islands were represented by two swimmers.

=== Association football===

The Marshall Islands have a small club league, including Kobeer as the most successful club. One tournament was held by &quot;Play Soccer Make Peace&quot;. There is a small Football Association on the island of Majuro. The sport of association football is new to the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands is the only country in the world that does not have a national football team. The Marshall Islands is therefore the only sovereign country in the world that does not have a record of a national football match.

=== Marshall Islands Baseball / Softball Federation===
Softball and baseball are held under one sports federation in the Marshall Islands. The President is Jeimata Nokko Kabua. Both sports are growing at a fast pace, with hundreds of Marshallese people behind the Marshall Islands Baseball / Softball Federation. The Marshall Islands achieved a silver medal in the Micronesian Games in 2012, as well as medals in the SPG Games.

==Economy==

The islands have few natural resources, and their imports far exceed exports. According to the CIA, the value of exports in 2013 was approximately $53.7 million while estimated imports were $133.7 million. Agricultural products include coconuts, tomatoes, melons, taro, breadfruit, fruits, pigs and chickens. Industry is made of the production of copra and craft items, tuna processing and tourism. The GDP in 2016 was an estimated $180 million, with a real growth rate of 1.7%. The GDP per capita was $3,300.

The International Monetary Fund reported in mid-2016 that the economy of the Republic had expanded by about 0.5 percent in the Fiscal Year 2015 thanks to an improved fisheries sector. A surplus of 3% of GDP was recorded &quot;owing to record-high fishing license fees. Growth is expected to rise to about 1.5 percent and inflation to about 0.5 percent in FY2016, as the effects of the drought in earlier 2016 are offset by the resumption of infrastructure projects.&quot;

In 2018, the Republic of Marshall Islands passed the Sovereign Currency Act, which made it the first country to issue their own cryptocurrency and certify it as legal tender; the currency is called the &quot;Sovereign&quot;.

Marshall Islands has signed a bilateral trade agreement with Taiwan in 2019, this agreement has been approved in 2023 and will take effect at a future date.

=== Shipping===
The Marshall Islands plays a vital role in the international shipping industry as a flag of convenience for commercial vessels. The Marshallese registry began operations in 1990, and is managed through a joint venture with International Registries, Inc., a US-based corporation that has offices in major shipping centers worldwide. As of 2017, the Marshallese ship registry was the second largest in the world, after that of Panama.

Unlike some flag countries, there is no requirement that a Marshallese flag vessel be owned by a Marshallese individual or corporation. Following the 2015 seizure of the &quot;MV Maersk Tigris&quot;, the United States announced that its treaty obligation to defend the Marshall Islands did not extend to foreign-owned Marshallese flag vessels at sea.

As a result of ship-to-ship transfers by Marshallese flag tanker vessels, the Marshall Islands have statistically been one of the largest importers of crude oil from the United States, despite the fact that the islands have no oil refining capacity.

===Labour===
In 2007, the Marshall Islands joined the International Labour Organization, which means its labor laws will comply with international benchmarks. This may affect business conditions in the islands.

===Taxation===

The income tax has two brackets, with rates of 8% and 12%. The corporate tax is 3% of revenue.

===Foreign assistance===

United States government assistance is the mainstay of the economy. Under terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association, the U.S. is committed to providing US$57.7 million per year in assistance to the Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2013 and then US$62.7 million through 2023, at which time a trust fund, made up of U.S. and RMI contributions, will begin perpetual annual payouts.

The United States Army maintains the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll. Marshallese landowners receive rent for the base.

===Agriculture===

Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms. The most important commercial crop is copra, followed by coconut, breadfruit, pandanus, banana, taro and arrowroot. The livestock consists primarily of pigs and chickens.

===Industry===
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra.

===Fishing===
Majuro is the world&#x27;s busiest tuna transshipment port, with 704 transshipments totaling 444,393 tons in 2015. Majuro is also a tuna processing center; the Pan Pacific Foods plant exports processed tuna to a number of countries, primarily the United States under the Bumble Bee brand. Fishing license fees, primarily for tuna, provide noteworthy income for the government.

In 1999, a private company built a tuna loining plant with more than 400 employees, mostly women. But the plant closed in 2005 after a failed attempt to convert it to produce tuna steaks, a process that requires half as many employees. Operating costs exceeded revenue and the plant closed. It was taken over by the government, which had been the guarantor of a $2 million loan to the business.

===Energy===
Coconut trees abound in the Pacific&#x27;s tropical islands. Copra, the meat of the coconut, yields 1 liter of coconut oil for every 6 to 10 coconuts. As of 2007 power authorities, private companies, and entrepreneurs on the islands had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators, and ships. In 2009, a 57 kW solar power plant was installed, the largest in the Pacific at the time, including New Zealand. It is estimated that 330 kW of solar and 450 kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy self-sufficient. Marshalls Energy Company (MEC), a government entity, provides the islands with electricity. In 2008, two 100-Wp solar home systems were installed on 420 homes on Ailinglaplap Atoll, sufficient for limited electricity use.

==Education==

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) finds that the Marshall Islands are fulfilling only 66.1% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country&#x27;s level of income. HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration the Marshall Islands&#x27; income level, the nation is achieving 65.5% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education and 66.6% for secondary education.

The Ministry of Education is the education agency of the islands. Marshall Islands Public School System operates the state schools in the Marshall Islands.

In the 1994–1995 school year the country had 103 elementary schools and 13 secondary schools. There were 27 private elementary schools and one private high school. Christian groups operated most of the private schools.

Historically the Marshallese population was taught in English first with Marshallese instruction coming later, but this was reversed in the 1990s to keep the islands&#x27; cultural heritage and so children could write in Marshallese. Now English language instruction begins in grade 3. Christine McMurray and Roy Smith wrote in &quot;Diseases of Globalization: Socioeconomic Transition and Health&quot; that this could potentially weaken the children&#x27;s English skills.

There are two tertiary institutions operating in the Marshall Islands, the College of the Marshall Islands and the University of the South Pacific.

==Transportation==

The Marshall Islands are served by the Marshall Islands International Airport in Majuro, the Bucholz Army Airfield in Kwajalein, and other small airports and airstrips.

Airlines include United Airlines, Nauru Airlines, Air Marshall Islands, and Asia Pacific Airlines.

==Media and communications==

The Marshall Islands have several AM and FM radio stations. AM stations are 1098 5 kW V7AB Majuro (Radio Marshalls, national coverage) and 1224 AFN Kwajalein (both public radio) as well as 1557 Micronesia Heatwave. The FM stations are 97.9 V7AD Majuro, V7AA 96.3 FM Uliga and 104.1 V7AA Majuro (Baptist religious). BBC World is broadcast on 98.5 FM Majuro. The most recent station is Power 103.5 which started broadcasting in 2016.

AFRTS stations include 99.9 AFN Kwajalein (country), 101.1 AFN (adult rock) and 102.1 AFN (hot AC).

There is one broadcast television station, MBC-TV operated by the state. Cable TV is available. On cable TV, most programs are shown two weeks later than in North America but news in real time can be viewed on CNN, CNBC and BBC. American Forces Radio and Television also provides TV service to Kwajalein Atoll.

The Marshall Islands National Telecommunications Authority (NTA) provides telephone, cable TV (MHTV), FAX, cellular and Internet services. The Authority is a private corporation with significant ownership by the national government.

===Newspapers===
&quot;Loan Ran Kein&quot;, a Marshallese language paper, was published from 1953 to 1954. The current national newspaper is a bilingual (Marshallese and English) weekly, &quot;The Marshall Islands Journal&quot;. It has been published since 1980.

<text>The Marshall Islands consist of two archipelagic island chains of 30 atolls and 1,152 islands, which form two parallel groups—the &quot;Ratak&quot; (sunrise) chain and the &quot;Ralik&quot; (sunset) chain. The Marshalls are located in the North Pacific Ocean and share maritime boundaries with Micronesia and Kiribati. Two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s population lives in the capital of Majuro and the settlement of Ebeye. The outer islands are sparsely populated due to lack of employment opportunities and economic development.

== Statistics ==
The country is located about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Papua New Guinea. The archipelago includes the atolls of Bikini, Enewetak, Kwajalein, Majuro, Rongelap, and Utirik.

The total area of the islands is equal to the size of the City of Washington, DC. The largest atoll with a land area of is Kwajalein. The terrain consists of low coral limestone and sand islands. Natural resources include coconut products, marine products, and deep seabed minerals. Current environmental issues are inadequate supplies of potable water; pollution of Majuro lagoon from household waste and discharges from fishing vessels.

Bikini and Enewetak are former US nuclear test sites; Kwajalein, the famous World War II battleground, is now used as a US missile test range; the island city of Ebeye is the second largest settlement in the Marshall Islands, after the capital of Majuro, and one of the most densely populated locations in the Pacific.
== Climate ==
Tropical; hot and humid with a Koeppen-Geiger classification of &quot;Af&quot;. The wet season lasts from May to November and the islands border the typhoon belt. Typhoons do pose an infrequent threat from July to mid November.

Due to their low elevation, the Marshall Islands are threatened by the potential effects of sea level rise. According to the President of Nauru, the Marshall Islands are the most endangered nation on Earth due to flooding from climate change.

A study by the University of Plymouth found that the tides move sediment to create higher elevation, which may keep the islands habitable.

===Climate change===

Climate change is a serious threat to the Marshall Islands, with typhoons becoming stronger and sea levels rising. The sea around Pacific islands has risen 7mm a year since 1993, which is more than twice the rate of the worldwide average. In Kwajalein, there is a high risk of permanent flooding; when sea level rise to 1 meter, 37% of buildings will be permanently flooded in that scenario. In Ebeye, the risk of sea level rise is even higher, with 50% of buildings being permanently flooded in the same scenario. With 1 meter sea level rise parts of the Majuro atoll will be permanently flooded and other parts are having a high risk of flooding especially the eastern part of the atoll would be significantly at risk. With 2 meter sea level rise all the buildings of Majuro will be permanently flooded or would be at a high risk to be flooded.

The per capita emissions were 2.56t in 2020. The government of Marshall Islands pledged to be net zero in 2050, with a decrease of 32% decrease of GHGs in 2025, 45% decrease in 2030 and a 58% decrease in 2035 all compared to 2010 levels.

== Extreme points ==
This is a list of the extreme points of the Marshall Islands, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – Bokak Atoll (Taongi), Ratak Chain*
* Easternmost point – Knox Atoll, Ratak Chain
* Southernmost point – Ebon Atoll, Ralik Chain
* Westernmost point - Ujelang Atoll, Ralik Chain
* &quot;Note: the government of the Marshall Islands claims Wake Island, currently under US administration. If this is considered part of the Marshall Islands, then Toki Point on Peale Island, Wake Island is the northernmost point of the Marshall Islands&quot;

<text>The [[demographics]] of the [[Marshall Islands]] include data such as population density, ethnicity, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

Historical population figures for the Marshall Islands are unknown. In 1862, the population of the islands was estimated at 10,000. In 1960, the population of the Islands was approximately 15,000. The 2021 census counted 42,418 residents, 23,156 of whom (approximately 54.6%) lived on Majuro. 77.7% of the population lived in an urban setting on Majuro or Ebeye, the country&#x27;s secondary urban center. The Marshallese census figures exclude Marshall Islanders who have relocated elsewhere; the Compact of Free Association allows them to freely relocate to the United States and obtain work there. Approximately 4,300 Marshall Islands natives relocated to Springdale, Arkansas in the United States; this figure represents the largest population concentration of Marshall Islands natives outside their island home.

Most residents of the Marshall Islands are Marshallese. Marshallese people are of Micronesian origin and are believed to have migrated from Asia to the Marshall Islands several thousand years ago. A minority of the Marshallese have Asian and European ancestry such as Japanese and German. A Majority have Polynesian and Melanesian ancestry. About one-half of the nation&#x27;s population lives in Majuro and Ebeye Atolls.

The official languages of the Marshall Islands are English and Marshallese. Both languages are widely spoken.

<doc id="19157" wikidata="Q471729" url="?curid=19157" title="Mass deacidification">
<text>Mass deacidification is a term used in library and information science as one possible measure against the degradation of paper in old books, the so-called &quot;slow fires&quot;. The goal of the process is to increase the pH of acidic paper. Although acid-free paper has become more common, a large body of acidic paper still exists in books made after the 1850s; this is because of its cheaper and simpler production methods. Acidic paper, especially when exposed to light, air pollution, or high relative humidity, yellows and becomes brittle over time. During mass deacidification an alkaline agent is deposited in the paper to neutralize existing acid and prevent further decay. Mass deacidification is intended for objects on acidic paper that will be lost if no action is performed.

== History of research and process development ==
Mass deacidification—along with microfilm and lamination—was developed during the early and mid-20th century as a response to the chemical process of hydrolysis by which the fibers that constitute paper, providing its structure and strength, have their bonds broken, resulting in paper that becomes increasingly brittle over time. Environmental pollutants can react with paper to form acids that promote oxidation, creating more acid as a by-product, which results in a positive feedback loop of autocatalytic destruction. Supported in part by grants from the Council on Library Resources, William J. Barrow conducted research into paper decay and found that no more than three percent of books published between 1900 and 1949 would survive more than fifty years. In response to this, a Standing Committee on the Preservation of Research Library Materials was formed by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in 1960.

Barrow also invented an aqueous process to neutralize acid in paper while depositing an alkaline buffer that would slow the rate of decay. In addition to Barrow&#x27;s original method, both non-aqueous—employing organic solvents—and vaporous—the Library of Congress&#x27; DEZ (diethyl zinc) treatment—methods of achieving the same results have been researched in an attempt to reduce time, labor, and cost requirements.

One technique proposed is to place books in an evacuated chamber, then introduce diethylzinc (DEZ). In theory, the diethylzinc would react with acidic residues in the paper, leaving an alkaline residue that would protect the paper against further degradation. In practice, the heating required to remove trace water from the books before reaction (DEZ reacts violently with water) caused an accelerated degradation of the paper, a series of chemical reactions between DEZ and other components of the book (glues, bindings), caused further damage, and produced unpleasant aromas. In the 1980s, a pilot plant for mass deacidification, using this process, was constructed by NASA and was tested on books provided by the Library of Congress. In 1986 it was discovered that the DEZ had not been removed in one of the deacidification runs and pooled in the bottom of the chamber, possibly remaining within the plumbing. DEZ is violently flammable when it comes in contact with either oxygen or water vapor, so the vacuum chamber could not be opened to remove the books within. Eventually, explosives were used to rupture the suspect plumbing; suspicions of the presence of residual DEZ were confirmed by the subsequent fire that destroyed the plant. In his book &quot;Double Fold&quot;, Nicholson Baker discusses the failure of the NASA program at great length.

The chemical company AkzoNobel made later attempts at refining the process. The risks of fire and explosions were reduced by a better process design, however, damage and odors remained a problem. In the end, AkzoNobel determined the process was not a viable commercial proposition and shut down their research at the end of 1994.

== Goals ==
These are the results that the Library of Congress expected of an ideal mass deacidification treatment in 1994:
*neutralize acidic paper and add an alkaline reserve.
*produce a pH value between 6.8 and 10.4 that is evenly distributed throughout the book.
*should not cause any damage to adhesives, inks, or dyes.
*should not cause an odor or any change in the color of the paper.
*should not cause loss of pliancy or mechanical strength.

Faculty members of the Slovak University of Technology added these further requirements:
*the chemicals used have to be safe.
*the process has to be able to be applied to any kind of paper.
*the process can not cause swelling or warping of the paper.

== Effects ==
All of the processes imparted an adequately high pH in studies conducted by the European Commission on Preservation and Access, the Library of Congress, and a team of scientists from the Centre de Recherches sur la Conservation des Documents Graphiques in the early and mid-nineties. BookKeeper produced a pH of 9–10. CSC Book Saver yielded a pH of 8.78–10.5. Wei T&#x27;o gives 7.5 to 10.4, and Papersave gives a pH of 7.5–9.

The same studies also found that the processes had adverse cosmetic side effects. BookKeeper left &quot;a palpable residue&quot;, clamp marks on the covers, and caused some of the colored inks to rub off. CSC Book Saver left a &quot;white powdery deposit&quot; on books. Papersave caused &quot;discoloration, white deposit, Newton&#x27;s rings, bleeding of inks and dyes, odor and different &#x27;feel&#x27; of the paper.&quot; Wei T&#x27;o caused &quot;odor, white residues, rings, cockling, (yellow) discolorations and adhesive bleeding.&quot;

Conservators from the British Library acknowledge that the existing mass deacidification processes are still being developed and further research needs to be conducted on their chemical and mechanical effects.

== Services ==
Several commercial deacidification techniques are on the market :
*The BookKeeper process is a non-aqueous, liquid phase process that uses magnesium oxide. BookKeeper is available through Preservation Technologies, L.P. with plants in the U.S., Spain, Japan, Poland, The Netherlands, South Africa, Qatar. Another plant is available through Fratielivi in Italy.
*The CSC Book Saver uses carbonated magnesium propylate for deacidification. The CSC Book Saver is available in Europe through Conservación de Sustratos Celulósicos S.L. (CSC) (Barcelona, Spain).
*The Papersave process was developed by Battelle Ingenieurtechnik GmbH and is, therefore, sometimes referred to as &quot;the Battelle Process&quot;. The process uses magnesium titanium alkoxide. The Papersave process is available in Europe through Nitrochemie Wimmis (Wimmis, Switzerland) under the name of Papersave Swiss and the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung (Leipzig, Germany).
*The Wei T&#x27;o process uses methoxy magnesium methyl carbonate, or isopropoxy magnesium isopropyl carbonate, and new products are coming out in 2008. Wei T&#x27;o is less commonly used for mass deacidification treatment than for single item deacidification. Wei T&#x27;o products are available through Wei T&#x27;o Associates Inc. (Matteson, US).

BookKeeper, CSC Booksaver, Papersave, and Wei T&#x27;o are also available as hand-held sprays.

== Adoption and costs ==
While deacidification has been adopted by major research libraries such as the Library of Congress and the New York Public Library, it is not clear whether many archives, particularly those in the United States, have followed suit. Some European national archives have tested deacidification techniques. The United States&#x27; National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which pioneered an aqueous technique that improved upon Barrow&#x27;s, chose to invest its preservation dollars elsewhere. In 2000, the Chief of the NARA Document Conservation Laboratory defended the lack of a mass deacidification program by pointing to differences between library and archival collections. For example, noting that many of the papers coming to NARA were of a higher quality than those in library collections; that the Archives does not receive records from federal government agencies until they are at least 30 years old, by which time acidic paper will have already been irrevocably weakened, and that limited resources might best be applied elsewhere, such as climate control. Under the Archives&#x27; Twenty-Year Preservation Plan, emphasis was placed on achieving the &quot;maximum benefit for the greatest number of records.&quot;

Though now dated, several sources estimate the costs and suitability of deacidification treatment. Studies conducted by the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center and the General State Archive of the Netherlands found the DEZ method might be particularly applicable to archival materials. It was estimated that deacidification costs, excluding transportation and handling, during the early 1990s was $5–10 per volume. During 1995–1997, the Library of Congress received $2 million in appropriations to deacidify 72,000 books using the Bookkeeper commercial method and evaluate alternative methods. The actual cost per book was $11.70. Finally, a 2003 cost comparison with reformatting options per volume yielded $125 for microfilming, $50 for scanning and minimal indexing and, based on a New York Public Library project, $16.20 for deacidification. However, already in 2004 Google Books was able to scan for only $10-$20 per book.

As of 2022, there were five mass deacidification plants in the world.

<text>The mile, sometimes the international mile or statute mile to distinguish it from other miles, is a British imperial unit and United States customary unit of length; both are based on the older English unit of length equal to 5,280 English feet, or 1,760 yards. The statute mile was standardised between the Commonwealth of Nations and the United States by an international agreement in 1959, when it was formally redefined with respect to SI units as exactly .

With qualifiers, &quot;mile&quot; is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile (roughly ), such as the nautical mile (now exactly), the Italian mile (roughly ), and the Chinese mile (now exactly). The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 pedēs (&quot;feet&quot;), but the greater importance of furlongs in the Elizabethan-era England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to or in 1593. This form of the mile then spread across the British Empire, some successor states of which continue to employ the mile. The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes, but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile continues to see some use, although it was officially phased out in 2022. While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units (SI), the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories or have close historical ties with the UK or US.

==Name ==
The modern English word &quot;mile&quot; derives from Middle English &#x27; and Old English &#x27;, which was cognate with all other Germanic terms for &quot;miles&quot;. These derived from the nominal ellipsis form of &#x27; &#x27;mile&#x27; or &#x27; &#x27;miles&#x27;, the Roman mile of one thousand paces.

The present international mile is usually what is understood by the unqualified term &quot;mile&quot;. When this distance needs to be distinguished from the nautical mile, the international mile may also be described as a land mile or statute mile. In British English, &quot;statute mile&quot; may refer to the present international mile or to any other form of English mile since the 1593 Act of Parliament, which set it as a distance of . Under American law, however, &quot;statute mile&quot; refers to the US survey mile. Foreign and historical units translated into English as &quot;miles&quot; usually employ a qualifier to describe the kind of mile being used but this may be omitted if it is obvious from the context, such as a discussion of the 2nd-century Antonine Itinerary describing its distances in terms of &quot;miles&quot; rather than &quot;Roman miles&quot;.

===Abbreviation===
The mile has been variously abbreviated in English—with and without a trailing period—as &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;ml&quot;, and &quot;m&quot;. The American National Institute of Standards and Technology now uses and recommends &quot;mi&quot; to avoid confusion with the SI metre (m) and millilitre (ml). However, derived units such as miles per hour or miles per gallon continue to be abbreviated as &quot;mph&quot; and &quot;mpg&quot; rather than &quot;mi/h&quot; and &quot;mi/gal&quot;. In the United Kingdom, road signs use &quot;m&quot; as the abbreviation for mile though height and width restrictions also use &quot;m&quot; as the symbol for the metre, which may be displayed alongside feet and inches. The BBC style holds that &quot;there is no acceptable abbreviation for &#x27;miles and so it should be spelled out when used in describing areas.

==Historical==

===Roman===
The Roman mile (&#x27;,  &quot;thousand paces&quot;;  m.p.; also &#x27; and &quot;&quot;) consisted of a thousand paces as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times. When Roman legionaries were well-fed and harshly driven in good weather, they thus created longer miles. The distance was indirectly standardised by Agrippa&#x27;s establishment of a standard Roman foot (Agrippa&#x27;s own) in 29 BC, and the definition of a pace as 5 feet. An Imperial Roman mile thus denoted 5,000 Roman feet. Surveyors and specialised equipment such as the decempeda and dioptra then spread its use.

In modern times, Agrippa&#x27;s Imperial Roman mile was empirically estimated to have been about in length, slightly less than the of the modern international mile.

In Hellenic areas of the Empire, the Roman mile (, ) was used beside the native Greek units as equivalent to 8 stadia of 600 Greek feet. The continued to be used as a Byzantine unit and was also used as the name of the zero mile marker for the Byzantine Empire, the Milion, located at the head of the Mese near Hagia Sophia.

The Roman mile spread throughout Europe, with its local variations giving rise to the different units. Also arising from the Roman mile is the milestone. All roads radiated out from the Roman Forum throughout the Empire – 50,000 (Roman) miles of stone-paved roads. At every mile was placed a shaped stone. Originally, these were obelisks made from granite, marble, or whatever local stone was available. On these was carved a Roman numeral, indicating the number of miles from the centre of Rome – the Forum. Hence, one can know how far one is from Rome.

===Italian===
The Italian mile (&#x27;,  &#x27;) was traditionally considered a direct continuation of the Roman mile, equal to 1000 paces, although its actual value over time or between regions could vary greatly. It was often used in international contexts from the Middle Ages into the 17th century and is thus also known as the &quot;geographical mile&quot;, although the geographical mile is now a separate standard unit.

===Arabic===
The Arabic mile (, ) was not the common Arabic unit of length; instead, Arabs and Persians traditionally used the longer parasang or &quot;Arabic league&quot;. The Arabic mile was, however, used by medieval geographers and scientists and constituted a kind of precursor to the nautical or geographical mile. It extended the Roman mile to fit an astronomical approximation of 1 arcminute of latitude measured directly north-and-south along a meridian. Although the precise value of the approximation remains disputed, it was somewhere between 1.8 and 2.0 km.

===English===
The &quot;old English mile&quot; of the medieval and early modern periods varied but seems to have measured about 1.3 international miles (2.1 km). The old English mile varied over time and location within England. The old English mile has also been defined as 79,200 or 79,320 inches (1.25 or 1.2519 statute miles). The English long continued the Roman computations of the mile as 5,000 feet, 1,000 paces, or 8 longer divisions, which they equated with their &quot;furrow&#x27;s length&quot; or furlong.

The origins of English units are &quot;extremely vague and uncertain&quot;, but seem to have been a combination of the Roman system with native British and Germanic systems both derived from multiples of the barleycorn. Probably by the reign of Edgar in the 10th century, the nominal prototype physical standard of English length was an arm-length iron bar (a yardstick) held by the king at Winchester; the foot was then one-third of its length. Henry I was said to have made a new standard in 1101 based on his own arm. Following the issuance of Magna Carta in 1215, the barons of Parliament directed John and his son to keep the king&#x27;s standard measure (&quot;&quot;) and weight at the Exchequer, which thereafter verified local standards until its abolition in the 19th century. New brass standards are known to have been constructed under Henry VII and Elizabeth I.

Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Customs of London&quot; recorded a mile shorter than previous ones, coming to 0.947 international miles (5,000 feet) or 1.524 km.

====Statute====
The English statute mile was established by a Weights and Measures Act of Parliament in 1593 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The act on the Composition of Yards and Perches had shortened the length of the foot and its associated measures, causing the two methods of determining the mile to diverge. Owing to the importance of the surveyor&#x27;s rod in deeds and surveying undertaken under Henry VIII, decreasing the length of the rod by would have amounted to a significant tax increase. Parliament instead opted to maintain the mile of 8 furlongs (which were derived from the rod) and to increase the number of feet per mile from the old Roman value. The applicable passage of the statute reads: &quot;A Mile shall contain eight Furlongs, every Furlong forty Poles, and every Pole shall contain sixteen Foot and half.&quot; The statute mile therefore contained 5,280 feet or 1,760 yards. The distance was not uniformly adopted. Robert Morden had multiple scales on his 17th-century maps which included continuing local values: his map of Hampshire, for example, bore two different &quot;miles&quot; with a ratio of and his map of Dorset had three scales with a ratio of . In both cases, the traditional local units remained longer than the statute mile. The English statute mile was superseded in 1959 by the international mile by international agreement.

===Welsh===
The Welsh mile (&#x27; or &#x27;) was 3 statute miles and 1,470 yards long (6.17 km). It comprised 9,000 paces (&#x27;), each of 3 Welsh feet (&#x27;) of 9 inches (&quot;&quot;). (The Welsh inch is usually reckoned as equivalent to the English inch.) Along with other Welsh units, it was said to have been codified under Dyfnwal the Bald and Silent and retained unchanged by Hywel the Good. Along with other Welsh units, it was discontinued following the conquest of Wales by Edward I of England in the 13th century.

===Scots===
The Scots mile was longer than the English mile, as mentioned by Robert Burns in the first verse of his poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;. It comprised 8 (Scots) furlongs divided into 320 falls or faws (Scots rods). It varied from place to place but the most accepted equivalencies are 1,976 Imperial yards (1.123 statute miles or 1.81 km).
It was legally abolished three times: first by a 1685 act of the Scottish Parliament, again by the 1707 Treaty of Union with England, and finally by the Weights and Measures Act 1824. It had continued in use as a customary unit through the 18th century but had become obsolete by its final abolition.

===Irish===
The Irish mile (&#x27; or &#x27;) measured 2,240 yards: approximately 1.27 statute miles or 2.048 kilometres. It was used in Ireland from the 16th century plantations until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on &quot;English measure&quot; but used a linear perch measuring as opposed to the English rod of .

===Dutch===
The Dutch mile () has had different definitions throughout history. One of the older definitions was 5,600 ells. But the length of an ell was not standardised, so that the length of a mile could range between 3,280 m and 4,280 m. In the sixteenth century, the Dutch had three different miles: small (), medium (), and large (). The Dutch mile had the historical definition of one hour&#x27;s walking (), which was defined as 24 stadia, 3000 paces, or 15,000 Amsterdam or Rhineland feet (respectively 4,250 m or 4,710 m). The common Dutch mile was 32 stadia, 4,000 paces, or 20,000 feet (5,660 m or 6,280 m). The large mile was defined as 5000 paces. The common Dutch mile was preferred by mariners, equating with 15 to one degree of latitude or one degree of longitude on the equator. This was originally based upon Ptolemy&#x27;s underestimate of the Earth&#x27;s circumference. The ratio of 15 Dutch miles to a degree remained fixed while the length of the mile was changed as with improved calculations of the circumference of the Earth. In 1617, Willebrord Snellius calculated a degree of the circumference of the Earth at 28,500 (within 3.5% of the actual value), which resulted in a Dutch mile of 1900 rods. By the mid-seventeenth century, map scales assigned 2000 rods to the common Dutch mile, which equalled around 7,535 m (reducing the discrepancy with latitude measurement to less than 2%). The metric system was introduced in the Netherlands in 1816, and the metric mile became a synonym for the kilometre, being exactly 1,000 m. Since 1870, the term was replaced by the equivalent . Today, the word is no longer used, except as part of certain proverbs and compound terms like (&quot;miles away&quot;).

===German===
The German mile () was 24,000 German feet. The standardised Austrian mile used in southern Germany and the Austrian Empire was 7.586 km; the Prussian mile used in northern Germany was 7.5325 km. Following its standardisation by Ole Rømer in the late 17th century, the Danish mile (&quot;) was precisely equal to the Prussian mile and likewise divided into 24,000 feet. These were sometimes treated as equivalent to 7.5 km. Earlier values had varied: the , for instance, had been 11.13 km. The Germans also used a longer version of the geographical mile.

===Breslau===

The Breslau mile, used in Breslau, and from 1630 officially in all of Silesia, equal to 11,250 ells, or about 6,700 meters. The mile equaled the distance from the Piaskowa Gate all the way to Psie Pole (Hundsfeld). By rolling a circle with a radius of 5 ells through Piaskowa Island, Ostrów Tumski and suburban tracts, passing eight bridges on the way, the standard Breslau mile was determined.

===Saxon===
The Saxon post mile (&#x27; or &#x27;, introduced on occasion of a survey of the Saxon roads in the 1700s, corresponded to 2,000 Dresden rods, equivalent to 9.062 kilometres.

===Hungarian===

The Hungarian mile (&#x27; or &#x27;) varied from 8.3790 km to 8.9374 km before being standardised as 8.3536 km.

===Portuguese===

The Portuguese mile (&quot;) used in Portugal and Brazil was 2.0873 km prior to metrication.

===Russian===

The Russian mile ( or , ) was 7.468 km, divided into 7 versts.

===Croatian===

 The Croatian mile (&#x27;), first devised by the Jesuit Stjepan Glavač on a 1673 map, is the length of an arc of the equator subtended by ° or 11.13 km exactly. The previous Croatian mile, now known as the &quot;ban mile&quot; (&#x27;), had been the Austrian mile given above.

===Ottoman===
The Ottoman mile was 1,894.35 m, which was equal to 5,000 Ottoman foot. After 1933, the Ottoman mile was replaced with the modern Turkish mile (1,853.181 m).

===Japanese===
The CJK Compatibility Unicode block contains square-format versions of Japanese names for measurement units as written in katakana script.
Among them, there is , after .

==International==
The international mile is precisely equal to (or  km as a fraction). It was established as part of the 1959 international yard and pound agreement reached by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, which resolved small but measurable differences that had arisen from separate physical standards each country had maintained for the yard. As with the earlier statute mile, it continues to comprise 1,760 yards or 5,280 feet.

The old Imperial value of the yard was used in converting measurements to metric values in India in a 1976 Act of the Indian Parliament. However, the current National Topographic Database of the Survey of India is based on the metric WGS-84 datum, which is also used by the Global Positioning System.

The difference from the previous standards was 2 ppm, or about 3.2 millimetres ( inch) per mile. The US standard was slightly longer and the old Imperial standards had been slightly shorter than the international mile. When the international mile was introduced in English-speaking countries, the basic geodetic datum in America was the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27). This had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of 1893, with 1 foot =  (≈0.304800609601) metres and the definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the &quot;US survey foot&quot; to distinguish it from the international foot. Thus a survey mile =  × 5280 (≈1609.347218694) metres. An international mile = 1609.344 / ( × 5280) (=0.999998) survey miles.

The exact length of the land mile varied slightly among English-speaking countries until the international yard and pound agreement in 1959 established the yard as exactly 0.9144 metres, giving a mile of exactly 1,609.344 metres. The US adopted this international mile for most purposes, but retained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the &quot;U. S. survey mile&quot;. In the United States, &quot;statute mile&quot; normally refers to the survey mile, about 3.219 mm ( inch) longer than the international mile (the international mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the US survey mile).

While many countries abandoned the mile when switching to the metric system, the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom and the United States. It is also used in a number of territories with less than a million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US: American Samoa, Bahamas, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Falkland Islands, Grenada, Guam, The N. Mariana Islands, Samoa, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; The Grenadines, St. Helena, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, and the US Virgin Islands.
The mile is even encountered in Canada, though this is predominantly in rail transport and horse racing, as the roadways have been metricated since 1977. Ireland gradually replaced miles with kilometres, including in speed measurements; the process was completed in 2005.

==US survey ==

The US survey mile is 5,280 US survey feet, or 1,609.347 metres and 0.30480061 metres respectively. Both are very slightly longer than the international mile and international foot. In the United States, the term &quot;statute mile&quot; formally refers to the survey mile, but for most purposes, the difference of less than between the survey mile and the international mile (1609.344 metres exactly) is insignificant—one international mile is US survey miles—so &quot;statute mile&quot; can be used for either. But in some cases, such as in the US State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles, the accumulated difference can be significant, so it is important to note that the reference is to the US survey mile.

The United States redefined its yard in 1893, and this resulted in US and Imperial measures of distance having very slightly different lengths.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which replaced the NAD27, is defined in metres. State Plane Coordinate Systems were then updated, but the National Geodetic Survey left individual states to decide which (if any) definition of the foot they would use. All State Plane Coordinate Systems are defined in metres, and 42 of the 50 states only use the metre-based State Plane Coordinate Systems. However, eight states also have State Plane Coordinate Systems defined in feet, seven of them in US survey feet and one in international feet.

State legislation in the US is important for determining which conversion factor from the metric datum is to be used for land surveying and real estate transactions, even though the difference (2 ppm) is hardly significant, given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures be based on the US survey foot, eight have legislated that they be based on the international foot, and eighteen have not specified which conversion factor to use.

SPCS 83 legislation refers to state legislation that has been passed or updated using the newer 1983 NAD data. Most states have done so. Two states, Alaska and Missouri, and two jurisdictions, Guam and Puerto Rico, do not specify which foot to use. Two states, Alabama and Hawaii, and four jurisdictions, Washington, DC, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa and Northern Mariana Islands, do not have SPCS 83 legislation.

In October 2019, US National Geodetic Survey and National Institute of Standards and Technology announced their joint intent to retire the US survey foot and US survey mile, as permitted by their 1959 decision, with effect on January 1, 2023.

==Nautical==

The &quot;nautical mile&quot; was originally defined as one minute of arc along a meridian of the Earth. Navigators use dividers to step off the distance between two points on the navigational chart, then place the open dividers against the minutes-of-latitude scale at the edge of the chart, and read off the distance in nautical miles. The Earth is not perfectly spherical but an oblate spheroid, so the length of a minute of latitude increases by 1% from the equator to the poles, as seen for example in the WGS84 ellipsoid, with at the equator, at the poles and average .

Since 1929 the international nautical mile is defined by the First International Extraordinary Hydrographic Conference in Monaco as exactly 1,852 metres (which is or ). In the United States, the nautical mile was defined in the 19th century as , whereas in the United Kingdom, the &quot;Admiralty nautical mile&quot; was defined as and was about one minute of latitude in the latitudes of the south of the UK. Other nations had different definitions of the nautical mile.

===Related units===
The nautical mile per hour is known as the knot. Nautical miles and knots are almost universally used for aeronautical and maritime navigation, because of their relationship with degrees and minutes of latitude and the convenience of using the latitude scale on a map for distance measuring.

The data mile is used in radar-related subjects and is equal to 6,000 feet (1.8288 kilometres). The radar mile is a unit of time (in the same way that the light year is a unit of distance), equal to the time required for a radar pulse to travel a distance of two miles (one mile each way). Thus, the radar statute mile is 10.8 μs and the radar nautical mile is 12.4 μs.

==Geographical==
The geographical mile is based upon the length of a meridian of latitude. The German geographical mile () was previously ° of latitude (7.4127 km).

==Metric==
The informal term &quot;metric mile&quot; is used in some countries, in sports such as track and field athletics and speed skating, to denote a distance of . The 1500 meters is the premier middle distance running event in Olympic sports. In United States high-school competition, the term is sometimes used for a race of .

==Scandinavian==
The Scandinavian mile (&#x27;) remains in common use in Norway and Sweden, where it has meant precisely 10 km since metrication in 1889. It is used in informal situations and in measurements of fuel consumption, which are often given as litres per &#x27;. In formal situations (such as official road signs) only kilometres are given.

The Swedish mile was standardised as 36,000 Swedish feet or in 1649; before that it varied by province from about 6 to 14.485 km.

Before metrication, the Norwegian mile was .

The traditional Finnish &#x27; was translated as &#x27; and also set equal to 10 km during metrication in 1887, but is much less commonly used.

==Comparison table==
A comparison of the different lengths for a &quot;mile&quot;, in different countries and at different times in history, is given in the table below. Leagues are also included in this list because, in terms of length, they fall in between the short West European miles and the long North, Central and Eastern European miles.

==Idioms==
The mile is still used in a variety of idioms, even in English-speaking countries that have moved from the Imperial to the metric system (for example, Australia, Canada, or New Zealand). These idioms include:
* A &quot;&quot; is used colloquially to denote a very long distance.
* &quot;A miss is as good as a mile&quot; (failure by a narrow margin is no better than any other failure)
* &quot;Give him an inch and he&#x27;ll take a mile&quot; – a corruption of &quot;Give him an inch and he&#x27;ll take an ell&quot; (the person in question will become greedy if shown generosity)
* &quot;Missed by a mile&quot; (missed by a wide margin)
* &quot;Go a mile a minute&quot; (move very quickly)
* &quot;Talk a mile a minute&quot; (speak at a rapid rate)
* &quot;To go the extra mile&quot; (to put in extra effort)
* &quot;Miles away&quot; (lost in thought, or daydreaming)
* &quot;Milestone&quot; (an event indicating significant progress)
* &quot;Glasgow&#x27;s miles better&quot;, a touristic campaign.

<doc id="19160" wikidata="Q1777591" url="?curid=19160" title="Spam (Monty Python sketch)">
<text>&quot;Spam&quot; is a Monty Python sketch, first televised in 1970 (series 2, episode 12, &quot;Spam&quot;) and written by Terry Jones and Michael Palin. In the sketch, two customers are lowered by wires into a greasy spoon café and try to order a breakfast from a menu that includes Spam in almost every dish, much to the consternation of one of the customers. As the waitress recites the Spam-filled menu, a group of Viking patrons drown out all conversations with a song, repeating &quot;Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam… Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!&quot;.

The excessive amount of Spam was probably a reference to the ubiquity of it and other imported canned meat products in the United Kingdom after World War II (a period of rationing in the UK) as the country struggled to rebuild its agricultural base. Thanks to its wartime ubiquity, the British public had grown tired of it.

The televised sketch and several subsequent performances feature Terry Jones as the waitress, Eric Idle as Mr. Bun and Graham Chapman as Mrs. Bun, who does not like Spam. The original sketch also featured John Cleese as The Hungarian and Palin as a historian, but this part was left out of the audio version of the sketch recorded for the team&#x27;s second album &quot;Another Monty Python Record&quot; (1971). A year later this track was released as the Pythons&#x27; first 7&quot; single.

The use of the term &quot;spam&quot; for unsolicited electronic communications is derived from this sketch.

==Plot==

The three-and-a-half-minute sketch is set in the fictional Green Midget Cafe in Bromley. An argument develops between the waitress, who recites a menu in which nearly every dish contains Spam, and Mrs. Bun, who does not like Spam. She asks for a dish without Spam, much to the amazement of her Spam-loving husband. The waitress responds to this request with disgust. Mr. Bun offers to take her Spam instead, and asks for a dish containing a lot of Spam and baked beans. The waitress says the beans are not available; when Mr. Bun asks for a substitution of Spam, the waitress begins reading out the new dish&#x27;s name.

At several points, a group of Vikings in the restaurant interrupt conversations by loudly singing about Spam. The irate waitress orders them to shut up, but they resume singing more loudly. A Hungarian tourist comes to the counter, trying to order by using a wholly inaccurate Hungarian/English phrasebook (a reference to a previous sketch). He is rapidly escorted away by a police constable.

The sketch abruptly cuts to a historian in a television studio talking about the origin of the Vikings in the café. As he goes on, he begins to increasingly insert the word &quot;Spam&quot; into every sentence, and the backdrop is raised to reveal the restaurant set behind. The historian joins the Vikings in their song, and Mr. and Mrs. Bun are lifted by wires out of the scene while the singing continues. In the original televised performance, the closing credits (which also have &quot;Spam&quot; inserted in various points among others) begin to scroll with the singing still audible in the background.

==Production notes==
The sketch premiered on 15 December 1970 as the final sketch of the 25th show of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, and the end credits for the episode were changed so every member of the crew has either Spam or some other food item from the menu added to their names. (Spam Terry Jones, Michael Spam Palin, John Spam John Spam John Spam Cleese, Graham Spam Spam Spam Chapman, Eric Spam Egg and Chips Idle, Terry Spam Sausage Spam Egg Spam Gilliam, etc.) The &quot;Spam&quot; sketch became immensely popular, and was ranked the fifth favourite Python sketch in a poll. The word &quot;Spam&quot; is uttered at least 132 times. The Vikings&#x27; Spam song is a parody of &quot;The Viking Song&quot; by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.

This sketch has also been featured in several Monty Python videos including &quot;Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python&quot;. A lead sheet for the song appears in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot;. The DVD release of the episode contains a deliberate subtitling error. When the Hungarian tries to order food, his words are &quot;My lower intestine is full of Spam, Egg, Spam, Bacon, Spam, Tomatoes, Spam.&quot; Yet the subtitles read &quot;Your intestine is full of Sperm.&quot; This is a continuation of the &quot;Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook&quot; sketch from the same episode.

The audio version of the sketch excludes the Hungarian and historian, and instead has the Vikings reaching a dramatic crescendo. The waitress, resigned to these disruptions, mutters &quot;Bloody Vikings!&quot; In the 2014 version of the sketch performed in &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, one of the Vikings replies &quot;Racist bastard!&quot; before leading the group into an operatic chorus that includes a sampling of &quot;Finland&quot; from the team&#x27;s &quot;Contractual Obligation Album&quot;.

Spam was a popular food during World War II in the UK. Although rationed, it was generally easily available and not subject to supply shortages, as were other meats. Thanks to its wartime ubiquity, the British public eventually tired of it.

==Impact==
The phenomenon, some years later, of marketers drowning out discourse by flooding Usenet newsgroups and individuals&#x27; email with junk mail advertising messages was named spamming, due to some early internet users that flooded forums with the word &quot;spam&quot; recounting the repetitive and unwanted presence of spam in the sketch. This phenomenon has been reported in court decisions handed down in lawsuits against spammers – see, for example, &quot;CompuServe Inc. v. Cyber Promotions, Inc.&quot;, 962 F.Supp. 1015, n. 1 (S.D.Ohio 1997). Furthermore, it has been referenced in an Electronic Frontier Foundation &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief to the Supreme Court of the United States in 2014. The term also is used to refer to mass marketing using junk phone calls or text messages, and has since entered video game culture as a term to refer to producing a large quantity of something, such as rocket-spamming or grenade-spamming.

The Python programming language, named after Monty Python, prefers to use spam, ham, and eggs as metasyntactic variables, instead of the traditional foo, bar and baz.

The Japanese anime series &quot;Girls und Panzer&quot; featured the special episode &quot;Survival War!&quot;, which referenced the &quot;Spam&quot; sketch, but the word &quot;spam&quot; was censored to avoid legal issue with the Pythons. This was reversed in the English dub.

==Hormel&#x27;s response==
Spam makers Hormel, while never happy with the use of the word &quot;spam&quot; for junk email, have been supportive of Monty Python and their sketch. Hormel issued a special tin of Spam for the Broadway premiere of Eric Idle&#x27;s musical &quot;Spamalot&quot; based on &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. The sketch is part of the company&#x27;s Spam Museum in Austin, Minnesota, United States, and also mentioned in Spam&#x27;s on-can advertisements for the product&#x27;s 70th anniversary in 2007 – although the date of the Python sketch was incorrectly stated to be 1971 instead of 1970.

In 2007 the company decided that such publicity was part of their corporate image, and sponsored a game where their product is strongly associated with Monty Python, featuring a product with &quot;Stinky French Garlic&quot; as part of the promotion of &quot;Spamalot&quot;. For the company&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 2012, they introduced Sir Can-A-Lot, a knight character, appearing on the product&#x27;s packaging with the phrase &quot;Glorious SPAM®!&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Dead Parrot Sketch&quot;, alternatively and originally known as the &quot;Pet Shop Sketch&quot; or &quot;Parrot Sketch&quot;, is a sketch from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; about a non-existent species of parrot, called a &quot;Norwegian Blue&quot;. A satire on poor customer service, it was written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman and initially performed in the show&#x27;s first series, in the eighth episode (&quot;Full Frontal Nudity&quot;, which first aired 7 December 1969).

The sketch portrays a conflict between disgruntled customer Mr Praline (played by Cleese) and a shopkeeper (Michael Palin), who argue whether or not a recently purchased parrot is dead.

Over the years, Cleese and Palin have performed many versions of the &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; sketch for television shows, record albums, and live performances. &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; was voted the top alternative comedy sketch in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll.

==Plot==
Mr. Praline (Cleese) enters the pet shop to register a complaint about the dead Norwegian Blue parrot (actually Spix&#x27;s macaw; parrots are not native to Norway) just as the shopkeeper (Palin) is preparing to close the establishment for lunch. Despite being told that the bird is deceased and that it had been nailed to its perch, the proprietor insists that it is &quot;pining for the fjords&quot; or simply &quot;stunned&quot;.

As the exasperated Praline attempts to wake up the parrot, the shopkeeper tries to make the bird move by hitting the cage, and Praline erupts into a rage after banging &quot;Polly Parrot&quot; on the counter. After listing several euphemisms for death (&quot;is no more&quot;, &quot;has ceased to be&quot;, &quot;bereft of life, it rests in peace&quot;, and &quot;is an ex-parrot&quot;) he is told to go to the pet shop run by the shopkeeper&#x27;s brother in Bolton, Lancashire for a refund. That proves difficult, as the proprietor of that store (who is really the first shopkeeper, save for a fake moustache) claims this is Ipswich, prompting Praline to return to the railway station, where the station attendant (Terry Jones) assures him that he is actually in Bolton after all.

Confronting the shopkeeper&#x27;s &quot;brother&quot; for lying, the shopkeeper claims he was playing a prank on Praline by sending him to Ipswich, which he claims was a palindrome for Bolton; Praline points out that the shopkeeper was wrong because a palindrome for Bolton would have been &quot;Notlob&quot; (i.e., it wouldn&#x27;t be spelled the same backwards). When the shopkeeper demands to know what he wants, Praline refuses to continue this conversation, saying that &quot;this is getting too silly&quot;. The no-nonsense Colonel (Graham Chapman) then bursts in to concur with him and orders the sketch stopped.

== Background ==
The &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; sketch was inspired by a &quot;Car Salesman&quot; sketch that Palin and Chapman had done in &quot;How to Irritate People&quot;. In it, Palin played a car salesman who repeatedly refused to admit that there was anything wrong with his customer&#x27;s (Chapman&#x27;s) car, even as it fell apart in front of him. That sketch was based on an actual incident between Palin and a car salesman. In &quot;Monty Python Live at Aspen&quot;, Palin said that this salesman &quot;had an excuse for everything&quot;. John Cleese said on the same show that he and Chapman &quot;believed that there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it&quot;. In early drafts of what would become the Dead Parrot Sketch, the frustrated customer was trying to return a faulty toaster to a shop. Chapman realised that it needed to be &quot;madder&quot;, and came up with the parrot idea.

==Variations of the sketch==

In the film &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; (1971), in which the parrot is a blue and gold macaw, the sketch ends with the shopkeeper explaining that he always wanted to be a lumberjack and, ignoring Mr Praline&#x27;s protests of that being irrelevant, begins singing &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;.

The &quot;Monty Python Live at Drury Lane&quot; album features a live version of the sketch, which is slightly different from the TV version. Praline&#x27;s rant about the deceased parrot includes &quot;He fucking snuffed it!&quot; Also, the sketch ends with the shopkeeper saying that he has a slug that does talk. Cleese, after a brief pause, says, &quot;Right, I&#x27;ll have that one, then!&quot; According to Michael Palin&#x27;s published diary, Palin changed his response in order to throw Cleese off. During this performance something occurs on stage that does not translate into audio, but causes the audience to break into hysterics upon Cleese&#x27;s follow-up line &quot;Now that&#x27;s what I call a dead parrot&quot;.

A live performance from the 1976 Amnesty International benefit show, &quot;A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)&quot;, has Palin cracking up while Cleese declares &quot;Pining for the fjords? What kind of talk is that?&quot; The audience cheers this bit of breaking character, but Palin quickly composes himself and Cleese declares &quot;Now, look! This is nothing to laugh at!&quot; before proceeding with the sketch. This version can be seen in the film &quot;Pleasure at Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;, albeit with the ending removed.

The 1976 &quot;Monty Python Live at City Center&quot; performance ended with the following punchline:
:&quot;Shopkeeper&quot;: (long, long pause) ... Do you want to come back to my place?
:&quot;Mr Praline&quot;: I thought you&#x27;d never ask.

In his appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Cleese appears as a pirate attempting to take over a spaceship during a &quot;Pigs in Space&quot; sketch. At the end of the sketch, he demands of the smart-mouthed talking parrot on his shoulder, &quot;Do you want to be an ex-parrot?&quot;

In 1980, the sketch was performed again during The Pythons&#x27; four-night stint at the Hollywood Bowl. However, it was one of the sketches to be cut from the 1982 film version. In the 1989 TV special which saw the final appearance of all six Pythons together, the sketch was mentioned in the title, &quot;Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python&quot;. True to its title, the &quot;Dead Parrot sketch&quot; is not included.

In 1989&#x27;s Amnesty benefit show, &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Biggest Ball&quot;, the sketch opens similarly, but ends very differently:
:&quot;Mr Praline&quot;: It&#x27;s dead, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with it.
:&quot;Shopkeeper&quot;: &quot;(long pause as he examines the bird)&quot; So it is. &#x27;Ere&#x27;s your money back and a couple of holiday vouchers.
:&quot;(audience goes wild)&quot;
:&quot;Mr Praline&quot;: &quot;(looks completely flabbergasted)&quot; Well, you can&#x27;t say Thatcher hasn&#x27;t changed some things.

Margaret Thatcher famously used the sketch in a speech at the Conservative Party Conference in 1990, referring to the Liberal Democrats and their symbol being a dove, before ending the speech by commenting, &quot;And now for something completely different.&quot; In 1998, &quot;The Sun&quot; ran the front-page headline &quot;This party is no more...it has ceased to be...this is an EX-party&quot; for an article about a Conservative Party conference. According to her former political secretary John Whittingdale, Thatcher did not understand why the joke was funny and had to be persuaded that it would work. The Conservatives&#x27; use of this sketch was derivative of an earlier Spitting Image sketch, itself derivative of the Python Dead Parrot sketch, in which the part of Mr. Praline was played by a puppet representing David Owen and the part of the shopkeeper was played by a puppet representing Roy Jenkins. Mr Praline/Owen complains that the &quot;party&quot; he has recently acquired from the shopkeeper (representing the Social Democratic Party (UK)) has &quot;expired&quot;, and the shopkeeper/Jenkins claims it is not dead but &quot;pining for Bill Rodgers&quot; (Rodgers, Jenkins and Owen being original members of the &#x27;Gang of Four (SDP)&#x27;.

In a 1997 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performance of the sketch, Cleese added a line to the rant: &quot;Its metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians!&quot; In an interview on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, Palin attributed an almost dead audience to his seeing guests reverently mouthing the words of the sketch, rather than laughing at it. To end the sketch, Palin reused the punchline from &quot;City Center&quot; and asked Cleese, &quot;Do you want to come back to my place?&quot; to which Cleese said, &quot;I thought you&#x27;d never ask!&quot;

For the 1999 &quot;Python Night – 30 Years of Monty Python&quot; TV special, Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a &quot;South Park&quot; version of the sketch depicting Cartman angrily returning a dead Kenny to Kyle&#x27;s shop. Using much of the dialogue from the original sketch, it ends with Terry Gilliam&#x27;s animations playing around with Cartman before everything is crushed by the giant foot.

In a 2002 interview with Michael Parkinson, John Cleese said that when he and Palin were performing the sketch on Drury Lane, Palin made him laugh by saying, when asked if his slug could talk, &quot;It mutters a bit&quot; instead of &quot;Not really.&quot; When Cleese eventually stopped laughing, he couldn&#x27;t remember where they were in the sketch. He turned to the audience and asked them what the next line was, and people shouted it at him, causing him to wonder, &quot;What is the point of this?&quot; He also says that when he and Palin were asked to do the sketch for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; they sat down together to try to remember the lines, and when they got stuck they considered just going out and stopping somebody on the street to ask how it went, since everybody seemed to have it memorised.

In his published 2006 diary, Michael Palin recalls that during the filming of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; in Tunisia, Spike Milligan (who happened to be there on holiday) regaled the Pythons with his own version of the Dead Parrot sketch, but changed &quot;Norwegian Blue&quot; to &quot;Arctic Grey&quot;.

Cleese and Palin acted out the sketch during the Python&#x27;s reunion in The O2 in July 2014, &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;. The sketch ended with the shopkeeper saying he has a selection of cheeses, transitioning into the Cheese Shop Sketch. The entire sketch ended like the City Center performance, with the shopkeeper offering Mr Praline to come back to his place, and Mr Praline replying &quot;I thought you&#x27;d never ask.&quot; In their final performance on 20 July (which was broadcast live to many theatres all over the world), whilst listing the metaphors for the parrot&#x27;s death, Cleese added the line &quot;it had expired and gone to meet Dr. Chapman&quot; after which both Cleese and Palin did a thumbs-up to the sky.

In the episode of &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; from 13 November 2015, Cleese is a guest on the show. At the end of the big furry hat segment (where Stephen Colbert – and in this specific instance, Cleese – create nonsensical rules), Cleese asks, &quot;Do you want to come back to my place?&quot; and Colbert replies, &quot;I thought you&#x27;d never ask.&quot;

==Further uses==

At Graham Chapman&#x27;s memorial service, John Cleese began his eulogy by reprising euphemisms from the sketch.

Part or all of the dead parrot sketch is quoted in several television programmes, among them the &quot;Life of Python&quot; sketch from &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; (a parody of the &quot;Friday Night, Saturday Morning&quot; debate on &quot;Life of Brian&quot;) and &quot;The Early Bird&quot;, an episode from the third season of &quot;Death in Paradise&quot;.

When paleontologists published a paper announcing the discovery of a fossil parrot in Denmark, lead author Dr David Waterhouse alluded to the Dead Parrot Sketch, saying, &quot;Obviously, we are dealing with a bird that is bereft of life, but the tricky bit is establishing that it was a parrot.&quot; However, he declared that this bird could never have been pining for the fjords, explaining, &quot;This parrot shuffled off its mortal coil around 55 million years ago, but the fjords of Norway were formed during the last ice age and are less than a million years old.&quot;

During the Monty Python Reunion at London&#x27;s O2 Arena in 2014, UKTV channel Gold commissioned sculptor Iain Prendergast to create a giant fibreglass version of the mythical &quot;Norwegian Blue&quot;. The 50-foot long (15m) bird was displayed, appropriately &quot;resting&quot; on its back, inside the O2 during the run of the shows there, as well as at Potters Fields Park in South London, in view of Tower Bridge.

The sketch was extensively referenced in a 2021 British Columbia court opinion allowing a class action lawsuit for dietary supplements which did not contain the advertised ingredients. The judge stated &quot;Health Canada cannot establish a protocol that requires that a parrot only still have its feathers in order to be sold as a live parrot, and thereby prevent anyone from suing after being sold a parrot who &#x27;joined the bleedin&#x27; choir invisible.&#x27;&quot;

==Precedents==
The &quot;Philogelos&quot;, the oldest surviving joke book from antiquity written in the fourth century AD, contains a joke widely reported as an &quot;ancestor&quot; to the Dead Parrot sketch. In the joke, a man complains to a slave trader that a slave recently sold to him has died, to which the slave trader replies, &quot;When he was with me, he never did any such thing!&quot;

In Mark Twain&#x27;s humorous short story &quot;A Nevada Funeral&quot;, two characters use a series of euphemisms for death including &#x27;kicked the bucket&#x27; and &#x27;departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveller returns&#x27;.

In 1963, Benny Hill performed a sketch entitled &quot;The Taxidermist&quot; (written by Dave Freeman) on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; in which he attempted to pass off a stuffed duck as a parrot (blaming its different appearance on &quot;the steaming&quot; and &quot;the shrinkage&quot;). John Cleese later admitted that he watched Hill&#x27;s show during this period, but did not recall that particular piece.

In the 1960s, the comedian Freddie &quot;Parrot Face&quot; Davies included an obviously stuffed parrot in his act, berating its seller for having cheated him.

<text>The &quot;Cheese Shop&quot; is a sketch from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;.

It originally appeared in episode 33, &quot;Salad Days&quot; on 30 November, 1972. The script for the sketch is included in the 1989 book &quot;The Complete Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus: All the Words, Volume 2&quot;.

It was later reworked for the album &quot;The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; and appeared for one last time during &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, as a surprising coda to the Dead Parrot sketch.

==Origins==
The idea for the sketch came after a day of shooting in Folkestone Harbour, where John Cleese became seasick and threw up repeatedly while trying to deliver a line. During the drive back, Graham Chapman recommended that Cleese eat something and asked him what he wanted; Cleese replied that he fancied a piece of cheese. Upon seeing a chemist&#x27;s shop, Cleese pondered whether the shop would sell cheese, to which Chapman responded that if they did it would be medicinal cheese and that Cleese would need a prescription to buy some. Giggling, they decided to write a sketch based on that idea. However, on starting to write it, they concluded that asking for cheese in a chemist&#x27;s shop was too unrealistic without being set up. Wondering why someone would attempt to buy cheese somewhere other than a cheese shop, Cleese thought that they should write a sketch about someone attempting to buy cheese in a cheese shop that had no cheese whatsoever to set up a sketch revolving around someone attempting to buy cheese at a chemist&#x27;s which never wound up happening.

Chapman then wrote the sketch with Cleese, who did not initially find it humorous. When Chapman insisted that it was funny, they presented it at a reading for the other Python members. Though most of the other Pythons were also unimpressed, Michael Palin loved it and laughed hysterically, eventually falling to the floor. This amused the others and they agreed to use the sketch.

==Summary==
Cleese plays an erudite customer (Mr. Mousebender in the script) attempting to purchase some cheese from &quot;&quot;Ye National Cheese Emporium&quot;, purveyor of fine cheese to the gentry (and the poverty-stricken too)&quot;. The proprietor (Palin), Mr. Arthur Wensleydale (Henry Wensleydale in the TV version), appears to have nothing in stock, not even cheddar, &quot;the single most popular cheese in the world&quot;. A slow crescendo of bouzouki music plays in the background performed by Joe Moretti, as Terry Jones and Graham Chapman dance while dressed in bowler hats and business suits. Cleese initially expresses appreciation of the music, being &quot;one who delights in all manifestations of the Terpsichorean Muse&quot;, but as the sketch progresses it mirrors Cleese&#x27;s growing frustration until he loudly demands the music cease. As Cleese lists increasingly obscure, unsavoury, and, in one instance fictional, cheeses to no avail, the proprietor offers weak excuses such as &quot;Ohh! The cat&#x27;s eaten it.&quot; Cleese remarks that it is not much of a cheese shop, but Palin insists it is the best in the district due to its cleanliness, to which Cleese replies &quot;Well, it&#x27;s certainly uncontaminated by cheese.&quot; Eventually, Cleese asks if Palin has any cheese at all, to which Palin replies &quot;yes&quot;. Cleese then tells him that he will ask the question again, and if Palin says &quot;no&quot;, he will shoot him &quot;through&quot; the head. Palin answers &quot;no&quot; the second time, and Cleese immediately shoots him, then muses, &quot;What a senseless waste of human life!&quot; He then puts on a Stetson, and the sketch segues into Hugh Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Rogue Cheddar&quot; and a link to the Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Salad Days&quot; sketch.

==Cheeses==
Forty-three cheeses are mentioned in the original sketch. In the audio version on &quot;The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; album and other live and recorded versions, Cleese also mentions Greek feta. In the 2014 reunion show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, Stinking Bishop, Armenian string cheese and Zimbabwean rhinoceros milk cheese were also added to the list. &quot;Venezuelan Beaver Cheese&quot;, mentioned in the original as well as future versions, is a fictitious type of cheese.

==Pastiches and parodies==
* The sketch was reworked for &quot;The Brand New Monty Python Bok&quot;, becoming a two-player word game in which one player must keep naming different cheeses while the other player must keep coming up with different excuses; otherwise, &quot;the Customer wins and may punch the Shopkeeper in the teeth&quot;.
* The &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song &quot;Albuquerque&quot; parodies the sketch by portraying a similar situation in a doughnut shop. The scene ends when the shopkeeper reveals that all he has is a &quot;box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels&quot;; the main character purchases and opens it and is attacked by the creatures inside.
* A wheel of Le Brouère cheese was flown aboard the first SpaceX Dragon 1 reusable space capsule on 8 December 2010 in reference to this sketch. The presence of the space cheese was made known the day after the successful flight.

<doc id="19163" wikidata="Q3821582" url="?curid=19163" title="Bruces' Philosophers Song">
<text>&quot;Bruces&#x27; Philosophers Song&quot;, also known as &quot;The Bruces&#x27; Song&quot;, is a Monty Python song written and composed by Eric Idle that was a feature of the group&#x27;s stage appearances and its recordings.

==Origins==
The Bruces&#x27; Philosophers Song is sung by The Bruces, stereotypical &quot;ocker&quot; Australians of the period. The Bruces are kitted out in khakis, slouch hats and a cork hat, and are faculty members of the Philosophy Department at the fictional University of Woolamaloo (Woolloomooloo is an inner suburb of Sydney, although there is no university there).

The Bruces themselves first appeared in the Bruces sketch which featured in episode 22, &quot;How to Recognise Different Parts of the Body&quot;, of the TV show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, first broadcast on 24 November 1970. The sketch shows an English academic (played by Terry Jones) coming to a hot and perhaps remote part of Australia and being inducted by the Bruces (John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle and Michael Palin) into their Philosophy Department, seemingly located in a simple wooden shack. The Bruces are lounging around a wooden table and soon start drinking cans of Foster&#x27;s Lager.

The song was not part of the TV sketch; it first appeared on the Monty Python&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; as a coda for the album version of the sketch. The song was subsequently included in most of the Monty Python team&#x27;s live shows, sometimes as a singalong with musical accompaniment provided by a Jew&#x27;s harp.

==Lyrics==
The song&#x27;s lyrics make a series of scandalous allegations about a number of highly respected philosophers, usually with regard to their capacity or incapacity for imbibing alcoholic drinks.

The sixth line differs from version to version. While the studio recording on &quot;Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; refers solely to &quot;Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&quot;, live recordings (included in the &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; film and on the albums &quot;Live at Drury Lane&quot; and &quot;Live at City Center&quot;) mention &quot;Schopenhauer and Hegel.&quot;

==The philosophers==
All the philosophers whom the song mentions were dead by the time it appeared, apart from Martin Heidegger.

Philosophers mentioned in the song (in order):

#Immanuel Kant (a real pissant who was very rarely stable)
#Martin Heidegger (a boozy beggar who could think you under the table) 
#David Hume (able to out-consume G. W. F. Hegel)
#Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (out-consumed by Hume)
#Arthur Schopenhauer (in some versions also out-consumed by Hume) 
#Ludwig Wittgenstein (a beery swine who was just as &quot;sloshed&quot;, i.e. drunk, as Schlegel)
#Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel and/or August Wilhelm Schlegel (Wittgenstein is alleged be just as sloshed as either of them)
#Friedrich Nietzsche (particularly knowledgeable about &quot;the raising of the wrist&quot;) 
#Socrates (mentioned twice in each refrain: permanently &quot;pissed&quot;, i.e. drunk)
#John Stuart Mill (particularly ill after half a pint of shandy)
#Plato (said to regularly consume half a crate of whiskey daily) 
#Aristotle (a bugger for the bottle) 
#Thomas Hobbes (fond of his dram) 
#René Descartes (a drunken fart; drinks, therefore he is)
#Socrates (second mention) (particularly missed, noted as both a lovely little thinker, but a bugger when pissed)

<doc id="19164" wikidata="Q601592" url="?curid=19164" title="The Funniest Joke in the World">
<text>&quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot; (also &quot;Joke Warfare&quot; and &quot;Killer Joke&quot;) is a Monty Python comedy sketch revolving around a joke that is so funny that anyone who reads or hears it promptly dies from laughter. Ernest Scribbler (Michael Palin), a British &quot;manufacturer of jokes&quot;, writes the joke on a piece of paper only to die laughing. His mother (Eric Idle) also immediately dies laughing after reading it, as do the first constables on the scene. Eventually the joke is contained, weaponized, and deployed against Germany during World War II.

The sketch appeared in the first episode of the television show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (&quot;Whither Canada&quot;), first shown on 5 October 1969. It appeared in altered forms in several later Python works. The German translation of the joke in the sketch is made of various meaningless, German-sounding nonsense words, and so it does not have an English translation.

==Synopsis==
The sketch is framed in a documentary style and opens with Ernest Scribbler (Michael Palin), a British &quot;manufacturer of jokes&quot;, creating and writing the funniest joke in the world on a piece of paper, only to die laughing. His mother (Eric Idle) finds the joke, thinks it is a suicide note, reads it and also immediately dies laughing. Aware of the deadly nature of the joke, a brave Scotland Yard inspector (Graham Chapman) attempts to retrieve the joke, aided by the playing of very somber music on gramophone records and the chanting of laments by fellow policemen to create a depressing atmosphere. The inspector leaves the house with the joke in hand, but also dies from laughter.

The British Army are soon eager to determine &quot;the military potential of the Killer Joke&quot;. They test the joke on a rifleman (Terry Jones), who laughs and falls dead on the range. After confirming its &quot;devastating effectiveness at a range of up to 50 yards&quot;, they then translate it into German, with each translator working on only one word of the joke for their own safety (one translator saw two words of the joke and had to be hospitalised for several weeks). The German &quot;translation&quot; (in reality mostly just nonsense words) is used for the first time on 8 July 1944 in the Ardennes, causing German soldiers to fall down dead from laughter:
The German version is described as being &quot;over 60,000 times as powerful as Britain&#x27;s great pre-war joke&quot; (at this point a newsreel of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain waving his &quot;piece of paper&quot; appears on screen). The joke is then used in open warfare, with Tommies running through an open field amid artillery fire while shouting the joke at the Germans, who die laughing in response. Afterward, a German field hospital is shown with bandaged German soldiers on stretchers, convulsing with laughter, presumably having heard some parts of the joke. In a subsequent scene, a British officer from the Joke Brigade (Palin) has been taken prisoner and is being interrogated by Gestapo officers. The British officer uses the joke to escape as his German captors die laughing, with one German officer (Cleese) insisting that the joke isn&#x27;t funny. He then cracks up and utters a Woody Woodpecker-style laugh, before expiring.

The Germans attempt counter-jokes, but each attempt is found unsuccessful, with unamused Gestapo officers executing the hapless scientists as a consequence. For example, a film is shown of Adolf Hitler supposedly saying, &quot;My dog has no nose&quot;, then a German soldier asking &quot;How does he smell?&quot;, with Hitler replying, &quot;Awful!&quot;. Eventually their best &quot;V-joke&quot; (in reference to the V-weapons) is attempted on a radio broadcast to British households: &quot;Der ver zwei peanuts, valking down der Straße, und von vas assaulted...peanut. Ohohohoho!&quot; Although the joke is followed triumphantly by the German anthem &quot;Deutschland über alles&quot;, the attack is ineffective, and merely confuses any Britons listening.

The British joke is said to have been laid to rest when &quot;peace broke out&quot; at the end of the war, and countries agree to a joke warfare ban at the Geneva Convention. In 1950, the last copy of the joke is sealed under a monument in the Berkshire countryside, bearing the inscription &quot;To the Unknown Joke&quot;. Thus, the English version of the joke is never revealed to the audience.

==Hitler footage from the sketch in reality==
The footage of Adolf Hitler is taken from Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;. The section (about 34 minutes into the film) where Konstantin Hierl presents the Reichsarbeitsdienst to Hitler is the source of the speech used for the joke. The first clip shows Hitler saying &#x27; (&quot;In particular, no one will live in Germany anymore [without working for their country]&quot;), subtitled &quot;My dog has no nose&quot;. The crowd (led by Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach) saying: &quot;How does he smell?&quot; is from a scene just before Hitler&#x27;s speech; the original German is &#x27;, &quot;We are the Reich&#x27;s young men!&quot; The punchline of the joke &quot;Awful&quot; is the next shot that shows Hitler&#x27;s face. The original words are &quot;&quot;, from &quot;[The whole nation will go through] your school&quot;.

==Influence, and other works==
Jim Carrey is a fan of Monty Python. He described how Ernest Scribbler, played by Michael Palin, laughing himself to death in the sketch, had a huge effect on his early years.

The sketch was later remade in a shorter version for the film &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;. It is also available on the CD-ROM video game version of the film &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot;.

<doc id="19165" wikidata="Q1216336" url="?curid=19165" title="The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)">
<text>&quot;The Spanish Inquisition&quot; is an episode and recurring segment in the British sketch comedy TV series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, specifically series 2 episode 2 (first broadcast 22 September 1970), that satirises the Spanish Inquisition. The sketches are notable for the catchphrase, &quot;Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!&quot;, which has been frequently quoted and become an Internet meme. The final instance of the catchphrase in the episode uses the musical composition &quot;Devil&#x27;s Galop&quot; by Charles Williams. Rewritten audio versions of the sketches were included on &quot;Another Monty Python Record&quot; in 1971.

==Plot synopsis==
This recurring sketch is predicated on a seemingly unrelated narrative bit in which someone exclaims that they &quot;didn&#x27;t expect a Spanish Inquisition!&quot;, often in irritation at being vigorously questioned by another. The first appearance of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Inquisition&quot; characters occurs in a drawing room set in &quot;Jarrow, 1912&quot;, with a title card featuring a modern British urban area with a nuclear power plant. A mill worker (Graham Chapman) enters the room and tells a woman sitting on a couch knitting (Carol Cleveland) in a thick accent that &quot;one of the cross beams has gone out askew on the treadle&quot;. When Cleveland says that she cannot understand what he&#x27;s talking about, Chapman repeats the line without the thick accent. The woman says, &quot;Well, what on earth does that mean?&quot; Chapman becomes defensive and says, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition!&quot; Suddenly, the Inquisitionconsisting of Cardinal Ximénez (Michael Palin) and his assistants, Cardinal Biggles (Terry Jones) (who resembles his namesake Biggles wearing a leather aviator&#x27;s helmet and goggles) and Cardinal Fang (Terry Gilliam)bursts into the room to the sound of a jarring musical sting. Ximénez shouts, with a particular and high-pitched emphasis on the first word: &quot;&quot;No&quot;-body expects the Spanish Inquisition!&quot;.

After entering, Ximénez begins enumerating their weapons, but interrupts himself as he keeps forgetting to mention additional weapons and has to begin numbering his list over again. After several attempts, Ximénez states that he will come in again and herds the Inquisition back off the set. The straight man mill worker repeats the cue line, the Inquisition bursts back in (complete with jarring chord), and the introduction is tried anew. But Ximénez fails again and tries to get Cardinal Biggles to do the introduction, but Biggles is also unsuccessful.

Ximénez decides to forget the introduction and has Cardinal Fang read out charges of heresy against Cleveland, who pleads &quot;innocent&quot;, and the cardinals respond with &quot;diabolical laughter&quot; and threats. Ximénez intends to torture the woman with &quot;the rack&quot;, but Cardinal Biggles instead produces a dish-drying rack. This rack is tied to Cleveland and Biggles pretends to turn a lever, but it has no effect whatsoever. As they work, Chapman answers the door to find a BBC employee (John Cleese) requesting him to open a door for a gag on &quot;the neighboring sketch&quot;, leading into the &quot;Jokes and Novelties Salesman&quot; segment.

The Inquisition returns in a later sketch as an older woman (Marjorie Wilde) shares photographs from a scrapbook with another woman (Cleveland), who rips them up as they are handed to her. When the older woman presents a photo of the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the coal shed, Cleveland says, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect the Spanish Inquisition!&quot; The three cardinals then reappear and take the older woman away to a dungeon.

Biggles tries to torture the woman by poking her repeatedly with soft cushions. When this fails, Ximénez orders Fang to get &quot;the comfy chair&quot;, which is brought out and the woman placed in it. Ximénez states that she must stay in the chair &quot;until lunch time with only a cup of coffee at 11&quot;, and begins to shout at her to confessonly to have Biggles break down and confess. This frustrates Ximénez, but he cannot complain about it since he is distracted by a cartoon character from the next scene.

At the end of the show, in the &quot;Court Charades&quot; sketch, a judge (Jones) who is also a defendant in an obscenity trial at the Old Bailey is casually sentenced by another judge (Chapman) to be burned at the stake. The convicted judge responds, &quot;Blimey, I didn&#x27;t expect the Spanish Inquisition!&quot; The whole court rises and looks expectantly at the witness entrance door. As the closing credits of the episode begin, the Inquisitors race out of a house and hop on a double-decker bus to the Old Bailey, all to the tune of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Galop&quot;. As the Inquisitors ride in the bus, they comment worriedly that they are running out of credits and are panicked that the episode will soon end. The bus reaches the courthouse and the cardinals charge up the steps of the Old Bailey. They finally burst into the courtroom and Ximénez begins to shout, &quot;NO-body expects the Span...,&quot; but a black title card with the words, &quot;THE END&quot;, interrupts him. In resignation, he says, &quot;Oh, bugger&quot;, and the episode concludes.

In the &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; stage show, the sketch ends when Ximénez orders Biggles to &quot;torture&quot; the victim (who is sitting in the comfy chair) by giving her a glass of cold milk from the fridge. When Biggles opens the door, the Man in the Fridge (Eric Idle) emerges and begins singing the &quot;Galaxy Song&quot; to the victim, while the Inquisition exit through the fridge.

==Related sketches==
Cardinal Ximénez briefly appears two episodes later (&quot;The Buzz Aldrin Show&quot;) in a vox pop, again displaying difficulty counting (in this instance, the kinds of aftershave he uses). Later in that episode during the &quot;Police Constable Pan Am Sketch&quot;, the policeman tells a chemist &quot;one more peep out of you and I&#x27;ll do you for heresy&quot;, with the chemist (played by Palin) responding that he &quot;didn&#x27;t expect the Spanish Inquisition&quot;; PC Pan Am (played by Graham Chapman) tells the chemist to shut up.

<doc id="19166" wikidata="Q235063" url="?curid=19166" title="Maya Lin">
<text>Maya Ying Lin (Chinese: 林瓔; born October 5, 1959) is an American architect, designer and sculptor. Born in Athens, Ohio to Chinese immigrants, she attended Yale University to study architecture. In 1981, while still an undergraduate at Yale she achieved national recognition when she won a national design competition for the planned Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The memorial was designed in the minimalist architectural style, and it attracted controversy upon its release but went on to become influential. Lin has since designed numerous memorials, public and private buildings, landscapes, and sculptures. In 1989, she designed the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama. She has an older brother, the poet Tan Lin.

Although best known for historical memorials, she is also known for environmentally themed works, which often address environmental decline. According to Lin, she draws inspiration from the architecture of nature but believes that nothing she creates can match its beauty. She also draws inspirations from &quot;culturally diverse sources, including Japanese gardens, Hopewell Indian earthen mounds, and works by American earthworks artists of the 1960s and the 1970s&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Maya Lin was born in Athens, Ohio. Her parents emigrated from China to the United States, her father in 1948 and her mother in 1949, and settled in Ohio before Lin was born. Her father, Henry Huan Lin, born in Fuzhou, Fujian, was a ceramist and dean of the Ohio University College of Fine Arts. Her mother, Julia Chang Lin, born in Shanghai, was a poet and professor of literature at Ohio University. She is the &quot;half&quot; niece of Lin Huiyin, who was an American-educated artist and poet, and said to have been the first female architect in modern China. Lin Juemin and Lin Yin Ming, both of whom were among the 72 martyrs of the Second Guangzhou uprising, were cousins of her grandfather. Lin Chang-min, a Hanlin of Qing dynasty and the emperor&#x27;s teacher, fathered Lin Huiyin with his wife, while Maya Lin&#x27;s father Henry Huan Lin was Lin Chang-Min’s son by his concubine.

According to Lin, she &quot;didn&#x27;t even realize&quot; she was ethnically Chinese until later in life, and that only in her 30s did she acquire an interest in her cultural background.

Lin has said that she did not have many friends when growing up, stayed home a lot, loved to study, and loved school. While still in high school she took courses at Ohio University where she learned to cast bronze in the school&#x27;s foundry. She graduated in 1977 from Athens High School in The Plains, Ohio, after which she attended Yale University where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1981 and a Master of Architecture in 1986.

== Environmental concerns ==
According to Lin, she has been concerned with environmental issues since she was very young, and dedicated much of her time at Yale University to environmental activism. She attributes her interest in the environment to her upbringing in rural Ohio: the nearby Hopewell and Adena Native America burial mounds inspired her from an early age. Noting that much of her later work has focused on the relationship people have with their environment, as expressed in her earthworks, sculptures, and installations, Lin said, &quot;I&#x27;m very much a product of the growing awareness about ecology and the environmental movement...I am very drawn to landscape, and my work is about finding a balance in the landscape, respecting nature not trying to dominate it. Even the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is an earthwork. All of my work is about slipping things in, inserting an order or a structuring, yet making an interface so that in the end, rather than a hierarchy, there is a balance and tension between the man-made and the natural.&quot;

According to the scholar Susette Min, Lin&#x27;s work uncovers &quot;hidden histories&quot; to bring attention to landscapes and environments that would otherwise be inaccessible to viewers and &quot;deploys the concept to discuss the inextricable relationship between nature and the built environment&quot;. Lin&#x27;s focus on this relationship highlights the impact humanity has on the environment, and draws attention to issues such as global warming, endangered bodies of water, and animal extinction/endangerment. She has explored these issues in her recent memorial, called &quot;What Is Missing?&quot;

According to one commentator, Lin constructs her works to have a minimal effect on the environment by utilizing recycled and sustainable materials, by minimizing carbon emissions, and by attempting to avoid damaging the landscapes/ecosystems where she works.

In addition to her other activities as an environmentalist, Lin has served on the Natural Resources Defense Council board of trustees.

==Vietnam Veterans Memorial==
In 1981, at 21 and still an undergraduate student, Lin won a public design competition to design the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, to be built on the National Mall in Washington D.C. Her design, one of 1,422 submissions, specified a black granite wall with the names of 57,939 fallen soldiers carved into its face (hundreds more have been added since the dedication), to be v-shaped, with one side pointing toward the Lincoln Memorial and the other toward the Washington Monument. The memorial was designed in the minimalist architectural style, which was in contrast to previous war memorials. The memorial was completed in late October 1982 and dedicated in November 1982.

According to Lin, her intention was to create an opening or a wound in the earth to symbolize the pain caused by the war and its many casualties. &quot;I imagined taking a knife and cutting into the earth, opening it up, and with the passage of time, that initial violence and pain would heal,&quot; she recalled.

Her winning design was initially controversial for several reasons: its minimalist design, her lack of professional experience, and her Asian ethnicity. Some objected to the exclusion of the surviving veterans&#x27; names, while others complained about the dark complexion of the granite, claiming that it expressed a negative attitude towards the Vietnam War. Lin defended her design before the US Congress, and a compromise was reached: &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;, a bronze depiction of a group of soldiers and an American flag were placed to the side of Lin&#x27;s design.

Notwithstanding the initial controversy, the memorial has become an important pilgrimage site for relatives and friends of the dead soldiers, many of whom leave personal tokens and mementos in memory of their loved ones. In 2007, an American Institute of Architects poll ranked the memorial No. 10 on a list of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture, and it is now one of the most visited sites on the National Mall. Furthermore, it now serves as a memorial for the veterans of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. There is a collection with items left since 2001 from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, which includes handwritten letters and notes of those who lost loved ones during these wars. There is also a pair of combat boots and a note with it dedicated to the veterans of the Vietnam War, that reads &quot;If your generation of Marines had not come home to jeers, insults, and protests, my generation would not come home to thanks, handshakes and hugs.&quot;

Lin once said that if the competition had not been held &quot;blind&quot; (with designs submitted by name instead of number), she &quot;never would have won&quot; on account of her ethnicity. Her assertion is supported by the fact that she was harassed after her ethnicity was revealed, as when prominent businessman and later third-party presidential candidate Ross Perot called her an &quot;egg roll.&quot;

==Later work==
Lin, who now owns and operates Maya Lin Studio in New York City, has designed numerous projects following the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, including the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama (1989) and the &quot;Wave Field&quot; outdoor installation at the University of Michigan (1995). Lin is represented by the Pace Gallery in New York City.

===Works===
* &quot;Peace-Chapel&quot; (completed in 1989), for the Baker Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies and Juniata College. Lin was approached by Elizabeth Evans Baker to design the open-aired chapel, perched on top of a mountain. The chapel represented in one place the connections between peace, art, spirituality, and nature. The site consists of a circle of stones for “pews,” the ground of the earth for a floor, and the boundless sky for a ceiling overhead. Located on Baker-Henry Nature Preserve in Huntingdon, PA.
* &quot;Wave Field&quot; (completed in 1995), for the University of Michigan. Lin was inspired by both diagrams of fluids in motion and photographs of ocean waves. She was intrigued by the idea of capturing and freezing the motion of water and wished to capture that movement in the earth rather than through photography. &quot;Wave Field&quot; was her first experiment with earthworks.
* &quot;Confluence Project&quot; (completed in 2000), a series of outdoor installations at historical points along the Columbia River and Snake River in the states of Washington and Oregon.
* &quot;Eleven Minute Line&quot; (completed in 2004), an earthwork in Sweden that was designed for the Wanås Foundation. Lin drew inspiration from the Serpent Mounds (Native American burial mounds) located in her home state, Ohio. It is meant to be a walkway for the viewers to experience, taking eleven minutes to complete. The work was inspired by Robert Smithson&#x27;s &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot;.
* A new plaza (completed in 2005), at the Claire Trevor School of the Arts at the University of California, Irvine.
* &quot;Waterline&quot; (completed in 2006), composed of aluminum tubing and paint. Lin has described the piece as a drawing instead of a sculpture. It is a to-scale representation of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, and it is installed so that viewers may walk on the underwater mountain range. One critic saw in the work a purposeful ambiguity as to where the actual water line was in relation to the mountain range, which highlighted the viewers&#x27; relationship to the environment and the effect they had on bodies of water.
* &quot;Bodies of Water&quot; series (completed in 2006), consisting of representations of three bodies of water, &quot;The Black Sea,&quot; &quot;The Caspian Sea,&quot; and &quot;The Red Sea&quot;. Each sculpture is made of layers of birch plywood, and are to-scale representations of three endangered bodies of water. The sculptures are balanced on the deepest point of the sea. Lin wished to call attention to the &quot;unseen ecosystems&quot; that people continue to pollute.
* &quot;Input&quot; (with Tan Lin, completed in 2004). Lin was commissioned by Ohio University to design what is known as &quot;Input&quot; in that institution&#x27;s Bicentennial Park, a landscape designed to resemble a computer punch card. The work relates to Lin&#x27;s first official connection with the university. The daughter of the late Professor Emerita of English Julia Lin and the late Henry Lin, dean emeritus of the College of Fine Arts, Maya Lin studied computer programming at the university while in high school. The installation is located in a 3.5-acre park. It has 21 rectangles, some raised and some depressed, resembling the holes in computer punch cards, a mainstay of early programming courses.
* &quot;Above and Below&quot; (completed in 2007), an outdoor sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum of Art in Indiana. The artwork is made of aluminum tubing that has been electrolytically colored by anodization.
* &quot;2 × 4 Landscape&quot; (completed in 2008), a 30-ton sculpture made of many pieces of wood, which was exhibited at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, in San Francisco. The sculpture itself is evocative of the swelling movement of water, which is juxtaposed with the dry materiality of the lumber pieces. According to Lin, &quot;2 × 4 Landscape&quot; was her attempt to bring the experience of &quot;Wavefield&quot; (1995) indoors. The 2 × 4 pieces are also meant to be reminiscent of pixels, to evoke the &quot;virtual or digital space that we are increasingly occupying.&quot;
* &quot;Wave Field,&quot; (completed in 2008), at the Storm King Art Center in New York state. It is the center&#x27;s first earthwork, spanning 4 acres of land, and is a larger version of her original &quot;Wave Field&quot; (1995) that focuses on the &quot;fusion of opposites,&quot; comparing the motion of water to the material of the earth.
* Design of a building (2009) for the Museum of Chinese in America, near New York City&#x27;s Chinatown. Lin said that she found the project to be personally significant, explaining that she wants her two daughters to &quot;know that part of their heritage&quot;.
* &quot;Silver River&quot; (2009), her first work of art in the Las Vegas Strip. It is part of a public fine art collection at MGM Mirage&#x27;s CityCenter, which opened December 2009. Lin created an cast of the Colorado River made entirely of reclaimed silver. With the sculpture, Lin wanted to make a statement about water conservation and the importance of the Colorado River to Nevada in terms of energy and water. The sculpture is displayed behind the front desk of the Aria Resort and Casino.
* &quot;Pin River - Sandy&quot; (completed in 2013) Was a work Lin created in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Displayed in the Pace Gallery of New York, it stands at 114 × 120 × 1 1/2 in. The work was meant to represent the flood zone of Hurricane Sandy. She wants this piece to raise awareness of how New York City used to be, and how the natural oyster beds and salt marshes would protect from the storm surges.
* &quot;A Fold in the Field&quot; (completed in 2013). Her largest work to date, it was built from 105,000m cubic meters of earth, covering 3 hectares. It forms part of a private collection within a sculpture park, owned by Alan Gibbs, north of Auckland, New Zealand.
* Since around 2010, Lin has been working on what she calls &quot;her final memorial,&quot; the What Is Missing? Foundation, to commemorate the biodiversity that has been lost in the planet&#x27;s sixth mass extinction. She aims to raise awareness about the loss of biodiversity and natural habitats by using sound, media, science, and art for temporary installations and a web-based project. &quot;What Is Missing?&quot; exists not in one specific site but in many forms and in many places simultaneously.
* From 2015 to 2021, Lin worked on the renovation and reconfiguration of the Neilson Library and its grounds at Smith College. A project in Madison Square Park, &quot;Ghost Forest,&quot; was postponed until 2021.
* Both &quot;What is Missing&quot; and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial were referred to by the White House in its press release that announced Lin as one of the 2016 recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Nature and the environment have been central concerns for Lin in both her art and architecture: &quot;As an artist I often work in series, and so for me, I wanted my last memorial to be on a subject that I have personally been concerned with and connected to since I was a child. The last memorial is &quot;What Is Missing?&quot; And encompasses multiple platforms, with temporary and permanent physical installations as well as an interactive online component.&quot; She has expressed her concerns for the goals of the Trump administration: &quot;I think nature is resilient— if we protect it—and with my background I wanted to lend a voice to the incredible threat we are under from climate change and species and habitat loss.&quot;

==Design methodology==

Maya Lin calls herself a &quot;designer,&quot; rather than an &quot;architect&quot;. Her vision and her focus are always on how space needs to be in the future, the balance and relationship with the nature and what it means to people. She has tried to focus less on how politics influences design and more on what emotions the space would create and what it would symbolize to the user. Her belief in a space being connected and the transition from inside to outside being fluid, coupled with what a space means, has led her to create some very memorable designs. She has also worked on sculptures and landscape installations, such as “Input” artwork at Ohio University. In doing so, Lin focuses on memorializing concepts of time periods instead of direct representations of figures, creating an abstract sculptures and installations.

Lin believes that art should be an act of any individual who is willing to say something that is new and not quite familiar. In her own words, Lin&#x27;s work &quot;originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings, not just the physical world but also the psychological world we live in.&quot; Lin describes her creative process as having a very important writing and verbal component. She first imagines an artwork verbally to understand its concepts and meanings. She believes that gathering ideas and information is especially vital in architecture, which focuses on humanity and life and requires a well-rounded mind. When a project comes her way, she tries to &quot;understand the definition (of the site) in a verbal before finding the form to understand what a piece is conceptually and what its nature should be even before visiting the site&quot;. After she completely understands the definition of the site, Lin finalizes her designs by creating numerous renditions of her project in model form. In her historical memorials, such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the &quot;Women&#x27;s Table&quot;, and the Civil Rights Memorial, Lin tries to focus on the chronological aspect of what she is memorializing. That theme is shown in her art memorializing the changing environment and in charting the depletion of bodies of water. Lin also explores themes of juxtaposing materials and a fusion of opposites: &quot;I feel I exist on the boundaries. Somewhere between science and art, art and architecture, public and private, east and west... I am always trying to find a balance between these opposing forces, finding the place where opposites meet... existing not on either side but on the line that divides.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lin was married to Daniel Wolf (1955–2021), a photography dealer and collector. Her sister-in-law was the philanthropist Diane R. Wolf (1954–2008). She has homes in New York and rural Colorado, and is the mother of two daughters, India and Rachel. She has an older brother, the poet Tan Lin.

==Recognition==
Lin has been awarded honorary doctorate degrees from Yale University, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Williams College, and Smith College. In 1987, she was among the youngest to be awarded an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by Yale University.

In 1994, she was the subject of the Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision&quot;. Its title comes from an address she gave at Juniata College in which she spoke of the monument design process in the origin of her work; &quot;My work originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings and this can include not just the physical but the psychological world that we live in.&quot;

In 2002, Lin was elected Alumni Fellow of the Yale Corporation, the governing body of Yale University (upon whose campus sits another of Lin&#x27;s designs, the Women&#x27;s Table, designed to commemorate the role of women at Yale University), in an unusually public contest. Her opponent was W. David Lee, a local New Haven minister and graduate of the Yale Divinity School, who was running on a platform to build ties to the community with the support of Yale&#x27;s unionized employees. Lin was supported by Yale President Richard Levin and other members of the Yale Corporation, and she was the officially endorsed candidate of the Association of Yale Alumni.

In 2003, Lin was chosen to serve on the selection jury of the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition. A trend toward minimalism and abstraction was noted among the entrants and the finalists as well as in the chosen design for the World Trade Center Memorial.

In 2005, Lin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, as well as the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.

President Barack Obama awarded Lin the National Medal of Arts in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

In 2022, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. announced the first biographical exhibition, &quot;One Life: Maya Lin&quot;, dedicated to Lin, noting her contributions as architect, sculptor, environmentalist, and designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

<text>A manuscript (abbreviated MS for singular and MSS for plural) was, traditionally, any document written by hand or typewritten, as opposed to mechanically printed or reproduced in some indirect or automated way. More recently, the term has come to be understood to further include &quot;any&quot; written, typed, or word-processed copy of an author&#x27;s work, as distinguished from the rendition as a printed version of the same.

Before the arrival of prints, all documents and books were manuscripts. Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, music notation, explanatory figures, or illustrations.

==Terminology==

The word &quot;manuscript&quot; derives from the (from , hand and from , to write), and is first recorded in English in 1597. An earlier term in English that shares the meaning of a handwritten document is &quot;hand-writ&quot; (or &quot;handwrit&quot;), which is first attested around 1175 and is now rarely used. The study of the writing (the &quot;hand&quot;) in surviving manuscripts is termed palaeography (or paleography). The traditional abbreviations are MS for manuscript and MSS for manuscripts, while the forms MS., ms or ms. for singular, and MSS., mss or mss. for plural (with or without the full stop, all uppercase or all lowercase) are also accepted. The second &quot;s&quot; is not simply the plural; by an old convention, a doubling of the last letter of the abbreviation expresses the plural, just as &quot;pp.&quot; means &quot;pages&quot;.

A manuscript may be a codex (i.e. bound as a book), a scroll, or bound differently or consist of loose pages. Illuminated manuscripts are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed initial letters or full-page illustrations.

===Parts===
* Cover
* Flyleaf (blank sheet)
* Colophon (publication information)
* incipit (the first few words of the text)
* decoration; illustrations
* dimensions
* Shelfmark or Signature in holding library (as opposed to printed Catalog number). Paper size number often precedes signature number with a &quot;circulus&quot; (degree symbol) following, but many libraries prefer spelling out the word (sometimes only in abbreviation) of the paper size (e.g. Fol[ia]., Qu[arto], Oct[avo, etc.). Some libraries use an equal sign instead of the circulus and may change the side on which the paper size number appears (8=3456 vs 3456=8) for indexing purposes.

===Reproduction===

The mechanical reproduction of a manuscript is called facsimile. Digital reproductions can be called (high-resolution) scans or digital images.

==History==

Before the inventions of printing, in China by woodblock and in Europe by movable type in a printing press, all written documents had to be both produced and reproduced by hand. In the west, manuscripts were produced in form of scrolls (&quot;volumen&quot; in Latin) or books (&quot;codex&quot;, plural &quot;codices&quot;). Manuscripts were produced on vellum and other parchment, on papyrus, and on paper.

In Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia, palm leaf manuscripts, with a distinctive long rectangular shape, were used dating back to the 5th century BCE or earlier, and in some cases continued to be used until the 19th century. In China, bamboo and wooden slips were used prior to the introduction of paper. In Russia, birch bark documents as old as from the 11th century have survived.

Paper spread from China via the Islamic world to Europe by the 14th century, and by the late 15th century had largely replaced parchment for many purposes there. When Greek or Latin works were published, numerous professional copies were sometimes made simultaneously by scribes in a scriptorium, each making a single copy from an original that was declaimed aloud.

The oldest written manuscripts have been preserved by the perfect dryness of their Middle Eastern resting places, whether placed within sarcophagi in Egyptian tombs, or reused as mummy-wrappings, discarded in the middens of Oxyrhynchus or secreted for safe-keeping in jars and buried (Nag Hammadi library) or stored in dry caves (Dead Sea scrolls). Volcanic ash preserved some of the Roman library of the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum. Manuscripts in Tocharian languages, written on palm leaves, survived in desert burials in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia.

Ironically, the manuscripts that were being most carefully preserved in the libraries of antiquity are virtually all lost. Papyrus has a life of at most a century or two in relatively humid Italian or Greek conditions; only those works copied onto parchment, usually after the general conversion to Christianity, have survived, and by no means all of those.

Originally, all books were in manuscript form. In China, and later other parts of East Asia, woodblock printing was used for books from about the 7th century. The earliest dated example is the Diamond Sutra of 868. In the Islamic world and the West, all books were in manuscript until the introduction of movable type printing in about 1450. Manuscript copying of books continued for a least a century, as printing remained expensive. Private or government documents remained hand-written until the invention of the typewriter in the late 19th century. Because of the likelihood of errors being introduced each time a manuscript was copied, the filiation of different versions of the same text is a fundamental part of the study and criticism of all texts that have been transmitted in manuscript.

In Southeast Asia, in the first millennium, documents of sufficiently great importance were inscribed on soft metallic sheets such as copperplate, softened by refiner&#x27;s fire and inscribed with a metal stylus. In the Philippines, for example, as early as 900 AD, specimen documents were not inscribed by stylus, but were punched much like the style of today&#x27;s dot-matrix printers. This type of document was rare compared to the usual leaves and bamboo staves that were inscribed. However, neither the leaves nor paper were as durable as the metal document in the hot, humid climate. In Burma, the kammavaca, Buddhist manuscripts, were inscribed on brass, copper or ivory sheets, and even on discarded monk robes folded and lacquered. In Italy some important Etruscan texts were similarly inscribed on thin gold plates: similar sheets have been discovered in Bulgaria. Technically, these are all inscriptions rather than manuscripts.

In the Western world, from the classical period through the early centuries of the Christian era, manuscripts were written without spaces between the words (scriptio continua), which makes them especially hard for the untrained to read. Extant copies of these early manuscripts written in Greek or Latin and usually dating from the 4th century to the 8th century, are classified according to their use of either all upper case or all lower case letters. Hebrew manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea scrolls make no such differentiation. Manuscripts using all upper case letters are called majuscule, those using all lower case are called minuscule. Usually, the majuscule scripts such as uncial are written with much more care. The scribe lifted his pen between each stroke, producing an unmistakable effect of regularity and formality. On the other hand, while minuscule scripts can be written with pen-lift, they may also be cursive, that is, use little or no pen-lift.

== Islamic world ==

Islamic manuscripts were produced in different ways depending on their use and time period. Parchment (vellum) was a common way to produce manuscripts. Manuscripts eventually transitioned to using paper in later centuries with the diffusion of paper making in the Islamic empire. When Muslims encountered paper in Central Asia, its use and production spread to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and North Africa during the 8th century.

== Africa ==
4,203 of Timbuktu&#x27;s manuscripts were burned or stolen during the armed conflict in Mali between 2012 and 2013. 90% of these manuscripts were saved by the population organized around the NGO &quot;Sauvegarde et valorisation des manuscrits pour la défense de la culture islamique&quot; (SAVAMA-DCI). Some 350,000 manuscripts were transported to safety, and 300,000 of them were still in Bamako in 2022. An international consultation on the safeguarding, accessibility and promotion of ancient manuscripts in the Sahel was held at the UNESCO office in Bamako in 2020.

== Western world ==
Most surviving pre-modern manuscripts use the codex format (as in a modern book), which had replaced the scroll by Late Antiquity. Parchment or vellum, as the best type of parchment is known, had also replaced papyrus, which was not nearly so long lived and has survived to the present almost exclusively in the very dry climate of Egypt, although it was widely used across the Roman world. Parchment is made of animal skin, normally calf, sheep, or goat, but also other animals. With all skins, the quality of the finished product is based on how much preparation and skill was put into turning the skin into parchment. Parchment made from calf or sheep was the most common in Northern Europe, while civilizations in Southern Europe preferred goatskin. Often, if the parchment is white or cream in color and veins from the animal can still be seen, it is calfskin. If it is yellow, greasy or in some cases shiny, then it was made from sheepskin.

Vellum comes from the Latin word vitulinum which means &quot;of calf&quot;/ &quot;made from calf&quot;. For modern parchment makers and calligraphers, and apparently often in the past, the terms parchment and vellum are used based on the different degrees of quality, preparation and thickness, and not according to which animal the skin came from, and because of this, the more neutral term &quot;membrane&quot; is often used by modern academics, especially where the animal has not been established by testing.

===Scripts===
Merovingian script, or &quot;Luxeuil minuscule&quot;, is named after an abbey in Western France, the Luxeuil Abbey, founded by the Irish missionary St Columba . Caroline minuscule is a calligraphic script developed as a writing standard in Europe so that the Latin alphabet could be easily recognized by the literate class from different regions. It was used in the Holy Roman Empire between approximately 800 and 1200. Codices, classical and Christian texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the Carolingian Renaissance. The script developed into blackletter and became obsolete, though its revival in the Italian renaissance forms the basis of more recent scripts. In &quot;Introduction to Manuscript Studies&quot;, Clemens and Graham associate the beginning of this text coming from the Abby of Saint-Martin at Tours.

Caroline Minuscule arrived in England in the second half of the 10th century. Its adoption there, replacing Insular script, was encouraged by the importation of continental European manuscripts by Saints Dunstan, Aethelwold, and Oswald. This script spread quite rapidly, being employed in many English centres for copying Latin texts. English scribes adapted the Carolingian script, giving it proportion and legibility. This new revision of the Caroline minuscule was called English Protogothic Bookhand.
Another script that is derived from the Caroline Minuscule was the German Protogothic Bookhand. It originated in southern Germany during the second half of the 12th century.
All the individual letters are Caroline; but just as with English Protogothic Bookhand it evolved. This can be seen most notably in the arm of the letter h. It has a hairline that tapers out by curving to the left. When first read the German Protogothic h looks like the German Protogothic b. Many more scripts sprang out of the German Protogothic Bookhand. After those came Bastard Anglicana, which is best described as:

The coexistence in the Gothic period of formal hands employed for the copying of books and cursive scripts used for documentary purposes eventually resulted in cross-fertilization between these two fundamentally different writing styles. Notably, scribes began to upgrade some of the cursive scripts. A script that has been thus formalized is known as a &quot;bastard&quot; script (whereas a bookhand that has had cursive elements fused onto it is known as a hybrid script). The advantage of such a script was that it could be written more quickly than a pure bookhand; it thus recommended itself to scribes in a period when demand for books was increasing and authors were tending to write longer texts. In England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, many books were written in the script known as Bastard Anglicana.

=== Genres ===
From ancient texts to medieval maps, anything written down for study would have been done with manuscripts. Some of the most common genres were bibles, religious commentaries, philosophy, law and government texts.

====Biblical====

&quot;The Bible was the most studied book of the Middle Ages&quot;. The Bible was the center of medieval religious life. Along with the Bible came scores of commentaries. Commentaries were written in volumes, with some focusing on just single pages of scripture. Across Europe, there were universities that prided themselves on their biblical knowledge. Along with universities, certain cities also had their own celebrities of biblical knowledge during the medieval period.

====Book of hours====

A book of hours is a type of devotional text which was widely popular during the Middle Ages. They are the most common type of surviving medieval illuminated manuscripts. Each book of hours contain a similar collection of texts, prayers, and psalms but decoration can vary between each and each example. Many have minimal illumination, often restricted to ornamented initials, but books of hours made for wealthier patrons can be extremely extravagant with full-page miniatures. These books were used for owners to recite prayers privately eight different times, or hours, of the day.

====Liturgical books and calendars====

Along with Bibles, large numbers of manuscripts made in the Middle Ages were received in Church. Due to the complex church system of rituals and worship these books were the most elegantly written and finely decorated of all medieval manuscripts. Liturgical books usually came in two varieties. Those used during mass and those for divine office.

Most liturgical books came with a calendar in the front. This served as a quick reference point for important dates in Jesus&#x27; life and to tell church officials which saints were to be honored and on what day.

==Modern variations ==
In the context of library science, a manuscript is defined as any hand-written item in the collections of a library or an archive. For example, a library&#x27;s collection of hand-written letters or diaries is considered a manuscript collection. Such manuscript collections are described in finding aids, similar to an index or table of contents to the collection, in accordance with national and international content standards such as DACS and ISAD(G).

In other contexts, however, the use of the term &quot;manuscript&quot; no longer necessarily means something that is hand-written. By analogy a typescript has been produced on a typewriter.

===Publishing===

In book, magazine, and music publishing, a manuscript is an autograph or copy of a work, written by an author, composer or copyist. Such manuscripts generally follow standardized typographic and formatting rules, in which case they can be called fair copy (whether original or copy). The staff paper commonly used for handwritten music is, for this reason, often called &quot;manuscript paper&quot;.

===Film and theatre===

In film and theatre, a manuscript, or &quot;script&quot; for short, is an author&#x27;s or dramatist&#x27;s text, used by a theatre company or film crew during the production of the work&#x27;s performance or filming. More specifically, a motion picture manuscript is called a screenplay; a television manuscript, a teleplay; a manuscript for the theatre, a stage play; and a manuscript for audio-only performance is often called a radio play, even when the recorded performance is disseminated via non-radio means.

===Insurance===

In insurance, a manuscript policy is one that is negotiated between the insurer and the policyholder, as opposed to an off-the-shelf form supplied by the insurer.

== Preservation ==
About 300,000 Latin, 55,000 Greek, 30,000 Armenian and 12,000 Georgian medieval manuscripts have survived. National Geographic estimates that 700,000 African manuscripts have survived at the University of Timbuktu in Mali.

==Repositories==
Major U.S. repositories of medieval manuscripts include:
* The Morgan Library &amp; Museum = 1,300 (including papyri)
* Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale = 1,100
* Walters Art Museum = 1,000
* Houghton Library, Harvard = 850
* Van Pelt Library, Penn = 650
* Huntington Library = 400
* Robbins Collection = 300
* Newberry Library = 260
* Cornell University Library = 150
Many European libraries have far larger collections.
* Arnamagnæan Institute
* Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies
* British Library#Collections of manuscripts
* Kungliga biblioteket

Because they are books, pre-modern manuscripts are best described using bibliographic rather than archival standards. The standard endorsed by the American Library Association is known as AMREMM. A growing digital catalog of pre-modern manuscripts is Digital Scriptorium, hosted by the University of California at Berkeley.

<doc id="19168" wikidata="Q308857" url="?curid=19168" title="Misogyny">
<text>Misogyny () is hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against women or girls. It is a form of sexism that can keep women at a lower social status than men, thus maintaining the social roles of patriarchy. Misogyny has been widely practised for thousands of years. It is reflected in art, literature, human societal structure, historical events, mythology, philosophy, and religion worldwide.

An example of misogyny is violence against women, which includes domestic violence and, in its most extreme forms, misogynist terrorism and femicide. Misogyny also often operates through sexual harassment, coercion, and psychological techniques aimed at controlling women, and by legally or socially excluding women from full citizenship. In some cases, misogyny rewards women for accepting an inferior status.

Misogyny can be understood both as an attitude held by individuals, primarily by men, and as a widespread cultural custom or system. Sometimes misogyny manifests in obvious and bold ways; other times it is more subtle or disguised in ways that provide plausible deniability.

In feminist thought, misogyny also includes the rejection of feminine qualities. It holds in contempt institutions, work, hobbies, or habits associated with women. It rejects any aspects of men that are seen as feminine or unmanly. At the same time, femininity researcher Rhea Ashley Hoskin points out that one should distinguish between oppression based on female gender, and oppression based on feminine gender expression. The academic term for the latter is femmephobia. Racism and other prejudices may reinforce and overlap with misogyny.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the English word &quot;misogyny&quot; was coined in the middle of the 17th century from the Greek misos &#x27;hatred&#x27; + gunē &#x27;woman&#x27;. The word was rarely used until it was popularised by second-wave feminism in the 1970s.

== Definitions ==
English and American dictionaries define misogyny as &quot;hatred of women&quot; and as &quot;hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women&quot;.

The American &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; distinguishes misogyny, &quot;a hatred of women&quot;, from sexism, which denotes sex-based discrimination, and &quot;behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex.&quot;

In 2012, primarily in response to a speech in the Australian Parliament, the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; (which documents Australian English and New Zealand English) expanded its definition to include not only hatred of women but also &quot;entrenched prejudices against women&quot;.

Social psychology research describes overt misogyny as &quot;blatant hostile sexism&quot; that raises resistance in women, as opposed to &quot;manifestations of benevolent sexism&quot; or chivalry that lead women to behave in a manner perpetuating patriarchal arrangements.

According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, &quot;misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female&quot;. Johnson argues that:
Sociologist Michael Flood at the University of Wollongong defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
Philosopher Kate Manne of Cornell University defines misogyny as the attempt to control and punish women who challenge male dominance. Manne finds the traditional &quot;hatred of women&quot; definition of misogyny too simplistic, noting it does not account for how perpetrators of misogynistic violence may love certain women; for example, their mothers. Instead, misogyny rewards women who uphold the status quo and punishes those who reject women&#x27;s subordinate status. Manne distinguishes sexism, which she says seeks to rationalise and justify patriarchy, from misogyny, which she calls the &quot;law enforcement&quot; branch of patriarchy:
&quot;Misogynous&quot; and &quot;misogynistic&quot; can both be used as an adjectival form of the word. The noun &quot;misogynist&quot; can be used for a woman-hating person. The counterpart of misogyny is misandry, the hatred or dislike of men. Misandry is a minor issue, not equivalent to the widespread practice and extensive history of misogyny. The antonym of misogyny, philogyny—love or fondness toward women— is not widely used. Words derived from the word &quot;misogyny&quot; and denoting connected concepts include misogynoir, the intersection of anti-black racism and misogyny faced by Black women; transmisogyny, the intersection of misogyny and transphobia faced by trans women and transfeminine people; and transmisogynoir, the confluence of these faced by black trans women and transfeminine people.

==Origins==
Misogyny likely arose at the same time as patriarchy: three to five thousand years ago at the start of the Bronze Age. The three main monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam promoted patriarchal societal structures, and used misogyny to keep women at a lower status. Misogyny gained strength in the Middle Ages, especially in Christian societies. In parallel to these, misogyny was also practised in societies such as the Romans, Greeks, and the tribes of the Amazon Basin and Melanesia, who did not follow a monotheistic religion. Nearly every human culture contains evidence of misogyny.

Anthropologist David D. Gilmore argues that misogyny is rooted in men&#x27;s conflicting feelings: men&#x27;s existential dependence on women for procreation, and men&#x27;s fear of women&#x27;s power over them in their times of male weakness, contrasted against the deep-seated needs of men for the love, care and comfort of women—a need that makes the men feel vulnerable.

Angela Saini notes that a large proportion of women in ancient societies were kidnapped brides from other cultures. Such a woman was often forced to marry a man who had killed her family. Misogynistic suspicion in ancient Greece and elsewhere is to some degree explained by male anxiety that women would some day revolt against their captors. Saini argues that patriarchy and gender stereotyping emerged at the same time as the state.

== Historical usage ==
=== Classical Greece ===
In his book &quot;City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens&quot;, J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as Hesiod. He claims that the term &quot;misogyny&quot; itself comes directly into English from the Ancient Greek word &quot;misogunia&quot; (), which survives in several passages.

The earlier, longer, and more complete passage comes from a moral tract known as &quot;On Marriage&quot; (&quot;c&quot;. 150 BC) by the stoic philosopher Antipater of Tarsus. Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine (polytheistic) decree. He uses &quot;misogunia&quot; to describe the sort of writing the tragedian Euripides eschews, stating that he &quot;reject[s] the hatred of women in his writing&quot; (ἀποθέμενος τὴν ἐν τῷ γράφειν μισογυνίαν). He then offers an example of this, quoting from a lost play of Euripides in which the merits of a dutiful wife are praised.

According to Tieleman other surviving use of the Ancient Greek word is by Chrysippus, in a fragment from &quot;On affections&quot;, quoted by Galen in &quot;Hippocrates on Affections&quot;. Here, &quot;misogyny&quot; is the first in a short list of three &quot;disaffections&quot;—women (&quot;misogunia&quot;), wine (&quot;misoinia&quot;, μισοινία) and humanity (&quot;misanthrōpia&quot;, μισανθρωπία). Chrysippus&#x27; point is more abstract than Antipater&#x27;s, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. &quot;It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike.&quot; So Chrysippus, like his fellow stoic Antipater, views misogyny negatively, as a disease; a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests that the general stoic view was that &quot;[a] man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other.&quot;

In the &quot;Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic&quot;, Nickolas Pappas describes the &quot;problem of misogyny&quot; and states:

&quot;Misogynist&quot; is also found in the Greek—&quot;misogunēs&quot; ()—in &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; (above) and in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, where it is used as the title of Heracles in the history of Phocion. It was the title of a play by Menander, which we know of from book seven (concerning Alexandria) of Strabo&#x27;s 17 volume &quot;Geography&quot;, and quotations of Menander by Clement of Alexandria and Stobaeus that relate to marriage. A Greek play with a similar name, &quot;Misogunos&quot; (Μισόγυνος) or &quot;Woman-hater&quot;, is reported by Marcus Tullius Cicero (in Latin) and attributed to the poet Marcus Atilius.
Cicero reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by gynophobia, a fear of women.

In summary, despite considering women as generally inferior to men, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a disease—an anti-social condition—in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.

=== English language ===
According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word entered English because of an anonymous proto-feminist play, &quot;Swetnam the Woman-Hater&quot;, published in 1620 in England. The play is a criticism of anti-woman writer Joseph Swetnam, who it represents with the pseudonym Misogynos. The character of Misogynos is the origin of the term misogynist in English.

The term was fairly rare until the mid-1970s. The publication of feminist Andrea Dworkin&#x27;s 1974 critique &quot;Woman Hating&quot; popularised the idea. The term misogyny entered the lexicon of second-wave feminism. Dworkin and her contemporaries used the term to include not only a hatred or contempt of women, but the practice of controlling women with violence and punishing women who reject subordination.

Misogyny was discussed worldwide in 2012 because of a viral video of a speech by Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Her parliamentary address is known as the Misogyny Speech. In the speech, Gillard powerfully criticised her opponents for holding her policies to a different standard than those of male politicians, and for speaking about her in crudely sexual terms. She was criticised for systemic misogyny, because earlier in the day her Labour Party had passed legislation cutting $728 million in welfare benefits to single mothers.

Gillard&#x27;s usage of the word &quot;misogyny&quot; promoted re-evaluations of the word&#x27;s published definitions. The &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; revised its definition in 2012 to better match the way the word has been used over the prior 30 years. The book &quot;Down Girl&quot;, which reconsidered the definition using the tools of analytic philosophy, was inspired in part by Gillard.

== Religion ==
=== Ancient Greek ===

In &quot;Misogyny: The World&#x27;s Oldest Prejudice&quot;, Jack Holland argues that there is evidence of misogyny in the mythology of the ancient world. In Greek mythology according to Hesiod, the human race had already experienced a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods before the creation of women. When Prometheus decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, Zeus becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an &quot;evil thing for their delight&quot;. This &quot;evil thing&quot; is Pandora, the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described—incorrectly—as a box) which she was told to never open. Epimetheus (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus&#x27; warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it she unleashes into the world all evil; labour, sickness, old age, and death.

=== Buddhism ===

In his book &quot;The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender&quot;, professor Bernard Faure of Columbia University argued generally that &quot;Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought.&quot; He remarked, &quot;Many feminist scholars have emphasised the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism&quot; and stated that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. Additionally, he wrote:
=== Christianity ===


Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of Christianity to differ in their beliefs with regard to their treatment of women.

In &quot;The Troublesome Helpmate&quot;, Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic, and she lists what she says are specific examples of misogyny in the Pauline epistles. She states:

In K. K. Ruthven&#x27;s &quot;Feminist Literary Studies: An Introduction&quot;, Ruthven makes reference to Rogers&#x27; book and argues that the &quot;legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called &#x27;Fathers&#x27; of the Church, like Tertullian, who thought a woman was not only &#x27;the gateway of the devil&#x27; but also &#x27;a temple built over a sewer&#x27;.&quot;

Several Christian institutions exclude women. For example, women are excluded from the Mount Athos region of Greece and from the governing hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Some Christian theologians, such as John Knox in his book &quot;The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women&quot;, have written that women should be excluded from secular government institutions for religious reasons.

However, some other scholars have argued that Christianity does not include misogynistic principles, or at least that a proper interpretation of Christianity would not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a biblical scholar at Fuller Theological Seminary, stated that the verse Galatians 3:28 (&quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus&quot;) is &quot;the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church.&quot; In his book &quot;Equality in Christ? Galatians 3:28 and the Gender Dispute&quot;, Richard Hove argues that—while Galatians 3:28 does mean that one&#x27;s sex does not affect salvation—&quot;there remains a pattern in which the wife is to emulate the church&#x27;s submission to Christ and the husband is to emulate Christ&#x27;s love for the church.&quot;

In &quot;Christian Men Who Hate Women&quot;, clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written that Christian social culture often allows a misogynist &quot;misuse of the biblical ideal of submission&quot;. However, she argues that this a distortion of the &quot;healthy relationship of mutual submission&quot; which is actually specified in Christian doctrine, where &quot;[l]ove is based on a deep, mutual respect as the guiding principle behind all decisions, actions, and plans&quot;. Similarly, Catholic scholar Christopher West argues that &quot;male domination violates God&#x27;s plan and is the specific result of sin&quot;.

=== Islam ===


The fourth chapter (or &quot;sura&quot;) of the Quran is called &quot;Women&quot; (&quot;an-nisa&quot;). The 34th verse is a key verse in feminist criticism of Islam. The verse notes men&#x27;s God-given advantages over women. They are consequently their protectors and maintainers. Where women are disobedient &quot;admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them...&quot; In his book &quot;No god but God&quot;, University of Southern California, Professor Reza Aslan wrote that &quot;misogynistic interpretation&quot; has been persistently attached to An-Nisa, 34 because commentary on the Quran &quot;has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men&quot;.

In his book &quot;Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh&quot;, Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture, writing:

The economic and social position of men and women was reflected in blood money to the family of a victim. The financial loss for a woman was pegged at half that of a man.

=== Sikhism ===

Scholars William M. Reynolds and Julie A. Webber have written that Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith tradition, was a &quot;fighter for women&#x27;s rights&quot; that was &quot;in no way misogynistic&quot; in contrast to some of his contemporaries. However, unconscious misogynistic attitudes in Sikh men have steadily reduced the power of women in Sikhism, such that the Sikh community has been observed to contain toxic masculinity.

== Misogynistic ideas among prominent Western thinkers ==
Numerous influential Western philosophers have expressed ideas that have been characterised as misogynistic, including Aristotle, René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, G. W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Otto Weininger, Oswald Spengler, and John Lucas. Because of the influence of these thinkers, feminist scholars trace misogyny in Western culture to these philosophers and their ideas.

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle believed women were inferior and described them as &quot;deformed males&quot;. In his work &quot;Politics&quot;, he states

as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject 4 (1254b13-14).

Another example is &quot;Cynthia&#x27;s catalog&quot; in which Cynthia states &quot;Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman&#x27;s lies in obeying; that &#x27;matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful&#x27;; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or &#x27;as it were, a deformity&#x27;. Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are &quot;more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate[,] ... more easily moved to tears[,] ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike[,] ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful[,] ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action&quot; than men.

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
Jean-Jacques Rousseau is well known for his views against equal rights for women for example in his treatise &quot;Emile&quot;, he writes: &quot;Always justify the burdens you impose upon girls but impose them anyway... . They must be thwarted from an early age... . They must be exercised to constraint, so that it costs them nothing to stifle all their fantasies to submit them to the will of others.&quot; Other quotes consist of &quot;closed up in their houses&quot;, &quot;must receive the decisions of fathers and husbands like that of the church&quot;.

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===

Based on his essay &quot;On Women&quot; (Über die Weiber), Arthur Schopenhauer has been noted as a misogynist by many such as the philosopher, critic, and author Tom Grimwood. In a 2008 article published in the philosophical journal of &quot;Kritique,&quot; Grimwood argues that Schopenhauer&#x27;s misogynistic works have largely escaped attention despite being more noticeable than those of other philosophers such as Nietzsche. For example, he noted Schopenhauer&#x27;s works where the latter had argued women only have &quot;meagre&quot; reason comparable that of &quot;the animal&quot; &quot;who lives in the present&quot;. Other works he noted consisted of Schopenhauer&#x27;s argument that women&#x27;s only role in nature is to further the species through childbirth and hence is equipped with the power to seduce and &quot;capture&quot; men. He goes on to state that women&#x27;s cheerfulness is chaotic and disruptive which is why it is crucial to exercise obedience to those with rationality. For her to function beyond her rational subjugator is a threat against men as well as other women, he notes. Schopenhauer also thought women&#x27;s cheerfulness is an expression of her lack of morality and incapability to understand abstract or objective meaning such as art. This is followed up by his quote &quot;have never been able to produce a single, really great, genuine and original achievement in the fine arts, or bring to anywhere into the world a work of permanent value&quot;.

Schopenhauer condemned what he called &quot;Teutonico-Christian stupidity&quot; on female affairs. He argued that women are &quot;by nature meant to obey&quot; as they are &quot;childish, frivolous, and short sighted&quot;. He also argued that women did not possess any real beauty:
=== Nietzsche ===
In &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, Friedrich Nietzsche stated that stricter controls on women was a condition of &quot;every elevation of culture&quot;. In his &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, he has a female character say &quot;You are going to women? Do not forget the whip!&quot; In &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;, Nietzsche writes &quot;Women are considered profound. Why? Because we never fathom their depths. But women aren&#x27;t even shallow.&quot; There is controversy over the questions of whether or not this amounts to misogyny, whether his polemic against women is meant to be taken literally, and the exact nature of his opinions of women.

=== Hegel ===
Hegel&#x27;s view of women has been characterised as misogynistic. Passages from Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; illustrate the criticism:
== Violence ==

===Terrorism and hate crimes===

Femicide is the name of a hate crime, the intentional killing of women or girls on account of their sex. It is ideological misogynist killing, and in some cases may also be an example of domestic violence.

Misogynist terrorism is terrorism intended to punish woman. Since 2018 counter-terrorism professionals such as ICCT and START have tracked misogyny or male supremacy as ideologies that have motivated terrorism. They describe this form of terror as a &quot;rising threat&quot;. Among the attacks designated as misogynist terrorism are the 2014 Isla Vista killings and the 2018 Toronto van attack. Some of the attackers have identified with the incel movement, and were motivated to kill by a perception of being entitled to sexual access to women. However, misogyny is common among mass killers, even when it is not the primary motivation.

== Online misogyny ==

Misogynistic rhetoric is pervasive online and has grown more aggressive over time. Online misogyny includes both individual attempts to intimidate and denigrate women, denial of gender inequity (neosexism), and also coordinated, collective attempts such as vote brigading and the Gamergate antifeminist harassment campaign. In a paper written for the &quot;Journal of International Affairs&quot;, Kim Barker and Olga Jurasz discuss how online misogyny can lead to women facing obstacles when trying to engage in the public and political spheres of the Internet due to the abusive nature of these spaces. They also suggest regulations and shut downs of online misogyny through both governmental and non-governmental means.

=== Coordinated attacks ===

The most likely targets for misogynistic attacks by coordinated groups are women who are visible in the public sphere, women who speak out about the threats they receive, and women who are perceived to be associated with feminism or feminist gains. Authors of misogynistic messages are usually anonymous or otherwise difficult to identify. Their rhetoric involves misogynistic epithets and graphic or sexualised imagery. It centres on the women&#x27;s physical appearance, and prescribes sexual violence as a corrective for the targeted women. Examples of famous people who spoke out about misogynistic attacks are Anita Sarkeesian, Laurie Penny, Caroline Criado Perez, Stella Creasy, and Lindy West.

These attacks do not always remain online only. Swatting was used to bring Gamergate attacks into the physical world.

=== Language used ===
The insults and threats directed at different women tend to be very similar. Jude Doyle, who has been the target of online threats, noted the &quot;overwhelmingly impersonal, repetitive, stereotyped quality&quot; of the abuse, the fact that &quot;all of us are being called the same things, in the same tone&quot;.

A 2016 study conducted by the think tank Demos found that the majority of Twitter messages containing the words &quot;whore&quot; or &quot;slut&quot; were advertisements for pornography. Of those that were not, a majority used the terms in a non-aggressive way, such a discussion of slut-shaming. Of those that used the terms &quot;whore&quot; or &quot;slut&quot; in an aggressive, insulting way, about half were women and half were men. Twitter users most frequently targeted by women with aggressive insults were celebrities, such as Beyoncé Knowles.

A 2020 study published in the journal &quot;New Media &amp; Society&quot; also discusses how language on the internet can contribute to online misogyny. The authors specifically criticise &quot;Urban Dictionary&quot;, claiming the language used in the definitions are misogynistic and anti-feminist, rather than simply being a collaborative dictionary.

A 2021 study published at the meeting of the &quot;Association for Computational Linguistics&quot; notes that online misogyny presents differently in different contexts. For example: Spanish online discussions show a stronger presence of dominance; Italian misogyny has a plurality of stereotyping and objectification; English online misogyny most frequently involves discrediting women; and Danish discussions primarily express neo-sexism.

=== Incels ===
Incels, or involuntary celibates, is an online community of men who believe they cannot get into heterosexual relationships. They share a common belief that women pick partners based solely on looks, so due to their unattractiveness, they will be alone forever. Due to this perception of themselves, incels in turn hate women, and believe that men are systematically discriminated against. Incels have a large network of male-oriented websites dedicated to the cyber hate of women, discrimination, and networking of misogyny. In the incel form of misogyny, all women are discriminated against, however, women of colour are doubly denigrated by sexism and racism. Incels endorse and participate in sexism, racism, and mass violence. They are not only a threat in online communities, but they also carry their misogyny over to killing sprees, like the 2014 Isla Vista massacre that inspired other incel acts of violence. Incel existence and rhetoric is a good example of misogyny online.

===With white supremacy===
Andrew Anglin uses the white supremacist website &quot;The Daily Stormer&quot; as a platform to promote misogynistic conspiracy theories, claiming that politically active &quot;[w]hite women across the Western world&quot; are pushing for liberal immigration policies &quot;to ensure an endless supply of Black and Arab men to satisfy their depraved sexual desires.&quot; In July 2018, Anglin summarised his misogynistic views, writing: &quot;Look, I hate women. I think they deserve to be beaten, raped and locked in cages.&quot; The term misogynoir describes misogyny directed towards Black women where prejudice based upon race and gender play reinforcing roles.

== Psychological impact ==

=== Internalised misogyny ===
 Women who experience internalised misogyny may express it through minimising the value of women, mistrusting women, and believing gender bias in favour of men. A common manifestation of internalised misogyny is lateral violence.

=== Abuse and harassment ===

Misogyny has taken shape as sexual harassment.

Misogynist attitudes lead to the physical, sexual, and emotional abuse of gender nonconforming boys in childhood.

== Feminist theory ==

===&quot;Good&quot; versus &quot;bad&quot; women===

Many feminists have written that the notions of &quot;good&quot; women and &quot;bad&quot; women are imposed upon women in order to control them. Women who are easy to control, or who advocate for their own oppression, may be told they are good. The categories of bad and good also cause fighting among women; Helen Lewis identifies this &quot;long tradition of regulating female behaviour by defining women in opposition to one another&quot; as the architecture of misogyny.
The &quot;Madonna–whore dichotomy&quot; or &quot;virgin/whore dichotomy&quot; is the perception of women as either good and chaste or as bad and promiscuous. Belief in this dichotomy leads to misogyny, according to the feminist perspective, because the dichotomy appears to justify policing women&#x27;s behaviour. Misogynists seek to punish &quot;bad&quot; women for their sexuality. Author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie observes that when women describe being harassed or assaulted (as in the #MeToo movement) they are viewed as deserving sympathy only if they are &quot;good&quot; women: non-sexual, and perhaps helpless.

In her 1974 book &quot;Woman Hating&quot;, Andrea Dworkin uses traditional fairy tales to illustrate misogyny. Fairy tales designate certain women as &quot;good&quot;, for example Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, who are inert, passive characters. Dworkin observed that these characters &quot;never think, act, initiate, confront, resist, challenge, feel, care, or question. Sometimes they are forced to do housework.&quot; In contrast, the &quot;evil&quot; women who populate fairy tales are queens, witches, and other women with power. Further, men in fairy tales are said to be good kings and good husbands irrespective of their actions. For Dworkin, this illustrates that under misogyny only powerless women are allowed to be seen as good. No similar judgement is applied to men.
In her book &quot;Right-Wing Women&quot;, Dworkin adds that powerful women are tolerated by misogynists provided women use their power to reinforce the power of men and to oppose feminism. Dworkin gives Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant as examples of powerful women tolerated by anti-feminists only because they advocated for their own oppression. Women may even be worshipped or called superior to men if they are sufficiently &quot;good&quot;, meaning obedient or inert.

Philosopher Kate Manne argues that the word &quot;misogyny&quot; as used by modern feminists denotes not a generalised hatred of women, but instead the system of distinguishing good from bad women. Misogyny is like a police force, Manne writes, that rewards or punishes women based on these judgements.

===Patriarchal bargain===

In the late 20th century, second-wave feminist theorists argued that misogyny is both a cause and a result of patriarchal social structures.

Economist Deniz Kandiyoti has written that colonisers of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia kept conquered armies of men under control by offering them complete power over women. She calls this the &quot;patriarchal bargain&quot;. Men who were interested in accepting the bargain were promoted to leadership by colonial powers, causing the colonised societies to become more misogynistic.

===Contempt for the feminine===
Julia Serano defines misogyny as not only hatred of women per se, but the &quot;tendency to dismiss and deride femaleness and femininity.&quot; In this view, misogyny also causes homophobia against gay men because gay men are stereotyped as feminine and weak; misogyny likewise causes anxiety among straight men that they will be seen as unmanly. Serano&#x27;s book &quot;Whipping Girl&quot; argues that most anti-trans sentiment directed at trans women should be understood as misogyny. By embracing femininity, the book argues, trans women cast doubt on the superiority of masculinity.
Culture rewards traits that are considered masculine and devalues traits that seem feminine, according to Tracy M. Hallstead at Quinnipiac University. From childhood, boys and men are told to &quot;man up&quot; to appear tough by distancing themselves from feminine things. Boys learn that it is shameful to be seen as emotional, dependent, or vulnerable. Men raised in this way may disown femininity and may even learn to despise it. In this view, misogyny is directed not only at women, but at any feminine qualities that men see within themselves.

This contempt for the feminine causes men feel that they must assert their dominance over women by controlling them, Hallstead writes. She illustrates this with the ancient story of Pygmalion, a sculptor who hated &quot;the faults beyond measure which nature has given to women.&quot; Pygmalion creates a sculpture of a woman that magically comes alive. Pygmalion is very gratified by the complete control he has over the woman, Galatea, because this control re-enforces his masculinity. He considers Galatea the perfect woman, in spite of his contempt for women, because of his absolute power over her.

== English and Welsh law ==
In recent years, there has been increasing discussion in England and Wales of misogyny being added to the list of aggravating factors that are commonly referred to by the media as &quot;hate crimes&quot;. Aggravating factors in criminal sentencing currently include hostility to a victim due to characteristics such as sexuality, race or disability.

In 2016, Nottinghamshire Police began a pilot project to record misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether the action was a criminal offence. Over two years (April 2016-March 2018) there were 174 reports made, of which 73 were classified as crimes and 101 as incidents.

In September 2018, it was announced that the Law Commission would conduct a review into whether misogynistic conduct, as well as hostility due to ageism, misandry or towards groups such as goths, should be treated as a hate crime.

In October 2018, two senior police officers, Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs&#x27; Council, and Cressida Dick, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, stated that police forces should focus on more serious crimes such as burglary and violent offences, and not on recording incidents which are not crimes. Thornton said that &quot;treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations&quot;, but that police forces &quot;do not have the resources to do everything&quot;.

In September 2020 the Law Commission proposed that sex or gender be added to the list of protected characteristics. At the time of the Law Commission&#x27;s proposals seven police forces in England and Wales classed misogyny as a hate crime, but that definition had not been adopted across the board. The commission plans to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021.

A Home Office spokesperson in October 2021 stated that police forces had been requested to record any crime the victim understood was driven by hostility to their sex.

== Criticism of the concept ==

Camille Paglia, a self-described &quot;dissident feminist&quot; who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that there are serious flaws in the Marxism-inspired interpretation of misogyny that is prevalent in second-wave feminism. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not &quot;hate&quot; women but &quot;fear&quot; them. Christian Groes-Green has argued that misogyny must be seen in relation to its opposite which he terms philogyny. Criticising R. W. Connell&#x27;s theory of hegemonic masculinities, he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.

<text>Martinique ( ; ; or ; Kalinago: or ) is an island in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies, in the eastern Caribbean Sea. A part of the French West Indies (Antilles), Martinique is an overseas department and region and a single territorial collectivity of the French Republic. It is a part of the European Union as an outermost region within the special territories of members of the European Economic Area, and an associate member of the CARICOM, but is not part of the Schengen Area or the European Union Customs Union. The currency in use is the euro.

Martinique has a land area of and a population of 349,925 inhabitants as of January 2024. One of the Windward Islands, it lies directly north of Saint Lucia, northwest of Barbados and south of Dominica. Virtually the entire population speaks both French (the sole official language) and Martinican Creole. 
==Etymology==
It is thought that Martinique is a corruption of the Taíno name for the island (/, meaning &#x27;island of flowers&#x27;, or , &#x27;island of women&#x27;), as relayed to Christopher Columbus when he visited the island in 1502. According to historian Sydney Daney, the island was called or &quot;Iouanacaera&quot; by the Caribs, which means &#x27;the island of iguanas&#x27;.

==History==
===Pre-European contact and early colonial periods===
The island was occupied first by Arawaks, then by Caribs. The Arawaks came from Central America in the 1st century AD and the Caribs came from the Venezuelan coast around the 11th century.

Christopher Columbus charted Martinique (without landing) in 1493, during his second voyage, but Spain had little interest in the territory. Columbus landed during a later voyage, on 15 June 1502, after a 21-day trade wind passage, his fastest ocean voyage. He spent three days there refilling his water casks, bathing and washing laundry.

The Indigenous people Columbus encountered called Martinique &quot;Matinino&quot;. He was told by Indigenous people of
San Salvador that &quot;the island of Matinino was entirely populated by women on whom the Caribs descended at certain seasons of the year; and if these women bore sons they were entrusted to the father to bring up.&quot;

In 1635, Spain formally ceded Martinique to France after 133 years of Spanish rule. On 15 September 1635, Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc, French governor of the island of St. Kitts, landed in the harbour of St. Pierre with 80 to 150 French settlers after being driven off St. Kitts by the English. D&#x27;Esnambuc claimed Martinique for the French king Louis XIII and the French &quot;Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique&quot; (Company of the American Islands), and established the first European settlement at Fort Saint-Pierre (now St. Pierre). D&#x27;Esnambuc died in 1636, leaving the company and Martinique in the hands of his nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who in 1637 became governor of the island.

In 1636, in the first of many skirmishes, the Indigenous Kalinago rose against the settlers to drive them off the island. The French repelled the natives and forced them to retreat to the eastern part of the island, on the Caravelle Peninsula in the region then known as the Capesterre. When the Caribs revolted against French rule in 1658, the governor Charles Houël du Petit Pré retaliated with war against them. Many were killed, and those who survived were taken captive and expelled from the island. Some Caribs fled to Dominica or St. Vincent, where the French agreed to leave them at peace.

After the death of du Parquet in 1658, his widow Marie Bonnard du Parquet tried to govern Martinique, but dislike of her rule led King Louis XIV to take over the sovereignty of the island. In 1654, Dutch Jews expelled from Portuguese Brazil introduced sugar plantations worked by large numbers of enslaved Africans.

In 1667, the Second Anglo-Dutch War spilled out into the Caribbean, with Britain attacking the pro-Dutch French fleet in Martinique, virtually destroying it and further cementing British preeminence in the region. In 1674, the Dutch attempted to conquer the island, but were repulsed.

Because there were few Catholic priests in the French Antilles, many of the earliest French settlers were Huguenots who sought religious freedom. Others were transported there as a punishment for refusing to convert to Catholicism, many of them dying en route. Those who survived were quite industrious and over time prospered, though the less fortunate were reduced to the status of indentured servants. Although edicts from King Louis XIV&#x27;s court regularly came to the islands to suppress the Protestant &quot;heretics&quot;, these were mostly ignored by island authorities until Louis XIV&#x27;s Edict of Revocation in 1685.

As many of the planters on Martinique were Huguenots suffering under the harsh strictures of the Revocation, they began plotting to emigrate from Martinique with many of their recently arrived brethren. Many of them were encouraged by the Catholics, who looked forward to their departure and the opportunities for seizing their property. By 1688, nearly all of Martinique&#x27;s French Protestant population had escaped to the British American colonies or Protestant countries in Europe. The policy decimated the population of Martinique and the rest of the French Antilles and set back their colonisation by decades, causing the French king to relax his policies in the region, which left the islands susceptible to British occupation over the next century.

===Post-1688 period===
Under governor of the Antilles Charles de Courbon, comte de Blénac, Martinique served as a home port for French pirates, including Captain Crapeau, Étienne de Montauban, and Mathurin Desmarestz. In later years, pirate Bartholomew Roberts styled his jolly roger as a black flag depicting a pirate standing on two skulls labeled &quot;ABH&quot; and &quot;AMH&quot; for &quot;A Barbadian&#x27;s Head&quot; and &quot;A Martinican&#x27;s Head&quot; after governors of those two islands sent warships to capture Roberts.

On 28 November 1717 the pirate Blackbeard and his pirates captured a French frigate named &quot;La Concorde&quot; near the island of Martinique in the West Indies. After selling her cargo of slaves on the island, Blackbeard made the vessel his flagship, added more heavy cannons and renamed her &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

Martinique was attacked or occupied several times by the British, in 1693, 1759, 1762 and 1779. Excepting a period from 1802 to 1809 following signing of the Treaty of Amiens, Britain controlled the island for most of the time from 1794 to 1815, when it was traded back to France at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars. Martinique has remained a French possession since then.

Despite the introduction of successful coffee plantations to Martinique in the 1720s, making it the first coffee-growing area in the Western hemisphere, the planter class lost political influence as sugar prices declined in the early 1800s. Slave rebellions in 1789, 1815 and 1822, plus the campaigns of abolitionists such as Cyrille Bissette and Victor Schœlcher, persuaded the French government to end slavery in the French West Indies in 1848. Martinique was the first French overseas territory in which the abolition decree came into force, on 23 May 1848.

As a result, some plantation owners imported workers from India and China. Despite the abolition of slavery, life scarcely improved for most Martinicans; class and racial tensions exploded into rioting in southern Martinique in 1870 following the arrest of Léopold Lubin, a trader of African ancestry who retaliated after he was beaten by a Frenchman. After several deaths, the revolt was crushed by French militia.

===20th–21st centuries===
On 8 May 1902, Mont Pelée erupted and completely destroyed St. Pierre, killing 30,000 people. Refugees from Martinique travelled by boat to the southern villages of Dominica, and some of them remained permanently on the island. The only survivor in the town of Saint-Pierre, Ludger Sylbaris, was saved by the thick walls of his prison cell. Shortly thereafter, the capital shifted to Fort-de-France, where it remains today.

During World War II, the pro-Nazi Vichy government controlled Martinique under Admiral Georges Robert. German U-boats used Martinique for refuelling and re-supply during the Battle of the Caribbean. In 1942, 182 ships were sunk in the Caribbean, dropping to 45 in 1943, and five in 1944. Free French forces took over on the island on Bastille Day, 14 July 1943.

In 1946, the French National Assembly voted unanimously to transform the colony into an Overseas Department of France. Meanwhile, the post-war period saw a growing campaign for full independence; a notable proponent of this was the author Aimé Césaire, who founded the Progressive Party of Martinique in the 1950s. Tensions boiled over in December 1959 when riots broke out following a racially-charged altercation between two motorists, resulting in three deaths. In 1962, as a result of this and the global turn against colonialism, the strongly pro-independence OJAM () was formed. Its leaders were later arrested by the French authorities. However, they were later acquitted. Tensions rose again in 1974, when gendarmes shot dead two striking banana workers. However the independence movement lost steam as Martinique&#x27;s economy faltered in the 1970s, resulting in large-scale emigration. Hurricanes in 1979–80 severely affected agricultural output, further straining the economy. Greater autonomy was granted by France to the island in the 1970s–80s.

In 2009, Martinique was convulsed by the French Caribbean general strikes. Initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, the movement soon took on a racial dimension as strikers challenged the continued economic dominance of the &quot;Béké&quot;, descendants of French European settlers. President Nicolas Sarkozy later visited the island, promising reform. While ruling out full independence, which he said was desired neither by France nor by Martinique, Sarkozy offered Martiniquans a referendum on the island&#x27;s future status and degree of autonomy.

On 2 February 2023, Martinique adopted its independent activist flag, symbolising its three colors of Pan-Africanism.
==Governance==


Like French Guiana, Martinique is a special collectivity (Unique in French) of the French Republic. It is also an outermost region of the European Union. The inhabitants of Martinique are French citizens with full political and legal rights. Martinique sends four deputies to the French National Assembly and two senators to the French Senate.

On 24 January 2010, during a referendum, the inhabitants of Martinique approved by 68.4% the change to be a &quot;special (unique) collectivity&quot; within the framework of article 73 of the French Republic&#x27;s Constitution. The new council replaces and exercises the powers of both the General Council and the regional council.

===Administrative divisions===

Martinique is divided into 4 &quot;arrondissements&quot; and 34 &quot;communes&quot;. It had also been divided into 45 &quot;cantons&quot;, but these were abolished in 2015. The four arrondissements of the island, with their respective locations, are as follows:
* Fort-de-France is the prefecture of Martinique. It takes up the central zone of the island. It includes four communes. In 2019, the population was 152,102. Besides the capital, it includes the communities of Saint-Joseph and Schœlcher.
* La Trinité, one of the three subprefectures on the island, occupies the northeast region. It has ten communes. In 2019, the population was 75,238. La Trinité contains the communities of La Trinité, Ajoupa-Bouillon, Basse-Pointe, Le Gros-Morne, Le Lorrain, Macouba, Le Marigot, Le Robert and Sainte-Marie.
* Le Marin, the second subprefecture of Martinique, makes up the southern part of the island and is composed of twelve communes. In 2019, the population was 114,824. The subprefecture includes the communities of La Marin, Les Anses d&#x27;Arlet, Le Diamant, Ducos, Le François, Rivière-Pilote, Rivière-Salée, Sainte-Anne, Sainte-Luce, Saint-Esprit, Les Trois-Îlets, and Le Vauclin.
* Saint-Pierre is the third subprefecture of the island. It comprises eight communes, lying in the northwest of Martinique. In 2019, the population was 22,344. In addition to Saint-Pierre, its communities include Le Carbet, Case-Pilote-Bellefontaine, Le Morne-Rouge, and Le Prêcheur.


=== Representation of the State ===
The prefecture of Martinique is Fort-de-France. The three sub-prefectures are Le Marin, Saint-Pierre and La Trinité. The French State is represented in Martinique by a prefect (Stanislas Cazelles since 5 February 2020), and by two sub-prefects in Le Marin (Corinne Blanchot-Prosper) and La Trinité / Saint-Pierre (Nicolas Onimus, appointed on 20 May 2020).

The prefecture was criticized for racism following the publication on its Twitter account of a poster calling for physical distancing against the coronavirus and showing a black man and a white man separated by pineapples.

=== Institutions ===

The President of the Executive Council of Martinique is Serge Letchimy as of 2 July 2021.

The Executive Council of Martinique is composed of nine members (a president and eight executive councilors).

The deliberative assembly of the territorial collectivity is the Assembly of Martinique, composed of 51 elected members and chaired by Lucien Saliber as of 2 July 2021.

The advisory council of the territorial collectivity of Martinique is the Economic, Social, Environmental, Cultural and Educational Council of Martinique (Conseil économique, social, environnemental, de la culture et de l&#x27;éducation de Martinique), composed of 68 members. Its president is Justin Daniel since 20 May 2021.

==== National representation ====
Martinique has been represented since 17 June 2017, in the National Assembly by four deputies (Serge Letchimy, Jean-Philippe Nilor, Josette Manin and Manuéla Kéclard-Mondésir) and in the Senate by two senators (Maurice Antiste and Catherine Conconne) since 24 September 2017.

Martinique is also represented in the Economic, Social and Environmental Council by Pierre Marie-Joseph since 26 April 2021.

=== Institutional and statutory evolution of the island ===
During the 2000s, the political debate in Martinique focused on the question of the evolution of the island&#x27;s status. Two political ideologies, assimilationism and autonomism, clashed. On the one hand, there are those who want a change of status based on Article 73 of the French Constitution, i.e., that all French laws apply in Martinique as of right, which in law is called legislative identity, and on the other hand, the autonomists who want a change of status based on Article 74 of the French Constitution, i.e., an autonomous status subject to the regime of legislative specialty following the example of St. Martin and St. Barthelemy.

Since the constitutional revision of 28 March 2003, Martinique has four options:
* First possibility: the status quo, Martinique retains its status as an Overseas Department and Region, under Article 73 of the Constitution. The DROMs are under the regime of legislative identity. In this framework, the laws and regulations are applicable as of right, with the adaptations required by the particular characteristics and constraints of the communities concerned.
* Second possibility: if the local stakeholders, and first and foremost the elected representatives, agree, they can, within the framework of Article 73 of the Constitution, propose an institutional evolution such as the creation of a single assembly (merger of the general council and the regional council). However, the department and the region will remain. The government may propose to the President of the Republic to consult the voters on this issue. In case of a negative answer, nothing will be possible. In case of positive response, the final decision will be taken by the Parliament, which will finally decide whether the reform is carried out by passing an ordinary law.
* Third possibility: those elected may propose the creation of a new collectivity within the framework of Article 73 of the French Constitution. This new community will replace the department and the region. It will bring together the competences currently attributed to the General Council and the Regional Council. This community governed by Article 73 is subject to the regime of legislative identity and is therefore not autonomous. It will have as institutions an executive council, a deliberative assembly and an economic and social council.
* Fourth possibility: if a consensus is reached, the elected representatives may propose to the government a change of status, i.e., the transformation of Martinique into an overseas collectivity (COM). Indeed, since the constitutional revision of 28 March 2003, the overseas departments may, under Article 74, become an overseas collectivity (COM) like St. Martin and St. Barthélemy.

Unlike the overseas departments, the overseas collectivities are subject to legislative specialization. The laws and decrees of the Republic apply to them under certain conditions established by the organic law defining their status. The overseas departments have a greater degree of autonomy than the DOMs. They have an executive council, a territorial council and an economic and social council. The prefect is the representative of the French State in the overseas collectivity.

However, the French Constitution specifies in Article 72-4 that &quot;no change may be made, for all or part of one of the communities mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 72-3, from one of the regimes provided for in Articles 73 and 74, without the prior consent of the electors of the community or part of the community concerned having been obtained, under the conditions provided for in the following paragraph.

In 2003, a new organization is envisaged, in which the regional and departmental institutions would be merged into a single institution. This proposal was rejected in Martinique (but also in Guadeloupe) by 50.48% in a referendum held on 7 December 2003.

On 10 January 2010, a consultation of the population was held. Voters were asked to vote in a referendum on a possible change in the status of their territory. The ballot proposed voters to &quot;approve or reject the transition to the regime provided for in Article 74 of the Constitution&quot;. The majority of voters, 79.3%, said &quot;no&quot;.

The following 24 January, in a second referendum, 68.4% of the population of Martinique approved the transition to a &quot;single collectivity&quot; under Article 73 of the Constitution, i.e., a single assembly that would exercise the powers of the General Council and the Regional Council.

=== New collectivity of Martinique ===
The project of the elected representatives of Martinique to the government proposes a single territorial community governed by Article 73 of the Constitution, whose name is &quot;Territorial Community of Martinique&quot;. The single assembly that replaces the General Council and the Regional Council is called the &quot;Assembly of Martinique&quot;. The Assembly of Martinique is composed of 51 councilors, elected for a six-year term of office by the proportional representation system (the electoral district is divided into four sections). A majority bonus of 20% is granted to the first place list.

The executive body of this community is called the &quot;executive council&quot;, which is composed of nine executive councilors, including a president. The president of the community of Martinique is the president of the executive council. The executive council is responsible to the Assembly of Martinique, which may overrule it by a motion of constructive censure. Unlike the previous functioning of the General Council and the Regional Council, the Assembly of Martinique is separate from the Executive Council and is headed by a bureau and a president.

The new collectivity of Martinique combines the powers of the general and regional councils, but may obtain new powers through empowerments under Article 73. The executive council is assisted by an advisory council, the Economic, Social, Environmental, Cultural and Educational Council of Martinique.

The bill was approved on 26 January 2011, by the French Government. The ordinary law was submitted to Parliament during the first half of 2011 and resulted in the adoption of Law No. 2011-884 27 July 2011, on the territorial communities of French Guiana and Martinique.

=== Political forces ===
Political life in Martinique is essentially based on Martinican political parties and local federations of national parties (PS and LR). The following classification takes into account their position with regard to the statutory evolution of the island: there are the assimilationists (in favor of an institutional or statutory evolution within the framework of Article 73 of the French Constitution), the autonomists and the independentists (in favor of a statutory evolution based on Article 74 of the French Constitution).

Indeed, on 18 December 2008, during the congress of Martinique&#x27;s departmental and regional elected representatives, the thirty-three pro-independence elected representatives (MIM/CNCP/MODEMAS/PALIMA) of the two assemblies voted unanimously in favor of a change in the island&#x27;s status based on Article 74 of the French Constitution, which allows access to autonomy; this change in status was massively rejected (79.3%) by the population during the referendum of 10 January 2010.

=== Defence ===
The defence of the department is the responsibility of the French Armed Forces. Some 1,400 military personnel are deployed in Martinique and Guadeloupe – centred on the 33e régiment d&#x27;infanterie de Marine in Martinique and incorporating a reserve company of the regiment located in Guadeloupe.

Five French Navy vessels are based in Martinique, including: the surveillance frigates and , the patrol and support ship &quot;Dumont d&#x27;Urville&quot;, the &quot;Combattante&quot; and the coastal harbor tug (RPC) &quot;Maïtos&quot;. The naval aviation element includes Eurocopter AS565 Panther and Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin helicopters able to embark on the two &quot;Floréal&quot;-class surveillance frigates as required. One &quot;Engins de Débarquement Amphibie – Standards&quot; (EDA-S) landing craft is to be delivered to naval forces based in Martinique by 2025. The landing craft is to better support operations in the territory and region.

About 700 National Gendarmerie are also stationed in Martinique.

==Geography==

Part of the archipelago of the Antilles, Martinique is located in the Caribbean Sea about northeast of the coast of South America and about southeast of the Dominican Republic. It is north of St. Lucia, northwest of Barbados and south of Dominica.

The total area of Martinique is , of which is water and the rest land. Martinique is the 3rd largest island in The Lesser Antilles after Trinidad and Guadeloupe. It stretches in length and in width. The highest point is the volcano of Mount Pelée at above sea level. There are numerous small islands, particularly off the east coast.The Atlantic, or &quot;windward&quot; coast of Martinique is difficult to navigate by ship. A combination of coastal cliffs, shallow coral reefs and cays, and strong winds make the area notoriously hazardous for sea traffic. The Caravelle peninsula clearly separates the north Atlantic and south Atlantic coast.
The Caribbean, or &quot;leeward&quot; coast of Martinique is much more favourable to sea traffic. Besides being shielded from the harsh Atlantic trade winds by the island, the sea bed itself descends steeply from the shore. This ensures that most potential hazards are deep underwater, and prevents the growth of corals.

The north of the island is especially mountainous. It features four ensembles of &quot;pitons&quot; (volcanoes) and &quot;mornes&quot; (mountains): the Piton Conil on the extreme North, which dominates the Dominica Channel; Mont Pelée, an active volcano; the Morne Jacob; and the Pitons du Carbet, an ensemble of five extinct volcanoes covered with rainforest and dominating the Bay of Fort de France at . Mont Pelée&#x27;s volcanic ash has created grey and black sand beaches in the north (in particular between Anse Ceron and Anse des Gallets), contrasting markedly from the white sands of Les Salines in the south.
The south is more easily traversed, though it still features impressive geographic features. Because it is easier to travel to, and due to the many beaches and food facilities throughout this region, the south receives most of the tourism. The beaches from Pointe de Bout, through Diamant (which features right off the coast of Roche de Diamant), St. Luce, the department of St. Anne and down to Les Salines are popular.

=== Relief ===

The terrain is mountainous on this island of volcanic origin. The oldest areas correspond to the volcanic zones at the southern end of the island and towards the peninsula of La Caravelle to the east. The island developed over the last 20 million years according to a sequence of movements and volcanic eruptions to the north.

The volcanic activity is due to the subduction fault located here, where the South American Plate slides beneath the Caribbean Plate. Martinique has eight centres of volcanic activity. The oldest rocks are andesitic lavas dated to about 24 million years ago, mixed with tholeiitic magma containing iron and magnesium. Mount Pelée, the island&#x27;s most dramatic feature, formed about 400,000 years ago. Pelée erupted in 1792, 1851, and twice in 1902. The eruption of 8 May 1902, destroyed Saint-Pierre and killed 28,000 people in 2 minutes; that of 30 August 1902, killed nearly 1,100, mostly in Le Morne-Rouge and Ajoupa-Bouillon.

The east coast, coast of the wind or of the islands, has been called in the Caribbean &quot;cabesterre&quot;. This term in Martinique designates more specifically the area of La Caravelle. This windward coast, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean, is directly exposed to the trade winds and the sea bottom. The northern part of the Grand River in Sainte-Marie is basically surrounded by cliffs, with very few mooring points; access to maritime navigation is limited to inshore fishing with small traditional Martinique boats.

===Flora and fauna===


The northern end of the island catches most of the rainfall and is heavily forested, featuring species such as bamboo, mahogany, rosewood and West Indian locust. The south is drier and dominated by savanna-like brush, including cacti, Copaiba balsam, logwood and acacia.

Anole lizards and fer-de-lance snakes are native to the island. Mongooses (&quot;Urva auropunctata&quot;), introduced in the 1800s to control the snake population, have become a particularly cumbersome introduced species as they prey upon bird eggs and have exterminated or endangered a number of native birds, including the Martinique trembler, white-breasted trembler and White-breasted Thrasher. Bat species include the Jamaican fruit bat, the Antillean fruit-eating bat, the Little yellow-shouldered bat, Davy&#x27;s naked-backed bat, the Greater bulldog bat, Schwartz&#x27;s myotis, and the Mexican free-tailed bat.

=== Beaches ===
Martinique has many beaches: those in the south of the island have white sand, unlike those in the north which are of volcanic origin and therefore have black or gray sand.

Most of the beaches are wild, without services and without surveillance, but some are organized and enable water-sports and marine activities.

=== Hydrography ===
Due to the island&#x27;s geographic and morphological characteristics, it has short and torrential rivers. The Lézarde, 30 km long, is the longest on the island.

=== Major urban areas ===

The most populous urban unit is Le Robert, which covers 11 communes in the southeastern part of the department. The three largest urban units are:

==Economy==

In 2014, Martinique had a total GDP of 8.4 billion euros. Its economy is heavily dependent on tourism, limited agricultural production, and grant aid from mainland France.

Historically, Martinique&#x27;s economy relied on agriculture, notably sugar and bananas, but by the beginning of the 21st century this sector had dwindled considerably. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to mainland France. Chlordecone, a pesticide used in the cultivation of bananas before a ban in 1993, has been found to have contaminated farming ground, rivers and fish, and affected the health of islanders. Fishing and agriculture has had to stop in affected areas, having a significant effect on the economy. The bulk of meat, vegetable and grain requirements must be imported. This contributes to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from mainland France.

All goods entering Martinique are charged a variable &quot;sea toll&quot; which may reach 30% of the value of the cargo and provides 40% of the island&#x27;s total revenue. Additionally the government charges an &quot;annual due&quot; of 1–2.5% and a value added tax of 2.2–8.5%.

=== Exports and imports ===
Exports of goods and services in 2015 amounted to €1,102 million (€504 million of goods), of which more than 20% were refined petroleum products (SARA refinery located in the town of Le Lamentin), €95.9 million of agricultural, forestry, fish and aquaculture products, €62.4 million of agri-food industry products and €54.8 million of other goods.

Imports of goods and services in 2015 were €3,038 million (of which €2,709 million were goods), of which approximately 40% were crude and refined petroleum products, €462.6 million were agricultural and agri-food products, and €442.8 million were mechanical, electrical, electronic and computer equipment.

===Tourism===

Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. Most visitors come from mainland France, Canada and the United States. Roughly 16% of the total businesses on the island (some 6,000 companies) provide tourist-related services.

=== Agriculture ===

==== Banana ====
Banana cultivation is the main agricultural activity, with more than 7,200 hectares cultivated, nearly 220,000 tons produced and almost 12,000 jobs (direct + indirect) in 2006 figures. Its weight in the island&#x27;s economy is low (1.6%); however, it generates more than 40% of the agricultural value added.

==== Rum ====
Rum, and particularly agricultural rum, accounted for 23% of agri-food value added in 2005 and employed 380 people on the island (including traditional rum). The island&#x27;s production is about 90,000 hl of pure alcohol in 2009, of which 79,116 hl of pure alcohol is agricultural rum (2009).

==== Sugarcane ====
In 2009, sugarcane cultivation occupied 4,150 hectares, or 13.7% of agricultural land. The area under cultivation has increased by more than 20% in the last 20 years, a rapid increase explained by the high added value of the rum produced and the rise in world sugar prices. This production is increasingly concentrated, with farms of more than 50 hectares accounting for 6.2% of the farms and 73.4% of the area under production. Annual production was about 220,000 tons in 2009, of which almost 90,000 tons went to sugar production, and the rest was delivered to agricultural rum distilleries.

==== Pineapples ====
Pineapples used to be an important part of agricultural production. However, according to IEDOM, in 2005, they accounted for only 1% of agricultural production in value (2.5 million euros compared to 7.9 million in 2000).

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
Martinique&#x27;s main and only airport with commercial flights is Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport. It serves flights to and from Europe, the Caribbean, Venezuela, the United States, and Canada. See List of airports in Martinique.

Fort-de-France is the major harbour. The island has regular ferry service to Guadeloupe, Dominica and St. Lucia. There are also several local ferry companies that connect Fort-de-France with Pointe du Bout.

The road network is extensive and well-maintained, with freeways in the area around Fort-de-France. Buses run frequently between the capital and St. Pierre.

==== Roads ====
In 2019, Martinique&#x27;s road network consisted of 2,123 km:
* 7 km of highway (A1 between Fort-de-France and Le Lamentin) ;
* 919 km of departmental and national roads
* 1,197 km of communal roads.

In proportion to its population, Martinique is the French department with the highest number of vehicle registrations.

In 2019, 19,137 new vehicles were registered in Martinique, i.e. 42 new vehicles were purchased per 1,000 inhabitants (+14 in five years), to the great benefit of dealers.

==== Public transport ====
The public entity &quot;Martinique Transport&quot; was created in December 2014. This establishment is in charge of urban, intercity passenger (cabs), maritime, school and disabled student transport throughout the island, as well as the bus network.

The first exclusive right-of-way public transport line in Martinique (TCSP), served by high service level buses between Fort-de-France and Le Lamentin airport, was put into service on 13 August 2018. Extensions to Schœlcher, Robert and Ducos are planned.

==== Ports ====
Given the insular nature of Martinique, its supply by sea is important. The port of Fort-de-France is the seventh largest French port in terms of container traffic. After 2012, it became the Grand Port Maritime Port (GPM) of Martinique, following the State&#x27;s decision to modernize port infrastructures of national interest.

==== Air services ====
The island&#x27;s airport is Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport. It is located in the municipality of Le Lamentin. Its civilian traffic (1,696,071 passengers in 2015) ranks it thirteenth among French airports, behind those of two other overseas departments (Guadeloupe – Pôle Caraïbes de Pointe-à-Pitre Airport, Guadeloupe, and La Réunion-Roland-Garros Airport). Its traffic is very strongly polarized by metropolitan France, with very limited (192,244 passengers in 2017) and declining international traffic.

==== Railroads ====
At the beginning of the 20th century, Martinique had more than 240 km of railways serving the sugar factories (cane transport). Only one tourist train remains in Sainte-Marie between the Saint-James house and the banana museum.

===Communications===
The country code top-level domain for Martinique is .mq, but .fr is often used instead. The country code for international dialling is 596. The entire island uses a single area code (also 596) for landline phones and 696 for cell phones. (596 is dialled twice when calling a Martinique landline from another country.)

==== Mobile telephony ====
There are three mobile telephone networks in Martinique: Orange, SFR Caraïbe and Digicel. The arrival of Free, in partnership with Digicel, was planned for 2020.45

According to Arcep, by mid-2018, Martinique is 99% covered by 4G.

==== Television ====
The DTT package includes 10 free channels: 4 national channels of the France Télévisions group, the news channel France 24, Arte and 4 local channels Martinique 1re, ViàATV, KMT Télévision. Zouk TV stopped broadcasting in April 2021 and will be subsequently replaced by Zitata TV, whose broadcasting is delayed following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viewers in Martinique do not have free access to other free national channels in the DTT package in mainland France (TF1 group, M6 group, etc.).

Viewers in the French overseas territories also do not have free access to the public service cultural channel Culturebox, which is not broadcast locally on DTT.

The French-language satellite package Canal+ Caraïbes is available in the territory.

==== Telephone and Internet ====
In early 2019, Orange put into service &quot;Kanawa&quot;, a new submarine cable linking Martinique to French Guiana.

Martinique is also connected by other submarine cables: ECFS (en), Americas-2 (en) and Southern Caribbean Fiber.

==Demographics==

===Population===
Martinique had a population of 349,925 as of January 2024. The population has been decreasing by 0.9% per year since 2013. There are an estimated 260,000 people of Martinican origin living in mainland France, most of them in the Paris region. Emigration was highest in the 1970s, causing population growth to almost stop, but it is comparatively light today.

===Ethnic groups===
The population of Martinique is mainly of African descent generally mixed with European, Amerindian (Carib), Indian (descendants of 19th-century Tamil and Telugu immigrants from South India), Lebanese, Syrian or Chinese. Martinique also has a small Syro-Lebanese community, a small Indian community, a small but increasing Chinese community, and the &quot;Béké&quot; community, descendants of the first European settlers.

The Béké population represents around 1% of Martinique&#x27;s population, mostly of noble ancestry or members of the old bourgeoisie. In addition to the island population, the island hosts a mainland French community, most of which live on the island on a temporary basis (generally from 3 to 5 years).

===Religion===
About 90% of Martiniquans are Christian, predominantly Roman Catholic as well as smaller numbers of various Protestant denominations. There are much smaller communities of other faiths such as Islam, Hinduism and the Baháʼí Faith.

The island has 49 parishes and several historic places of worship, such as the Saint-Louis Cathedral of Fort de France, the Sacred Heart Church of Balata, and the Co-Cathedral of Our Lady of Assumption, Saint-Pierre.

==== Catholic Church ====
Catholic parishes are present in each municipality and village of the territory. The island has the following places of worship classified as historic monuments:
* Saint-Louis Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint Louis) in Fort-de-France, erected in 1850 by a bull of Pope Pius IX, is currently the seat of the archdiocese of Saint-Pierre and Fort-de-France since 1967.
* Church of the Sacré-coeur (Sacred Heart) in Balata
* Cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Assomption (Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption) in Saint-Pierre de la Martinique. The former church of Mouillage, located on the corner of Victor Hugo Street and Dupuy Street, in the Mouillage district of Saint-Pierre, was completed in 1956.
* Our Lady of the Assumption Church, in Sainte-Marie, a town in Martinique, dates to 1658.

The Archdiocese of Saint-Pierre and Fort-de-France (Latin: archidioecesis Sancti Petri et Arcis Gallicae seu Martinicensis) is an ecclesiastical circumscription of the Catholic Church in the Caribbean, based in Saint-Pierre and Fort-de-France, on the island of Martinique. The archdiocese of Saint-Pierre and Fort-de-France is metropolitan and its suffragan dioceses are Basse-Terre and Pointe-à-Pitre and Cayenne.

===Languages===

The official language of Martinique is French, which is spoken by most of the population. The department was integrated into France in 1946, and consequently became French. Most residents also speak Martinican Creole (&quot;Martinique Creole&quot;, &quot;Kréyol Mat&#x27;nik, Kreyòl&quot;), a form of Antillean Creole closely related to the varieties spoken in neighboring English-dominated islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica. Martiniquan Creole is based on French, Carib and African languages with elements of English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Also, unlike other varieties of French creole, such as Mauritian Creole, Martinican Creole is not readily understood by speakers of Standard French due to significant differences in grammar, syntax, vocabulary and pronunciation. It continues to be used in oral storytelling traditions and other forms of speech and to a lesser extent in writing.

French and Creole are in a diglossic situation in Martinique, where French is used in official dialogue and Martinican Creole is used in casual or familial contexts. Creole was a spoken language with a developed &quot;oraliture&quot;; it was not until the mid 20th century that it began to be written. Since then, decreolization of the language has taken place via the adoption of Standard French features, mostly unconsciously, but some speakers have noticed that they do not speak Creole like their parents once did.

Being an overseas department of France, the island has European, French, Spanish, Caribbean, Martinican, Black (African), Indian (Tamil) and Creole markers of identity, all being influenced by foreign factors, social factors, cultural factors and, as a reportedly important marker, linguistic practices. Martinican and Creole identities are specifically asserted through encouragement of Creole language and its use in literature, in a movement known as &quot;Créolité,&quot; that was started by Patrick Chamoiseau, Jean Bernabé and Raphaël Confiant. Martinican Creole used to be a shameful language, and it was not until the 1970s that it has been revalorized through literature and increasing code switching. People now speak Martinican Creole more often and in more contexts.

Speaking Creole in public schools was forbidden until 1982, which is thought to have discouraged parents from using Creole in the home. In collaboration with GEREC (&quot;Groupe d&#x27;Etudes et de Recherches en Espace Créolophone&quot;) Raphaël Confiant created KAPES KREYOL (CAPES for Creole, &quot;Certificat d&#x27;aptitude au professorat de l&#x27;enseignement du second degré)&quot;, which is an aptitude exam that allowed Creole teachers in secondary school. This debuted 9 February 2001. Recently, the education authority, &quot;Académie de la Martinique&quot;, launched &quot;Parcours Creole +&quot; in 2019, a project trialling bilingual education of children in French and Martinican. Rather than being a topic to be learned itself, Creole became a language that classes were taught in, such as arts, math, physical activity, etc. Parents can also choose the &quot;Parcours Anglais +&quot;, learning in classes conducted in French and English from kindergarten until their final year, as in the Creole + course. A &quot;Parcours Espagnol +&quot;, where children learn in and with French and Spanish, is in the planning stages.

Though Creole is normally not used in professional situations, members of the media and politicians have begun to use it more frequently as a way to redeem national identity and prevent cultural assimilation by mainland France.

==== Linguistic features of Martinican Creole ====
Martinican Creole has general locative marking (GLM, also called general locative adposition, goal/source (in)difference and motion-to=motion-from). This means that source locations, final locations and static entity locations are expressed morphologically identically. Some West African languages that are possibly contributors to Martinican Creole also present GLM. Martinican Creole locative marking exists in 3 morphological types, including:

# spatial prepositions as free morphemes;
#* These include &quot;&quot;an&quot; (in), &quot;adan&quot; (inside), &quot;douvan&quot; (in front), &quot;anba&quot; (under) and &quot;anlè&quot;&quot; (on).
# spatial morphemes &quot;a-&quot;, &quot;an(n)-&quot;, and &quot;o(z)-&quot; bound to the noun on their right;
#* Only bare lexemes that depict certain locations will take on these particles
# phonologically null locative markers
#* In ambiguous sentences, these are added to polysyllabic city names

==Culture==

As an overseas &quot;département&quot; of France, Martinique&#x27;s culture has blended the French, African and Caribbean influences. The city of Saint-Pierre (destroyed by a volcanic eruption of Mount Pelée), was often referred to as the &quot;Paris of the Lesser Antilles&quot;. Following traditional French custom, many businesses close at midday to allow a lengthy lunch, then reopen later in the afternoon.

Today, Martinique has a higher standard of living than most other Caribbean countries. French products are easily available, from Chanel fashions to Limoges porcelain. Studying in the &quot;métropole&quot; (mainland France, especially Paris) is common for young adults. Martinique has been a vacation hotspot for many years, attracting both upper-class French and more budget-conscious travelers.

===Cuisine===
Martinique has a hybrid cuisine, mixing elements of African, French, Carib Amerindian and Indian subcontinental traditions. One of its most famous dishes is the Colombo (compare kuzhambu () for gravy or broth), a unique curry of chicken (curry chicken), meat or fish with vegetables, spiced with a distinctive &quot;masala&quot; of Tamil origins, sparked with tamarind, and often containing wine, coconut milk, cassava and rum. A strong tradition of Martiniquan desserts includes cakes made with pineapple, rum, and a wide range of local ingredients.

===Literature===

Sisters Jeanne Nardal and Paulette Nardal were involved in the creation of the Négritude movement. Yva Léro was a writer and painter who co-founded the Women&#x27;s Union of Martinique. Anna Marie-Magdeleine wrote with her partner under the pseudonym Carbet.

Aimé Césaire is perhaps Martinique&#x27;s most famous writer; he was one of the main figures in the Négritude literary movement. René Ménil was a surrealist writer who founded the journal &quot;Tropiques&quot; with Aimé and Suzanne Césaire and later formulated the concept of Antillanité. Other surrealist writers of that era included Étienne Léro and Jules Monnerot, who co-founded the journal &quot;Légitime Défense&quot; with Simone Yoyotte and Ménil. Édouard Glissant was later influenced by Césaire and Ménil, and in turn had an influence on Patrick Chamoiseau, who founded the Créolité movement with Raphaël Confiant and Jean Bernabé. Raphaël Confiant was a poetry, prose and non-fiction writer who supports Creole and tries to bring both French and Martinican Creole together in his work. He is specifically known for his contribution to the Créolité movement.

Frantz Fanon, a prominent critic of colonialism and racism, was also from Martinique.

===Music===
Martinique has a large popular music industry, which gained in international renown after the success of zouk music in the later 20th century. Zouk&#x27;s popularity was particularly intense in France, where the genre became an important symbol of identity for Martinique and Guadeloupe. Zouk&#x27;s origins are in the folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe, especially Martinican chouval bwa, and Guadeloupan gwo ka. There&#x27;s also notable influence of the pan-Caribbean calypso tradition and Haitian kompa.

=== Film ===
Martinique has been the site for filming many films, including movies, TV shows, and documentaries. The Martinique Film Commission offers aid opportunities, including residence grants, writing assistance, development assistance and production assistance. 

=== Symbols and flags ===

Martinique adopted a new flag on February 2, 2023, featuring a red triangle at the hoist and two horizontal bands of green and black. The flag of France is also flown alongside it as the country&#x27;s parent country. A previous competition to create a flag in 2018 was annulled by the local administrative tribunal, but the island began a new public vote in 2022, with the hummingbird design being selected as the winner. However, the designer withdrew her design due to accusations of plagiarism, and the runner-up design, the rouge-vert-noir (&quot;red-green-black&quot;), was adopted. This flag is also the preferred symbol of Martinique&#x27;s independence movement.

== Sport ==
=== Association football ===
The Martinique national football team is affiliated with CONCACAF, but not FIFA, so it does not play in World Cup Qualifiers, but can play friendly matches and CONCACAF tournaments such as the CONCACAF Nations League and Gold Cup. Since Martiniquais people are French citizens, they may choose to represent France in international competitions. Several French players also have had roots in Martinique although they were born or raised in France. Among the most famous include Thierry Henry, Eric Abidal, Raphaël Varane, Sylvain Wiltord and Loïc Rémy, all of whom represented France on multiple occasions and in Henry&#x27;s case won the European Golden Boot twice. Henry and Varane also have won a FIFA World Cup each.

Martinique has its own soccer league known as the Ligue de Football de Martinique. The Martinique men&#x27;s soccer championship, known as the Regional 1 (R1) – Trophée Gérard Janvion, is a premier local soccer competition in the territory. It is held annually in the form of a championship between fourteen amateur clubs between the months of September and May. The competition is organized by the Martinique Football League and, although the clubs in the league are affiliated with the French Football Federation, there is no promotion to the French national championships.

At the end of the twenty-six-day (two-stage) championship, the top four teams qualify for the Ligue Antilles, while the bottom three are relegated to the lower division, the Régionale 2.

=== Surf ===

The Martinique Surf Pro is an international surfing competition held every year in April in Basse-Pointe (Martinique). It was created in 2015 by two Martinicans, Nicolas Ursulet and Nicolas Clémenté and is organized by the Caribbean Surf Project (CSP).51 It is the only Caribbean competition in the World Surf League, the world surfing championship. It is part of the World Qualifying Series calendar, the entry league to the WSL&#x27;s elite circuit, the Championship Tour.

=== Regattas ===
Le Tour de Yoles Rondes de Martinique is an annual sailing regatta, the island&#x27;s largest sporting event, which takes place in late July and early August and is very popular with spectators.

The event is organized by the &quot;Fédération des yoles rondes&quot;. Crews circumnavigate Martinique on a 180-kilometer course over eight stages. The race begins with a prologue time trial from the starting town.

The time trial determines the starting order of the first ten boats, and the time between starts is determined by the advantage of each boat over the next during the prologue; all Boats below the top ten start simultaneously. The next seven legs circumnavigate the island. The leg around the southern part of the island, starting in the commune of Le Diamant, passing through Sainte-Anne and finishing in Le François, is known as the Défi de l&#x27;Espace Sud (Southern Challenge Zone).
=== Handball ===
The Martinique Handball Championship, organized by the Martinique Handball League, concludes with the Poule des As (play-off) which determines the Martinique champion in the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s categories. The Poule des As is a very popular event in Martinique, the pavilions are filled for the finals held at the Palais des Sports de Lamentin.

The highest division is the Pré-Nationale, equivalent to the Pré-Nationale (or even the Nationale 3) in metropolitan France. The champions of the Poule des As come every year to Metropolitan France to play in the finals of the French Handball Championships of N1, N2 and N3 Women, N2 and N3 Men Metropolitan/Ultra Marines.

The winners (female and male) of the Martinique Handball Cup, receive a reward of 10 000 Euros. The main players of the Martinique Handball Championship in recent years have been: Katty Piejos, Cédric Sorhaindo, Joël Abati.

== Energy ==
Martinique is part of the zones not interconnected to the continental metropolitan network (ZNI), which must therefore produce the electricity they consume themselves. For this reason, the ZNI have specific legislation on electricity production and distribution.

Martinique&#x27;s energy mix is marked by a very strong importance of thermal energy production. At the same time, the island&#x27;s electricity consumption has decreased slightly. These results can be attributed to the information and awareness-raising efforts of the regions, the Agency for the Environment and Energy Management (ADEME) and energy companies in favor of energy savings, but also to the context of demographic decline of the territory.

Despite these results, the control of the Territory&#x27;s electricity consumption remains a central issue, given the Territory&#x27;s low energy potential compared to other overseas territories, such as Guadeloupe and Reunion.

Martinique and its inhabitants are therefore faced with a twofold need: to further strengthen the control of electricity consumption and at the same time develop renewable energies to reduce environmental pollution due to thermal electricity production.
=== Renewable energies ===
The exploitation of renewable energies in Martinique started late, as the characteristics of the island were previously considered unfavorable for their development. However, the efforts of the population and energy suppliers are moving towards a higher proportion of renewable energies in Martinique&#x27;s future energy mix.

Article 56 of the Grenelle I Law No. 2009-967 3 August 2009, on the implementation of the Grenelle Environment Forum, sets out the provisions for overseas: in the case of Martinique, the energy objective is to reach 50% renewable energy in final consumption by 2020. Energy autonomy is planned for 2030.

As Martinique&#x27;s electricity distribution grid is not interconnected with neighboring islands, let alone with the mainland&#x27;s metropolitan grid, the decree of 23 April 2008, applies to the management of so-called intermittent energies: wind, photovoltaic and marine: any solar and wind power production facility with a capacity exceeding 3 kWp and not equipped with a storage system is liable to be disconnected from the grid by the grid manager once the threshold of 30% of random active power injected into the grid has been reached.

Thus, the achievement of the objectives of the Grenelle I law is subject to the development of Structures with a maximum power of 3 kWp or less, or to the incorporation of storage devices in production facilities.

=== Water ===
90% of the water distributed by Martinique&#x27;s drinking water network comes from Rainwater intakes in five catchment areas. Thus, although there is no shortage of water, the situation becomes very critical in the Lenten period, with abstractions leading to the drying up of several rivers.

Water resources are abundant but unevenly distributed: Four municipalities (Saint-Joseph, Gros-Morne, le Lorrain and Fort-de-France) provide 85% of Martinique&#x27;s drinking water.

There is no water catchment in the south of the island. The water consumed in the South comes exclusively from abstractions from the North and the center (mainly from the Blanche River which flows into the Lézarde, the Capot, and the Dumauzé). Thus, 60% of the total is extracted from a single river (the Lézarde and its tributary, the Blanche river). This concentration of abstractions can constitute a risk in a crisis situation, such as a drought for example.

== Health ==
=== Regional health agency ===
A regional health agency for Martinique (Agence régionale de santé Martinique) was set up in 2010. It is responsible for applying French health policy in the territory, managing public health and health care regulations.

=== Healthcare professionals ===
As of 1 January 2018, Martinique had a workforce of 1,091 doctors. For each 100,000 people of its population, there was a density of 141 general practitioners, 150 specialists, 53 dentists, 1,156 state certified nurses and 90 pharmacists. Self-employed doctors are represented by URML Martinique, created under the Hospital, patients, health, territories bill. URML Martinique works in partnership with ARS Martinique, l&#x27;Assurance Maladie, the Ministry of Health and Local Authorities to manage regional health policy.

=== Health facilities ===
The University Hospital of Martinique (Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Martinique) is a teaching hospital based in Fort-de-France, in an agreement with the University of the French Antilles. It is the largest French- and English-speaking university hospital in the Caribbean, having more than 1600 beds. These include 680 medical, 273 surgical and 100 obstetrics beds, with another 30 in its intensive care unit. The hospital operates a 24-hour emergency service.

=== Chlordecone controversy ===

==== Actions of the French government ====
After the discovery of the toxicity of chlordecone, a dangerous insecticide, and the health risks it posed, the French state put in place certain measures to protect the Martinican and Guadeloupean populations, allocating nearly 100 million euros towards the implementation of these measures. The soils are regularly tested and subjected to strict regulations related to the standards of potability. Martinique is also subject to regular mapping processes to delineate highly contaminated areas. River fishing is also prohibited in order to limit health risks, as rivers represent high-risk contamination areas.

Since 2008, the French state has developed three action plans establishing strategies to protect local populations, raise awareness regarding the effects of chlordecone, as well as to support the agriculture and fisheries sectors.

A French parliamentary commission revealed in 2019 that more than 90% of Martinicans have been exposed to chlordecone, which was authorized for use between 1972 and 1993 in the banana plantations of the Antilles. The committee judged the three &quot;Chlordecone Plans&quot; launched by the State since 2008 to be inadequate; recommendations were provided via its rapporteur, Justine Benin MP, to address prevention and research into cleanup methods for a fourth plan, scheduled for 2020.

The parliamentary commission of inquiry called the French state into question for having authorized the sale of chlordecone as an insecticide, as its toxicity was known, but &quot;responsibilities are shared with economic actors. Firstly, industrialists, but also groups of planters and certain elected officials.&quot;

==== Health consequences ====
Chlordecone is known to have harmful effects on human health, with scientific research identifying it as an endocrine disruptor or hormonally-active chemical agent, as well as a probable carcinogen, particularly in relation to increasing chances of prostate cancer occurrence and recurrence. As an endocrine disruptor, chlordecone can also lead to delayed cognitive development in infants, an increased likelihood of pregnancy complications, and may disrupt the reproductive process.

The chlordecone molecule has physical and chemical characteristics that allow it to remain for several centuries in soil, river-water and groundwater, thus spreading beyond the location of the banana plantations where this insecticide was initially administered. Although chlordecone has not been used since the 1990s, the health risks remain. Chlordecone contamination occurs through contaminated food and drink.

==== Local community response ====
In the streets of Fort-de-France, approximately 5,000 to 15,000 residents of Martinique demonstrated in protest on 27 March 2021, denouncing the possible statute of limitations on a complaint filed by civil parties for the use of chlordecone in causing life endangerment (&quot;mise en danger de la vie d&#x27;autrui).&quot; The complaint was issued on 23 February 2006.

The French government&#x27;s actions in response to the historical authorization of chlordecone are often criticized by residents of Martinique and local associations involved in the &quot;Chlordecone Scandal.&quot; The lack of information transmitted to the population concerning the danger of chlordecone between 1993 and 2004 is one of the main concerns expressed.

The civil complaint in 2006 was issued by several associations from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, and was in response to the long-term impacts of government-authorized chlordecone use in polluting the islands&#x27; natural environments and affecting the health of inhabitants.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Martinique&#x27;s first cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) were confirmed in March 2020. The pandemic has since put provision of health services under significant stress; as of 2 September 2021, Martinique had recorded an excess mortality at all ages, and of all causes since the week beginning 26 July 2021.

==In popular culture==
* In 1887, the artist Paul Gauguin lived in Martinique. Gauguin painted the tropical landscape and the native women. The Paul Gauguin Interpretation Centre (former Gauguin Museum) is dedicated to his stay on the island.
* Aimé Césaire&#x27;s seminal poem &quot;Cahier d&#x27;un retour au pays natal (Notebook of a Return to the Native Land)&quot; envisions the poet&#x27;s imagined journey back to his homeland Martinique to find it in a state of colossal poverty and psychological inferiority due to the French colonial presence.
* Lafcadio Hearn in 1890 published a travel book titled &quot;Two Years in the French West Indies&quot;, in which Martinique [Martinique Sketches] is its main topic; his descriptions of the island, people and history are lively observations of life before the Mont Pelée eruption in 1902 that would change the island forever. The Library of America republished his works in 2009 entitled &quot;Hearn: American Writings&quot;.

<text>The economy of Martinique is mostly based in the services sector. Agriculture accounts for about 6% of Martinique&#x27;s GDP and the small industrial sector for 11%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is employed in the service sector and in administration.

<text>Martinique is a small Caribbean island that is an overseas department/region and single territorial collectivity of France. An integral part of the French Republic, Martinique is located in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies in the eastern Caribbean Sea. It has a land area of and a population of 376,480 inhabitants as of January 2016. One of the Windward Islands, it is directly north of Saint Lucia, northwest of Barbados and south of Dominica. Martinique is also an Outermost Region (OMR) of the European Union and a special territory of the European Union; the currency in use is the euro. Virtually the entire population speaks both French (the sole official language) and Martinican Creole.

Given its geography, the balance of its transport network is unusual: there are three airports, only 2.5 km of heritage railway, and 2,105 km of paved highways (in 2000). Sea transport is also important, and there are two harbours at Fort-de-France and La Trinité.

== Road transport ==
As of 2000, Martinique had 2,105 km of paved highways.

There is a part of the N5 road that has been upgraded to a motorway, running from the capital Fort-de-France through Lamentin, Ducos and Rivière Salée until Les Coteaux.

== Rail transport ==

Martininique has now(2018) only one railway line in operation: The little-known 2.5 km long Le Train des Plantations is a heritage railway that runs from the Rhum Museum in Sainte-Marie through some sugarcane and banana plantations over two Bailey bridges to the Banana Museum.

In former times several narrow gauge sugarcane railways existed. Saint-Pierre had horse-drawn trams, which had an unusually narrow gauge. At least two steam locomotives are preserved in an optically refurbished condition, but not operational.

== Air transport ==
It has three airports, the main one being Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport. See List of Airports in Martinique.

<doc id="19180" wikidata="Q1063712" url="?curid=19180" title="History of Mauritania">
<text>The original inhabitants of Mauritania were the Bafour, presumably a Mande ethnic group, connected to the contemporary Arabized minor social group of &quot;Imraguen&quot; (&quot;fishermen&quot;) on the Atlantic coast.

The territory of Mauritania was on the fringe of geographical knowledge of Libya in classical antiquity. Berber immigration took place from about the 3rd century. Mauritania takes its name from the ancient Berber kingdom and later Roman province of Mauretania, and thus ultimately from the Mauri people, even though the respective territories do not overlap, historical Mauritania being considerably further north than modern Mauritania.

The Umayyads were the first Arab Muslims to enter Mauritania. During the Islamic conquests, they made incursions into Mauritania and were present in the region by the end of the 7th century. Many Berber tribes in Mauritania fled the arrival of the Arabs to the Gao region in Mali.

The European colonial powers of the 19th century had little interest in Mauritania. The French Republic was mostly interested in the territory for strategic reason, as a connection between their possessions in North and in West Africa. Mauritania thus became part of French West Africa in 1904, but colonial control was mostly limited to the coast and the Saharan trade routes, and there were territories nominally within French West Africa which were not reached by European control as late as 1955. 

In 1960, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania became Independent of France. The conflict over the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara in 1976 resulted in partial annexation by Mauritania, withdrawn in favour of Morocco in 1979. The long-serving President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya was ousted by the military of Mauritania and replaced by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy in a coup d&#x27;état in 2005. A new constitution was passed in 2006. An indecisive election in 2007 triggered another coup in 2008. A leader of the 2005 coup, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, was elected president in 2009. After his ten-year presidency, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani&#x27;s victory in the 2019 Mauritanian presidential election was presented as having been the country&#x27;s first peaceful transition of power since independence. 

==Early history==
The Sahara has linked rather than divided the peoples who inhabit it and has served as an avenue for migration and conquest. Mauritania, lying next to the Atlantic coast at the western edge of the desert, received and assimilated into its complex society many waves of these migrants and conquerors.

What is now Mauritania was a dry savanna area during classical antiquity, where independent tribes like the Pharusii and the Perorsi (and the Nigritae near the Niger river) lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle facing growing desertification.

The Romans explored toward this area and probably reached, with Suetonius Paulinus, the area of Adrar. There is evidence (coins, fibulas) of Roman commerce in Akjoujt and Tamkartkart near Tichit.

Berbers moved south to Mauritania beginning in the 3rd century, followed by Arabs in the late 7th century, subjugating and assimilating Mauritania&#x27;s original inhabitants. From the 8th through the 15th century, black kingdoms of the western Sudan, such as Ghana, Mali, and Songhai, brought their political culture from the south.

The divisive tendencies of the various groups within Mauritanian society have always worked against the development of Mauritanian unity. Both the Sanhadja Confederation, at its height from the 8th to the 10th century, and the Almoravid Empire, from the 11th to the 12th century, were weakened by internecine warfare, and both succumbed to further invasions from the Ghana Empire and the Almohad Empire, respectively.

==Islamization==
The Umayyads were the first Arab Muslims to enter Mauritania. During the Islamic conquests, they made incursions into Mauritania and were present in the region by the end of the 7th century. Many Berber tribes in Mauritania fled the arrival of the Arabs to the Gao region in Mali. By the 11th century, Islamization had reached the region around the Senegal River.

In the 11th century, several nomadic Berber confederations in the desert regions overlapping present-day Mauritania joined together to form the Almoravid movement. They expanded north and south, spawning an important empire that stretched from the Sahara to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe. However, the legacy of the southern Almoravids in the Sahara is less well-documented and understood than their subsequent operations in the north. Arabic sources record that Abu Bakr, one of the early leaders of the Almoravids, made Azuggi his base after he left Marrakesh and the northern Almoravids under the control of Yusuf Ibn Tashfin. According to Arabic sources, he also led the Almoravids further south to conquer the ancient and extensive Ghana Empire around 1076, but this narrative has been disputed and debated by modern historians.

The decline of the Almoravids after this is not documented. From the 13th century onward, the Banu Ma&#x27;qil, an Arab tribal confederation of Yemeni origin, migrated into the Maghreb and into what is now Morocco. Some of them progressively moved south into the Sahara, identifying themselves as the Beni Ḥassān or Awlad Hassan. From 1644 to 1674, the indigenous peoples of the area that is modern Mauritania made what became their final effort to repel the Ma&#x27;qil Arabs who were invading their territory. This effort, which was unsuccessful, is known as the Char Bouba War. The invaders were led by the Beni Ḥassān tribe. The descendants of the Beni Hassan warriors became the upper stratum of society. Hassaniya, a bedouin Arabic dialect named for the Beni Hassan, became the dominant language among the largely nomadic population.

From the 15th to the 19th century, European contact with Mauritania was dominated by the trade for gum arabic. Rivalries among European powers enabled the Arab-Berber population to maintain their independence and later to exact annual payments from France, whose sovereignty over the Senegal River and the Mauritanian coast was recognized by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Although penetration beyond the coast and the Senegal River began in earnest under Louis Faidherbe, governor of Senegal in the mid-19th century, European conquest or &quot;pacification&quot; of the entire country did not begin until 1900. Because extensive European contact began so late in the country&#x27;s history, the traditional social structure carried over into modern times with little change.

==French colonization==


The history of French colonial policy in Mauritania is closely tied to that of the other French possessions in West Africa, particularly to that of Senegal, on which Mauritania was economically, politically, and administratively dependent until independence. The French policy of assimilation and direct rule, however, was never applied with any vigor in Mauritania, where a system that corresponded more to indirectly ruling the colony developed. Colonial administrators relied extensively on Islamic religious leaders and the traditional warrior groups to maintain their rule and carry out their policies. Moreover, little attempt was made to develop the country&#x27;s economy. 

After World War II, Mauritania, along with the rest of French West Africa, was involved in a series of reforms of the French colonial system, culminating in independence in November 1960. These reforms were part of a trend away from the official policies of assimilation and direct rule in favor of administrative decentralization and internal autonomy. Although the nationalistic fervor sweeping French West Africa at this time was largely absent in Mauritania, continuous politicking (averaging one election every eighteen months between 1946 and 1958) provided training for political leaders and awakened a political consciousness among the populace. On 28 July 1960 France agreed to Mauritania becoming fully independent. Nevertheless, when Mauritania declared its independence on 28 November 1960, its level of political as well as economic development was, at best, embryonic.

==Independence, Ould Daddah era, and the Saharan War==
As the country gained Independence on November 28, 1960, the capital city, Nouakchott, was founded at the site of a small village founded during the colonial period, the Ksar, while 90% of the population was still nomadic. With independence, larger numbers of ethnic Sub-Saharan Africans (Haalpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof) entered Mauritania, moving into the area north of the Senegal River. As before independence, the sedentary lifestyle of these groups made them more receptive to and useful in state formation, and they quickly came to dominate state administration, even if the Moorish groups built up by the French remained in charge of the political process. Moors reacted to this change by increasing pressures for Arabization, to Arabicize many aspects of Mauritanian life, such as law and language, and ethnic tension built up – helped by a common memory of warfare and slave raids. 

President Moktar Ould Daddah, originally assisted to the post by the French, rapidly reformed Mauritania into an authoritarian one-party state in 1964, with his new Mauritanian constitution. Daddah&#x27;s own &quot;Parti du Peuple Mauritanien&quot; (PPM) became the ruling organization. The President justified this decision on the grounds that he considered Mauritania unready for western-style multi-party democracy. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1966, 1971 and 1976. 

To take advantage of the country&#x27;s sizable iron ore deposits in Zouérat, the new Government built a 675-km railway and a mining port. Production began in 1963. The mines were operated by a foreign owned consortium that paid its approximately 3,000 expatriate workers handsomely – their salaries accounted for two-thirds of the country&#x27;s entire wages bill. When the Mauritanian miners went on a two-month strike in the late 1960s the army intervened and eight miners were killed. Left-wing opposition to the government mounted and some miners formed a clandestine Marxist union in 1973. President Ould Daddah survived the challenge from left-wing opponents by nationalizing the company in 1974 and withdrawing from the franc zone, substituting the ouguiya for the CFA. 

In 1975, partly for nationalist reasons and partly for fear of Moroccan expansionism, Mauritania invaded and annexed the southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1975, renaming it Tiris al-Gharbiyya. However, after nearly three years of raids by the Sahrawi guerrillas of the Polisario Front, Mauritania&#x27;s economic and political stability began to crumble. Despite French and Moroccan military aid , Polisario raids against the Zouerate railway and mines threatened to bring about economic collapse, and there were deep misgivings in the military about the Saharan adventure. Ethnic unrest contributed to the disarray. Black Africans from the south were conscripted as front-line soldiers, after the northern Sahrawi minorities and their Moorish kin had proven unreliable in the fight against Polisario, but many of the southerners rebelled against having to fight what they considered an inter-Arab war. After the government quarters in Nouakchott had twice been shelled by Polisario forces, unrest simmered, but Daddah&#x27;s only response was to further tighten his hold on power.

On July 10, 1978, Col. Mustafa Ould Salek led a bloodless coup d&#x27;état that ousted the President, who would later go into exile in France. Power passed to the military strongmen of the Military Committee for National Recovery (CMRN). Polisario immediately declared a cease-fire, and peace negotiations began under the sponsorship of Polisario&#x27;s main backer, Algeria. With the CMRN&#x27;s leader reluctant to break with France and Morocco, the country refused to give in to Polisario demands for a troop retreat, and Ould Salek&#x27;s careless handling of the ethnic issue (massively discriminating against Black Africans in nominating for government posts ) contributed to further unrest. In early 1979, he was pushed aside by another group of officers, who renamed the junta the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN). Col. Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla soon emerged as its main strongman.

==1978 to 1984==
In 1979, Polisario broke off the cease-fire and unleashed a string of new attacks on military and government targets. Mauritania, under its new government, immediately returned to the table to meet Polisario&#x27;s goals, declaring full peace, a complete troop retreat, relinquishing their portion of Western Sahara and recognizing the Front as the Sahrawi people&#x27;s sole representative. 

Morocco, occupying the northern half of Western Sahara and also involved in combat against Polisario, reacted with outrage, and launched a failed 1981 coup against the CMSN. Mauritania broke off relations with Rabat in protest, although ties were later restored. 

In interior policy, Ould Haidallah sought to improve relations between White Moors and Black Moors, among other things officially decreeing the ban of slavery for the first time in the country&#x27;s history, but he neither tried nor achieved a radical break with the sectarian and discriminating policies of previous regimes. An attempt to reinstate civilian rule was abandoned after the above-mentioned Moroccan-sponsored coup attempt nearly brought down the regime; foreign-backed plots also involved Persian Gulf countries and Libya, and the country several times appeared to be under military threat from Morocco. 

With Ould Haidallah&#x27;s ambitious political and social reform program undone by continuing instability, regime inefficiency and a plethora of coup attempts and intrigues from within the military establishment, the CMSN Chairman turned increasingly autocratic, excluding other &quot;junta&quot; officers from power, and provoking discontent by frequently reshuffling the power hierarchy to prevent threats to his position.

On December 12, 1984, Col. Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya deposed Haidallah and declared himself Chairman of the CMSN. Like other rulers before him, he promised a swift transfer to democracy, but then made little of these promises. 

==1984 to present==
The discord between conflicting visions of Mauritanian society as either black or Arab, again rose to the surface during the inter-communal violence that broke out in April 1989 (the &quot;1989 Events&quot;), when a Mauritania–Senegal border dispute escalated into violence between the two communities. Tens of thousands of black Mauritanians fled or were expelled from the country, and many remain in Senegal as refugees. This is also where the black Mauritanian movement FLAM is based. Although tension has since subsided, the Arab-African racial tension remains an important feature of the political dialog today. The country continues to experience ethnic tensions between its black minority population and the dominant Maure (Arab–Berber) populace. A significant number from both groups, however, seek a more diverse, pluralistic society. 

Opposition parties were legalized, and a new Constitution approved in 1991 which put an end to formal military rule. However, Ould Taya&#x27;s election wins were dismissed as fraudulent by both opposition groups and some external observers. In 1998, Mauritania became the third Arab country to recognize Israel, despite strong internal opposition. 

In 2001, elections incorporated more safeguards against voter fraud, but opposition candidate (and former leader) Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah was nevertheless arrested prior to election day on charges of planning a coup, released the same day and rearrested after the election. Attempted military coups and unrest instigated by Islamist opponents of the regime marred the early years of the 21st century, and the Taya regime&#x27;s heavy-handed crackdowns were criticized by human rights groups. 

On June 8, 2003, a failed coup attempt was made against President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya by forces unhappy with his imprisonment of Islamic leaders in the wake of the United States-led invasion of Iraq and his establishment of full diplomatic relations with Israel. The coup was suppressed after two days of heavy fighting in the capital when pro-Taya military forces arrived from the countryside. A number of Government officials were detained after the coup including the head of the Supreme Court, Mahfoud Ould Lemrabott, and the Secretary of State for Women&#x27;s Affairs, Mintata Mint Hedeid. The coup leader, Saleh Ould Hanenna, a former Army major sacked for opposing Taya&#x27;s pro-Israel policies, was not captured or killed during the coup, he initially escaped capture. (See this BBC article on theories behind the coup.) 

On August 3, 2005, the Mauritanian military, including members of the Presidential guard (BASEP), seized control of key points in the capital of Nouakchott, performing a coup against the Government of President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya who was out of the country attending the funeral of Saudi King Fahd. The officers released the following statement: 

&quot;The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.&quot; (BBC) 

Taya was never able to return to the country and remains in exile. The new junta called itself the &quot;Military Council for Justice and Democracy&quot;, and democracy and rule of law. Col. Ely Ould Mohamed Vall emerged as leader at an early stage. Dissidents were released, and the political climate relaxed. A new constitution was approved in June 2006. Elections were held in March 2007, Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi was elected president and Vall stood down.

On August 6, 2008, Mauritania&#x27;s presidential spokesman Abdoulaye Mamadouba said President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef and the Interior minister were arrested by renegade Senior Mauritanian army officers, unknown troops and a group of generals and were held under house arrest at the Presidential palace in Nouakchott. In the apparently successful and bloodless coup d&#x27;état, Abdallahi&#x27;s daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi said: &quot;The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father.&quot; The coup plotters are top fired Mauritania&#x27;s security forces, which include General Muhammad Ould &#x27;Abd Al-&#x27;Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier-General (Aqid) Ahmed Ould Bakri. Mauritanian lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, announced that &quot;many of the country&#x27;s people were supporting the takeover attempt&quot; and the government is &quot;an authoritarian regime&quot; and that the president had &quot;marginalized the majority in parliament.&quot; 

In August 2019, former General Mohamed Ould Ghazouani was sworn in as Mauritania’s tenth president since its independence from France in 1960. His predecessor Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz ruled the country for 10 years. The ruling party Union for the Republic (UPR) was founded by Aziz in 2009. 

In December 2023, former president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was arrested and sentenced to 5 years in prison for corruption. In June 2024, President Ghazouani was re-elected for a second term.

<text>Mauritania is a presidential democracy, but has suffered from repeated military coups since its Independence in November 1960. For 18 years after independence, Mauritania was a one-party state under Moktar Ould Daddah. This was followed by decades of military rule. The first fully democratic presidential election in Mauritania occurred on 11 March 2007, which marked a transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005. The election was won by Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, who was ousted by another military coup in 2008 and replaced by general Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. Mauretania underwent its first peaceful transition of power after the 2019 presidential election, although this was between two presidents of the ruling UPR party and former army generals. 

Personalities have long exercised an important influence in the politics of Mauritania - the effective exercise of political power in the country depends on control over resources; perceived ability or integrity; and tribal, ethnic, family, and personal considerations. Conflict between white Moor, black Moor, and non-Moor ethnic groups, centering on language, land tenure, and other issues, continues to pose challenges to the idea of national unity. 

==Political administration==
The government bureaucracy comprises traditional ministries, special agencies, and parastatal companies. The Ministry of Interior controls a system of regional governors and prefects modeled on the French system of local administration. Under this system, Mauritania has 13 regions (wilaya), including the capital district, Nouakchott. 

Control remains tightly concentrated in the executive branch of the central government, but a series of national and municipal elections since 1992 have produced some limited decentralization. 

==Political history==
Mauritania achieved independence from the French colonial empire in 1960. After independence, President Moktar Ould Daddah, originally installed by the French, formalized Mauritania into a one-party state in 1964 with a new constitution, which set up an authoritarian presidential regime. Daddah&#x27;s own Parti du Peuple Mauritanien (PPM) became the ruling organization. The President justified this decision on the grounds that he considered Mauritania unready for western-style multi-party democracy. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1966, 1971 and 1976. Daddah was ousted in a bloodless coup on July 10, 1978. 

A committee of military officers governed Mauritania from July 1978 to April 1992. A popular referendum approved the current Constitution in July 1991. 

===Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya&#x27;s rule (1984-2005) ===
The &quot;Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social&quot; (PRDS), led by President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya, has dominated Mauritanian politics since the country&#x27;s first multi-party elections in April 1992 following the approval by referendum of the current constitution in July 1991. President Taya, who won elections in 1992, 1997 and 2003, first became chief of state through a December 12, 1984, bloodless coup which made him Chairman of the committee of military officers that governed Mauritania from July 1978 to April 1992. 

Political parties were legalized again in 1991. By April 1992, as civilian rule returned, 16 major political parties had been recognized; 12 major political parties were active in 2004. By April 1992, as civilian rule returned, 15 political parties had gained official recognition. Among the mostly small groupings, two main opposition parties emerged: 
# the Rally of Democratic Forces (RFD). 
# the Action for Change (AC)--traditionally considered the party of the Haratines. 

Most opposition parties boycotted the first legislative election in 1992, and for nearly a decade the Democratic and Social Republican Party (PRDS) dominated the Parliament. The opposition participated in municipal elections in January–February 1994 and in subsequent elections for the Senate, gaining representation at the local level as well as one seat in the Senate. Noting procedural changes and opposition gains in municipal and legislative contests, most local observers considered the October 2001 elections open and transparent. The opposition participated in municipal elections in January–February 1994 and subsequent Senate elections, most recently in April 2004, gaining representation at the local level as well as three seats in the Senate. 

In October 2001, Mauritania held its third legislative and fifth municipal elections since the establishment of multi-party politics under the 1991 Constitution. In an effort to forestall the sort of widespread accusations of fraud and manipulation which had accompanied previous elections, the government introduced new safeguards, including published voter lists and a hard-to-falsify voter identification card. Reversing a trend of election boycotts, 15 opposition parties nominated candidates for more than 3,000 municipal posts and for the 81-member National Assembly. Four opposition parties won a combined 11 seats in the National Assembly and took 15% of the municipal posts. The ruling Democratic and Social Republican Party (PRDS), in conjunction with two coalition parties, won the remaining contests. See 2003 Mauritania election 

Mauritania&#x27;s presidential election, its third since adopting the democratic process in 1992, took place on November 7, 2003. Six candidates, including Mauritania&#x27;s first female and first Haratine (former slave family) candidates, represented a wide variety of political goals and backgrounds. Incumbent President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya won re-election with 67.02% of the popular vote, according to the Official figures, with ex-head-of-state Col. Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla finishing second. 

Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya recognized the State of Israel, and started cooperating with the United States in antiterrorism activities. 

A group identifying itself as the Military Council for Justice and Democracy (CMJD) overthrew the Taya Government on 3 August 2005 during the absence of the President in Saudi Arabia for King Fahd&#x27;s funeral. The military dictatorship said it would remain in power for two years in order to allow time for implementing democratic institutions. 

===August 2005 military coup===
In August 2005, a military coup led by Col. Ely Ould Mohamed Vall ended Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya&#x27;s 21 years of strong-arm rule. 

On August 3, the Mauritanian military, including members of the presidential guard (BASEP), seized control of key points in the capital of Nouakchott. They took advantage of President Taya&#x27;s attendance at the funeral of Saudi King Fahd to organize the coup, which took place without loss of life. The officers, calling themselves the Military Council for Justice and Democracy, released the following statement: 

:&quot;The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.&quot; (BBC) 

The Military Council later issued another statement naming as president Col. Ould Mohamed Vall, Director of the national police force, the &quot;Sûreté Nationale&quot;, since 1987, and listing 16 other officers as members. 

Col. Mohamed Vall was once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya, even aiding him in the original coup that brought him to power, and later serving as his security chief. This high-level betrayal of the former president suggests broad discontent within the branches of local government, which is further supported by the lack of bloodshed and the population&#x27;s support of the rebel militaries. 

Applauded by the Mauritanian people, but cautiously watched by the international community, the coup has since been generally accepted, while the military &quot;junta&quot; has promised to organize elections within two years. 

Parliamentary and municipal elections were held on the 19 November 2006 . 

Israel&#x27;s recognition by the Islamic Republic of Mauritania was maintained by the new regime. 

===Dispute with Woodside Petroleum===
In February 2006, the new Mauritanian government denounced amendments to an oil contract made by former Leader Ould Taya with Woodside Petroleum, an Australian company. In 2004, Woodside had agreed to invest $US 600 million in developing Mauritania&#x27;s Chinguetti offshore oil project. The controversial amendments, which Mauritanian authorities declared had been signed &quot;outside the legal framework of normal practice, to the great detriment of our country&quot;, could cost Mauritania up to $200 million a year, according to &quot;BBC News&quot;. Signed by Woodside two weeks after the February 1, 2005, legislation authorizing the four amendments, they provided for a lower state quota in the &quot;profit-oil&quot;, and reduced taxes by 15 percent in certain zones. They also eased environmental constraints and extended the length and scope of the exploitation and exploration monopoly, among other measures. 

The disputed amendments were signed by former Oil Minister Zeidane Ould Hmeida in February 2004 and March 2005. Hmeida was arrested in January 2006 on charges of &quot;serious crimes against the country&#x27;s essential economic interests&quot;. 

Nouakchott&#x27;s authorities declared that the government would likely seek international arbitration, which Woodside (which operated for Hardman, BG Group, Premier, ROC Oil, Fusion, Petronas, Dana Petroleum, Energy Africa and the Hydrocarbons Mauritanian Society) also contemplated. 

Discovered in 2001, Chinguetti has proven reserves of about of oil. At the end of December 2005, authorities estimated that in 2006, the oil profits would be 47 billion &quot;ouguiyas&quot; (about US$180 million) and represent a quarter of the state budget, according to &quot;RFI&quot;. 

===2007 Presidential election===
The first fully democratic Presidential election since 1960 occurred on 11 March 2007. The election is the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005. This is the first time the president will have been selected by ballot in the country&#x27;s history. 

The election was won by Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. 

Slavery is still said to exist in Mauritania, some 100 years after slavery officially ended in the West and since it was officially abolished in the country in 1981. 

===2008 coup d&#x27;état===
On August 6, 2008, Mauritania&#x27;s presidential spokesman Abdoulaye Mamadou Ba said President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghef and the Interior minister, were arrested by renegade Senior Mauritanian army officers, unknown troops and a group of generals, and were held under house arrest at the Presidential palace in Nouakchott. In the apparently successful and bloodless coup d&#x27;état, Abdallahi&#x27;s daughter Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi said, &quot;The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father.&quot; The coup plotters are top fired Mauritania’s security forces, which include General Muhammad Ould ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmed Ould Bakri. Mauritanian lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, announced that &quot;many of the country&#x27;s people were supporting the takeover attempt and the government is &#x27;an authoritarian regime&#x27;&quot; and that the president had &quot;marginalized the majority in parliament.&quot; 

=== After the 2008 coup ===

In August 2019, former General Mohamed Ould Ghazouani was sworn in as Mauritania’s tenth president since its independence from France in 1960. His predecessor Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz ran the African desert country for 10 years. The ruling party Union for the Republic (UPR) was founded by Aziz in 2009 and renamed to Equity Party in 2022. Mohamed Ould Ghazouani&#x27;s victory in the 2019 Mauritanian presidential election was presented as having been the country&#x27;s first peaceful transition of power since independence. In June 2024, President Ghazouani was re-elected for a second term.

<doc id="19184" wikidata="Q375832" url="?curid=19184" title="Economy of Mauritania">
<text>The economy of Mauritania is still largely based on agriculture, slave labour and livestock, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurring droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. 

Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. With the current rise in metal prices, gold and copper mining companies are opening mines in the interior.

The nation&#x27;s coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country&#x27;s first deep water port opened near Nouakchott in 1986.

In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission on a $54 million enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). The economic objectives have been set for 1999–2002. Privatization remains one of the key issues.

==Macro-economic trends==
This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Mauritania at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Mauritanian Ouguiyas. 
Current GDP per capita of Mauritania grew 82% in the Sixties reaching a peak growth of 166% in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable, and growth consequently scaled back to 14% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 29% in the Nineties. Mean wages were $0.97 per man-hour in 2009.

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1990–2024.
==Diversification==
In 2007, mining industries accounted for well over 35 percent of the Mauritanian economy, with the fish industry so much as 54% (with big changes between these industries in the power relationship). Diversification of the economy into non-mining industries remains a long-term issue. Mauritania is a net importer of food, reportedly importing 70% of its domestic food needs.

==Natural Gas and the Tortue/Ahmeyim Project==
In 2015, Kosmos Energy made significant natural gas discoveries on the maritime border between Senegal and Mauritania, and in December 2016, it entered into partnership with British Petroleum. The two companies, along with Mauritanian and Senegalese governments and the two countries&#x27; national oil companies, are optimistic about the potential of these gas discoveries. The Grand Tortue/Ahmeyim reserves are estimated at 15 trillion cubic feet. According to BP, &#x27;that&#x27;s equivalent to all of Africa&#x27;s current gas production for nearly seven years.&#x27; The production phase will begin in 2022, starting with 2.3 million tons annually.

== Dispute with Woodside Petroleum ==
In February 2006, the new Mauritanian government denounced amendments to an oil contract made by former Leader Ould Taya with Woodside Petroleum, an Australian company. In 2004, Woodside had agreed to invest US$600 million in developing Mauritania&#x27;s Chinguetti offshore oil project. The controversial amendments, which Mauritanian authorities declared had been signed &quot;outside the legal framework of normal practice, to the great detriment of our country&quot;, could cost Mauritania up to $200 million a year, according to BBC News. Signed by Woodside two weeks after the February 1, 2005, legislation authorizing the four amendments, they provided for a lower state quota in the &quot;profit-oil&quot;, and reduced taxes by 15 percent in certain zones. They also eased environmental constraints and extended the length and scope of the exploitation and exploration monopoly, among other measures.

The disputed amendments were signed by former Oil Minister Zeidane Ould Hmeida in February 2004 and March 2005. Hmeida was arrested in January 2006 on charges of &quot;serious crimes against the country&#x27;s essential economic interests&quot;.

Nouakchott&#x27;s authorities declared that the government would likely seek international arbitration, which Woodside (which operated for Hardman, BG Group, Premier Oil, ROC Oil, Fusion, Petronas, Dana Petroleum, Energy Africa and the Hydrocarbons Mauritanian Society) also contemplated.

Discovered in 2001, Chinguetti has proven reserves of about of oil. At the end of December 2005, authorities estimated that in 2006, the oil profits would be 47 billion &quot;ouguiyas&quot; (about US$180 million) and represent a quarter of the state budget, according to &quot;RFI&quot;.

Some U.S. oil companies are alleged to be playing a part in Mauritania&#x27;s oil related corruption.

== Electricity ==

Mauritania has 380 MW of generating capacity, of which 263 MW are fossil fuels and 117 MW are renewable. Its sunny weather makes solar power highly favorable, and eight plants totaling 16.6 MW were installed with the support of Masdar in 2016.

<text>Citizens of Mauritania have limited access to transportation. The single-line railroad serves mining interests with very occasional ad hoc passenger services. Apart from two infrastructural road developments there are few paved roads.

== Railways ==
*717 km total of single track (standard gauge), owned and operated by a government mining company, Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière (National Mining and Industrial Company, SNIM). The railway goes from the mines at Zouérat and El Rhein, passes another mine at Fderik, and ends at the port of Nouadhibou/Cansado.
*One of the world&#x27;s longest trains (up to 2.5 km long) runs here, with more than 200 wagons mainly transporting iron ore, and some carriages for passengers; alternatively, people sit on top of the iron piles. 

There are no rail links with adjacent countries.

In 2008, a railway was proposed that would link Nouakchott with Tiguint, Mederdra, R&#x27;Kiz, Leguatt, Leeleibatt, Menjem Boffal, Kaedi, and Bofal.

* Sunday, August 5, 2007 - Sudan, China to Build $630 Mln Mauritania Railway.
Sudan&#x27;s Danfodio Holding and China&#x27;s Transtech Engineering have signed an agreement to build a 460-million-euro ($634 million) railway linking Mauritania&#x27;s capital Nouakchott with southern phosphate deposits at Bofal. The line would run close to the southern frontier with Senegal. It is hoped that the new line would link with existing lines just across the border in Senegal, Mali. There is no through link to Burkina Faso. There are problems of choice of gauge.

==== 2008 ====
* May - 8 new EMD locomotives. 

==== 2013 ====
* Proposed line for phosphate traffic - 430 km long railway line, Nouakchott and Kaedi, Mauritania&#x27;s third city, through Tiguint, Mederdra, R&#x27;Kiz, Leguatt, Leeleibatt and Menjem Boffal, is to be constructed in three years&#x27; time.

==== 2014 ====
* Glencore Xstrata proposes branch lines to new mines at Askaf and Guelb El Aouj sharing infrastructure of SNIM.

== Motorway ==
There are 450 km of Motorway in Mauritania (in 2010), connecting Nouakchott to Nouadhibou along a coastal route. A motorway linking Nouakchott to Rosso is under construction (due for completion in 2012).

== Highways ==

Mauritania has only about of surfaced roads, of unsurfaced roads, and of unimproved tracks. 

The country&#x27;s size and harsh climate make road maintenance and repair especially problematic. Overland travel is difficult and roadside assistance is almost nonexistent. Public transportation is not safe and road conditions in Mauritania are poor, particularly in the interior. Driving in Mauritania can be treacherous, and many Mauritanians drive without regard to traffic signs or rules. Roadway obstructions and hazards caused by drifting sand, animals, and poor roads often plague motorists.

===International highways===

The Cairo-Dakar Highway in the Trans-African Highway network passes through Mauritania, linking Nouakchott to Rabat, Tangiers, Algiers, and Tripoli. The section between the capital Nouakchott and the port of Nouadhibou was paved by 2018; only a few kilometers remain unpaved at the Moroccan border :fr:Transport en Mauritanie. From Dakar there are links throughout western Africa. 

The north-western end of the Trans–West African Coastal Highway is considered by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to originate in Nouakchott.

As of 2018, the Mauritanian armed forces budget was 3.9% of the country&#x27;s GDP.

The military forces of Mauritania are listed by the IISS Military Balance 2007 as comprising 15,870 personnel with an additional 5,000 paramilitaries, in the national gendarmerie. The Navy (Marine Mauritanienne) has 620 personnel and 11 patrol and coastal combatants, with bases at Nouadhibou and Nouakchott. The CIA reports that the navy includes naval infantry.

==History==

Saleh Ould Hanenna, a former army major, led the 2003 Mauritanian coup d&#x27;état attempt in June 2003. It aimed to overthrow President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya. He commanded a rebel section of the Army during two days of heavy fighting in Nouakchott. With the failure of the coup Hanenna initially escaped capture, and formed a group called the &#x27;Knights of Change&#x27; with Mohamed Ould Cheikhna, but they were arrested on 9 October 2004. 

General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, a career soldier and high-ranking officer, was a leading figure in the 2005 Mauritanian coup d&#x27;état that deposed President Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya. 

In August 2008, General Ould Abdel Aziz led the 2008 Mauritanian coup d&#x27;état that toppled President Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi. Following the latter coup, Abdel Aziz became President of the High Council of State as part of what was described as a political transition leading to a new election. He resigned from that post in April 2009 to stand as a candidate in the July 2009 presidential election, which he won. He was sworn in on 5 August 2009. 

== Army ==

In March 1985, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported the army was 8,300 strong with no reserves (Military Intelligence Summary – Africa South of the Sahara, DDB 2680-104-85, ICOD 15 October 1984, Mauritania pages 4, 5, declassified by letter dated 29 April 2014). Reported regions at the time were Region I – Nouadhibou, Region II – Zoueirat, Region III – Atar, Region IV – formerly at Tidjikdja, which no longer existed, Region V – Nema, Region VI – Nouakchott, and Region VII – Rosso. The army was organized into the six regions which each supervised several companies, though there was &#x27;one small autonomous infantry battalion stationed in Nouakchott.&#x27; 

The Army is 15,000 strong, according to the IISS, with six military regions, two camel corps battalions, one battalion of T-55 battle tanks, one armored reconnaissance squadron, eight garrison infantry battalions, seven motorized infantry battalions, one commando/para battalion, 3 artillery battalions, 4 air defense batteries, one engineer company, and one guard battalion. The 1ère région militaire is at Nouadhibou, 2nd Military Region is at Zouerate, 3rd Military Region is at Atar, 4ème région militaire may be at Tidjikdja, 5th Military Region headquarters is at Néma, The 6th Military Region may be in the area of the capital, and the 7th Military Region may be at Aleg. 

The Mauritanian military is currently involved in Operation Enduring Freedom – Trans Sahara. Previous U.S. anti-terrorist engagement included training under the Pan Sahel Initiative. Under the PSI, a 10th Special Forces Group training team carried out a one-week border monitoring training programme in January 2004. 

The IISS listed equipment in 2007 as including 35 T-55 main battle tanks, 70 reconnaissance vehicles (20 Panhard AML-60, 40 Panhard AML-90, 10 Alvis Saladin), 25 wheeled APCs (estimate 20 Panhard M3 and 5 Alvis Saracen), 194 artillery pieces (80 towed: 36 HM-2/M-101, 20 D-30, 24 D-74; 114 mortars: 60 60-mm, 30 Brandt 120-mm), 24 MILAN ATGM, 114 recoilless rocket launchers (est. 90 M-40A1 106mm, est 24 M-20 75mm), est 48 RPG-7 Knout, 104 SAMs (est 100 SA-7 Grail, and a reported 4 SA-9 Gaskin), and 82 towed anti-aircraft guns (14.5mm, including 12 ZPU-4, ZU-23-2, 37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K), 12 57 mm AZP S-60, and 12 100mm KS-19s). 

===Equipment===
Among reported special forces units are:
*1er Bataillon de Commandos Parachutistes (1er BCP)
*2eme Bataillon de Commandos Parachutistes (2eme BCP)
*Bataillon de la Securite Presidentielle (BASEP)
*Bataillon Special d&#x27;Intervention (BSI) 
* (GSI)

== Air Force ==

After achieving independence in 1960 the Faidem&#x27;s (Force Aerienne Islamique de Mauritanie) was supplied equipment by France, such as C-47s and MH.1521 Broussards, which was later replaced by the Britten-Norman BN-2A Defender between 1976 and 1978 and had operated as a transport and observation squadron in the Western Sahara War. During the same time two Cessna 337s and two DHC-5 Buffalo STOL transports were supplied in 1977 and 1978 with one DHC-5 crashing almost immediately and the other being returned to De Havilland Canada in 1979. After the Polisario Front shot down one Defender and damaged two in 1978 the Mauritanian government ordered six IA-58 Pucarás for ground attack duties from Argentina; this order was later cancelled after a Mauritanian military coup. 

The Air Force School was created in Atar. It was founded to train pilots, mechanics, other crewmen for the Air Force. 

More recent procurements have been from China in the form of the Harbin Y-12 II turboprop transports were delivered in September 1995, one crashed in April 1996. A second one crashed on 12 July 2012. The Xian Y7-100C (a copy of the AN-24 transport) was delivered from October 1997, which crashed in May 1998. The Air Force has recently received their order of Embraers.

==Navy==
Mauritania has developed a five-year plan to develop its navy into a force that is capable of defending the country&#x27;s 235,000 km squared exclusive economic zone, Admiral Isselkou Ould Cheik El-Weli said during a promotion ceremony held at the Nouadhibou naval base in late May 2017. The Saharamedias.net website reported that the plan includes the acquisition of two 60-meter vessels, which are currently under construction, and &quot;mid-sized ships&quot;, as well as the formation of three companies of marines. No further details were provided. 

The Mauritanian Navy was created on 25 January 1966, after the extension of Mauritania&#x27;s territorial waters from . By 1972 the navy had one small patrol gunboat and two small patrol craft that performed port control and customs duties. In 1987 the navy had thirteen boats. Of these boats, only eight were seaworthy, and the navy could send only two vessels out to open water at a time. Mauritania&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extended out from the coast, but even if effective coastal surveillance were possible, the navy&#x27;s vessels would not be able to control Mauritania&#x27;s waters. Nouadhibou housed the major naval base; Nouakchott housed a secondary base.

<text>Mumbai ( ; ISO: , ), also known as Bombay ( ; its official name until 1995), is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. Mumbai is the financial capital and the most populous city proper of India with an estimated population of 12.5 million (1.25 crore). Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth-most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million (2.3 crore). Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. Mumbai has the highest number of billionaires out of any city in Asia.

The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of Marathi language-speaking Koli people. For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England. Beginning in 1782, Mumbai was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the Arabian Sea. Along with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Mumbai into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Mumbai in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India&#x27;s independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Mumbai as the capital.

Mumbai is the financial, commercial, and entertainment capital of South Asia. Mumbai is often compared to New York, and the city is home to the Bombay Stock Exchange, situated on Dalal Street. It is also one of the world&#x27;s top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, generating 6.16% of India&#x27;s GDP, and accounting for 25% of the nation&#x27;s industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust, Dharamtar Port and JNPT), and 70% of capital transactions to India&#x27;s economy. The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. The city is also home to some of India&#x27;s premier scientific and nuclear institutes and the Hindi and Marathi film industries. Mumbai&#x27;s business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Mumbai&quot; (Marathi: ) originated from &quot;Mumbā&quot; or &quot;Mahā-Ambā&quot;—the name of the patron Hindu goddess (Kula Devata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli community—and from &quot;ā&#x27;ī&quot;, meaning &quot;mother&quot; in the Marathi language, which is the mother tongue of the Koli people and the official language of Maharashtra. According to certain accounts, the Koli community, which hails from Kathiawar and Central Gujarat, is believed to have introduced their deity Mumba from Kathiawar (Gujarat), where her worship continues to this day. However, other sources disagree that Mumbai&#x27;s name was derived from the goddess Mumba.
The oldest known names for the city are &quot;Kakamuchee&quot; and &quot;Galajunkja&quot;; these are sometimes still used. Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia recorded the name &quot;Bombaim&quot; after 1512 in his &quot;Lendas da Índia&quot; (&quot;Legends of India&quot;). While some Anglophone authors have suggested this name possibly originated as an alleged Galician-Portuguese phrase &quot;bom baim&quot;, meaning &quot;good little bay&quot;, such suggestions lack any scientific basis. Portuguese linguist José Pedro Machado attributes that interpretation to a deficient knowledge of the Portuguese language of these authors, mixing up the Portuguese word &quot;bom&quot; with the English &quot;bay&quot;, from the English version of the name. In 1516, Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name &quot;Tana-Maiambu&quot;: &quot;Tana&quot; appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and &quot;Maiambu&quot; to &quot;Mumbadevi&quot;. The form &quot;Bombaim&quot; is still commonly used in Portuguese.

Other variations recorded in the 16th and the 17th centuries include: &quot;Mombayn&quot; (1525), &quot;Bombay&quot; (1538), &quot;Bombain&quot; (1552), &quot;Bombaym&quot; (1552), &quot;Monbaym&quot; (1554), &quot;Mombaim&quot; (1563), &quot;Mombaym&quot; (1644), &quot;Bambaye&quot; (1666), &quot;Bombaiim&quot; (1666), &quot;Bombeye&quot; (1676), &quot;Boon Bay&quot; (1690) and &quot;Bon Bahia&quot;. After the English gained possession of the city in the 17th century, the Portuguese name was anglicised as &quot;Bombay&quot;. Ali Muhammad Khan, imperial dewan or revenue minister of the Gujarat province, in the &quot;Mirat-i Ahmedi&quot; (1762) referred to the city as &quot;Manbai&quot;.

The French traveller Louis Rousselet, who visited in 1863 and 1868, states in his book &quot;L&#x27;Inde des Rajahs&quot;, which was first published in 1877: &quot;Etymologists have wrongly derived this name from the Portuguese Bôa Bahia, or (French: &quot;bonne bai&quot;, English: &quot;good bay&quot;), not knowing that the tutelar goddess of this island has been, from remote antiquity, Bomba, or Mumba Devi, and that she still ... possesses a temple&quot;.

By the late 20th century, the city was referred to as &quot;Mumbai&quot; or &quot;Mambai&quot; in Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Kannada and Sindhi, and as &quot;Bambai&quot; in Hindi. The Government of India officially changed the English name to &quot;Mumbai&quot; in November 1995. This came at the insistence of the Marathi nationalist Shiv Sena party, which had just won the Maharashtra state elections, and mirrored similar name changes across the country and particularly in Maharashtra. According to &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, &quot;they argued that &#x27;Bombay&#x27; was a corrupted English version of &#x27;Mumbai&#x27; and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule.&quot; &quot;Slate&quot; also said &quot;The push to rename Bombay was part of a larger movement to strengthen Marathi identity in the Maharashtra region.&quot; While Mumbai is still referred to as Bombay by some of its residents and by some Indians from other regions, mention of the city by a name other than &quot;Mumbai&quot; has been controversial.

=== People from Mumbai ===
A resident of Mumbai is called &quot;Mumbaikar&quot; () in Marathi, in which the suffix &quot;-kar&quot; means a &#x27;resident of&#x27;. The term had been in use for quite some time but it gained popularity after the official name change to Mumbai. Older terms such as &quot;Bombayite&quot; are also used.

== History ==


=== Early history ===
Mumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman&#x27;s Island (also known as &quot;Little Colaba&quot;). It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age. Perhaps at the beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.

In the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the Maurya Empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha. The Kanheri Caves in Borivali were excavated from basalt rock in the first century CE, and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times. The city then was known as &quot;Heptanesia&quot; (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE. The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were cut out between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.

Between the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Western Satraps, Abhira, Vakataka, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, before being ruled by the Shilaharas from 810 to 1260. Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the Jogeshwari Caves (between 520 and 525), Elephanta Caves (between the sixth to seventh century), Walkeshwar Temple (10th century), and Banganga Tank (12th century).

King Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in &quot;Mahikawati&quot; (present day Mahim). The Pathare Prabhus, among the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to &quot;Mahikawati&quot; from Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev. The Delhi Sultanate annexed the islands in 1347–48 and controlled it until 1407. During this time, the islands were administered by the Muslim Governors of Gujarat, who were appointed by the Delhi Sultanate.

The islands were later governed by the independent Gujarat Sultanate, which was established in 1407. As a result of the Sultanate&#x27;s support, numerous mosques were built, with one notable example being the Haji Ali Dargah in Worli. Erected in 1431, this magnificent structure pays homage to the revered Muslim saint, Haji Ali. From 1429 to 1431, the islands were a source of contention between the Gujarat Sultanate and the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan. In 1493, Bahadur Khan Gilani of the Bahmani Sultanate attempted to conquer the islands but was defeated.

=== Portuguese and British rule ===

The Mughal Empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century. Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.

The Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form &quot;Bombaim&quot;. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael&#x27;s Church at Mahim (1534), St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri (1579), St. Andrew&#x27;s Church at Bandra (1580), and Gloria Church at Byculla (1632). The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, &quot;Castella de Aguada&quot; (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The English were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Mumbai, as they recognised its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land attacks. By the middle of the 17th century the growing power of the Dutch Empire forced the English to acquire a station in western India. On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal, placed the islands in possession of the English Empire, as part of Catherine&#x27;s dowry to Charles. However, Salsette, Bassein, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. From 1665 to 1666, the English managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala.
In accordance with the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, England leased these islands to the English East India Company in 1668 for a sum of £10 per annum. The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675. The islands were subsequently attacked by Yakut Khan, the Muslim Koli admiral of the Mughal Empire, in October 1672, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India on 20 February 1673, and Siddi admiral Sambal on 10 October 1673.

In 1687, the English East India Company transferred its headquarters from Surat to Mumbai. The city eventually became the headquarters of the Bombay Presidency. Following the transfer, Mumbai was placed at the head of all the company&#x27;s establishments in India. Towards the end of the 17th century, the islands again suffered incursions from Yakut Khan in 1689–90. The Portuguese presence ended in Mumbai when the Marathas under &quot;Peshwa&quot; Baji Rao I captured Salsette in 1737, and Bassein in 1739.
By the middle of the 18th century, Mumbai began to grow into a major trading town, and received a huge influx of migrants from across India. Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the Treaty of Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776), and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.

From 1782 onwards, the city was reshaped with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands of Bombay into a single amalgamated mass by way of a causeway called the Hornby Vellard, which was completed by 1784. In 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Baji Rao II, the last of the Maratha &quot;Peshwa&quot; in the Battle of Khadki. Following his defeat, almost the whole of the Deccan Plateau came under British suzerainty, and was incorporated into the Bombay Presidency. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan marked the end of all attacks by native powers.

By 1845, the seven islands coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard project via large scale land reclamation. On 16 April 1853, India&#x27;s first passenger railway line was established, connecting Mumbai to the neighbouring town of Thana (now Thane). During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the city became the world&#x27;s chief cotton-trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy that subsequently enhanced the city&#x27;s stature.

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 transformed Mumbai into one of the largest seaports on the Arabian Sea. In September 1896, Mumbai was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. About 850,000 people fled Mumbai and the textile industry was adversely affected. While the city was the capital of the Bombay Presidency, the Indian independence movement fostered the Quit India Movement in 1942 and the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946.

=== Independent India ===
After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the territory of the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state. Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State. In April 1950, Municipal limits of Mumbai were expanded by merging the Mumbai Suburban District and Mumbai City to form the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation.

The Samyukta Maharashtra movement to create a separate Maharashtra state including Mumbai was at its height in the 1950s. In the &quot;Lok Sabha&quot; discussions in 1955, the Congress party demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state. The States Reorganisation Committee recommended a bilingual state for Maharashtra–Gujarat with Mumbai as its capital in its 1955 report. Bombay Citizens&#x27; Committee, an advocacy group of leading Gujarati industrialists lobbied for Mumbai&#x27;s independent status.

Following protests during the movement in which 105 people died in clashes with the police, Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960. Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat. Maharashtra State with Mumbai as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them. As a memorial to the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, Flora Fountain was renamed as &quot;Hutatma Chowk&quot; (Martyr&#x27;s Square) and a memorial was erected.

The following decades saw massive expansion of the city and its suburbs. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) was established on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Mumbai metropolitan region. In August 1979, a sister township of New Mumbai was founded by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across the Thane and Raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of Mumbai&#x27;s population. The textile industry in Mumbai largely disappeared after the widespread 1982 Great Bombay Textile Strike, in which nearly 250,000 workers in more than 50 textile mills went on strike. Mumbai&#x27;s defunct cotton mills have since become the focus of intense redevelopment. Industrial development began in Mumbai when its economy started focusing on the petrochemical, electronic, and automotive sectors. In 1954 Hindustan Petroleum commissioned Mumbai Refinery at Trombay and BPCL Refinery.

The Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which handles 55–60% of India&#x27;s containerised cargo, was commissioned on 26 May 1989 across the creek at Nhava Sheva with a view to de-congest Mumbai Harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city. The geographical limits of Greater Mumbai were coextensive with municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. On 1 October 1990, the Greater Mumbai district was bifurcated to form two revenue districts namely, Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban, though they continued to be administered by same Municipal Administration.

The years from 1990 to 2010 saw an increase in violence and terrorism activities. Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992–93 in which more than 1,000 people were killed. In March 1993, a series of 13 coordinated bombings at several city landmarks by Islamic extremists and the Mumbai underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries. In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city&#x27;s commuter trains. In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels. The three coordinated bomb explosions in July 2011 that occurred at the Opera house, Zaveri Bazaar and Dadar were the latest in the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai which resulted in 26 deaths and 130 injuries.

Mumbai is the commercial capital of India and has evolved into a global financial hub. For several decades it has been the home of India&#x27;s main financial services companies, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment. From being an ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, Mumbai has become South Asia&#x27;s largest city and home of the world&#x27;s most prolific film industry.

== Geography ==

Mumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of Salsette Island, which lies between the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east and Vasai Creek to the north. Mumbai&#x27;s suburban district occupies most of the island. Navi Mumbai is east of Thane Creek and Thane is north of Vasai Creek. Mumbai consists of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra. The city district region is also commonly referred to as the &quot;Island City&quot; or South Mumbai. The total area of Mumbai is . Of this, the island city spans , while the suburban district spans , together accounting for under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the MCGM. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of .
Mumbai lies at the mouth of the Ulhas River on the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan. It sits on Salsette Island (Sashti Island), which it partially shares with the Thane district. Mumbai is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west. Many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from ; the city has an average elevation of . Northern Mumbai (Salsette) is hilly, and the highest point in the city is at Salsette in the Powai–Kanheri ranges. The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali National Park) is located partly in the Mumbai suburban district, and partly in the Thane district, and it extends over an area of .

Apart from the Bhatsa Dam, there are six major lakes that supply water to the city: Vihar, Lower Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, Tulsi, Tansa and Powai. Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are located in Borivili National Park, within the city&#x27;s limits. The supply from Powai lake, also within the city limits, is used only for agricultural and industrial purposes. Three small rivers, the Dahisar River, Poinsar (or Poisar) and Ohiwara (or Oshiwara) originate within the park, while the Mithi River originates from Tulsi Lake and gathers water overflowing from Vihar and Powai Lakes. The coastline of the city is indented with numerous creeks and bays, stretching from the Thane creek on the
eastern to Madh Marve on the western front. The eastern coast of Salsette Island is covered with large mangrove swamps, rich in biodiversity, while the western coast is mostly sandy and rocky.

Soil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants dating back to the late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras. Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity. The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region, which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.

=== Climate ===

Mumbai has an extreme tropical wet and dry climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, although the central and northern suburbs have a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) with even heavier wet season rainfall. Mumbai has a virtually rainless period extending from October to May and an extremely wet period peaking in July. A cooler season from December to February is followed by a hotter season from March to May. The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season.

Between June and September, the South-west monsoon rains occur in Mumbai. Pre-monsoon showers are received in May. Occasionally, north-east monsoon showers occur in October and November. The maximum annual rainfall ever recorded was for 1954. The highest rainfall recorded in a single day was on 26 July 2005. The average total annual rainfall is for the Island City, and for the suburbs.

The average annual temperature is , and the average annual precipitation is . In the Island City, the average maximum temperature is , while the average minimum temperature is . In the suburbs, the daily mean maximum temperature range from to , while the daily mean minimum temperature ranges from to . The record high is set on 14 April 1952, and the record low is set on 27 January 1962.

Tropical cyclones are rare in the city. The worst cyclone to ever impact Mumbai was the one in 1948 where gusts reached in Juhu. The storm left 38 people dead and 47 missing. The storm reportedly impacted Mumbai for 20 hours and left the city devastated.

Mumbai is prone to monsoon floods, exacerbated by climate change which affects heavy rains and high tide in the sea. According to the World Bank, unplanned drainage system and informal settlement is a key factor of frequent floods in Mumbai. Among other causes of flooding in Mumbai is its geographic location, Mumbai urban is peninsular in form, (a land-filled area that connects seven islands) a low laying area, compared to its suburbs that sit on an elevated location. Over the past few decades, new informal settlements were formed in the suburbs, causing a rapid increase in population, improper waste management, and drainage congestion. The rainwater from these areas heavily flows towards low-lying urban areas consisting of some slums and high-rise buildings. As a result, slums are either swamped, washed away, or collapse causing heavy casualties, and post-flood water logging lasts for a long time that causing blockage of railway lines-(most frequently used public transport in Mumbai), traffic snarl, inundated roads, and sub-merged bylanes. Over the past few decades, the frequency of floods in Mumbai is enormous, the 2005 Mumbai floods are characterised by 500-1000 deaths, household displacements, damaged infrastructure-(including heritage sites), and a financial loss of 1.2 billion. In the process of reducing floods in Mumbai, the Maharashtra government adopted a flood mitigation plan; according to which the drainage system will be restructured, restoration of Mithi River, and re-establishment of informal settlements. Local civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities are assigned to forecast and issue eviction notices while BMC along with NGO&#x27;s prepare for the evacuation of the residents of those areas to temporary safe camps.

=== Air pollution ===
Air pollution is a major issue in Mumbai. According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database, the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2013 was 63 μg/m3, which is 6.3 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines for the annual mean PM2.5. The Central Pollution Control Board for the Government of India and the Consulate General of the United States, Mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data. In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in Mumbai, among other Indian cities.

Mumbai has been ranked 24th best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India according to &#x27;Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results&#x27; 

== Economy ==

Mumbai, sometimes described as the &quot;New York of India&quot;, is India&#x27;s most populous city and is the financial and commercial capital of the country as it generates 6.16% of the total GDP. It serves as an economic hub of India; as of 2006, Mumbai contributed 10% of the nation&#x27;s factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of foreign trade, and in corporate taxes. Along with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s. 

Estimates of the 2016 economy of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have ranged from $368 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India. Many of India&#x27;s numerous conglomerates (including Larsen &amp; Toubro, State Bank of India (SBI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Tata Group, Godrej and Reliance), and five of the Fortune Global 500 companies are based in Mumbai. This is facilitated by the presence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), and financial sector regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Until the 1970s, Mumbai owed its prosperity largely to textile mills and the seaport, but the local economy has since then diversified to include finance, engineering, diamond-polishing, healthcare, and information technology.
The key sectors contributing to the city&#x27;s economy are: finance, gems &amp; jewellery, leather processing, IT and ITES, textiles, petrochemical, electronics manufacturing, automobiles, and entertainment. Nariman Point and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) are Mumbai&#x27;s major financial centres.

Despite competition from Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune, Mumbai has carved a niche for itself in the information technology industry. The Santacruz Electronic Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) and the International Infotech Park (Navi Mumbai) offer excellent facilities to IT companies.

State and central government employees make up a large percentage of the city&#x27;s workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled self-employed population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics, and other such blue collar professions. The port and shipping industry is well established, with Mumbai Port being one of the oldest and most significant ports in India. Dharavi, in central Mumbai, has an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of the city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.

As of 2024, Mumbai is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world. With a total wealth of around $960 billion, it is the richest Indian city and one of the richest cities in the world. , the Globalization and World Cities Research Network has ranked Mumbai as an &quot;alpha world city&quot;, third in its categories of Global cities. Mumbai is the third most expensive office market in the world, and was ranked among the fastest cities in the country for business startup in 2009.

=== Income inequality ===
However, it is important to acknowledge that Mumbai faces important challenges regarding income inequality. Despite having the largest concentration of billionaires out of any city in Asia, Mumbai is one of the most unequal cities in the world. Like other Indian metropolitan cities, Mumbai is in desperate need of affordable housing infrastructure for its lower and lower-middle class citizens. The median rental cost of a one-bedroom apartment in Mumbai proper is around ₹30,000, while according to ResearchGate, 25% of Mumbai households have a monthly income of less than ₹12,500. The overall average salary in Mumbai is ₹45,000. This means that the vast majority of conventional housing is out of bounds for many Mumbai residents, leading many to rely on informal housing.

== Government and politics ==

=== Civic administration ===

Greater Mumbai (or Brihanmumbai), an area of , consisting of the Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban districts, extends from Colaba in the south, to Mulund and Dahisar in the north, and Mankhurd in the east. Its population as per the 2011 census was 12,442,373.

It is administered by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) (sometimes referred to as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai), formerly known as the &quot;Bombay Municipal Corporation&quot; (BMC). The BMC is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis. The mayor, who serves for a term of years, is chosen through an indirect election by the councillors from among themselves.

The municipal commissioner is the chief executive officer and head of the executive arm of the municipal corporation. All executive powers are vested in the municipal commissioner who is an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed by the state government. Although the municipal corporation is the legislative body that lays down policies for the governance of the city, it is the commissioner who is responsible for the execution of the policies. The commissioner is appointed for a fixed term as defined by state statute. The powers of the commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the corporation or the standing committee.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation was ranked 9th out of 21 cities for best governance &amp; administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 3.5 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.
The two revenue districts of Mumbai come under the jurisdiction of a District Collector. The collectors are in charge of property records and revenue collection for the central government, and oversee the national elections held in the city.

The Mumbai Police is headed by a police commissioner, who is an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. The Mumbai Police is a division of the Maharashtra Police, under the state Home Ministry. The city is divided into seven police zones and seventeen traffic police zones, each headed by a deputy commissioner of police. The Mumbai Traffic Police is a semi-autonomous body under the Mumbai Police. The Mumbai Fire Brigade, which is under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation, is headed by the chief fire officer, who is assisted by four deputy chief fire officers and six divisional officers. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is responsible for infrastructure development and planning of Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

Mumbai also has two lower courts, the Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. Mumbai also has a special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (TADA) court for people accused of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism in the city.

=== National politics ===

Mumbai had been a traditional stronghold and birthplace of the Indian National Congress, also known as the Congress Party. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Mumbai from 28 to 31 December 1885. The city played host to the Indian National Congress six times during its first 50 years, and became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the 20th century.

The 1960s saw the rise of regionalist politics in Mumbai, with the formation of the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966, under the leadership of Balasaheb Thackeray out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalisation of the native Marathi people in Mumbai. Shiv Sena switched from &#x27;Marathi Cause&#x27; to larger &#x27;Hindutva Cause&#x27; in 1985 and joined hands with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in the same year. The Congress had dominated the politics of Mumbai from independence until the early 1980s, when the Shiv Sena won the 1985 Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections.

In 1989, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major national political party, forged an electoral alliance with the Shiv Sena to dislodge the Congress in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections. In 1999, several members left the Congress to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) but later allied with the Congress as part of an alliance known as the Democratic Front. Other parties such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and several independent candidates also contest elections in the city.

In the Indian national elections held every five years, Mumbai is represented by six parliamentary constituencies: North, North West, North East, North Central, South Central, and South. A member of parliament (MP) to the &quot;Lok Sabha&quot;, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is elected from each of the parliamentary constituencies. In the 2019 national election, all six parliamentary constituencies were won by the BJP and Shiv Sena in alliance, with both parties winning three seats each.
In the Maharashtra state assembly elections held every five years, Mumbai is represented by 36 assembly constituencies. A member of the legislative assembly (MLA) to the Maharashtra &quot;Vidhan Sabha&quot; (legislative assembly) is elected from each of the assembly constituencies. In the 2019 state assembly election, out of the 36 assembly constituencies, 16 were won by the BJP, 11 by the Shiv Sena, 6 by the Congress, 2 by the NCP and one by independent candidate.

Elections are also held every five years to elect corporators to power in the MCGM. The Corporation comprises 227 directly elected Councillors representing the 24 municipal wards, five nominated Councillors having special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, and a mayor whose role is mostly ceremonial. In the 2012 municipal corporation elections, out of the 227 seats, the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance secured 107 seats, holding power with the support of independent candidates in the MCGM, while the Congress-NCP alliance bagged 64 seats. The tenure of the mayor, deputy mayor, and municipal commissioner is years.

Though 88% of the city&#x27;s commuters travel by public transport, Mumbai still continues to struggle with traffic congestion. Mumbai&#x27;s transport system has been categorised as one of the most congested in the world.

==== Water ====
Water transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercraft and catamarans. Services are provided by both government agencies as well as private partners. Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai. They were subsequently scrapped due to lack of adequate infrastructure.

=== Roads ===
Mumbai is served by National Highway 48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160 and National Highway 61. The Mumbai–Chennai and Mumbai–Delhi prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral system of National Highways start from the city. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India. The Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the island city to the western suburbs. The three major road arteries of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel and the Western Express Highway from Bandra to Bhayander.

=== Air ===

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the main aviation hub in the city and the second busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic. It handled 52.8 million passengers in the Financial Year 2024, an increase of 16 per cent in passenger traffic over the previous Financial Year. An upgrade plan was initiated in 2006, targeted at increasing the capacity of the airport to handle up to 40 million passengers annually and the new terminal T2 was opened in February 2014.

The Navi Mumbai International airport, being built in the Kopra-Panvel area, will help relieve the increasing traffic burden on the existing airport. It is expected to be completed and become operational by March 2025.

The Juhu Aerodrome was India&#x27;s first airport, and now hosts the Bombay Flying Club and a heliport operated by state-owned Pawan Hans.

=== Sea ===
Mumbai is served by two major ports, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, which lies just across the creek in Navi Mumbai. Mumbai Port has one of the best natural harbours in the world, and has extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities. Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India. It handles 55–60% of the country&#x27;s total containerised cargo. Ferries from Ferry Wharf in Mazagaon allow access to islands near the city.

The city is also the headquarters of the Western Naval Command, and also an important base for the Indian Navy.

== Utility services ==

Under colonial rule, tanks were the only source of water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM supplies potable water to the city from six lakes, most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway. The water is filtered at Bhandup, which is Asia&#x27;s largest water filtration plant. India&#x27;s first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.

About 700 million (70 crore) litres of water, out of a daily supply of 3.5 billion (350 crore) litres, is lost by way of water thefts, illegal connections and leakages, per day in Mumbai. Almost all of Mumbai&#x27;s daily refuse of , of which is plastic waste, is transported to dumping grounds in Gorai in the northwest, Mulund in the northeast, and to the Deonar dumping ground in the east. Sewage treatment is carried out at Worli and Bandra, and disposed of by two independent marine outfalls of and at Bandra and Worli respectively.

Electricity is distributed by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking in the island city, and by Adani Transmission, Tata Power and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (Mahavitaran) in the suburbs. Power supply cables are underground, which reduces pilferage, thefts and other losses.

Cooking gas is supplied in the form of liquefied petroleum gas cylinders sold by state-owned oil companies, as well as through piped natural gas supplied by Mahanagar Gas Limited.

The largest telephone service provider is the state-owned MTNL, which held a monopoly over fixed line and cellular services up until 2000, and provides fixed line as well as mobile WLL services. Mobile phone coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are Vodafone Essar, Airtel, MTNL, Loop Mobile, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and Tata Indicom. Both GSM and CDMA services are available in the city. Mumbai, along with the area served by telephone exchanges in Navi Mumbai and Kalyan is classified as a &quot;Metro&quot; telecom circle. Many of the above service providers also provide broadband internet and wireless internet access in Mumbai. , Mumbai had the highest number of internet users in India with 16.4 million (1.64 crore) users.

== Demographics ==


According to the 2011 census, the population of Mumbai city was 12,479,608. The population density is estimated to be about . The living space is per person. Mumbai Metropolitan Region was home to 20,748,395 people by 2011. Greater Mumbai, the area under the administration of the MCGM, has a literacy rate of 94.7%, higher than the national average of 86.7%. The number of slum-dwellers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is estimated to be 90 lakh (9 million), up from 60 lakh (6 million) in 2001 which constitutes approximately 38.5% of the region.

The sex ratio in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 males in the island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the national average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio is partly because of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.

Mumbai suffers from the same major urbanisation problems seen in many fast growing cities in developing countries: poverty and unemployment. With available land at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. Many of them live close to bus or train stations, although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district. Dharavi, Asia&#x27;s second largest slum (if Karachi&#x27;s Orangi Town is counted as a single slum) is located in central Mumbai and houses between 800,000 and 10 lakh (one million) people in , making it one of the most densely populated areas on Earth with a population density of at least .

The number of migrants to Mumbai from outside Maharashtra during the 1991–2001 decade was 11.2 lakh (1.12 million), which amounted to 54.8% of the net addition to the population of Mumbai.

The number of households in Mumbai is forecast to rise from 42 lakh (4.2 million) in 2008 to 66 lakh (6.6 million) in 2020. The number of households with annual incomes of 20 lakh (2 million) rupees will increase from 4% to 10% by 2020, amounting to 660,000 families. The number of households with incomes from 10 to 20 lakh (1–2 million) rupees is also estimated to increase from 4% to 15% by 2020. According to the 2016 report of the Central Pollution Control Board, Mumbai is the noisiest city in India, ahead of Lucknow, Hyderabad and Delhi.

=== Ethnic groups and religions ===


The religious groups represented in Greater Mumbai as of 2011 include Hindus (65.99%), Muslims (20.65%), Buddhists (4.85%), Jains (4.10%), Christians (3.27%) and Sikhs (0.49%). The linguistic/ethnic demographics in the Greater Mumbai Area are: Maharashtrians (32%), Gujaratis (20%), with the rest hailing from other parts of India.

Native Christians include East Indian Catholics, who were converted by the Portuguese during the 16th century, while Goan and Mangalorean Catholics also constitute a significant portion of the Christian community of the city. Jews settled in Mumbai during the 18th century. The Bene Israeli Jewish community of Mumbai, who migrated from the Konkan villages, south of Mumbai, are believed to be the descendants of the Jews of Israel who were shipwrecked off the Konkan coast, probably in the year 175 BCE, during the reign of the Greek ruler, Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Mumbai is also home to the largest population of Parsi Zoroastrians in the world, numbering about 60,000, however their population is declining rapidly. Parsis migrated to India from Greater Iran following the Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century. The oldest Muslim communities in Mumbai include the Dawoodi Bohras, Ismaili Khojas, and Konkani Muslims.

=== Cityscape ===

Mumbai&#x27;s cityscape consists of a variety of tall buildings and structures, most of which have been built in the last two decades. There was a significant lull in construction projects since the mid-1990s after which construction projects began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing. 
Mumbai with a commanding 77% share of tall buildings in India, is poised to maintain its position as the frontrunner in tall building construction due to its ability to command premium prices compared to other cities, thereby ensuring the economic viability of such developments within the city.
Mumbai has more residential tall buildings rather than commercial, unlike the trend globally. Limited land resources and an exponential increase in urban population were the primary reasons for Mumbai&#x27;s vertical growth compared to other Tier 1 Indian cities.

<text>The Miami Dolphins are a professional American football team based in the Miami metropolitan area. The Dolphins compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, a northern suburb of Miami. The team is owned by Stephen M. Ross. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, the Dolphins are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the southeast, along with the Atlanta Falcons.

The Dolphins were founded by Joe Robbie, an attorney and politician, and Danny Thomas, an actor and comedian. They began play in the AFL in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks, who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts. For the first few years, the Dolphins&#x27; full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew&#x27;s School, a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger.

The team played in its first Super Bowl in Super Bowl VI, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, 24–3. The following year, the Dolphins completed the NFL&#x27;s only perfect season, culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular season games, and all three of their playoff games, including Super Bowl VII. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect regular season, and remain the only team to do so including playoffs since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won Super Bowl VIII, becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX, losing both games.

For most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula, the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the 1999 season.

Since Marino&#x27;s retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just six playoff appearances (2000, 2001, 2008, 2016, 2022, and 2023) and two division titles (2000 and 2008) with one playoff win. They currently have the longest postseason win drought in the NFL.

In December 2024 the Dolphins, led by owner Stephen M. Ross, became one of the first teams in NFL history to sell part of their team to outside private equity investors. 13% of the Dolphins franchise was sold at a valuation of $8.1 billion, including 10% to the American investment group Ares Management.

==History==

The Miami Dolphins joined the American Football League (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer Joseph Robbie and actor Danny Thomas in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie. During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins&#x27; training camp was in St. Pete Beach with practices in August at Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport.

===Don Shula===
The Dolphins were the worst team with a 15–39–2 record in their first four seasons under head coach George Wilson, before Don Shula was hired as head coach. Shula was a Paul Brown disciple who had been lured from the Baltimore Colts, after losing Super Bowl III two seasons earlier to the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets, and finishing 8–5–1 the following season. Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL merged with the NFL in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the AFC East division in the NFL&#x27;s new American Football Conference.

For the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999. They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete perfect season in NFL history by finishing with a 14–0 regular-season record in 1972 and winning the Super Bowl that year. It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row. The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino, who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s. After winning every game against the division rival Buffalo Bills in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a competitive rivalry in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when Jim Kelly emerged as the quarterback for the Bills. The Dolphins have also maintained a strong rivalry with the New York Jets throughout much of their history.

Following the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s and 2010s. During this period, the team&#x27;s level of play was largely described as mediocre. They have only made the playoffs four times since Marino&#x27;s retirement and have largely been unable to find a consistent quarterback to replace him.

===Jimmy Johnson===
Jimmy Johnson was hired to replace Shula prior to the 1996 season. In his first season at the helm, he led the team to a 8–8 record and missed the postseason. In the 1997, the team improved to a 9–7 mark and made the postseason. The team saw their season end in the Wild Card Round with a 17–3 loss to the New England Patriots. In the 1998 season, the team went 10–6 and made the postseason. The Dolphins defeated the Bills 24–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Denver Broncos 38–3 in the Divisional Round. In the 1999 season, the Dolphins went 9–7 and made the postseason. The team defeated the Buffalo Bills 24–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling 62–7 to the Jacksonville Jaguars in what would be quarterback Dan Marino&#x27;s final game. Johnson resigned following the season.

===Dave Wannstedt===
Going into the 2000 season, the Dolphins named Dave Wannstedt as head coach. In his first season with the Dolphins, he led the team to a 11–5 record and an AFC East title. The team defeated the Indianapolis Colts 23–17 in the Wild Card Round before losing 27–0 to the Oakland Raiders in the Divisional Round. In the 2001 season, the team made the postseason with a 11–5 record and runner-up placement in the AFC East. The team lost to the Baltimore Ravens 20–3 in the Wild Card Round. In the 2002 season, the team failed to make the postseason despite a 9–7 record. In the 2003 season, the team went 10–6 but missed the postseason. Following a 1–8 start in the 2004 season, Wannstedt resigned. Jim Bates finished out the year with a 3–4 mark.

===Nick Saban===
Nick Saban coached the Dolphins in the 2005 and 2006 seasons. He went 9–7 and 6–10 in those two seasons, missing the playoffs in both. Saban resigned following the 2006 season to leave for the University of Alabama.

===Cam Cameron===
Prior to the 2007 season, the Dolphins hired Cam Cameron has head coach. The team suffered a franchise-worst 1–15 season in 2007. After the 2007 season, the team fired Cameron.

===Tony Sparano===
Tony Sparano was named head coach of the Dolphins prior to the 2008 season. In his first season, he led the team to an 11–5 result and an AFC East title. During the season, they became the second team to make a 10-game improvement over the previous season. That same season, the Dolphins upset the New England Patriots on the road during Week 3 thanks to the use of the gimmick Wildcat offense, which handed the Patriots their first regular-season loss since December 10, 2006, in which coincidentally, they were also beaten by the Dolphins. However, this success in 2008 proved to be an outlier during this period in the franchise&#x27;s history; to date, it is the last season the Dolphins won the AFC East. The team&#x27;s season ended with a 27–9 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round. The 2009 and 2010 seasons saw regression with a 7–9 record in both years. After a 4–9 start to the 2011 season, Sparano was fired. Todd Bowles finished the 6–10 season as interim coach.

===Joe Philbin===
Prior to the 2012 season, the team hired Joe Philbin as head coach. In his first season at the helm, Philbin led the team to a 7–9 record. In the 2013, the team improved to a 8–8 record but still missed the postseason. In the 2014 season, the team added Bill Lazor as offensive coordinator. The Dolphins once again finished 8–8. After a 1–3 start to the 2015 season, Philbin was fired. Dan Campbell was named as interim coach and finished the year with a 5–7 mark.

===Adam Gase===
Prior to the 2016 season, the team hired Adam Gase as head coach. He led the team to a 10–6 record and a postseason berth in the 2016 season. The team&#x27;s season ended with a 30–12 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round. In the 2017 season, the Dolphins regressed to a 6–10 record. In the 2018 season, the Dolphins finished with a 7–9 record. After a cumulative 23–25 record, Gase was fired by the Dolphins.

===Brian Flores===
Prior to the 2019 season, the Dolphins hired Brian Flores as head coach. He led the team to a 5–11 record in the 2019 season. The team drafted Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft. In the 2020 season, the team improved to a 10–6 mark but still missed the postseason. In the 2021 season, the team went 9–8 but missed the postseason. Following the end of the 2021 season, Flores was fired as head coach.

===Mike McDaniel===
Prior to the 2022 season, Mike McDaniel was hired as head coach. In his first season, he led the Dolphins to a 9–8 record and a 34–31 loss to the Bills in the Wild Card Round. In the 2023 season, the team improved to a 11–6 mark but the season again ended in the Wild Card Round with a 26–7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Dolphins finished with an 8–9 record in 2024, missing the playoffs for the first time in McDaniel&#x27;s head coaching tenure.

== Championships ==

===Super Bowl championships===
===AFC championships===
==Rivalries==
===Divisional===
==== New England Patriots ====

The Dolphins dominated the New England Patriots during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a 1982 game now known as the Snowplow Game. Fortunes changed when Tom Brady became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and during his tenure with the Patriots, New England dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East, winning 16 of 17 division titles between 2003 and 2019, with the Dolphins winning the only non-Patriots division title in that time frame when Brady was out due to injury. Miami posed the biggest divisional challenge to the Brady-led Patriots, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that era.

Notable wins over New England by the Dolphins include the Miracle in Miami, which involved a dramatic last-minute game-winning touchdown that paralleled &quot;The Night that Courage Wore Orange&quot;, where in 2004, the Dolphins, at 2–11, upset the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots 28–29, and handed them the second of their 2 losses that season. The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban, Bill Belichick&#x27;s former Browns defensive coordinator was hired as their new head coach and when Saban nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees, as well as in 2008, when the two teams battled for the AFC East division title. Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular-season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going 14–0 in 1972 and New England going 16–0 in 2007, but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl. As of the 2024 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 64–55.

==== Buffalo Bills ====

The Dolphins and the Buffalo Bills have a long-standing rivalry, as there are stark characteristic differences between the cities of Miami and Buffalo, especially in climate and culture. The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when Jim Kelly became the Bills&#x27; starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff matchups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins&#x27; only playoff win coming after Kelly&#x27;s retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino, the Bills-Dolphins rivalry faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably Dan Carpenter, Chris Hogan, and Charles Clay.

In the 2020s, the rivalry intensified again, with Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, drafted in 2020, leading a resurgent Dolphins team against the Josh Allen-led Bills, who had gained a streak of success after Brady&#x27;s departure from the Patriots and the division. Though Allen&#x27;s career record against Miami currently stands at 13–2, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first win over Bills in 8 games in 2022, and the Dolphins played the Bills tightly in the teams&#x27; two other meetings that year despite losing both, including the playoffs. As of the 2024 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 62–60–1.

==== New York Jets ====

The New York Jets are perhaps Miami&#x27;s most bitter rivals. Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets&#x27; misplaced cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include Dan Marino&#x27;s fake spike, Vinny Testaverde leading the Jets to a notable comeback on Monday Night Football, and former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title. The two teams have also played in the 1982 AFC Championship, with Miami winning to face the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVII. As of the 2024 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 61–57–1.

===Conference===
==== Jacksonville Jaguars ====
The Dolphins have taken part in a minor rivalry with the Jacksonville Jaguars as both teams are the only two AFC franchises located in Florida. The two teams first met during the 1998 NFL season on a Monday Night Football matchup. Both teams later met in the 1999 AFC Divisional Round in what would ultimately be the final career game for Dolphins&#x27; hall-of-fame quarterback Dan Marino. The Dolphins entered the game as heavy underdogs as they had finished the 1999 season 9–7, securing the lowest wild card berth. Meanwhile; the Jaguars had boasted an impressive 14–2 campaign under pro-bowl quarterback Mark Brunell; culminating in the Jaguars destroying Miami in a 62–7 blowout loss. The Jaguars managed an improbable upset victory during the 2021 Season as the team had declined severely under controversial head coach Urban Meyer. Despite this; the Jaguars managed a comeback victory against the Dolphins in London during week 6. Miami leads the series 6–5 all time, though the Jaguars lead 1–0 in the postseason.

==== Indianapolis Colts ====
When the then-Baltimore Colts were inserted into the AFC East following the AFL/NFL merger, they sparked a heated rivalry with the Dolphins, as a controversy involving the hiring of former Colts coach Don Shula forced Miami to forfeit a first-round draft pick. The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to Super Bowl VI, which the Dolphins lost to the Dallas Cowboys. The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and moved to Indianapolis, but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the AFC South as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL&#x27;s divisions. As of 2024, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 48–29.

===Inter Conference===
==== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ====

Since the founding of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976, the Dolphins and Buccaneers have shared a mellow in-state rivalry and were the only two teams in Florida until the Jacksonville Jaguars joined the NFL in 1995. As of the 2023 season, the Buccaneers lead the all-time series 7–5.

===Historic===
==== Kansas City Chiefs ====
The Dolphins won a notable pair of games against the Kansas City Chiefs, defeating them in &quot;The Longest Game&quot;, the final game in Municipal Stadium, and then the first regular season game at Arrowhead Stadium in 1972. As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 17–16.

==== Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers, Pittsburgh Steelers====

The Dolphins also share historic rivalries with other AFC teams such as the Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Chargers, and Pittsburgh Steelers, stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era. As of the 2023 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 21–20–1.

==Facilities==

===Stadiums===
The Dolphins originally played all home games in the Orange Bowl in Miami. They moved to the new Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1986 season. From 1993 to 2011, the Dolphins shared the stadium with Major League Baseball&#x27;s Florida Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins). The venue has had multiple naming rights deals since 1996, carrying the names Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, New Miami Stadium and, as of August 2016, Hard Rock Stadium. The facility is located in Miami Gardens, a suburb of Miami located approximately north of downtown Miami. The Miami Dolphins share Hard Rock Stadium with the NCAA Miami Hurricanes. The 2015–2016 season was the first season in the newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. The Dolphins spent more than two years and over $400 million on a major overhaul to Hard Rock Stadium. Every seat was replaced and the lower-level seats were moved closer to the field. There are roughly 10,000 fewer seats.

===Training===

St. Petersburg Beach hosted the Dolphins&#x27; first training camp in 1966. St. Andrew&#x27;s School in Boca Raton hosted training camp in the late 1960s. The Dolphins subsequently trained in Miami Gardens at Biscayne College, later renamed St. Thomas University, from 1970 until 1993.

In 1993, the Dolphins opened the Miami Dolphins Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. In 2006, the facility added a domed field that allows the team to practice during thunderstorms which are common in the area during the summer.

In 2021, the Dolphins opened a new, 135 million training facility, dubbed the Baptist Health Training Complex, the Dolphins will practice in. The complex is located next to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

==Franchise information==

===Logos and uniforms===

====Leaping dolphin (1966–2012)====
The Dolphins logo and uniforms remained fairly consistent from the team&#x27;s founding through 2012. The team&#x27;s colors were originally aqua and coral, with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team&#x27;s original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter &amp; brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin&#x27;s head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin&#x27;s body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. Starting with the 1972 perfect season, these uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes.

An update was given to the logo in 1997 – the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression. The uniforms remained the same; however, a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added.

On very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against Washington, a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; match pitting the 2–11 Dolphins against the 12–1 defending champion New England Patriots. The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as &quot;The Night That Courage Wore Orange&quot;. The orange jerseys were used for a 2009 Monday night win against the New York Jets. However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the orange jerseys in the original style would not be worn again.

In 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes.

The Dolphins&#x27; final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28–0 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in Foxboro. The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo.

====Stylized swimming dolphin (2013–present)====
A new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the 2013 NFL draft. The new logo features a stylized aqua dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy.

Navy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers; however, the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look; however, navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large &quot;Dolphins&quot; text above the numbers, written in the team&#x27;s new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark.

In 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo.

====Throwback uniforms====
In 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 Miracle in Miami play against the Patriots.

====Color Rush uniform====
On September 29, 2016, the Dolphins debuted their new Color Rush uniform in a Thursday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The all-orange uniform marked the first time since 2010 that the Dolphins wore an orange uniform. However, the set was only used for that game as the Dolphins immediately retired the uniform soon after.

In later years, the Dolphins wore similar all-aqua or all-white uniforms in select games as the NFL gradually relaxed its rules regarding hosiery.

===Fight song===
The song was written and composed by Lee Ofman, and has similar instrumentation and lyrics to the fight song of the Houston Oilers. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17–0 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15–2 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song&#x27;s longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by T-Pain and Jimmy Buffett featuring Pitbull on August 7, 2009, which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season. The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett&#x27;s song &quot;Fins&quot; after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song.

===Cheerleaders===
The team&#x27;s cheerleaders are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders. The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites. (The name referred to the co-sponsor, Starbrite Car Polish.) The cheerleaders&#x27; founding choreographer was June Taylor, famed colleague of Jackie Gleason, who led the squad until her retirement in 1990.

===Special Teams/Volunteer Program===
In April 2010, the Dolphins started the first Volunteer Program in the NFL. Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques. Since its inception, Special Teams has given over 250,000 community services hours to the South Florida and Mexico community.

===Mascots===

====T.D.====

(&quot;The Dolphin&quot;)
On Friday, April 18, 1997, the first &quot;official&quot; mascot of the Miami Dolphins was introduced. The 7-foot mascot made his public debut on April 19 at Pro Player Stadium during the team&#x27;s draft-day party. The team then made a &quot;Name the Mascot&quot; contest that drew over 13,000 entries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997.

====Dolfan Denny====
Denny Sym cheered on the Miami Dolphins for 33 years as a one-man sideline show, leading Miami crowds in cheers and chants in his glittering coral (orange) and aqua hat from the Dolphins&#x27; first game in 1966 until 2000. Sym died on March 18, 2007. He was 72.

====Flipper====
From 1966 to 1968, and in the 1970s a live dolphin was situated in a water tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl. He would jump in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs, and in the 1970s due to stress.

==Radio and television==

In August 2010, the team launched its own regional TV network to carry preseason games and in-season content such as coach and player shows. The Dolphins Television Network comprises 10 South Florida TV stations that agreed to carry the team-produced coverage. Preseason games are broadcast on television through CBS-owned WFOR-TV in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, WTVX in West Palm Beach, WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, and WRDQ in Orlando. Longtime TV and radio personality Dick Stockton provides play-by-play commentary, with Dolphins Hall-of-Fame QB Bob Griese and former Dolphins WR Nat Moore providing color commentary. The radio broadcast team features Jimmy Cefalo providing play-by-play commentary and Joe Rose providing color commentary during preseason games, along with Griese for regular-season games. Griese replaced longtime color commentator Jim Mandich after his death in 2011, who played for the Dolphins under Don Shula. Radio coverage as of the 2023 season is carried WINZ (940 AM) and WBGG-FM (105.9 FM). Additionally, games can also be heard in Spanish on WNMA (1210 AM), with Raúl Striker Jr. and Joaquin Duro providing play-by-play and color commentary, respectively.

CBS-owned WFOR, in addition to preseason telecasts, airs most of the Dolphins&#x27; regular season games and &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;, with rare home games moved or delayed by hurricanes carried by sister station WBFS-TV due to network conflicts, and some games carried by WSVN when flexed to Fox. When playing on Sunday night, the team&#x27;s matches will be broadcast on NBC&#x27;s WTVJ.

Each of these players is honored with a placard on the facing of the upper level around Hard Rock Stadium including team founder-owner Joe Robbie. In place of a jersey number, Don Shula has the number 347, representing his record number of NFL coaching victories, 274 of them as Dolphins head coach. Dan Marino&#x27;s name includes his career passing statistics of attempts (8,358), completions (4,967), passing yards (61,361), and touchdown passes (420). Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees are additionally denoted by a hall of fame logo next to their names.

In 1992, at the 20-year anniversary, Miami&#x27;s &quot;1972 Undefeated Team&quot; was enshrined into the Honor Roll. At the 40 year anniversary, which enshrined former defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger into the Honor Roll, his name went on the Honor Roll where the &quot;1972 Undefeated Team&quot; inductee previously and originally was enshrined, and an updated &quot;1972 Perfect Season Team 17–0&quot; inductee was put into one corner of Hard Rock Stadium with special placards of Super Bowl VII and Super Bowl VIII included next to it on each side.


The inductees as of 2024 include:

<text>M, or m, is the thirteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of several western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is &quot;em&quot; (pronounced ), plural &quot;ems&quot;.

==History==

The letter M is derived from the Phoenician Mem via the Greek Mu (Μ, μ). Semitic Mem is most likely derived from a &quot;Proto-Sinaitic&quot; (Bronze Age) adoption of the &quot;water&quot; ideogram in Egyptian writing. The Egyptian sign had the acrophonic value , from the Egyptian word for &quot;water&quot;, &quot;nt&quot;; the adoption as the Semitic letter for was presumably also on acrophonic grounds, from the Semitic word for &quot;water&quot;, &quot;*mā(y)-&quot;.

==Use in writing systems==
===English===
In English, represents the voiced bilabial nasal .

The Oxford English Dictionary (first edition) says that is sometimes a vowel, such as in words like &quot;spasm&quot; and in the suffix &quot;-ism&quot;. In modern terminology, this is described as a syllabic consonant (IPA: ).

M is the fourteenth most frequently used letter in the English language.

===Other languages===
The letter represents the voiced bilabial nasal in the orthography of Latin as well as in those of many modern languages. 

In Washo, lower-case represents a voiced bilabial nasal , while upper-case represents a voiceless bilabial nasal .

===Other systems===
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, represents the voiced bilabial nasal .

==Other uses==
* The Roman numeral M represents the number 1000, though it was not used in Roman times. There is, however, scant evidence that the letter was later introduced in the early centuries A.D. by the Romans.
* Unit prefix M (mega), meaning one million times, and m (milli) meaning one-thousandth.
* m is the standard abbreviation for metre (or meter) in the International System of Units (SI). However, m is also used as an abbreviation for mile.
* M is used as the unit abbreviation for molarity.
* With money amounts, m or M is ambiguous. In the finance industry, m or M means 1,000. In this context, five million dollars is written $5mm or $5MM. Outside of finance, some people use M like the metric system &quot;mega-&quot; to mean one million and write $5M.
* M often represents male or masculine, especially in conjunction with F for female or feminine.
* In typography, an em dash is a punctuation symbol whose width is similar to that of a capital letter M.
* M is used as a logo by many rapid transit systems, standing for &quot;Metro&quot; (or equivalents in other languages.)

<text>A mean is a quantity representing the &quot;center&quot; of a collection of numbers and is intermediate to the extreme values of the set of numbers. There are several kinds of means (or &quot;measures of central tendency&quot;) in mathematics, especially in statistics. Each attempts to summarize or typify a given group of data, illustrating the magnitude and sign of the data set. Which of these measures is most illuminating depends on what is being measured, and on context and purpose.

The &quot;arithmetic mean&quot;, also known as &quot;arithmetic average&quot;, is the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., x&quot;n&quot; is typically denoted using an overhead bar, formula_1. If the numbers are from observing a sample of a larger group, the arithmetic mean is termed the &quot;sample mean&quot; (formula_1) to distinguish it from the group mean (or expected value) of the underlying distribution, denoted formula_3 or formula_4.

Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below.

==Types of means==

===Pythagorean means===

In mathematics, the three classical Pythagorean means are the arithmetic mean (AM), the geometric mean (GM), and the harmonic mean (HM). These means were studied with proportions by Pythagoreans and later generations of Greek mathematicians because of their importance in geometry and music.
==== Arithmetic mean (AM) ====

The arithmetic mean (or simply &quot;mean&quot; or &quot;average&quot;) of a list of numbers, is the sum of all of the numbers divided by their count. Similarly, the mean of a sample formula_5, usually denoted by formula_1, is the sum of the sampled values divided by the number of items in the sample.

:formula_7

For example, the arithmetic mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is:
:formula_8

==== Geometric mean (GM) ====
The geometric mean is an average that is useful for sets of positive numbers, that are interpreted according to their product (as is the case with rates of growth) and not their sum (as is the case with the arithmetic mean):
:formula_9 

For example, the geometric mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is:
:formula_10

==== Harmonic mean (HM) ====
The harmonic mean is an average which is useful for sets of numbers which are defined in relation to some unit, as in the case of speed (i.e., distance per unit of time):
:formula_11

For example, the harmonic mean of the five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is

:formula_12

If we have five pumps that can empty a tank of a certain size in respectively 4, 36, 45, 50, and 75 minutes, then the harmonic mean of formula_13
tells us that these five different pumps working together will pump at the same rate as much as five pumps that can each empty the tank in formula_13 minutes.

==== Relationship between AM, GM, and HM ====

AM, GM, and HM satisfy these inequalities:

:formula_15

Equality holds if all the elements of the given sample are equal.

===Statistical location===

In descriptive statistics, the mean may be confused with the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may incorrectly be called an &quot;average&quot; (more formally, a measure of central tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic average of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions.

====Mean of a probability distribution====
The mean of a probability distribution is the long-run arithmetic average value of a random variable having that distribution. If the random variable is denoted by formula_16, then the mean is also known as the expected value of formula_16 (denoted formula_18). For a discrete probability distribution, the mean is given by formula_19, where the sum is taken over all possible values of the random variable and formula_20 is the probability mass function. For a continuous distribution, the mean is formula_21, where formula_22 is the probability density function. In all cases, including those in which the distribution is neither discrete nor continuous, the mean is the Lebesgue integral of the random variable with respect to its probability measure. The mean need not exist or be finite; for some probability distributions the mean is infinite ( or ), while for others the mean is undefined.

===Generalized means===

====Power mean====
The generalized mean, also known as the power mean or Hölder mean, is an abstraction of the quadratic, arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means. It is defined for a set of &quot;n&quot; positive numbers &quot;x&quot;i by
formula_23 
By choosing different values for the parameter &quot;m&quot;, the following types of means are obtained:






==== &quot;f&quot;-mean====
This can be generalized further as the generalized -mean
: formula_24

and again a suitable choice of an invertible will give

===Weighted arithmetic mean===
The weighted arithmetic mean (or weighted average) is used if one wants to combine average values from different sized samples of the same population:

:formula_25 

Where formula_26 and formula_27 are the mean and size of sample formula_28 respectively. In other applications, they represent a measure for the reliability of the influence upon the mean by the respective values.

===Truncated mean===
Sometimes, a set of numbers might contain outliers (i.e., data values which are much lower or much higher than the others). Often, outliers are erroneous data caused by artifacts. In this case, one can use a truncated mean. It involves discarding given parts of the data at the top or the bottom end, typically an equal amount at each end and then taking the arithmetic mean of the remaining data. The number of values removed is indicated as a percentage of the total number of values.

===Interquartile mean===
The interquartile mean is a specific example of a truncated mean. It is simply the arithmetic mean after removing the lowest and the highest quarter of values.
: formula_29

assuming the values have been ordered, so is simply a specific example of a weighted mean for a specific set of weights.

===Mean of a function===

In some circumstances, mathematicians may calculate a mean of an infinite (or even an uncountable) set of values. This can happen when calculating the mean value formula_30 of a function formula_22. Intuitively, a mean of a function can be thought of as calculating the area under a section of a curve, and then dividing by the length of that section. This can be done crudely by counting squares on graph paper, or more precisely by integration. The integration formula is written as:

: formula_32

In this case, care must be taken to make sure that the integral converges. But the mean may be finite even if the function itself tends to infinity at some points.

===Mean of angles and cyclical quantities===
Angles, times of day, and other cyclical quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, there will not be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists. Consider a color wheel—there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.

=== Fréchet mean ===
The Fréchet mean gives a manner for determining the &quot;center&quot; of a mass distribution on a surface or, more generally, Riemannian manifold. Unlike many other means, the Fréchet mean is defined on a space whose elements cannot necessarily be added together or multiplied by scalars.
It is sometimes also known as the &quot;Karcher mean&quot; (named after Hermann Karcher).

=== Triangular sets ===

In geometry, there are thousands of different
definitions for the center of a triangle that can all be interpreted as the mean of a triangular set of points in the plane.

===Swanson&#x27;s rule===

This is an approximation to the mean for a moderately skewed distribution. It is used in hydrocarbon exploration and is defined as:

: formula_33

where formula_34, formula_35 and formula_36 are the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the distribution, respectively.
