<text>Lacrosse is a contact team sport played with a lacrosse stick and a lacrosse ball. It is the oldest organized sport in North America, with its origins with the indigenous people of North America as early as the 12th century. The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.

Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has five versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women&#x27;s lacrosse, box lacrosse, lacrosse sixes and intercrosse. The men&#x27;s games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women&#x27;s game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Lacrosse sixes is played by both men and women on a smaller field and is the most common version at multi-sport events. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.

The modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations. The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years. Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908. It will be contested at the 2028 Olympic Games in the lacrosse sixes format. It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.

==History==

Lacrosse is based on games played by various Native American communities as early as 1100 AD. By the 17th century, a version of lacrosse was well-established and was documented by Jesuit missionary priests in the territory of present-day Canada.

In the traditional aboriginal Canadian version, each team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field several miles/kilometers long. These games lasted from sunup to sundown for two to three days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, or to give thanks to the Creator or Master.

Lacrosse played a significant role in the community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years. Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the role of warriors, with the goal of bringing glory and honour to themselves and their tribes. The game was said to be played &quot;for the Creator&quot; or was referred to as &quot;The Creator&#x27;s Game&quot;, and a version of the game was called &quot;baggataway&quot;.
The French Jesuit missionary saw Huron tribesmen play the game during 1637 in present-day Ontario. He called it , &quot;the stick&quot; in French. The name seems to be originated from the French term for field hockey, .

James Smith described in some detail a game being played in 1757 by Mohawk people &quot;wherein now they used a wooden ball, about in diameter, and the instrument they moved it with was a strong staff about long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball&quot;.

English-speaking people from Montreal noticed Mohawk people playing the game and started playing themselves in the 1830s. In 1856, William George Beers, a Canadian dentist, founded the Montreal Lacrosse Club. In 1860, Beers codified the game, shortening the length of each game and reducing the number of players to 12 per team. The first game played under Beers&#x27;s rules was at Upper Canada College in 1867; they lost to the Toronto Cricket Club by a score of 3–1.

The new sport proved to be very popular and spread across the English-speaking world; by 1900 there were dozens of men&#x27;s clubs in Canada, the United States, England, Australia, and New Zealand. The women&#x27;s game was introduced by Louisa Lumsden in Scotland in 1890. The first women&#x27;s club in the United States was started by Rosabelle Sinclair at Bryn Mawr School in 1926.

In the United States, lacrosse during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s was primarily a regional sport centered around the Mid-Atlantic states, especially New York and Maryland. However, in the last half of the 20th century, the sport spread outside this region, and can be currently found in most of the United States. According to a survey conducted by US Lacrosse in 2016, there are over 825,000 lacrosse participants nationwide and lacrosse is the fastest-growing team sport among NFHS member schools.

==Versions of lacrosse==
===Field lacrosse===
Field lacrosse is the men&#x27;s outdoor version of the sport. There are ten players on each team: three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and one goalie. Each player carries a lacrosse stick. A short stick measures between long and is used by attackmen and midfielders. A maximum of four players on the field per team may carry a long stick which is between long and is used by the three defensemen and sometimes one defensive midfielder. The goalie uses a stick with a head as wide as that can be between long.

The field of play is . The goals are and are apart. Each goal sits inside a circular &quot;crease&quot;, measuring in diameter. The goalie has special privileges within the crease to avoid opponents&#x27; stick checks. Offensive players or their sticks may not enter into the crease at any time. The mid-field line separates the field into an offensive and defensive zone for each team. Each team must keep four players in its defensive zone and three players in its offensive zone at all times. It does not matter which positional players satisfy the requirement, although usually the three attackmen stay in the offensive zone, the three defensemen and the goalie stay in the defensive zone, and the three middies play in both zones. A team that violates this rule is offsides and either loses possession of the ball if they have it or incurs a technical foul if they do not.
The regulation playing time of a game is 60 minutes, divided into four periods of 15 minutes each. Play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal with a face-off. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks on the ground parallel to the mid-line, the two heads of their sticks on opposite sides of the ball. At the whistle, the face-off-men scrap for the ball, often by &quot;clamping&quot; it under their stick and flicking it out to their teammates. When one of the teams has possession of the ball, they bring it into their offensive zone and try to score a goal. Due to the offsides rule, settled play involves six offensive players versus six defensive players and a goalie.

If the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded against the team that touched it last. The exception is when the ball is shot towards the goal. Missed shots that go out of bounds are awarded to the team that has the player who is the closest to the ball when and where the ball goes out. During play, teams may substitute players in and out if they leave and enter the field through the substitution area, sometimes referred to as &quot;on the fly&quot;. After penalties and goals, players may freely substitute and do not have to go through the substitution area.

Penalties are awarded for rule violations and result in the offending team losing possession (loss of possession) or temporarily losing a player (time serving). During time serving penalties, the penalized team plays with one fewer player for the duration of the penalty. Time serving penalties are either releasable or non-releasable. When serving a releasable penalty, the offending player may re-enter play if a goal is scored by the opposing team during the duration of the penalty. Non-releasable penalties do not allow this and the player must serve the entire duration. In conjunction with the offsides rule, the opponent may play with six attackers versus the penalized team&#x27;s five defenders and goalie. The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing man down, while the other team is man up. Teams will use various lacrosse strategies to attack and defend while a player is being penalized.

There are two classes of rule violations that result in penalties: technical fouls and personal fouls. Technical fouls, such as offsides, pushing, and holding, result in either a loss of possession or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball. Personal fouls, such as cross-checking, illegal body checking, or slashing, concern actions that endanger player safety. Cross-checking is when a player strikes another player with the shaft of the stick between his hands. A slash is when a player strikes another player with the end of the stick anywhere besides the gloves. These fouls draw 1-minute or longer penalties; the offending player must leave the field.

===Box lacrosse===
Box lacrosse is played by teams of five runners plus a goalie on an ice hockey rink where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer field. The enclosed playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game. This version of the game was introduced in Canada in the 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas outside of the ice hockey season. Within several years it had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.

The goals in box lacrosse are smaller than field lacrosse, traditionally wide and tall. Also, the goaltender wears much more protective padding, including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as &quot;uppers&quot;, large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style goalie masks.

The style of the game is quick, accelerated by the close confines of the floor and a shot clock. The shot clock requires the attacking team to take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball. Box lacrosse is also a much more physical game. Since cross checking is legal in box lacrosse, players wear rib pads and the shoulder and elbow pads are bigger and stronger than what field lacrosse players wear. Box lacrosse players wear a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse cage. There is no offsides in box lacrosse, the players substitute freely from their bench areas as in hockey. However, most players specialize in offense or defense, so usually all five runners substitute for teammates as their team transitions between offense and defense.

For penalties, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him, or man-down, for the length of the penalty. Most fouls are minor penalties and last for two minutes, major penalties for serious offenses last five minutes. What separates box lacrosse (and ice hockey) from other sports is that at the top levels of professional and junior lacrosse, participating in a fight does not automatically cause an ejection, but a five-minute major penalty is given.

Box lacrosse is played at the highest level in the National Lacrosse League and by the Senior A divisions of the Canadian Lacrosse Association. The National Lacrosse League (NLL) employs some minor rule changes from the Canadian Lacrosse Association (CLA) rules. Notably, the goals are wide instead of and the games are played during the winter. The NLL games consist of four fifteen-minute quarters compared with three periods of twenty minutes each in CLA games. NLL players may only use sticks with hollow shafts, while CLA permits solid wooden sticks.

===Women&#x27;s lacrosse===
The rules of women&#x27;s lacrosse differ significantly from men&#x27;s lacrosse, most notably by equipment and the degree of allowable physical contact. Women&#x27;s lacrosse rules also differ significantly between the US and all other countries, who play by the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) rules. Women&#x27;s lacrosse does not allow physical contact; the only protective equipment worn is a mouth guard and eye guard. In the early part of the 21st century, there were discussions of requiring headgear to prevent concussions. In 2008, Florida was the first state to mandate headgear in women&#x27;s lacrosse. 

Stick checking is permitted in the women&#x27;s game, but only in certain levels of play and within strict rules. Women&#x27;s lacrosse also does not allow players to have a pocket, or loose net, on the lacrosse stick. Women start the game with a &quot;draw&quot; instead of a face-off. The two players stand up and the ball is placed between their stick heads while their sticks are horizontal at waist-height. At the whistle, the players lift their sticks into the air, trying to control where the ball goes.

The first modern women&#x27;s lacrosse game was held at St Leonards School in Scotland in 1890. It was introduced by the school&#x27;s headmistress Louisa Lumsden after a visit to Quebec, where she saw it played. The first women&#x27;s lacrosse team in the United States was established at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland in 1926.
Both the number of players and the lines on the field differ from men&#x27;s lacrosse. There are 12 players in women&#x27;s lacrosse and players must abide by certain boundaries that do not exist in men&#x27;s play. The three specific boundaries are the &quot;fan&quot; in front of the goal ( internationally), the ( internationally) half circle that surrounds the 8-meter fan, and the draw circle in the center of the field, which is used for draws to start quarters and after goals. The goal circle is also positioned slightly closer to the end line in women&#x27;s lacrosse compared to men&#x27;s. In women&#x27;s lacrosse on either the offensive or defensive end, the players besides the goaltender are not able to step inside the goal circle; this becomes a &quot;goal-circle violation&quot;. However, at the women&#x27;s collegiate level, defenders may pass through the goal circle.

The 8-meter fan that is in front of the goal circle has a few restrictions in it. Defenders cannot stand inside the 8-meter fan longer than 3 seconds without being a stick-length away from the offensive player they are guarding. This is very similar to the three-second rule in basketball. A three seconds violation results in a player from the other team taking a free shot against the goalie. If you are an attacker trying to shoot the ball into the goal, you are not supposed to take a shot while a defender is in &quot;shooting space&quot;. To make sure that you, the defender, are being safe, you want to lead with your lacrosse stick and once you are a sticks-length away, you can be in front of her.

===Lacrosse sixes===

Lacrosse sixes is a variant of lacrosse played outdoors with six players on each side. The game follows similar rules to traditional field lacrosse, with modifications and a shorter game time. It was created in 2021 by World Lacrosse in a bid to achieve lacrosse&#x27;s participation in the Olympic Games, and will make its Olympic debut at the 2028 edition in Los Angeles.

Lacrosse sixes has similar rules for men and women but preserves some differences, such as the amount of contact allowed. The major rule differences as compared to traditional field lacrosse are as follows:

* The field of play is smaller, at 70 meters by 36 meters.
* Face-offs only occur at the beginning of each quarter. Play is restarted after goals by the goalie taking the ball out of the net.
* A 30-second shot clock is added.
* Games are played in 4, 8-minute quarters.
* Rosters consist of 12 players.
* Everyone plays both offense and defense. 
* There are no long crosses.

===Intercrosse===

Intercrosse, or soft stick lacrosse, is a non-contact form of lacrosse with a standardized set of rules using modified lacrosse equipment. An intercrosse stick is different from a normal lacrosse stick, the head is made completely of plastic instead of leather or nylon pockets in traditional lacrosse sticks. The ball is larger, softer and hollow, unlike a lacrosse ball, which is solid rubber.

Intercrosse as a competitive adult sport is popular in Quebec, Canada, as well as in many European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic. Generally, teams consist of five players per side, and the field size is wide and long. Goals for adults are the same size as box lacrosse, in height and width. The international governing body, the Fédération Internationale d&#x27;Inter-Crosse, hosts a World Championship bi-annually.

Soft stick lacrosse is a popular way to introduce youth to the sport. It can be played outdoors or indoors and has a developed curriculum for physical education classes.

==International lacrosse==

Lacrosse has historically been played for the most part in Canada and the United States, with small but dedicated lacrosse communities in the United Kingdom and Australia. Recently, however, lacrosse has begun to flourish at the international level, with teams being established around the world, particularly in Europe and East Asia.

===World Lacrosse===

In August 2008, the men&#x27;s international governing body, the International Lacrosse Federation, merged with the women&#x27;s, the International Federation of Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Associations, to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). The FIL changed its name to World Lacrosse in May 2019. There are currently 62 member nations of World Lacrosse.

===Tournaments===
World Lacrosse sponsors five world championship tournaments: the World Lacrosse Championship for men&#x27;s field, the Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Championship for women&#x27;s, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, as well as the Men&#x27;s Under-20 World Lacrosse Championships and Women&#x27;s Under-20 World Lacrosse Championships. Each is held every four years.

The World Lacrosse Championship (WLC) began in 1968 as a four-team invitational tournament sponsored by the International Lacrosse Federation. Until 1990, only the United States, Canada, England, and Australia had entered. With the expansion of the game internationally, the 2014 World Lacrosse Championship was contested by 38 countries. The WLC has been dominated by the United States. Team USA has won 11 of the 14 titles, with Canada winning the other three.

The Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup (WLWC) began in 1982. The United States has won 9 of the 11 titles, with Australia winning the other two. Canada and England have always finished in the top five. The 2017 tournament was held in England and featured 25 countries.

The first World Indoor Lacrosse Championship (WILC) was held in 2003 and contested by six nations at four sites in Ontario. Canada won the championship by beating the Iroquois Nationals 21–4 in the final. The 2007 championship hosted by the Onondaga Nation included 13 teams. Canada has dominated the competition, winning all five gold medals and never losing a game.

The Iroquois Nationals are the men&#x27;s national team representing the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy in international field lacrosse competition. The team was admitted to the FIL in 1987. It is the only First Nations team sanctioned for international competition in any sport. The Nationals placed fourth in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Lacrosse Championships and third in 2014. The indoor team won the silver medal in all four World Indoor Lacrosse Championships. In 2008, the Iroquois women&#x27;s team was admitted to the FIL as the Haudenosaunee Nationals. They placed 7th at the 2013 Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup.

===Olympic Games===
Field lacrosse was a medal sport in the 1904 and the 1908 Summer Olympics. In 1904, three teams competed in the games held in St. Louis. Two Canadian teams, the Winnipeg Shamrocks and a team of Mohawk people from the Iroquois Confederacy, plus the local St. Louis Amateur Athletic Association team representing the United States participated. The Winnipeg Shamrocks captured the gold medal. The 1908 games held in London, England, featured only two teams, representing Canada and Great Britain. The Canadians again won the gold medal in a single championship match by a score of 14–10.

In the 1928, 1932, and the 1948 Summer Olympics, lacrosse was a demonstration sport. The 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam featured three teams: the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. The 1932 games in Los Angeles featured a three-game exhibition between a Canadian all-star team and the United States. The United States was represented by Johns Hopkins in both the 1928 and 1932 Olympics. The 1948 games featured an exhibition by an &quot;All-England&quot; team organized by the English Lacrosse Union and the collegiate lacrosse team from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute representing the United States. This exhibition match ended in a 5–5 tie.

Efforts were made to include lacrosse as an exhibition sport at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, but they were not successful.

An obstacle for lacrosse to return to the Olympics has been insufficient international participation. To be considered for the Olympics, a sport had to be played on four continents and by at least 75 countries. Lacrosse is played on all six continents, but as of August 2019 when Ghana joined, there are only 63 countries playing the sport. However, nowadays numeric criteria about widely practiced sports have been abolished. The International Olympic Committee granted provisional status to World Lacrosse in 2018. In August 2022, it was announced that nine sports had made the shortlist to be included in the games, among them lacrosse, with presentations expected to be made later that month. In October 2023, the LA28 Organizing Committee announced that it had recommended lacrosse as one of five sports that may be added to the program for the 2028 Summer Olympics. On October 16, 2023, lacrosse received approval from the International Olympic Committee for inclusion in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

===Other===

The European Lacrosse Federation (ELF) was established in 1995 and held the first European Lacrosse Championships that year. Originally an annual event, it is now held every four years, in between FIL&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s championships. In 2004, 12 men&#x27;s and 6 women&#x27;s teams played in the tournament, making it the largest international lacrosse event of the year. The last men&#x27;s tournament was in 2016, when 24 countries participated. England won its ninth gold medal out of the ten tournaments played. 2015 was the last women&#x27;s tournament, when 17 teams participated in the Czech Republic. England won its sixth gold medal, with Wales earning silver and Scotland bronze. These three countries from Great Britain have dominated the women&#x27;s championships, earning all but three medals since the tournament began in 1996. There are currently 29 members of the ELF, they make up the majority of nations in the FIL.

The Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union was founded in 2004 by Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan. It currently has 12 members and holds the Asia Pacific Championship for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams every two years.

Lacrosse, in 10 x 10 format, was played in the World Games for the first time at the 2017 World Games held in Poland. Only women&#x27;s teams took part in the competition. The United States won the gold medal defeating Canada in the finals. Australia won the bronze medal match. The Haudenosaunee Nationals women&#x27;s lacrosse team could not participate.

Both men and women tournaments, in sixes format, were held in the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama, USA. Women tournament will be played again, in same format, in 2025 World games.

The first U. S. intercollegiate men&#x27;s lacrosse game was played on November 22, 1877, between New York University and Manhattan College. An organizing body for the sport, the U. S. National Lacrosse Association, was founded in 1879 and the first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament was held in 1881, with Harvard beating Princeton 3–0 in the championship game. Annual post-season championships were awarded by a variety of early lacrosse associations through the 1930s. From 1936 to 1972, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the best college lacrosse team each year.

The NCAA began sponsoring a men&#x27;s lacrosse championship in 1971, when Cornell took the first title over Maryland, 12–6. Syracuse has 10 Division I titles, Johns Hopkins 9, and Princeton 6. The NCAA national championship weekend tournament draws over 80,000 fans.

==Equipment==
===Stick===
The lacrosse stick has two parts, the head and the shaft. There are three parts to the head: the scoop, sidewall, and pocket. The scoop is the top of the stick that affects picking up ground ball as well as passing and shooting. The sidewall is the side of the head that affects the depth of the head and the stiffness. The pocket is the leather or nylon mesh attached to the sidewall and scoop. A wider pocket allows an easier time catching balls but will also cause less ball control. A narrower pocket makes catching harder but allows more ball retention and accuracy.

Shafts are usually made of hollow metal. They are octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of aluminum, titanium, scandium, or alloys, but some shafts are made from other materials, including wood, plastic, carbon fiber, or fiberglass.

Stick length, both shaft and head together, is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men&#x27;s sticks be from long for offensive players, and long for defensemen, and long for goalies.

Women&#x27;s sticks must be an overall length of . The head must be seven to nine inches wide and the top of the ball must remain above the side walls when dropped in the pocket. The goalkeeper&#x27;s stick must be long. The head of the goalie&#x27;s stick can up to wide and the pocket may be mesh.

===Ball===

The ball is made of solid rubber. It is typically white for men&#x27;s lacrosse, or yellow for women&#x27;s lacrosse; but is also produced in a wide variety of colors, such as yellow, orange or lime green according to the Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Rules and Interpretations.

===Men&#x27;s field protective equipment===
Men&#x27;s field lacrosse protective equipment contains a pair of gloves, elbow pads, shoulder pads, helmet, mouthguard, and cleats. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads to protect themselves from checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked and goalies usually wear no elbow pads due to the very limited opportunities of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.

===Men&#x27;s box protective equipment===
Men&#x27;s box players wear more protective gear than field players due to the increased physical contact and more permissive checking rules. Cross-checking in the back is allowed by the rules. Runners wear larger and heavier elbow pads and stronger shoulder pads that extend down the back of the player. Most players wear rib pads as well. Box goalies wear equipment very similar to ice hockey goalies, the leg blockers are somewhat smaller, although the shoulder pads are bigger than ice hockey pads.

===Women&#x27;s field protective equipment===
Women&#x27;s field players are not required to wear protective equipment besides eyewear and a mouthguard. Eyegear is a metal cage covering the eyes attached with a strap around the back of the head. In recent years, there has been discussion about allowing or requiring padded headgear to protect against concussions. Women goalies wear a helmet, gloves, and chest protector.

<doc id="18081" wikidata="Q24826" url="?curid=18081" title="Liverpool">
<text>Liverpool is a cathedral and port city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England. It is situated on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, near the Irish Sea, northwest of London. With a population of (in ), Liverpool is the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom and the administrative headquarters of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million. 

Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills, and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway, the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974. It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, but has experienced regeneration since the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture in 2008, which was reported to have generated over £800 million for the local economy within a year.

The economy of Liverpool is diversified and encompasses tourism, culture, maritime, hospitality, healthcare, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, creative, and digital sectors. The city is home to the UK&#x27;s second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and parks and open spaces, with only London having more. It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture, and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022. It has produced numerous musicians, most notably the Beatles, and artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 hit singles than anywhere else. It has also produced academics, actors, artists, comedians, filmmakers, poets, scientists, sportspeople, and writers. It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool. The world&#x27;s oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street, is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city&#x27;s port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.

Residents of Liverpool are often called &quot;Scousers&quot; in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while &quot;Scouse&quot; is also the most common name given to the local accent. The city&#x27;s cultural and ethnic diversity is a result of attracting immigrants, especially from Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also the home of a large black and Chinese community, and the first mosque in England.

==Toponymy==
The name comes from the Old English , meaning thick or muddy water, and , meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as &quot;Liuerpul&quot;. According to the &quot;Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot;, &quot;The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained&quot;. The place appearing as &quot;Leyrpole&quot;, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool. Other origins of the name have been suggested, including &quot;elverpool&quot;, a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey. The adjective &quot;Liverpudlian&quot; was first recorded in 1833.

Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is , from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form &quot;Leverpool&quot; with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) &gt; Danetry, never-do-well &gt; ne’er-do-well).

In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name &quot;&quot; (&quot;(the) place (of) the pool&quot;), a reinterpretation of , probably in the belief that &quot; was the original form.

Another name, which is widely known even today, is , again a 19th-century coining. &quot; is pool, but &quot;&quot; has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910–1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in &quot;Place Names of North Wales&quot;, does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that &quot;&quot; is used as a Welsh equivalent of &quot;Liver&quot;.

A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh () of Latin (slough, bog, fen) to give &quot;&quot; is possible, but unproven.

==History==
 
===Early history===

In the Middle Ages, Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England. The town was planned with its own castle, although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester, the town&#x27;s growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade.

King John&#x27;s letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as &quot;Liuerpul&quot;). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns, in particular John&#x27;s Irish campaign of 1209. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street). Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, it survived until it was demolished in the 1720s. By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague.

In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including a brief siege in 1644. In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, &quot;Liverpool Merchant&quot;, set sail for Africa, Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament. But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development. Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region&#x27;s principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey. The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.

As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715. Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.

===19th century===
The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, world first, technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world.

By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.
In her poetical illustration &quot;Liverpool&quot; (1832), which celebrates the city&#x27;s worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress. This is to a painting by Samuel Austin, &quot;Liverpool, from the Mersey&quot;.

Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city&#x27;s economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, &quot;the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself&quot;. Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy, built ships of war for the Confederacy, and supplied
the South with military equipment and credit.

During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South.

For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London, and Liverpool&#x27;s Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer. Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office. During this century, at least 40% of the world&#x27;s entire trade passed through Liverpool.

In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.

As early as 1851, the city was described as &quot;the New York of Europe&quot;. During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool&#x27;s growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool&#x27;s oldest surviving churches, St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship.

===20th century===

The 20th century saw Liverpool&#x27;s established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars. Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city&#x27;s productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city&#x27;s influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century.

The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.

The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city&#x27;s population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested. Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain&#x27;s first provincial airport, operating from 1930.

During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London&#x27;s. The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called &quot;Shankland Plan&quot; of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland, led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture, compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland &quot;the butcher of Liverpool&quot;.

A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census, 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or &#x27;other black&#x27;.
In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the &quot;Merseybeat&quot; sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.

Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside, in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool&#x27;s docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city&#x27;s docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK, standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously. During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London. Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain&#x27;s &#x27;shock city&#x27;. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its &#x27;nadir&#x27; at the depths of post-colonial, post-industrial Britain.
In the late 20th century, Liverpool&#x27;s economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration. In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today.

===21st century===

Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city&#x27;s population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city.

In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee. On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall, the Queen recognised Liverpool as &quot;one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom&quot;, and paid tribute to the city&#x27;s &quot;major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries&quot;. She also acknowledged Liverpool&#x27;s bid to become the European Capital of Culture. To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool&#x27;s final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK&#x27;s flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.

Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city&#x27;s world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool&#x27;s economy.

In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 million development based on Paradise Street. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool&#x27;s city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as &#x27;Liverpool One,&#x27; the centre opened in May 2008.

In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the &quot;eight legs&quot; of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel.

Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District, King&#x27;s Dock, Mann Island, around Lime Street, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks, and Edge Lane.

Changes to Liverpool&#x27;s governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution. With a devolved budget granted by central government, the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region, including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.

By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. Liverpool Waters, a mixed-use development in the city&#x27;s disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK&#x27;s history. Everton&#x27;s new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.

Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world&#x27;s largest business event in 2014, and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951. The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference. Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023.

===Inventions and innovations===
Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams, and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world&#x27;s first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.

The first School for the Blind, Mechanics&#x27; Institute, High School for Girls, council house, and Juvenile Court were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA, NSPCC, Age Concern, Relate, and Citizen&#x27;s Advice Bureau all evolved from work in the city.

The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house, sanitary act, medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance, purpose-built ambulance, X-ray medical diagnosis, school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine, free school meal, cancer research centre, and zoonosis research centre all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world. Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas, and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray.

The world&#x27;s first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK&#x27;s first borough engineer. Liverpool also founded the UK&#x27;s first Underwriters&#x27; Association and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world&#x27;s first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.
In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers), and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre). It is also home to the UK&#x27;s oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra) and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).

In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world&#x27;s first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK&#x27;s first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey. It was the largest store in the world at the time.
Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook. The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter.

A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis&#x27;s department store in Liverpool in 1879. Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool&#x27;s docks in 1884. The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world&#x27;s first tunnel under a tidal estuary and the world&#x27;s first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station).
In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing and oversaw the construction of the UK&#x27;s first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as &quot;the eighth wonder of the world&quot; at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years.

In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool, including what is believed to be the world&#x27;s first tracking shot, taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world&#x27;s first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator.

Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934. The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world&#x27;s oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the &quot;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society&quot;, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.

In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the &quot;significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life&quot;.

==Government==
For the purposes of local government, Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each.

Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. 
The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.

Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.

The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament, all Labour as of the 2024 general election.

=== City Council Leader and Cabinet ===

Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different political parties. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city&#x27;s people.

At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as &#x27;portfolios&#x27;.

The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson, who represents the Labour Party, which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election, the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (&quot;Separate from the City Council Cabinet&quot;), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. 

The City Council&#x27;s decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.

=== Liverpool City Council elections ===

Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards. 

During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate&#x27;s total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won 3 seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won 3 seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining 3 seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party, the political party in power at national government, had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.

Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. After the 1979 general election, many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city. Liverpool is one of the Labour Party&#x27;s key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.

=== City Council criticism and improvement ===

In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayer&#x27;s money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. Grosvenor Group, the property company responsible for Liverpool One, commended the changes as an &quot;opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool&quot;.

In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council&#x27;s highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections, which were labelled &quot;the most unpredictable [elections] in the city&#x27;s history&quot;. The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to &#x27;all out&#x27; elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#x27;s government as a whole.

Councillor Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government, was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council&#x27;s long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council&#x27;s poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture. In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.

=== Lord Mayor of Liverpool ===

The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the &quot;first citizen&quot; and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool&#x27;s twin cities, chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations. The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings.
=== Mayor of the Liverpool City Region ===
. Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram.

=== Parliamentary constituencies and MPs ===

Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree, Liverpool West Derby and Garston and Halewood. At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively. Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent 2024 election, this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
=== Environment ===

Liverpool has been described as having &quot;the most splendid setting of any English city&quot;. At (53.4, −2.98), northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea, Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain.

The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east.

===Climate===
Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846. Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from on 21 December 2010 to on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of on 19 July 2006.

The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.

Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.

During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom. Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008 while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012. Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908 and the latest on 2 June 1975.

Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded of rain and the driest being February 1932, with . The driest year on record was 1991, with of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with .

====Green Liverpool====

In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the Mersey Forest to complete &quot;A Green Infrastructure Strategy&quot; for the city.

====Green belt====

Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.

The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council and the size in the city amounts to .

==Demonyms==
===Scouser===
Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city. The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.

The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool&#x27;s port. 

===Other demonyms===
Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity:
* Liverpoldon (17th century)
* Leeirpooltonian (17th Century)
* Liverpolitan (19th century)
* Liverpudlian (19th century to present)

Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of &#x27;Liverpolitan&#x27; and &#x27;Liverpudlian&#x27;. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.

Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as &#x27;Dick Liver&#x27;, &#x27;Dicky Sam&#x27; and &#x27;whacker&#x27; were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as &#x27;scousers&#x27;. By the time that Frank Shaw&#x27;s &quot;My Liverpool, a Celebration of &#x27;Scousetown&quot;&#x27; was published in 1971, Belchem argues that &#x27;Scouser&#x27; had firmly become the dominant demonym.

==Demography==
===Population===
====The city====
The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area, however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021, the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council.

Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England&#x27;s &#x27;core cities&#x27; and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.

The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.

The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell. 
The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool&#x27;s ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city&#x27;s population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.

It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool&#x27;s population with some form of Irish ancestry.

The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved.

At the 1931 United Kingdom census, Liverpool&#x27;s population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several &#x27;new town&#x27; council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool&#x27;s metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, Cheshire West and Chester, West Lancashire, Warrington and as far as North Wales.

Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester, In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).

====Urban and metropolitan area====
Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. 

The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:

=====ITL 1 region=====
North West England (code TLD)
&lt;br&gt;At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.

=====ITL 2 region=====
Merseyside (code TLD7) 
&lt;br&gt;The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74).
&lt;br&gt;At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows:

East Merseyside (TLD71):
*Halton = 128,200 
*Knowsley = 154,500 
*St. Helens = 183,200

Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100

Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300

Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200

Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census.

=====ITL 3 region=====
The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census.

=====Other definitions=====

At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds). Liverpool&#x27;s built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Sheffield.

Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the 4th largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool, plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, Wirral and the Borough of Halton. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics, particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.

A 2011 report, &quot;Liverpool City Region – Building on its Strengths&quot;, by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy, stated that &quot;what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5million&quot;, but also referred to &quot;an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester, Warrington, West Lancashire and across to Southport&quot;, with a population of 2.3million.

In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a &quot;Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area&quot; with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.

Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area, or megalopolis.

===Ethnicity===
In recent decades, Liverpool&#x27;s population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except &#x27;White English/British&#x27; and &#x27;Any Other&#x27;, where there were overall losses. The number of &#x27;Other White residents&#x27; in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the &#x27;Other Asian&#x27;, &#x27;Arab&#x27;, and &#x27;Other Mixed/Multiple&#x27; population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the &#x27;newly organised city electoral wards&#x27; ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.

According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool and their occurrence in the population are:
:1. Jones – 23,012
:2. Smith – 16,276
:3. Williams – 13,997
:4. Davies – 10,149
:5. Hughes – 9,787
:6. Roberts – 9,571
:7. Taylor – 8,219
:8. Johnson – 6,715
:9. Brown – 6,603
:10. Murphy – 6,495

Liverpool is home to Britain&#x27;s oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations. Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men. Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean, Ghanaian, and Somali communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations.

The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city&#x27;s Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century. The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool&#x27;s Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry.

The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations. In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool&#x27;s population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as &quot;the capital of North Wales.&quot;

During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States. By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish. At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland, but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.

Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian, Latin American, Malaysian, and Yemeni communities, which number several thousand each.

===Religion===
The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, including two Christian cathedrals.

Liverpool is known to be England&#x27;s &#x27;most Catholic city&#x27;, with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England. This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.

The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as &quot;the sailors church&quot;, which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen&#x27;s Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).

Liverpool&#x27;s wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens&#x27;s original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens&#x27; original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Wigwam&quot; due to its shape.

Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain&#x27;s Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool. Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000. The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.

Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there. Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree and a Baháʼí Centre in the same area.

The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road. Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum, the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom. The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer. Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque, Hamza Center (Community Center), Islamic community centre, Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute, Liverpool Towhid Centre, Masjid Annour, and the Shah Jalal Mosque.

==Economy==
===City and region===


Liverpool forms an integral part of North West England&#x27;s economy, the third largest regional economy in the United Kingdom. The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region, worth over £40 billion per year.

The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region&#x27;s total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city&#x27;s GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was £14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was £15.9 billion. This equates to £32,841 per head of the population.

At the 2021 United Kingdom census, 51.1% of Liverpool&#x27;s population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).

According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain. In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain&#x27;s local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.

In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism), culture, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, and advanced car manufacturing.

According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS, Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city&#x27;s tourist industry was worth a total of £3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth £5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated £100m to the Liverpool economy each year alone. Liverpool One, as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK. Liverpool Cruise Terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.

Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter, a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world&#x27;s most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a &#x27;pharmaceutical production superpower&#x27; and one of the UK&#x27;s leading regions for bioprocessing. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England&#x27;s second ever &#x27;Investment Zone&#x27; in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called &#x27;pharma cluster&#x27; in the city suburb of Speke. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city&#x27;s Baltic Triangle, which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.

Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.

Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city&#x27;s port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK&#x27;s fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK&#x27;s largest port for transatlantic trade, handling 45% of the country&#x27;s trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce.

The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world&#x27;s biggest container vessels.

Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line, Bibby Line, Borchard Lines Ltd, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, Independent Container Line, Irish Ferries, Maersk Line, Mediterranean Shipping Company and Zim Integrated Shipping Services.

Liverpool&#x27;s rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome. The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.

Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building, adjacent to the Depot.

===City region economy and devolution===

The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK&#x27;s core cities within the context of their respective city regions. The government&#x27;s longer-term plan is to assess each area&#x27;s potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities. As such, official statistics about Liverpool&#x27;s economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region, are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the &#x27;functional economic area&#x27; of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies.

As of 2023, there are 10 city regions in England with Combined Authorities. The economy of Liverpool&#x27;s combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows:

==Landmarks==

Liverpool&#x27;s long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture. The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire. There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed and 85 are Grade II* listed. The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist. This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England&#x27;s finest Victorian city.

The value of Liverpool&#x27;s architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city&#x27;s role in the development of international trade and docking technology. However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the &quot;serious deterioration&quot; of the area&#x27;s significance.

===Waterfront and docks===
As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city&#x27;s development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world&#x27;s first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes. The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain. Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world&#x27;s largest building in terms of area and today stands as the world&#x27;s largest brick-work building.

One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the &quot;Three Graces&quot;, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of &#x27;maritime Liverpool&#x27; and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.

In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool&#x27;s waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena, ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King&#x27;s Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince&#x27;s Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.

However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the &quot;New Chinatown&quot; working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the &quot;New Chinatown&quot; development failed to materialise. In January 2018, the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; and &quot;Asia Times&quot; revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor &quot;Bilt&quot; had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.

===Commercial district and cultural quarter===
Liverpool&#x27;s historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to &#x27;run the city with pride&#x27;.

The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area&#x27;s roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool&#x27;s former World Heritage site.

The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city&#x27;s finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain. Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank. Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers, which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.

The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city&#x27;s &#x27;Cultural Quarter&#x27;, owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George&#x27;s Hall, is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe. A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with &quot;S.P.Q.L.&quot; (Latin &quot;senatus populusque Liverpudliensis&quot;), meaning &quot;the senate and people of Liverpool&quot;. William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington&#x27;s Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John&#x27;s Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose. The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.

===Other notable landmarks===

While the majority of Liverpool&#x27;s architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598. The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century. In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city&#x27;s other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.

The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers, which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture, the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.

Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it. The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as &quot;one of the great buildings of the world&quot;. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.

In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool&#x27;s city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which saw almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space. Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool&#x27;s tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus, King&#x27;s Dock, Paddington Village and Liverpool Waters.

There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool&#x27;s Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term &quot;Red Brick University&quot;), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.

===Parks and gardens===
The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside&#x27;s Victorian Parks as collectively the &quot;most important in the country&quot;. Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.

==Transport==
Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city&#x27;s major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.

===National and international travel===
====Roads====

The city sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s suburbs run contiguously into the neighbouring boroughs defined by the ONS as the Liverpool Built-up Area. The wider City Region and Merseyside in general is densely urbanised and divided by several motorways and major roads. The city is served by a network motorways. The three motorways in closest proximity are the M58 to the north, and M62 and M57 to the east.

To the north, the M58 motorway runs 12 miles and provides links to the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, finally joining with the M6 west of Wigan.

To the east, the M62 runs across the north of the UK, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route to several large cities including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield.

To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.

To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport.

The Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the settlements on the Wirral Peninsula across the Mersey to the west, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales. 

====Railway====

Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout the Liverpool city region and beyond (see Local travel below). The national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city&#x27;s primary main line station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city. The station is served by a number of different train operating companies including Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, London North Eastern Railway, Northern Rail, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains. Between them, the station is connected with direct train services to numerous destinations including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Preston, Scarborough, Sheffield and York. Opened in 1836, Lime Street station is the world&#x27;s oldest mainline terminus station still in use. In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city&#x27;s airport.

====Port====

The Port of Liverpool connects passengers and freight to Liverpool from all around the world. Passenger ferry services depart from the city across the Irish Sea to Belfast and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&amp;O Ferries and Stena Line.

The Liverpool Cruise Terminal handles over 200,000 passengers and crew annually and is located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre. Berthing facilities for long-distance passenger cruises are provided and served by a large number of different cruise lines. Ports in Australia, France, Faroe Islands, Iceland, North America, Norway, Spain and the Caribbean are served by the facility. The cruise lines that call at Liverpool cruise terminal include the following:

*Ambassador
*Atlas Ocean Voyages
*Azamara
*Carnival Cruise Line
*Celebrity Cruises
*Cunard Line
*Disney Cruise Line
*Fred Olsen
*Hapag-Lloyd cruises
*Holland America Line
*Noble Caledonia
*Norwegian
*P&amp;O Cruises
*Princess Cruises
*Regent Seven Seas
*Royal Caribbean
*Saga Cruises
*Silversea Cruises
*Viking
, the Port of Liverpool is the fourth busiest port in the UK by freight tonnage, handling 33milliontonnes of freight cargo. 
It is the main port in the country for transatlantic trade and the largest port on the west coast of the UK. The Royal Seaforth and Liverpool2 container terminals are the port&#x27;s two main terminals and handle a wide variety of cargo including containers, liquid and dry bulk cargoes such as coal and grain, biomass and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars and trucks.
Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.

====Airport====

Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. It offers direct services to over 60 airports worldwide and to over 100 destinations via one-stop connections in Frankfurt, Dublin and Reykjavík. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines namely Aer Lingus, easyJet, Jet2.com, Loganair, Lufthansa, Play, Ryanair, Widerøe and Wizz Air, although it does provide facilities for private aircraft.

===Local travel===
====Trains====

Liverpool&#x27;s urban railway network, known as Merseyrail, is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool&#x27;s metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire.

The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.
The network is predominantly electric and covers of track. Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre, four stations and over of tunnels are underground. Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world. In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority&#x27;s long term &quot;Merseyrail for All&quot; plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester, Wrexham, Warrington and Preston.

====Buses====

Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Royal Albert Dock) for services to the south and east. Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and wider region. Tour bus services are provided by Maghull Coaches which allow tourists to hop-on-hop-off and view historical landmarks and attractions, as well as Liverpool F.C. and Beatles related locations. National Express services operate from the Liverpool One bus station to and from destinations across the UK. In 2023, the Liverpool city region confirmed plans to become the second place outside London to implement bus franchising. Local leaders have argued that it will improve services by transferring control over fares, ticketing and routes from bus companies to the Combined Authority. The full implementation of bus franchising will take place by the end of 2028.

====Mersey Ferry====

The cross-river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool city centre and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes, at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and at weekends. Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.

===Cycling and scooters===
A scooter-sharing system and electric bicycle scheme operates throughout Liverpool which allows residents and visitors to move around the city on rented scooters and bicycles. The scheme is operated by Swedish technology company Voi, and riders are able to pick up and drop off bikes and scooters at various locations around the city. National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool.

==Culture==

As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife among others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe&#x27;s largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929.

===Music===
Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &quot;World Capital City of Pop&quot;. Musicians from the city have produced 58 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world. Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was &quot;the centre of consciousness of the human universe&quot;. Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La&#x27;s 1990 hit single &quot;There She Goes&quot; was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;founding piece of Britpop&#x27;s foundation.&quot;

The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall. The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko. Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901. Among Liverpool&#x27;s curiosities, the Austrian émigré Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme.

Well established festivals in the city include Africa Oyé and Brazilica which are the UK&#x27;s largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively. The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyoncé, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40.

On 7 October 2022, the [[publisherBBCrporation and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) announced that Liverpool would host the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2023]] on behalf of the previous year&#x27;s winning country [[Ukraine]], which was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of the country]]. The contest was held at Liverpool Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and a final on 13 May 2023. This was the first time that the contest took place in the city, and was also a record-extending ninth time that the UK has hosted the contest, having last done so in [[Birmingham]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]].

===Visual arts===

Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London. [[National Museums Liverpool]] is the only English national collection based wholly outside London. The [[Tate Liverpool]] gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of [[Tate Modern]], the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The [[FACT centre]] hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the [[Walker Art Gallery]] houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of [[Pre-Raphaelite]] art in the world. [[Sudley House]] contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art. Liverpool University&#x27;s [[Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum|Victoria Building]] was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the university&#x27;s artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by [[John James Audubon|Audubon]] outside the US. A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter [[George Stubbs]] who was born in Liverpool in 1724.
The [[Liverpool Biennial]] festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide. It was during the 2004 festival that [[Yoko Ono]]&#x27;s work &quot;My mummy was beautiful&quot; invited controversy when photographs of a woman&#x27;s breast and crotch were exhibited on the main shopping street.

===Literature===
[[Felicia Hemans]] (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Consulate general|consul]] in that city. Her father&#x27;s business soon brought the family to [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and [[St. Asaph]] ([[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as &quot;Land of my childhood, my home and my dead&quot;. Her first poems, dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who briefly corresponded with her.
An engraving of a painting of by S. F. Serres was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 with a poetical illustration by [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] to which she adds the note &#x27;I believe that to this haunted gate, a common superstition is attached, namely, that to wish, and to have that wish fulfilled, is the result of such wish being uttered while passing&#x27;. It stood on the North Shore before the docks were built and was a place where farewells could be waved to departing voyagers.
A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas De Quincey]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[Hugh Walpole]]. Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as &quot;one of the wonders of Britain in his &#x27;Tour through England and Wales&#x27;&quot;. Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;[[Redburn]]&quot; deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman&#x27;s wanderings, and his reflections. From 1842 to 1869, Dickens visited the city to give public readings of his novels. Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856. Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81. Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, [[Jung]] famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.

&quot;[[Her Benny]]&quot;, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher [[Silas K.

===Football===

Liverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight [[Premier League]] teams. [[Everton F.C.]] was founded in 1878 and was one of the twelve founder members of the [[English Football League|Football League]]. It plays at [[Goodison Park]]. [[Liverpool F.C.]] were founded in 1892 and play at [[Anfield]]. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 [[FA Cup]] titles, 10 [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] titles, 6 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] titles, 1 [[FIFA Club World Cup]] title, 1 [[UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup|European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup]] title, 3 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] titles, and 24 [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shields]].

The two clubs contest the [[Merseyside derby]], dubbed the &#x27;friendly derby&#x27;. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs. Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in [[2019 UEFA Champions League final|2019]].
[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] has played at [[Anfield]] since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following [[Everton F.C.|Everton&#x27;s]] departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield as capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy.

 After leaving Anfield in 1892, [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] moved to [[Goodison Park]] on the opposite side of [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton&#x27;s first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It was one of the host venues during the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Street Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures.

[[Everton F.C.|Everton]] is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move first mooted as early as 1996. In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at [[King&#x27;s Dock, Port of Liverpool|King&#x27;s Dock]] due to financial constraints, with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of [[The Kirkby Project|Destination Kirkby]], moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool&#x27;s council boundary into [[Kirkby]]) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped.

The club will relocate to the multimillion-pound [[Everton Stadium]] designed by the American architect [[Dan Meis]] at the nearby [[Bramley-Moore Dock]] on the [[River Mersey]] waterfront during the 2025/26 season, with ground broken on the project in August 2021. The new stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 which could be expanded to 62,000 demand permitting and it will be a host venue for the [[UEFA Euro 2028]]. Everton also have a multimillion-pound training facility based at [[Finch Farm]]. The [[Everton F.C.

==Quotes about Liverpool==

* &quot;Lyrpole, alias Lyverpoole, a pavid towne, hath but a chapel ... The king hath a castelet there, and the [[Earl of Derby|Earl of Darbe]] hath a stone howse there. Irisch merchants cum much thither, as to a good haven ... At Lyrpole is smaul custom payed, that causith marchantes to resorte thither. Good marchandis at Lyrpole, and much Irish yarrn that [[Manchester]] men do buy there ...&quot; – [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], &quot;Itinerary&quot;, –1539
* &quot;Liverpoole is one of the wonders of Britain ... In a word, there is no town in England, London excepted, that can equal [it] for the fineness of the streets, and the beauty of the buildings.&quot; – [[Daniel Defoe]], &quot;[[A tour thro&#x27; the Whole Island of Great Britain]]&quot;, 1721–1726
* &quot;[O]ne of the neatest, best towns I have seen in England.&quot; – [[John Wesley]]. &quot;Journal&quot;, 1755
* &quot;I have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an African&#x27;s blood.&quot; – [[George Frederick Cooke]] (1756–1812), an actor responding to being hissed at when he came onstage drunk during a visit to Liverpool
* &quot;That immense City which stands like another [[Venice]] upon the water ... where there are riches overflowing and every thing which can delight a man who wishes to see the prosperity of a great community and a great empire ... This quondam village, now fit to be the proud capital of any empire in the world, has started up like an enchanted palace even in the memory of living men.&quot; – [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]], 1791
* &quot;I have heard of the greatness of Liverpool, but the reality far surpasses my expectation.&quot; – [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], speech, 1846
* &quot;Liverpool ... has become a wonder of the world. It is the New York of Europe, a world city rather than merely British provincial.&quot; – &quot;[[Illustrated London News]]&quot;, 15 May 1886
* &quot;The dream represented my situation at the time. I can still see the greyish-yellow raincoats, glistening with the wetness of the rain. Everything was extremely unpleasant, black and opaque – just as I felt then. But I had a vision of unearthly beauty, and that is why I was able to live at all. Liverpool is the &quot;pool of life.&quot; The &quot;liver,&quot; according to an old view, is the seat of life, that which makes to live.&quot; – [[C. G. Jung]], &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot;, 1928
* &quot;The centre is imposing, dignified and darkish, like a city in a rather gloomy Victorian novel ... We had now arrived in the heart of the big city, and as usual it was almost a heart of darkness. But it looked like a big city, there was no denying that. Here, emphatically, was the English seaport second only to London. The very weight of stone emphasised that fact. And even if the sun never seems to properly rise over it, I like a big city to proclaim itself a big city at once...&quot; – [[J. B. Priestley]], &quot;English Journey&quot;, 1934
* &quot;If Liverpool can get into top gear again, there is no limit to the city&#x27;s potential. The scale and resilience of the buildings and people is amazing – it is a world city, far more so than London and Manchester. It doesn&#x27;t feel like anywhere else in Lancashire: comparisons always end up overseas – [[Dublin]], or [[Boston]], or [[Hamburg]]. The city is tremendous, and so, right up to the [[First World War]], were the abilities of the architects who built over it. The centre is humane and convenient to walk around in, but never loses its scale. And, in spite of [[Liverpool Blitz|the bombings]] and the carelessness, it is still full of superb buildings. Fifty years ago it must have outdone anything in England.&quot; – [[Ian Nairn]], &quot;Britain&#x27;s Changing Towns&quot;, 1967

<text>The long jump is a track and field event in which athletes combine speed, strength and agility in an attempt to leap as far as possible from a takeoff point. Along with the triple jump, the two events that measure jumping for distance as a group are referred to as the &quot;horizontal jumps&quot;. This event has a history in the ancient Olympic Games and has been a modern Olympic event for men since the first Olympics in 1896 and for women since 1948.

==Rules==

At the elite level, competitors run down a runway (usually coated with the same rubberized surface as running tracks, crumb rubber or vulcanized rubber, known generally as an all-weather track) and jump as far as they can from a wooden or synthetic board, 20 centimetres or 8 inches wide, that is built flush with the runway, into a pit filled with soft damp sand. If the competitor starts the leap with any part of the foot past the foul line, the jump is declared a foul and no distance is recorded. To detect this occurrence, a layer of plasticine is placed at a 90° angle immediately after the board. An official (similar to a referee) will also watch the jump and make the determination. In recent times, laser sensors and camera technology have replaced the plasticine at elite competitions (like Diamond League meetings). The competitor can initiate the jump from any point behind the foul line; however, the distance measured will always be perpendicular to the foul line to the nearest break in the sand caused by any part of the body or uniform. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the competitor to get as close to the foul line as possible. Competitors are allowed to place two marks along the side of the runway in order to assist them to jump accurately. At a lesser meet and facilities, the plasticine will likely not exist, the runway might be a different surface or jumpers may initiate their jump from a painted or taped mark on the runway. At a smaller meet, the number of attempts might also be limited to four or three.

Each competitor has a set number of attempts. That would normally be three trials, with three additional jumps being awarded to the best eight or nine (depending on the number of lanes on the track at that facility, so the event is equatable to track events) competitors. All valid attempts will be recorded but only the best mark counts towards the results. The competitor with the longest valid jump (from either the trial or final rounds) is declared the winner at the end of competition. In the event of an exact tie, then comparing the next best jumps of the tied competitors will be used to determine place. In a large, multi-day elite competition (like the Olympics or World Championships), a qualification is held in order to select at least 12 finalists. Ties and automatic qualifying distances are potential factors. In the final, a set of trial round jumps will be held, with the best eight performers advancing to the final rounds. (For specific rules and regulations in United States Track &amp; Field see Rule 185)

For record purposes, the maximum accepted wind assistance is .

===Take-off-zone reform===
World Athletics has considered fundamental rule changes to the long jump. In a test phase starting with the 2025 indoor season, athletes will now take off from a wider zone instead of the traditional take-off board. This new 40-centimetre take-off zone was introduced by World Athletics to reduce the number of invalid attempts (around 30%) that have been common in recent years. The international athletics governing body believes that the new take-off zone will not only improve fairness and excitement for the athletes but also provide a more thrilling experience for the audience.

Traditionally, the jump distance is measured from the foul line to the nearest break in the sand. Under the new trial, the measurement will instead be taken from the exact point where the jumper&#x27;s front foot leaves the zone. Consequently, the effective jump distance is crucial for the outcome of the competition.

During the test phase, the jumps will also be recorded according to the traditional rules and will therefore be eligible for records and top lists.

==History==
The long jump is the only known jumping event of ancient Greece&#x27;s original Olympics&#x27; pentathlon events. All events that occurred at the Olympic Games were initially supposed to act as a form of training for warfare. The long jump emerged probably because it mirrored the crossing of obstacles such as streams and ravines. After investigating the surviving depictions of the ancient event it is believed that unlike the modern event, athletes were only allowed a short running start. The athletes carried a weight in each hand, which were called halteres (between 1 and 4.5 kg). These weights were swung forward as the athlete jumped in order to increase momentum. It was commonly believed that the jumper would throw the weights behind him in midair to increase his forward momentum; however, halteres were held throughout the duration of the jump. Swinging them down and back at the end of the jump would change the athlete&#x27;s center of gravity and allow the athlete to stretch his legs outward, increasing his distance. The jump itself was made from the &quot;bater&quot; (&quot;that which is trod upon&quot;). It was most likely a simple board placed on the stadium track which was removed after the event. The jumpers would land in what was called a &quot;skamma&quot; (&quot;dug-up&quot; area). The idea that this was a pit full of sand is wrong. Sand in the jumping pit is a modern invention. The &quot;skamma&quot; was simply a temporary area dug up for that occasion and not something that remained over time.

The long jump was considered one of the most difficult of the events held at the Games since a great deal of skill was required. Music was often played during the jump and Philostratus says that pipes at times would accompany the jump so as to provide a rhythm for the complex movements of the halteres by the athlete. Philostratus is quoted as saying, &quot;The rules regard jumping as the most difficult of the competitions, and they allow the jumper to be given advantages in rhythm by the use of the flute, and in weight by the use of the halter.&quot; Most notable in the ancient sport was a man called Chionis, who in the 656 BC Olympics staged a jump of .

There has been some argument by modern scholars over the long jump. Some have attempted to recreate it as a triple jump. The images provide the only evidence for the action so it is more well received that it was much like today&#x27;s long jump. The main reason some want to call it a triple jump is the presence of a source that claims there once was a fifty-five ancient foot jump done by a man named Phayllos.

The long jump has been part of modern Olympic competition since the inception of the Games in 1896. In 1914, Dr. Harry Eaton Stewart recommended the &quot;running broad jump&quot; as a standardized track and field event for women. However, it was not until 1948 that the women&#x27;s long jump was added to the Olympic athletics programme.

==Technique==

There are five main components of the long jump: the approach run, the last two strides, takeoff, action in the air, and landing. Speed in the run-up, or approach, and a high leap off the board are the fundamentals of success. Because speed is such an important factor of the approach, it is not surprising that many long jumpers also compete successfully in sprints. Classic examples of this long jump / sprint doubling are performances by Carl Lewis and Heike Drechsler.

===Approach===
The objective of the approach is to gradually accelerate to a maximum controlled speed at takeoff. The most important factor for the distance travelled by an object is its velocity at takeoff – both the speed and angle. Elite jumpers usually leave the ground at an angle of 20° or less; therefore, it is more beneficial for a jumper to focus on the speed component of the jump. The greater the speed at takeoff, the longer the trajectory of the center of mass will be. The importance of takeoff speed is a factor in the success of sprinters in this event.

The length of the approach is usually consistent distance for an athlete. Approaches can vary between 12 and 19 steps on the novice and intermediate levels, while at the elite level they are closer to between 20 and 22 steps. The exact distance and number of steps in an approach depends on the jumper&#x27;s experience, sprinting technique, and conditioning level. Consistency in the approach is important as it is the competitor&#x27;s objective to get as close to the front of the takeoff board as possible without crossing the line with any part of the foot.

===Last two steps===
The objective of the last two steps is to prepare the body for takeoff while conserving as much speed as possible.

The penultimate step is longer than the previous ones and than the final one before takeoff. The competitor begins to lower his or her center of gravity to prepare the body for the vertical impulse. The last step is shorter because the body is beginning to raise the center of gravity in preparation for takeoff.

The last two steps are extremely important because they determine the velocity at which the competitor will enter the jump.

===Takeoff===

The objective of the takeoff is to create a vertical impulse through the athlete&#x27;s center of gravity while maintaining balance and control.

This phase is one of the most technical parts of the long jump. Jumpers must be conscious to place the foot flat on the ground, because jumping off either the heels or the toes negatively affects the jump. Taking off from the board heel-first has a braking effect, which decreases velocity and strains the joints. Jumping off the toes decreases stability, putting the leg at risk of buckling or collapsing from underneath the jumper. While concentrating on foot placement, the athlete must also work to maintain proper body position, keeping the torso upright and moving the hips forward and up to achieve the maximum distance from board contact to foot release.

There are four main styles of takeoff: the double-arm style, the kick style, the power sprint or bounding takeoff, and the sprint takeoff.

====Double-arm====
The double-arm style of takeoff works by moving both arms in a vertical direction as the competitor takes off. This produces a high hip height and a large vertical impulse.

====Kick====
The kick style takeoff is where the athlete actively cycles the leg before a full impulse has been directed into the board then landing into the pit. This requires great strength in the hamstrings. This causes the jumper to jump to large distances.

====Power sprint or bounding====
The power sprint takeoff, or bounding takeoff, is one of the more common elite styles. Very similar to the sprint style, the body resembles a sprinter in full stride. However, there is one major difference. The arm that pushes back on takeoff (the arm on the side of the takeoff leg) fully extends backward, rather than remaining at a bent position. This additional extension increases the impulse at takeoff.

====Sprint====
The sprint takeoff is the style most widely instructed by coaching staff. This is a classic single-arm action that resembles a jumper in full stride. It is an efficient takeoff style for maintaining velocity through takeoff.

The &quot;correct&quot; style of takeoff will vary from athlete to athlete.

===Action in the air and landing===
There are three major flight techniques for the long jump: the hang, the hitch-kick, and the sail. Each technique is to combat the forward rotation experienced from take-off but is basically down to preference from the athlete. Once the body is airborne, there is nothing that the athlete can do to change the direction they are traveling and consequently where they are going to land in the pit. However, certain techniques influence an athlete&#x27;s landing, which can affect the distance measured. For example, if an athlete lands feet first but falls back because they are not correctly balanced, a lower distance will be measured.

====Hang====

Following the pivotal takeoff phase, the jumper executes a deliberate maneuver wherein the free leg descends until it aligns directly beneath the hips. This strategic positioning, characterized by an elongated and streamlined body silhouette, is meticulously crafted to minimize rotational forces. By maximizing the distance between both the arm and leg extremities and the hips—the theoretical center of mass—the rotational inertia is significantly increased. Leveraging the principle that longer levers rotate at a slower pace than shorter ones, this configuration facilitates a controlled and stable aerial trajectory.

As the free leg descends to meet the takeoff leg, forming an angle of 180° relative to the ground, a symmetrical alignment is achieved with both knees positioned directly beneath the hips. This alignment marks the apex of stability during the airborne phase, as minimal rotational tendencies are manifested. This aerodynamically advantageous posture, colloquially termed the &quot;180° position&quot;, epitomizes the pinnacle of equilibrium, affording the jumper enhanced control and poise amidst the dynamic forces encountered in flight.

====Hitch-kick====

In the realm of athletic performance, particularly in the domain of jumping techniques, a prevalent strategy observed among practitioners involves the utilization of a single-step arm and leg cycle. This technique, ingrained within the repertoire of many athletes, serves a fundamental purpose: to mitigate and alleviate the forward rotation momentum experienced during the jump. Characterized by a deliberate and synchronized motion of the arms and legs, this cycling maneuver is strategically devised to offset the rotational forces generated at the moment of takeoff.

Central to the efficacy of this technique is its capacity to orchestrate secondary rotations of both the upper and lower extremities, thereby fostering a mechanical equilibrium that counterbalances the initial rotational impulses triggered upon liftoff. By implementing this methodological approach, athletes can harness the principles of biomechanics to optimize their jumping performance, enhancing stability, control, and overall efficiency in their aerial endeavors. This nuanced understanding underscores the intricate interplay between physics and human kinetics, illuminating the sophisticated strategies employed by athletes to excel in their athletic pursuits.

====Sail====

The &quot;sail technique&quot; represents a fundamental long jump approach widely employed by athletes in competitive settings. Following the culmination of the takeoff phase, practitioners swiftly elevate their legs into a configuration aimed at touching the toes. This maneuver serves as an entry-level strategy particularly beneficial for novice jumpers, facilitating an early transition into the landing posture. However, despite its utility in expediting the landing process, this technique fails to mitigate the inherent forward rotational momentum of the body effectively. Consequently, while advantageous for its simplicity and expedited landing preparation, the sail technique lacks the requisite mechanisms to adequately counteract excessive forward rotation, posing a notable limitation to its effectiveness in optimizing jump performance.

====Somersault====

In the 1970s, some jumpers used a forward somersault, including Tuariki Delamere who used it at the 1974 NCAA Championships, and who matched the jump of the then Olympic champion Randy Williams. The somersault jump has potential to produce longer jumps than other techniques because in the flip, no power is lost countering forward momentum, and it reduces wind resistance in the air. The front flip jump was subsequently banned for fear that it was unsafe.

The men&#x27;s long jump world record has been held by just four individuals for the majority of time since the IAAF (now World Athletics) started to ratify records. The first mark recognized by the IAAF in 1912, the performance by Peter O&#x27;Connor in August 1901, stood just short of 20 years (nine years as an IAAF record). After it was broken in 1921, the record changed hands five times until Jesse Owens set the mark of at the 1935 Big Ten track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a record that was not broken for over 25 years, until 1960 by Ralph Boston. Boston improved upon it and exchanged records with Igor Ter-Ovanesyan three times over the next seven years. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Bob Beamon jumped at an altitude of , a record jump not exceeded for almost 23 years, and which remains the second longest wind legal jump of all time; it has now stood as the Olympic record for over years. On 30 August 1991, Mike Powell of the United States set the current men&#x27;s world record at the World Championships in Tokyo. It was in a dramatic showdown against Carl Lewis who also surpassed Beamon&#x27;s record that day, but his jump was wind-assisted (and thus not legal for record purposes). Powell&#x27;s record of has now stood for over years.

Some jumps over have been officially recorded. Wind-assisted were recorded by Powell at high altitude in Sestriere in 1992. A potential world record of was recorded by Iván Pedroso also in Sestriere. Despite a &quot;legal&quot; wind reading, the jump was not validated because videotape revealed a person standing in front of the wind gauge, invalidating the reading (and costing Pedroso a Ferrari valued at $130,000—the prize for breaking the record at that meet). As mentioned above, Lewis jumped moments before Powell&#x27;s record-breaking jump with the wind exceeding the maximum allowed. This jump remains the longest ever not to win an Olympic or World Championship gold medal, or any competition in general.

The women&#x27;s world record has seen more consistent improvement, though the current record has stood longer than any other long jump world record by men or women. The longest to hold the record prior was by Fanny Blankers-Koen during World War II, who held it for over 10 years. There have been four occasions when the record was tied and three when it was improved upon twice in the same competition. The current women&#x27;s world record is held by Galina Chistyakova of the former Soviet Union who leapt in Leningrad on 11 June 1988, a mark that has now stood for over years.

<text>Luke is a male given name, and less commonly, a surname.

The name Luke is the English form and the diminutive of the Latin name .

Although the name is attested in ancient inscriptions, the best known historical use of the name is in the New Testament. The Gospel of Luke was written around 70 to 90 AD (the exact years are unknown). Luke, who is credited with the authorship of the Gospel of Luke, was a physician who lived around 30 to 130 AD. Luke is also credited with the Book of Acts in the Bible, and also is mentioned by the Apostle Paul in some of Paul&#x27;s letters to first-century churches.

The name is sometimes used as a nickname for Luther. In 2020, Luke was the 31st most popular name for babies in the United States.

<text>Lonsdaleite (named in honour of Kathleen Lonsdale), also called hexagonal diamond in reference to the crystal structure, is an allotrope of carbon with a hexagonal lattice, as opposed to the cubical lattice of conventional diamond. It is found in nature in meteorite debris; when meteors containing graphite strike the Earth, the immense heat and stress of the impact transforms the graphite into diamond, but retains graphite&#x27;s hexagonal crystal lattice. Lonsdaleite was first identified in 1967 from the Canyon Diablo meteorite, where it occurs as microscopic crystals associated with ordinary diamond.

It is translucent and brownish-yellow and has an index of refraction of 2.40–2.41 and a specific gravity of 3.2–3.3. Its hardness is theoretically superior to that of cubic diamond (up to 58% more), according to computational simulations, but natural specimens exhibited somewhat lower hardness through a large range of values (from 7–8 on Mohs hardness scale). The cause is speculated to be due to the samples having been riddled with lattice defects and impurities.

In addition to meteorite deposits, hexagonal diamond has been synthesized in the laboratory (1966 or earlier; published in 1967) by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives.

==Hardness==
According to the conventional interpretation of the results of examining the meagre samples collected from meteorites or manufactured in the lab, lonsdaleite has a hexagonal unit cell, related to the diamond unit cell in the same way that the hexagonal and cubic close packed crystal systems are related. Its diamond structure can be considered to be made up of interlocking rings of six carbon atoms, in the chair conformation. In lonsdaleite, some rings are in the boat conformation instead. At nanoscale dimensions, cubic diamond is represented by &quot;diamondoids&quot; while hexagonal diamond is represented by &quot;wurtzoids&quot;.

In diamond, all the carbon-to-carbon bonds, both within a layer of rings and between them, are in the staggered conformation, thus causing all four cubic-diagonal directions to be equivalent; whereas in lonsdaleite the bonds between layers are in the eclipsed conformation, which defines the axis of hexagonal symmetry.

Mineralogical &quot;simulation&quot; predicts lonsdaleite to be 58% harder than diamond on the &lt;100&gt; face, and to resist indentation pressures of 152 GPa, whereas diamond would break at 97 GPa. This is yet exceeded by IIa diamond&#x27;s &lt;111&gt; tip hardness of 162 GPa.

The extrapolated properties of lonsdaleite have been questioned, particularly its superior hardness, since specimens under crystallographic inspection have not shown a bulk hexagonal lattice structure, but instead a conventional cubic diamond dominated by structural defects that include hexagonal sequences. A quantitative analysis of the X-ray diffraction data of lonsdaleite has shown that about equal amounts of hexagonal and cubic stacking sequences are present. Consequently, it has been suggested that &quot;stacking disordered diamond&quot; is the most accurate structural description of lonsdaleite. On the other hand, recent shock experiments with in situ X-ray diffraction show strong evidence for creation of relatively pure lonsdaleite in dynamic high-pressure environments comparable to meteorite impacts.

==Occurrence==

Lonsdaleite occurs as microscopic crystals associated with diamond in several meteorites: Canyon Diablo, Kenna, and Allan Hills 77283. It is also naturally occurring in non-bolide diamond placer deposits in the Sakha Republic. Material with d-spacings consistent with Lonsdaleite has been found in sediments with highly uncertain dates at Lake Cuitzeo, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, by proponents of the controversial Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is now refuted by earth scientists and planetary impact specialists. Claims of Lonsdaleite and other nanodiamonds in a layer of the Greenland ice sheet that could be of Younger Dryas age have not been confirmed and are now disputed. Its presence in local peat deposits is claimed as evidence for the Tunguska event being caused by a meteor rather than by a cometary fragment.

==Manufacture==
In addition to laboratory synthesis by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives, lonsdaleite has also been produced by chemical vapor deposition, and also by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(hydridocarbyne), at atmospheric pressure, under argon atmosphere, at .

In 2020, researchers at Australian National University found by accident they were able to produce lonsdaleite at room temperatures using a diamond anvil cell.

In 2021, Washington State University&#x27;s Institute for Shock Physics published a paper stating that they created lonsdaleite crystals large enough to measure their stiffness, confirming that they are stiffer than common cubic diamonds. However, the explosion used to create these crystals also destroys them nanoseconds later, providing just enough time to measure stiffness with lasers.

== Scams ==
Since the characteristics of lonsdaleite are unknown to most people outside of scientists trained in geology and mineralogy, the names &quot;lonsdaleite&quot; and &quot;hexagonal diamond&quot; have frequently been used in the fraudulent sale of ceramic artifacts passed off as meteorites on online e-commerce sites and at street fairs and street markets, with prices ranging from a few dollars to thousands of dollars.

<text>The Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) is an extinct North American duck species. It has the distinction of being the first known endemic North American bird species to become extinct after the Columbian Exchange, with the last reported sighting occurring in 1878 in Elmira, New York, and the last preserved specimen was shot in the fall of 1875 in Long Island, New York by J.G. Bell. It was already a rare duck before European settlers arrived, and as a result of its rarity, information on the Labrador duck is not abundant, although some, such as its habitat, characteristics, dietary habits and reasons behind its extinction, are known. There are 55 specimens of the Labrador duck preserved in museum collections worldwide.

==Taxonomy==

The Labrador duck is considered a sea duck. A basic difference in the shape of the process of metacarpal I divides the sea ducks into two groups:
#&quot;Bucephala&quot; and the mergansers
#The eiders, scoters, &quot;Histrionicus&quot;, &quot;Clangula&quot;, and &quot;Camptorhynchus&quot;
The position of the nutrient foramen of the tarsometatarsus also separates the two groups of sea ducks. In the first group, the foramen is lateral to the long axis of the lateral groove of the hypotarsus; in the second, the foramen is on or medial to the axis of that groove.

The Labrador duck was also known as the pied duck and skunk duck, the former being a vernacular name that it shared with the surf scoter and the common goldeneye (and even the American oystercatcher), a fact that has led to difficulties in interpreting old records of these species. Both names refer to the male&#x27;s striking white/black piebald colouration. Yet another common name was sand shoal duck, referring to its habit of feeding in shallow water. The closest evolutionary relatives of the Labrador duck are apparently the scoters (&quot;Melanitta&quot;).

A mitogenomic study of the placement of the Labrador duck found the species to be closely related to the Steller&#x27;s eider as shown below.
==Description==

The female plumage was grey. Although weakly patterned, the pattern was scoter-like. The male&#x27;s plumage was black and white in an eider-like pattern, but the wings were entirely white except for the primaries. The trachea of the male was scoter-like. An expansion of the tracheal tube occurred at the anterior end, and two enlargements (as opposed to one enlargement as seen in scoters) were near the middle of the tube. The bulla was bony and round, puffing out from the left side. This asymmetrical and osseus bulla was unlike that of scoters; this bulla was similar to eiders and harlequin duck&#x27;s bullae. The Labrador duck has been considered the most enigmatic of all North American birds.

The Labrador duck had an oblong head with small, beady eyes. Its bill was almost as long as its head. The body was short and depressed with short, strong feet that were far behind the body. The feathers were small and the tail was short and rounded. The Labrador duck belongs to a monotypic genus.

==Habitat==
The Labrador duck migrated annually, wintering off the coasts of New Jersey and New England in the eastern United States, where it favored southern sandy coasts, sheltered bays, harbors, and inlets, and breeding in Labrador and northern Quebec in the summer. John James Audubon&#x27;s son reported seeing a nest belonging to the species in Labrador. Some believe that it may have laid its eggs on the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The breeding biology of the Labrador duck is largely unknown.

==Diet==

The Labrador duck fed on small molluscs, and some fishermen reported catching it on fishing lines baited with mussels. The structure of the bill was highly modified from that of most ducks, having a wide, flattened tip with numerous lamellae inside. In this way, it is considered an ecological counterpart of the North Pacific/North Asian Steller&#x27;s eider. The beak was also particularly soft and may have been used to probe through sediment for food.

Another, completely unrelated, duck with similar (but even more specialized) bill morphology is the Australian pink-eared duck, which feeds largely on plankton, but also mollusks; the condition in the Labrador duck probably resembled that in the blue duck most in outward appearance.
Its peculiar bill suggests it ate shellfish and crustaceans from silt and shallow water. The Labrador duck may have survived by eating snails.

==Extinction==

The Labrador duck is thought to have been always rare, but between 1850 and 1870, populations waned further. The exact reasons for its extinction is still not fully known. The IUCN recognized the last year the species was seen as 1875. It was last seen in Canada, in 1874 on Grand Manan.

Although hunted for food, this duck was considered to taste bad, rotted quickly, and fetched a low price. Consequently, it was not sought much by hunters. However, the eggs may have been overharvested, and it may have been subject to depredations by the feather trade in its breeding area, as well. Another possible factor in the bird&#x27;s extinction was the decline in mussels and other shellfish on which they are believed to have fed in their winter quarters, due to growth of population and industry on the Eastern Seaboard. Although all sea ducks readily feed on shallow-water molluscs, no Western Atlantic bird species seems to have been as dependent on such food as the Labrador duck.
Another theory that was said to lead to their extinction was a huge increase of human influence on the coastal ecosystems in North America, causing the birds to flee their niches and find another habitat. These ducks were the only birds whose range was limited to the American coast of the North Atlantic, so changing niches was a difficult task. Whatever the causes may be, the Labrador duck became extinct in the late 19th century.

<text>Lettres de cachet (; ) were letters signed by the king of France, countersigned by one of his ministers, and closed with the royal seal. They contained orders directly from the king, often to enforce actions and judgments that could not be appealed.

In the case of organized bodies, &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; were issued for the purpose of preventing assembly, or to accomplish some other definite act. The provincial estates were convoked (called to assembly) in this manner, and it was by a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; (in this case, a &quot;lettre de jussipri&quot;), or by showing in person in a &quot;lit de justice&quot;, that the king ordered a &quot;parlement&quot; to register a law despite that &quot;parlement&quot;″s refusal to pass it.

The best-known &quot;lettres de cachet&quot;, however, were penal, by which a subject was imprisoned without trial and without an opportunity of defense (after inquiry and due diligence by the &quot;lieutenant de police&quot;) in a state prison or an ordinary jail, confined in a convent or the General Hospital of Paris, transported to the colonies, or expelled to another part of the realm, or from the realm altogether. The &quot;lettres&quot; were mainly used against drunkards, troublemakers, prostitutes, squanderers of the family fortune, or insane persons. The wealthy sometimes petitioned such &quot;lettres&quot; to dispose of inconvenient individuals, especially to prevent unequal marriages (nobles with commoners), or to prevent a scandal (the &quot;lettre&quot; could prevent court cases that might otherwise dishonour a family).

In this respect, the &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; were a prominent symbol of the abuses of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; monarchy, and as such were suppressed during the French Revolution. In 1789 and 1790, all cases were reviewed by a commission which confirmed most of the sentences. Historian Claude Quétel has interpreted these confirmations as indicating that the &quot;lettres&quot; were not as arbitrary and unjust as they have been represented after the Revolution, and he hence speaks of a &quot;Légende noire&quot;.

==History==

The power to issue &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; was a royal privilege recognized by the French monarchic civil law that developed during the 13th century, as the Capetian monarchy overcame its initial distrust of Roman law. The principle can be traced to a maxim which furnished a text of the &quot;Pandects&quot; of Justinian: in their Latin version, &quot;Rex solutus est a legibus&quot;, or &quot;The king is released from the laws&quot;. &quot;The French legal scholars interpreted the imperial office of the Justinian code generically and arrived at the conclusion that every &#x27;king is an emperor in his own kingdom&#x27;, that is, he possesses the prerogatives of legal absolutism that the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; attributes to the Roman emperor.&quot;

This meant that when the king intervened directly, he could decide without heeding the laws, and even contrary to the laws. This was an early conception, and in early times the order in question was simply verbal; some letters patent of Henry III in 1576 state that François de Montmorency was &quot;prisoner in our castle of the Bastille in Paris by verbal command&quot; of the late king Charles IX.

In the 14th century, the principle was introduced that the order should be written, and hence arose the &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;. The &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; belonged to the class of &quot;lettres closes&quot;, as opposed to &quot;lettres patentes&quot;, which contained the expression of the legal and permanent will of the king, and had to be furnished with the seal of state affixed by the chancellor.

The &quot;lettres de cachet&quot;, on the contrary, were signed simply by a secretary of state for the king; they bore merely the imprint of the king&#x27;s privy seal, from which circumstance they were often called, in the 14th and 15th centuries, &quot;lettres de petit signet&quot; or &quot;lettres de petit cachet&quot;, and were entirely exempt from the control of the chancellor.

==As a tool==
In addition to serving the government as a silent weapon against political adversaries or controversial writers and as a means of punishing culprits of high birth without the scandal of a lawsuit, the &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; had many other uses. They were employed by the police in dealing with prostitutes, and on their authority lunatics were shut up in hospitals and sometimes in prisons.

They were also often used by heads of families as a means of correction, for example, to protect the family honour from the disorderly or criminal conduct of sons. The case of the Marquis de Sade (imprisoned 1777–1790 under a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; obtained by his wealthy and influential mother-in-law) is a prominent example. Wives, too, took advantage of them to curb the profligacy of husbands, and vice versa.

In reality, the secretary of state had delegated powers, and could issue them at his own discretion, and in most cases the king was unaware of their issue. In the 18th century the letters were often issued blank, i.e. without containing the name of the person against whom they were directed; the recipient, or mandatary, filled in the name in order to make the letter effective.

==Protests==
Protests against the &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; were made continually by the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris and by the provincial &quot;parlements&quot;, and also by the Estates-General. In 1648, during the Fronde, the sovereign courts of Paris, by their &quot;Arrêt d&#x27;Union&quot;, procured their momentary suppression in a kind of charter of liberties which they imposed upon the crown, but which was short-lived.

It was not until the reign of Louis XVI that a reaction against the abuse became clearly perceptible. At the beginning of that reign Malesherbes during his short ministry endeavoured to infuse some measure of justice into the system, and in March 1784 the baron de Breteuil, a minister of the king&#x27;s household, addressed a circular to the intendants and the lieutenant of police with a view to preventing the most serious abuses connected with the issue of &quot;lettres de cachet&quot;.

The Comte de Mirabeau wrote a scathing indictment of &quot;lettres de cachet&quot; while imprisoned in the dungeon of Vincennes (by &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; obtained by his father). The treatise was published after his liberation in 1782 under the title &quot;Les Lettres de cachet et des prisons d&#x27;etat&quot; and was widely read throughout Europe.

Besides the Bastille, there were thirty prisons in Paris by 1779 in which a person could be detained without trial. Convents were used for the same purpose.

They were reported to have been openly sold, in the reign of Louis XV, by the mistress of one of his ministers.

In Paris, in 1779, the Cour des Aides demanded their suppression, and in March 1788 the Parlement of Paris made some exceedingly energetic remonstrances, which are important for the light they throw upon old French public law. The crown, however, did not decide to lay aside this weapon, and in a declaration to the States-General in the royal session of June 23, 1789 (art. 15) it did not renounce it absolutely.

==Abolition and reinstatement==
&quot;Lettres de cachet&quot; were abolished after the French Revolution by the Constituent Assembly, but Napoleon reestablished their penal equivalent by a political measure in the decree of 8 March 1801 on the state prisons. This was one of the acts brought up against him by the senatus-consulte of 3 April 1814, which pronounced his fall &quot;considering that he has violated the constitutional laws by the decrees on the state prisons.&quot;

==Victims of &quot;lettres de cachet&quot;==

* Charles Simon Favart (because a nobleman was interested in his wife)
* Luke Joseph Hooke (deprived of his academic chair in theology for awarding a PhD to a candidate without having read the (heretical) thesis.)
* Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau (several times, on request of his father, as protection against creditors and once to prevent a death penalty for kidnapping and eloping with a married woman)
* Marguerite Monvoisin (complicity in a poisoning affair. A &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; was used to avoid a scandal that might have affected Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan, a mistress of the King who was assumed to have been involved).
* Pigault-Lebrun (twice, for eloping with two successive young women)
* Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynière (misconduct: sent away to an abbey by his father)
* Marquis de Sade (rape and torture. The Lettre was petitioned by the marquis&#x27; wife, to avoid a court case)
* Comte de Sanois (domestic disputes and debt. His wife petitioned a Lettre, claiming her husband insane)
* Voltaire (once for slander, a second time for violent menaces against the Prince de Rohan)
* Jean-François Marmontel, accused to be the author of a satire against the Duke d&#x27;Aumont. His account of his short stay in the Bastille contains a description of the food he received, the room he was imprisoned with his servant, and the goodwill shown to him.
* Giacomo Casanova (dueling)
* Marie-Anne de La Ville (practiced black magic. A scandalous trial was avoided by a &quot;lettre&quot;)
* Jean-Baptiste Forqueray (request of his father)

==In literature==
* Honoré de Mirabeau, &quot;Des Lettres de Cachet et des prisons d&#x27;état&quot; (Hamburg, 1782), written in the dungeon at Vincennes into which his father had thrown him by a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;, one of the ablest and most eloquent of his works, which had an immense circulation and was translated into English in 1788.
* &quot;The Castle of Wolfenbach&quot;, one of the &quot;Horrid Novels&quot; mentioned in &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; by Jane Austen, features a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; as a major plot point when the main villain, the guardian of a young lady who has run away, tries to use a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; to obligate her to be returned to him so he can force her into marriage.
* Doctor Alexandre Manette, in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, was thrown into the Bastille prison by means of a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot;. In addition, Charles Darnay suspected that his uncle, a marquis, would have used a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; to put Darnay himself into prison had the Marquis not fallen out of favour with the royal court.

<doc id="18090" wikidata="Q237276" url="?curid=18090" title="Lilia Podkopayeva">
<text>Lilia Oleksandrivna Podkopayeva (; born 15 August 1978) is a Ukrainian former artistic gymnast. She is the 1995 world all-around champion, and the 1996 Olympic all-around and floor exercise champion. Often thought of as a complete athlete, Podkopayeva was known for combining power, style, and balletic grace.

==Gymnastics career==

=== 1993–95 ===
In March 1993, Lilia won her only National All Around Title in Ukraine. In April 1993, Podkopayeva competed at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Birmingham, England. She qualified for the vault final, but crashed on her first attempt and finished last with a score of 8.893.

At the 1994 World Championships in Brisbane, Australia, she placed sixth in the all-around with a score of 38.942. In event finals, she placed eighth on vault, scoring 9.424; fifth on uneven bars, scoring 9.350; and second on balance beam, scoring 9.737. In November 1994, at the World Team Championships in Dortmund, Germany, she contributed an all-around score of 38.099 toward the Ukrainian team&#x27;s fifth-place finish.

The following year, Podkopayeva competed at the 1995 World Championships in Sabae, Japan. She helped Ukraine place fifth and qualify a full team to the 1996 Olympics. Podkopayeva then won the all-around final with a score of 39.248. In event finals, she placed first on vault (9.781), second on uneven bars (9.837), second on balance beam (9.837), and seventh on floor (9.087).

=== 1996 ===
At the beginning of the year, Podkopayeva was seriously injured when she fell from the beam in practice, fracturing two ribs. However, in May, she competed at the European Championships in Birmingham, where she helped the Ukrainian team place third and won the individual all-around with a score of 39.205. In event finals, she placed third on balance beam (9.756), first on uneven bars (9.825), and first on floor (9.862).

==== Atlanta Olympics ====
In July, Podkopayeva competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. In the team final, she contributed a combined compulsory and optional score of 78.061 toward the Ukrainian team&#x27;s fifth-place finish. She then won the all-around final with a score of 39.255. In event finals, she placed fifth on uneven bars (9.787), second on balance beam (9.825), and first on floor (9.887). She was the fourth gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title as the reigning world champion, and the first gymnast to win the all-around without winning a team medal. She was also the last female gymnast to win the all-around title and an event-final gold medal until Simone Biles did this in 2016.

=== 1997 ===
Podkopayeva originally intended to continue competing after the 1996 Olympics, and she was named to the Ukrainian team for the 1997 World Championships. However, injuries forced her to sit out the competition and, later, to retire.

==Eponymous skills==
Podkopayeva has two eponymous skills listed in the Code of Points.

== Post-retirement ==
In 2002, Podkopayeva started the Golden Lilia International Sports Festival, an exhibition featuring artistic and rhythmic gymnasts, acrobats, and dancers. She said, &quot;It&#x27;s important to us to show outstanding people and brightest talent so that the next generation can follow the best of the best.&quot;

In December 2004, she married a Ukrainian businessman Tymofiy Nahornyi. They have two children: Vadym, adopted in Ukraine in July 2006, and Karolina, born in November 2006. The couple divorced in 2009.

In 2005, Podkopayeva became a United Nations goodwill ambassador on HIV/AIDS in Ukraine. She is also an Ambassador of the Council of Europe for Sport, Tolerance, and Fair Play.

In 2007, she won Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; with partner Sergiy Kostetskyi. The next year, she represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Dance Contest. Along with partner Kyrylo Khytrov, she placed third in the competition.

In 2014, Podkopayeva did a gala event in Mexico, using similar choreography to the floor routine she performed in Atlanta, as well as doing back handsprings and round-offs.

In 2019, Podkopayeva joined the coaching staff at Marcus Jewish Community Center of Atlanta&#x27;s Perimeter Gymnastics.

<doc id="18091" wikidata="Q597" url="?curid=18091" title="Lisbon">
<text>Lisbon ( ; ) is the capital and largest city of Portugal, with an estimated population of 567,131 as of 2023 within its administrative limits and 2,961,177 within the metropolis. Lisbon is mainland Europe&#x27;s westernmost capital city (second overall after Reykjavik) and the only one along the Atlantic coast, the others (Reykjavik and Dublin) being on islands. The city lies in the western portion of the Iberian Peninsula, on the northern shore of the River Tagus. The western portion of its metro area, the Portuguese Riviera, hosts the westernmost point of Continental Europe, culminating at Cabo da Roca.

Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in the world and the second-oldest European capital city (after Athens), predating other modern European capitals by centuries. Settled by pre-Celtic tribes and later founded and civilized by the Phoenicians, Julius Caesar made it a municipium called &quot;Felicitas Julia&quot;, adding the term to the name &quot;Olissipo&quot;. After the fall of the Roman Empire, it was ruled by a series of Germanic tribes from the 5th century, most notably the Visigoths. Later it was captured by the Moors in the 8th century. In 1147, Afonso Henriques conquered the city and in 1255, it became Portugal&#x27;s capital, replacing Coimbra. It has since been the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country.

As the political centre of the country, Lisbon hosts the government, National Assembly, Supreme Court of Justice, Armed Forces and residence of the head of state. It is also the centre of Portuguese diplomacy, with ambassadors from 86 countries residing in the city, as well as representations from Taiwan and Palestine. About 2.96 million people live in the Lisbon metropolitan area, which extends beyond the city&#x27;s administrative area, making it the third largest metropolitan area in the Iberian Peninsula (after Madrid and Barcelona) as well as figuring amongst the 10 most populous urban areas in the European Union. It represents approximately 28% of the country&#x27;s population.

Lisbon is recognised as an alpha-level global city because of its importance in finance, commerce, fashion, media, entertainment, arts, international trade, education, and tourism. Lisbon is amongst the two Portuguese cities (the other being Porto) to be recognised as a global city, and it is also home to three companies in the Global 2000 (EDP Group, Galp Energia and Jerónimo Martins). Lisbon is one of the major economic centres in Europe, with a growing financial sector, with PSI-20 being part of Euronext, the largest center for debt and funds listings in the world. The Lisbon region has a higher GDP PPP per capita than any other region in Portugal. Its GDP PPP amounts to US$179 billion and thus $61,713 per capita.

The city occupies the 40th place of highest gross earnings in the world and, with almost 21,000 millionaires, is the 11th European city by number of millionaires and the 14th by number of billionaires. Most of the headquarters of multinational corporations in Portugal are located in the Lisbon area.

==Etymology==

Lisbon&#x27;s name may derive from Proto-Celtic or Celtic &quot;Olisippo&quot;, &quot;Lissoppo&quot;, or a similar name which other visiting ancient peoples such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans adapted accordingly, such as the pre-Roman appellation for the Tagus River, &quot;Lisso&quot; or &quot;Lucio&quot;. Classical authors writing in Latin and Greek, including Strabo, Solinus, and Martianus Capella, referred to popular legends that the city of Lisbon was founded by the mythical hero Ulysses (Odysseus). Lisbon&#x27;s name was written &quot;Ulyssippo&quot; in Latin by the geographer Pomponius Mela, a native of Hispania. It was later referred to as &quot;Olisippo&quot; by Pliny the Elder and by the Greeks as &quot;Olissipo&quot; (Ὀλισσιπών) or &quot;Olissipona&quot; (Ὀλισσιπόνα).

Another claim repeated in historical literature is that the name of Lisbon could originate from a supposed ancient Phoenician term &quot;Alis-Ubbo&quot;, meaning &quot;safe harbour&quot; or &quot;pleasant haven&quot;. Although modern archaeological excavations show there may have been Phoenician presence at this location since 1000BC, this folk etymology completely lacks any evidence and &quot;is never attested in ancient classical literature&quot;.

Lisbon&#x27;s name is commonly abbreviated as &quot;LX&quot; or &quot;Lx&quot;, originating in an antiquated spelling of Lisbon as &quot;Lixbõa&quot;. While the old spelling has since been completely dropped from usage and goes against modern language standards, the abbreviation is still commonly used.

==History==

===Origins===
During the Neolithic period, the region was inhabited by Pre-Celtic tribes, who built religious and funerary monuments, megaliths, dolmens and menhirs, which still survive in areas on the periphery of Lisbon. The Indo-European Celts invaded in the 1st millennium BC, mixing with the Pre-Indo-European population, thus giving rise to Celtic-speaking local tribes such as the Cempsi or Sefes.

Although the first fortifications on Lisbon&#x27;s Castelo hill are known to be no older than the 2nd century BC, recent archaeological finds have shown that Iron Age people occupied the site from the 8th to 6th centuries BC. This indigenous settlement maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians, which would account for the recent findings of Phoenician pottery and other material objects. Archaeological excavations made near the Castle of São Jorge (&quot;Castelo de São Jorge&quot;) and Lisbon Cathedral indicate there may have been a Phoenician presence at this location since 1000 BC, and it can be stated with confidence that a Phoenician trading post stood on a site now the centre of the present city, on the southern slope of the Castle hill. The sheltered harbour in the Tagus River estuary was an ideal spot for an Iberian settlement and would have provided a secure harbour for unloading and provisioning trading ships. The Tagus settlement was an important centre of commercial trade with the inland tribes, providing an outlet for the valuable metals, salt and salted-fish they collected, and for the sale of the Lusitanian horses renowned in antiquity.

According to a persistent legend, the location was named for the Greek mythical king of Ithaca, Ulysses, who founded the city when he sailed westward to the ends of the known world.

===Roman era===

Following the defeat of Hannibal in 202 BC during the Punic wars, the Romans determined to deprive Carthage of its most valuable possession: Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula). The defeat of Carthaginian forces by Scipio Africanus in Eastern Hispania allowed the pacification of the west, led by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus. Decimus obtained the alliance of Olissipo (which sent men to fight alongside the Roman Legions against the northwestern Celtic tribes) by integrating it into the empire, as the &quot;Municipium Cives Romanorum Felicitas Julia&quot;. Local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended ; exempt from taxes, its citizens were given the privileges of Roman citizenship, and it was then integrated with the Roman province of Lusitania (whose capital was Emerita Augusta).

Lusitanian raids and rebellions during Roman occupation required the construction of a wall around the settlement. During Augustus&#x27; reign, the Romans also built a great theatre; the Cassian Baths (underneath &quot;Rua da Prata&quot;); temples to Jupiter, Diana, Cybele, Tethys and Idea Phrygiae (an uncommon cult from Asia Minor), in addition to temples to the Emperor; a large necropolis under &quot;Praça da Figueira&quot;; a large forum and other buildings such as insulae (multi-storied apartment buildings) in the area between Castle Hill and the historic city core. Many of these ruins were first unearthed during the mid-18th century (when the recent discovery of Pompeii made Roman archaeology fashionable among Europe&#x27;s upper classes).

The city prospered as piracy was eliminated and technological advances were introduced, consequently &quot;Felicitas Julia&quot; became a center of trade with the Roman provinces of Britannia (particularly Cornwall) and the Rhine. Economically strong, Olissipo was known for its garum (a fish sauce highly prized by the elites of the empire and exported in amphorae to Rome), wine, salt, and horse-breeding, while Roman culture permeated the hinterland. The city was connected by a broad road to Western Hispania&#x27;s two other large cities, Bracara Augusta in the province of Tarraconensis (Portuguese Braga), and Emerita Augusta, the capital of Lusitania. The city was ruled by an oligarchical council dominated by two families, the Julii and the Cassiae, although regional authority was administered by the Roman Governor of Emerita or directly by Emperor Tiberius. Among the majority of Latin speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves.

Olissipo, like most great cities in the Western Empire, was a center for the dissemination of Christianity. Its first attested Bishop was Potamius (c. 356), and there were several martyrs during the period of persecution of the Christians: Verissimus, Maxima, and Julia are the most significant examples. By the time of the Fall of Rome, Olissipo had become a notable Christian center.

===Middle Ages===
Following the disintegration of the Western Roman Empire, there were barbarian invasions; between 409 and 429 the city was occupied successively by Sarmatians, Alans and Vandals. The Germanic Suebi, who established a kingdom in Gallaecia (modern Galicia and northern Portugal), with its capital in &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot;, also controlled the region of Lisbon until 585. In 585, the Suebi Kingdom was integrated into the Germanic Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo, which comprised all of the Iberian Peninsula: Lisbon was then called &quot;Ulishbona&quot;.

On 6 August 711, Lisbon was taken by the Muslim forces of the Umayyad Caliphate. These conquerors built many mosques and houses, rebuilt the city wall (known as the &quot;Cerca Moura&quot;) and established administrative control, while permitting the diverse population of Muwallads, Arabs, Berbers, Mozarabs, &quot;Saqaliba&quot;, and Jews to maintain their socio-cultural lifestyles. Mozarabic was the native language spoken by most of the Christian population although Arabic was widely known as spoken by all religious communities. Islam was the official religion practised by the Arabs, Berbers, Saqaliba and Muwallad.

The ancient Muslim influence is still visible in the Alfama district, an old quarter of Lisbon that survived the 1755 Lisbon earthquake: many place-names are derived from Arabic and the Alfama (the oldest existing district of Lisbon) was derived from the Arabic &quot;&quot;al-hamma&quot;.

For a brief time, Lisbon was an independent Muslim kingdom known as the Taifa of Lisbon (1022–1094), before being conquered by the larger Taifa of Badajoz.

In 1108 Lisbon was raided and occupied by Norwegian crusaders led by Sigurd I on their way to the Holy Land as part of the Norwegian Crusade and occupied by crusader forces for three years. It was taken by the Moorish Almoravids in 1111.
In 1147, as part of Portuguese efforts during the so-called &quot;Reconquista&quot;, Afonso I of Portugal besieged and conquered Lisbon with the aid of crusader knights. The city, with around 154,000 residents at the time, was returned to Christian rule. The conquest of Portugal and re-establishment of Christianity is one of the most significant events in Lisbon&#x27;s history, described in the chronicle &quot;Expugnatione Lyxbonensi&quot;, which describes, among other incidents, how the local bishop was killed by the crusaders and the city&#x27;s residents prayed to the Virgin Mary as it happened. Some of the Muslim residents converted to Roman Catholicism and most of those who did not convert fled to other parts of the Islamic world, primarily Muslim Spain and North Africa. All mosques were either destroyed or altered and converted into churches. As a result of the end of Muslim rule in the mid-12th century, spoken Arabic quickly lost its place in Lisbon, and disappeared altogether.

With its central location, Lisbon became the capital city of the new Portuguese territory in 1255.
The first Portuguese university was founded in Lisbon in 1290 by King Denis I; for many years the &quot;Studium Generale&quot; (&quot;General Study&quot;) was transferred intermittently to Coimbra, where it was installed permanently in the 16th century as the University of Coimbra.

In 1384, the city was besieged by King Juan I of Castille, as a part of the ongoing 1383–1385 Crisis. The result of the siege was a victory for the Portuguese led by Nuno Álvares Pereira.

During the last centuries of the Middle Ages, Lisbon expanded substantially and became an important trading post with both Northern European and Mediterranean cities.

===Early Modern===
When the Spaniards expelled the Jews from Spanish territory, many of them fled to Lisbon. Although acknowledging the central importance of the Jews to the city&#x27;s prosperity, Manuel I decreed in 1497 that all Jews must convert to Christianity, only those who refused being forced to leave, but not before the expropriation of their property. In 1506, an anti-semitic movement among the Old Christians of Lisbon culminated in a massacre lasting four days in which some 1,000 to 4,000 New Christian men, women and children, converted descendants of Sephardic Jews, are estimated to have been killed. The king was at Évora when these events occurred, but angered when he received the news, he ordered an investigation which resulted in two of the instigating friars being excommunicated and burned alive.

Most of the Portuguese expeditions of the Age of Discovery set out from Lisbon during the period from the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century, including Vasco da Gama&#x27;s expedition to India in 1498. The following years of the 16th century began Lisbon&#x27;s golden era: the city was the European hub of commerce between Africa, India, the Far East and later, Brazil, and acquired great riches by exploiting the trade in spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods. This period saw the rise of the exuberant Manueline style in architecture, which left its mark in many 16th-century monuments (including Lisbon&#x27;s Belém Tower and Jerónimos Monastery, which were declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites). A description of Lisbon in the 16th century was written by Damião de Góis and published in 1554.

The succession crisis of 1580, initiated a sixty-year period of dual monarchy in Portugal and Spain under the Spanish Habsburgs. This is referred to as the &quot;Philippine Dominion&quot; (&quot;Domínio Filipino&quot;), since all three Spanish kings during that period were called Philip (&quot;Filipe&quot;). In 1589, Lisbon was the target of an incursion by the English Armada led by Francis Drake, while Queen Elizabeth supported a Portuguese pretender in Antonio, Prior of Crato, but support for Crato was lacking and the expedition was a failure. The Portuguese Restoration War, which began with a coup d&#x27;état organised by the nobility and bourgeoisie in Lisbon and executed on 1 December 1640, restored Portuguese independence. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare until the Treaty of Lisbon was signed in 1668.

In the early 18th century, gold from Brazil allowed King John V to sponsor the building of several Baroque churches and theatres in the city. Prior to the 18th century, Lisbon had experienced several significant earthquakes – eight in the 14th century, five in the 16th century (including the 1531 earthquake that destroyed 1,500 houses and the 1597 earthquake in which three streets vanished), and three in the 17th century.

On 1 November 1755, the city was destroyed by another devastating earthquake, which killed an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Lisbon residents of a population estimated at between 200,000 and 275,000, and destroyed 85 percent of the city&#x27;s structures. Among several important buildings of the city, the Ribeira Palace and the Hospital Real de Todos os Santos were lost. In coastal areas, such as Peniche, situated about north of Lisbon, many people were killed by the following tsunami.
By 1755, Lisbon was one of the largest cities in Europe; the catastrophic event shocked the whole of Europe and left a deep impression on its collective psyche. Voltaire wrote a long poem, &quot;Poême sur le désastre de Lisbonne&quot;, shortly after the quake, and mentioned it in his 1759 novel &quot;Candide&quot; (indeed, many argue that this critique of optimism was inspired by that earthquake). Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. also mentions it in his 1857 poem, &quot;The Deacon&#x27;s Masterpiece, or The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay&quot;.

After the 1755 earthquake, the city was rebuilt largely according to the plans of Prime Minister Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, the 1st Marquis of Pombal; the lower town began to be known as the &quot;Baixa Pombalina&quot; (Pombaline central district). Instead of rebuilding the medieval town, Pombal decided to demolish what remained after the earthquake and rebuild the city centre in accordance with principles of modern urban design. It was reconstructed in an open rectangular plan with two great squares: the &quot;Praça do Rossio&quot; and the &quot;Praça do Comércio&quot;. The first, the central commercial district, is the traditional gathering place of the city and the location of the older cafés, theatres and restaurants; the second became the city&#x27;s main access to the River Tagus and point of departure and arrival for seagoing vessels, adorned by a triumphal arch (1873) and a monument to King Joseph I.

===Modern era===
In the first years of the 19th century, Portugal was invaded by the troops of Napoléon Bonaparte, forcing Queen Maria I and Prince-Regent John (future John VI) to flee temporarily to Brazil. By the time the new King returned to Lisbon, many of the buildings and properties were pillaged, sacked or destroyed by the invaders.

During the 19th century, the Liberal movement introduced new changes into the urban landscape. The principal areas were in the &quot;Baixa&quot; and along the &quot;Chiado&quot; district, where shops, tobacconists shops, cafés, bookstores, clubs and theatres proliferated. The development of industry and commerce determined the growth of the city, seeing the transformation of the Passeio Público, a Pombaline era park, into the Avenida da Liberdade, as the city grew farther from the Tagus.

Lisbon was the site of the regicide of Carlos I of Portugal in 1908, an event which culminated two years later in the establishment of the First Republic.

The city refounded its university in 1911 after centuries of inactivity in Lisbon, incorporating reformed former colleges and other non-university higher education schools of the city (such as the &quot;Escola Politécnica&quot; – now &quot;Faculdade de Ciências&quot;). Today there are two public universities in the city (University of Lisbon and New University of Lisbon), a public university institute (ISCTE - Lisbon University Institute) and a polytechnic institute (IPL – Instituto Politécnico de Lisboa).

During World War II, Lisbon was one of the very few neutral, open European Atlantic ports, a major gateway for refugees to the U.S. and a haven for spies. More than 100,000 refugees were able to flee Nazi Germany via Lisbon.

During the Estado Novo regime (1926–1974), Lisbon, under the influence of Duarte Pacheco, the minister of works, was expanded at the cost of other districts within the country, resulting in nationalist and monumental projects. New residential and public developments were constructed; the zone of Belém was modified for the 1940 Portuguese Exhibition, while along the periphery new districts appeared to house the growing population. The inauguration of the bridge over the Tagus allowed a rapid connection between both sides of the river.

Lisbon was the site of three revolutions in the 20th century. The first, the 5 October 1910 revolution, brought an end to the Portuguese monarchy and established the highly unstable and corrupt Portuguese First Republic. The 6 June 1926 revolution ended the first republic and firmly established the Estado Novo, or the Portuguese Second Republic, as the ruling regime.

===Contemporary===
The Carnation Revolution, which took place on 25 April 1974, ended the right-wing Estado Novo regime and reformed the country to become as it is today, the Portuguese Third Republic.

In the 1990s, many of the districts were renovated and projects in the historic quarters were established to modernise those areas, for instance, architectural and patrimonial buildings were renovated, the northern margin of the Tagus was re-purposed for leisure and residential use, the Vasco da Gama Bridge was constructed and the eastern part of the municipality was re-purposed for Expo &#x27;98 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama&#x27;s sea voyage to India, a voyage that would bring immense riches to Lisbon and cause many of Lisbon&#x27;s landmarks to be built.

In 1988, a fire in the historical district of Chiado saw the destruction of many 18th-century Pombaline style buildings. A series of restoration works has brought the area back to its former self and made it a high-scale shopping district.

The Lisbon Agenda was a European Union agreement on measures to revitalise the EU economy, signed in Lisbon in March 2000. In October 2007 Lisbon hosted the 2007 EU Summit, where an agreement was reached regarding a new EU governance model. The resulting Treaty of Lisbon was signed on 13 December 2007 and came into force on 1 December 2009.

Lisbon has been the site for many international events and programmes. In 1994, Lisbon was the European Capital of Culture. On 3 November 2005, Lisbon hosted the MTV European Music Awards. On 7 July 2007, Lisbon held the ceremony of the &quot;New 7 Wonders Of The World&quot; election, in the Luz Stadium, with live transmission for millions of people all over the world. Every two years, Lisbon hosts the Rock in Rio Lisboa Music Festival, one of the largest in the world. Lisbon hosted the NATO summit (19–20 November 2010), a summit meeting that is regarded as a periodic opportunity for Heads of State and Heads of Government of NATO member states to evaluate and provide strategic direction for Alliance activities. The city hosts the Web Summit and is the head office for the Group of Seven Plus (G7+). In 2018 it hosted the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time as well as the Michelin Gala. On 11 July 2018, the Aga Khan officially chose the Henrique de Mendonça Palace, located on Rua Marquês de Fronteira, as the &quot;Divan&quot;, or seat, of the global Nizari Muslim Imamate. Lisbon hosted World Youth Day 2023 in August of that year, attracting Catholic youth from the around the world. Pope Francis led several events, with the final mass held in the city&#x27;s Parque do Tejo having an estimated 1.5 million attendees.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Lisbon is located at , situated at the mouth of the Tagus River and is the westernmost capital of a mainland European country. The river delta is inverted.

The westernmost part of Lisbon is occupied by the Monsanto Forest Park, a urban park, one of the largest in Europe, and occupying 10% of the municipality.

The city occupies an area of , and its city boundaries, unlike those of most major cities, coincide with those of the municipality. The rest of the urbanised area of the Lisbon urban area, known generically as Greater Lisbon () includes several administratively defined cities and municipalities, in the north bank of the Tagus River. The larger Lisbon metropolitan area includes the Setúbal Peninsula to the south.

===Climate===

Lisbon has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), characterized by cool, rainy winters and warm to hot, dry summers. The average annual temperature is , with average daily highs of and lows of .

In the coldest month, January, daytime highs typically range from , while nighttime lows range from , with an average sea temperature of . In the warmest month, August, daytime highs typically range from , nighttime lows range from , and the average sea temperature is around .

The climate of Lisbon is moderate, largely due to its location in southwestern Europe, its proximity to the Azores High and the Atlantic Ocean, and, locally, the influence of the urban heat island effect. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Lisbon was in February 1956, while the highest temperature ever recorded was on 4 August 2018. 

Lisbon receives around of precipitation annually, with the majority falling during the autumn and winter months. November and December are the wettest months, contributing to a third of the total annual rainfall. The dry season typically lasts from early June to mid-September, with July and August being the driest months. During this period, there are typically around 8 days with measurable precipitation.

The city has around 2,875 hours of sunshine per year, one of the highest amounts in Europe. August is the sunniest month, with sunshine occurring for approximately 80% of the daytime, while December is the dullest, with sunshine occurring only 51% of the time.

Temperatures across Lisbon&#x27;s metropolitan area can vary significantly, especially during the summer months. In areas with greater exposure to the Atlantic Ocean, such as Sintra or Cascais to the west of the city, temperatures tend to be more moderate and are generally cooler. In extreme cases, summer daytime highs can differ by as much as 20°C (36°F) between the city of Lisbon and Cabo da Roca.

===Freguesias===
The municipality of Lisbon included 53 &quot;freguesias&quot; until November 2012. A new law (&quot;Lei n.º 56/2012&quot;) reduced the number of &quot;freguesias&quot; to the following 24:
* Ajuda
* Alcântara
* Alvalade
* Areeiro
* Arroios
* Avenidas Novas
* Beato
* Belém

===Neighborhoods===
Locally, Lisbon&#x27;s inhabitants may commonly refer to the spaces of Lisbon in terms of historic &quot;Bairros de Lisboa&quot; (neighbourhoods). These communities have no clearly defined boundaries and represent distinctive quarters of the city that have in common a historical culture, similar living standards, and identifiable architectural landmarks, as exemplified by the &quot;Bairro Alto&quot;, &quot;Alfama&quot;, &quot;Chiado&quot;, and so forth.

====Alcântara====


Alcântara is situated along the northern bank of the Tagus River, between the parishes of Belém to the west and Estrela to the east. Its proximity to both the city centre and the riverside makes it a well-connected and popular area for both locals and tourists. Although today it is quite central, it was once a mere suburb of Lisbon, comprising mostly farms and country estates of the nobility with their palaces. Amongst the palaces found in the neighbourhood the most notable are:
* Palácio da Ega (16th century), now hosting the Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino
* Palácio Condes da Ribeira Grande (18th century), now hosting the MACAM museum and an hotel
* Palácio Burnay (18th century), now in the process of being restored so as to house a state-owned enterprise focused on culture
* Palacete do Conde de Burnay (19th century), now housing a public library (biblioteca de Alcântara)
* Palácio Vale-Flor (20th century), nowadays a restaurant and an hotel

In the 16th century, there was a brook there which the nobles used to promenade in their boats.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Alcântara became a popular industrial area, with many small factories and warehouses and docks along the waterfront. The presence of these industries attracted many working-class families.
By the mid-20th century, the area had experienced some decline as industries closed down. However, since the late 20th century, Alcântara has seen revitalisation, with many of the old factories repurposed into trendy spaces such as art galleries, nightclubs, and creative hubs. In the early 1990s, Alcântara began to attract youth because of the number of pubs and discothèques. This was mainly due to its outer area of mostly commercial buildings, which acted as barriers to the noise-generating nightlife (which acted as a buffer to the residential communities surrounding it). In the meantime, some of these areas began to become gentrified, attracting loft developments and new flats, which have profited from its river views and central location.

Alcântara has emerged as one of Lisbon&#x27;s most dynamic areas for nightlife and culture. The riverfront of Alcântara is known for its nightclubs and bars. The area is commonly known as &quot;docas&quot; (docks), since most of the clubs and bars are housed in converted dock warehouses.

Key places of interest/cultural landmarks in the neighbourhood include:
* LX Factory: A cultural and creative complex housed in a former industrial site now home to cafes, restaurants, co-working spaces, shops, and art installations. LX Factory frequently hosts markets, exhibitions, and live performances
* Village Underground: An innovative cultural space made of recycled shipping containers and old buses, used as offices, restaurants, and even a stage for performances. It exemplifies the creative reuse of industrial spaces in Alcântara.
* Museums: Many museums can be found in Alcantara, including the &quot;Museu de Macau&quot; (Macau Museum), &quot;Museu da Carris&quot; (Carris - Public transportation museum), the &quot;B-Mad museum&quot; (Berardo - Museum Art Deco) and the set-to-open in 2024 MACAM (Armando Martins Museum of Contemporary Art)
* Pilar 7: situated within one of the massive support pillars of the 25 de Abril Bridge. It was created to offer visitors a closer look at the bridge&#x27;s architectural and engineering marvel, providing access to areas of the bridge that would otherwise be off-limits. The main focus is on the structural aspects and construction of the bridge, but it also incorporates interactive exhibits and a viewpoint.

The neighbourhood is also noticeable for hosting the &quot;Lisbon Congress Centre&quot; (Centro de congressos de Lisboa), the Lisbon Metropolitan Orchestra (Orquestra Metropolitana de Lisboa) and the Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino.

====Alfama====

Alfama, the oldest district of Lisbon, spreads down the southern slope from the Castle of São Jorge to the River Tagus. Its name, derived from the Arabic &quot;Al-hamma&quot;, means fountains or baths. During the Islamic invasion of Iberia, the Alfama constituted the largest part of the city, extending west to the Baixa neighbourhood. Increasingly, the Alfama became inhabited by fishermen and the poor: its fame as a poor neighbourhood continues to this day. Many of the buildings date back to the 18th century, showcasing traditional Portuguese architecture, complete with colorful tiled facades and wrought-iron balconies. While the 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused considerable damage throughout the capital, the Alfama was largely spared and survived with little damage, thanks to its compact labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares.

This historic district has retained much of its original character. It is a historical quarter of mixed-use buildings occupied by Fado bars, restaurants, and homes with small shops downstairs. Fado, the typically Portuguese style of melancholy music, is common (but not obligatory) in the restaurants of the district.

Modernising trends have invigorated the district: old houses have been re-purposed or remodelled, while new buildings have been constructed.

Alfama hosts several events throughout the year, including the popular Festas de Santo António, where locals celebrate with street parties, music, and food. This vibrant atmosphere showcases the community&#x27;s spirit and connection to its cultural roots.

Key places of interest/cultural landmarks in the neighbourhood include:
* São Jorge Castle: historic castle which has been continuously occupied for the last 3,000 years
* Miradouros: Amongst the most emblematic viewpoints there are Miradouro de Santa Luzia (where the Igreja de Santa Luzia e de São Brás stands) and the Miradouro das Portas do Sol.
* Museums: Many museums can be found in Alfama, including the &quot;Museu de Santo António&quot; (Saint Anthony Museum), &quot;Museu do Aljube - Resistência e Liberdade&quot; (Aljube - Estado Novo dictatorship museum), the &quot;Museu do Teatro Romano&quot; (Roman Theatre Museum), the &quot;Fundação José Saramago&quot; (José Saramago Foundation) and the &quot;Museu de Artes Decorativas Portuguesas&quot; (Museum of Portuguese Decorative Arts)

====Mouraria====
The Mouraria, or Moorish quarter, is one of the most traditional neighbourhoods of Lisbon, although most of its old buildings were demolished by the Estado Novo between the 1930s and the 1970s. It takes its name from the fact that after the reconquest of Lisbon, the Muslims who remained were confined to this part of the city. In turn, the Jews were confined to three neighbourhoods called &quot;Judiarias&quot;.

====Bairro Alto====


Bairro Alto (literally &quot;the upper quarter&quot; in Portuguese) is an area of central Lisbon that functions as a residential, shopping and entertainment district; it is the center of the Portuguese capital&#x27;s nightlife, attracting hipster youth and members of various music subcultures. Lisbon&#x27;s punk, gay, metal, goth, hip hop and reggae scenes all find a home in the &quot;Bairro&quot; with its many clubs and bars that cater to them. The crowds in the Bairro Alto are a multicultural mix of people representing a broad cross-section of modern Portuguese society, many of them being entertainment seekers and devotees of various music genres outside the mainstream, Fado, Portugal&#x27;s national music, still survives in the midst of the new nightlife.

====Baixa====

The heart of the city is the &quot;Baixa&quot; or city centre; the Pombaline Baixa is an elegant district, primarily constructed after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, taking its name from its benefactor, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, who was the minister of Joseph I of Portugal (1750–1777) and a key figure during the Portuguese Enlightenment. Following the 1755 disaster, Pombal took the lead in rebuilding Lisbon, imposing strict conditions and guidelines on the construction of the city, and transforming the organic street plan that characterised the district before the earthquake into its current grid pattern. As a result, the Pombaline Baixa is one of the first examples of earthquake-resistant construction. Architectural models were tested by having troops march around them to simulate an earthquake. Notable features of Pombaline structures include the Pombaline cage, a symmetrical wood-lattice framework aimed at distributing earthquake forces, and inter-terrace walls that were built higher than roof timbers to inhibit the spread of fires.

====Beato====
The parish of Beato stands out for the new cultural dynamics it has been experiencing in recent years. The manufacturing districts and the industrial facilities by the riverside docks are the place of choice for contemporary art galleries, iconic bars, and gourmet restaurants that simmer in the streets. This reality has not gone unnoticed by the national press, and Visão, TimeOut, or Jornal de Negócios have already made notice of this parish that hides treasures such as the National Museum of the Azulejo or the Palacio do Grilo.

====Belém====
Belém is famous as the place from which many of the great Portuguese explorers set off on their voyages of discovery. In particular, it is the place from which Vasco da Gama departed for India in 1497 and Pedro Álvares Cabral departed for Brazil in 1499. It is also a former royal residence and features the 17th – 18th-century Belém Palace, a former royal residence now occupied by the President of Portugal, and the Ajuda Palace, begun in 1802 but never completed.

Perhaps Belém&#x27;s most famous feature is its tower, Torre de Belém, whose image is much used by Lisbon&#x27;s tourist board. The tower was built as a fortified lighthouse late in the reign of Dom Manuel l (1515–1520) to guard the entrance to the port. It stood on a little island on the right side of the Tagus, surrounded by water. Belém&#x27;s other major historical building is the &quot;Mosteiro dos Jerónimos&quot; (Jerónimos Monastery), which the Torre de Belém was built partly to defend. Belém&#x27;s most notable modern feature is the Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries) built for the Portuguese World Fair in 1940. In the heart of Belém is the &quot;Praça do Império&quot;: gardens centred upon a large fountain, laid out during World War II. To the west of the gardens lies the &quot;Centro Cultural de Belém&quot;. Belém is one of the most visited Lisbon districts. Here is located the Estádio do Restelo, home to Belenenses.

====Chiado====

The Chiado is a traditional shopping area that mixes old and modern commercial establishments, concentrated specially in the Rua do Carmo and the Rua Garrett. Locals as well as tourists visit the Chiado to buy books, clothing and pottery as well as to have a cup of coffee. The most famous café of Chiado is &quot;A Brasileira&quot;, famous for having had poet Fernando Pessoa among its customers. The Chiado is also an important cultural area, with several museums and theatres, including the opera. Several buildings of the Chiado were destroyed in a fire in 1988, an event that deeply shocked the country. Thanks to a renovation project that lasted more than 10 years, coordinated by celebrated architect Siza Vieira, the affected area has now virtually recovered.

====Estrela====

The ornate, late 18th-century Estrela Basilica is the main attraction of this district. The church with its large dome is located on a hill in what was at the time the western part of Lisbon and can be seen from great distances. The style is similar to that of the Mafra National Palace, late baroque and neoclassical. The façade has twin bell towers and includes statues of saints and some allegorical figures. São Bento Palace, the seat of the Portuguese parliament and the official residences of the Prime Minister of Portugal and the President of the Assembly of the Republic of Portugal, are in this district. Also in this district is Estrela Park, a favorite with families. There are exotic plants and trees, a duck pond, various sculptures, a children&#x27;s playground, and many cultural events going on throughout the year, including outdoor cinema, markets, and music festivals.

====Parque das Nações====

Parque das Nações (Park of Nations) is the newest district in Lisbon; it emerged from an urban renewal program to host the 1998 World Exhibition of Lisbon, also known as Expo&#x27;98. The area suffered massive changes giving Parque das Nações a futuristic look. A long-lasting legacy of the same, the area has become another commercial and higher-end residential area for the city.

Central in the area is the Gare do Oriente (Orient railway station), one of the main transport hubs of Lisbon for trains, buses, taxis, and the metro. Its glass and steel columns are inspired by Gothic architecture, lending the whole structure a visual fascination (especially in sunlight or when illuminated at night). It was designed by the architect Santiago Calatrava from Valencia, Spain. The Parque das Nações is across the street.

The area is pedestrian-friendly with new buildings, restaurants, gardens, the Casino Lisbon, the FIL building (International Exhibition and Fair), the Camões Theatre and the &quot;Oceanário de Lisboa&quot; (Lisbon Oceanarium), which is the second-largest in the world. The district&#x27;s Altice Arena has become Lisbon&#x27;s &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; performance arena. With seating for 20,000, it has staged events ranging from concerts to basketball tournaments.

==Politics==


Carlos Moedas (PSD) took office as the 78th and current Mayor of Lisbon on 18 October 2021, following the 2021 local elections.

===Local election results 1976–2021===
==Culture==


The city of Lisbon is rich in architecture; Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline, Baroque, Modern and Postmodern constructions can be found all over Lisbon. The city is also crossed by historical boulevards and monuments along the main thoroughfares, particularly in the upper districts; notable among these are the &quot;Avenida da Liberdade&quot; (Avenue of Liberty), &quot;Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo&quot;, &quot;Avenida Almirante Reis&quot; and &quot;Avenida da República&quot; (Avenue of the Republic).

Lisbon is home to numerous prominent museums and art collections, from all around the world. The National Museum of Ancient Art, which has one of the largest art collections in the world, and the National Coach Museum, which has the world&#x27;s largest collection of royal coaches and carriages, are the two most visited museums in the city. Other notable national museums include the National Museum of Archaeology, the Museum of Lisbon, the National Azulejo Museum, the National Museum of Contemporary Art, and the National Museum of Natural History &amp; Science.
Prominent private museums and galleries include the Gulbenkian Museum (run by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, one of the wealthiest foundations in the world), which houses one of the largest private collections of antiquities and art in the world, the Contemporary Art Museum - Centro Cultural de Belém, the Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology, and the Museum of the Orient. Other popular museums include the Electricity Museum, the Ephemeral Museum, the Museu da Água, and the Museu Benfica, among many others.

Lisbon&#x27;s Opera House, the &quot;Teatro Nacional de São Carlos&quot;, hosts a relatively active cultural agenda, mainly in autumn and winter. Other important theatres and musical houses are the &quot;Centro Cultural de Belém&quot;, the &quot;Teatro Nacional D. Maria II&quot;, the Gulbenkian Foundation, and the &quot;Teatro Camões&quot;.

The monument to &quot;Christ the King&quot; (Cristo-Rei) stands on the southern bank of the Tagus River, in Almada. With open arms, overlooking the whole city, it resembles the Corcovado monument in Rio de Janeiro, and was built after World War II, as a memorial of thanksgiving for Portugal&#x27;s being spared the horrors and destruction of the war.
13 June is Lisbon&#x27;s holiday in honour of the city&#x27;s saint, Anthony of Lisbon (). Saint Anthony, also known as &quot;Saint Anthony of Padua&quot;, was a wealthy Portuguese bohemian who was canonised and made Doctor of the Church after a life preaching to the poor. Although Lisbon&#x27;s patron saint is Saint Vincent of Saragossa, whose remains are housed in the Sé Cathedral, there are no festivities associated with this saint.

Eduardo VII Park, the second-largest park in the city following the &quot;Parque Florestal de Monsanto&quot; (Monsanto Forest Park), extends down the main avenue (Avenida da Liberdade), with many flowering plants and green spaces, that includes the permanent collection of subtropical and tropical plants in the winter garden (). Originally named &quot;Parque da Liberdade&quot;, it was renamed in honour of Edward VII who visited Lisbon in 1903.
Lisbon is home every year to the Lisbon Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival, the Lisboarte, the DocLisboa – Lisbon International Documentary Film Festival, the Festival Internacional de Máscaras e Comediantes, the Lisboa Mágica – Street Magic World Festival, the Monstra – Animated Film Festival, the Lisbon Book Fair, the Peixe em Lisboa – Lisbon Fish and Flavours, and many others.

Lisbon has two sites listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site: Belém Tower and Jerónimos Monastery. Furthermore, in 1994, Lisbon was the European Capital of Culture and, in 1998, organised the Expo &#x27;98 (&quot;1998 Lisbon World Exposition&quot;).

Lisbon is also home to the Lisbon Architecture Triennial, the Moda Lisboa (Fashion Lisbon), ExperimentaDesign – Biennial of Design, and LuzBoa – Biennial of Light.

Lisbon hosts many fine examples of Portuguese azulejo tile art, a use of ceramic tile as an architectural finish for both building interiors and exteriors dating from the 15th Century. This art form is celebrated in Lisbon&#x27;s National Museum of the Azulejo and as a station feature in the Lisbon metro. In addition, the mosaic Portuguese pavement (&quot;Calçada Portuguesa&quot;) was born in Lisbon, in the mid-1800s. The art has since spread to the rest of the Portuguese Speaking world. The city remains one of the most expansive examples of the technique, nearly all walkways and even many streets being created and maintained in this style.

In May 2018, the city hosted the 63rd edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, after the victory of Salvador Sobral with the song &quot;Amar pelos dois&quot; in Kyiv on 13 May 2017.

World Youth Day 2023 was hosted in August of that year in Lisbon, attracting hundreds of thousands of young Catholics from over 140 countries.

==Demographics==

The historical population of the city was around 35,000 in 1300 . This number went up to 60,000 in 1400, and raised to 70,000 by 1500. Between 1528 and 1590 the population went from 70,000 to 120,000. The population was about 150,000 in 1600, and almost 200,000 in 1700.

Lisbon has 567,131 inhabitants within the administrative center on the area of only 100.05 km2 The population density of the city itself is .

The Lisbon metropolitan area incorporates two NUTS III (European statistical subdivisions): &quot;Grande Lisboa&quot; (Greater Lisbon), along the northern bank of the Tagus River, and &quot;Península de Setúbal&quot; (Setúbal Peninsula), along the southern bank. These two subdivisions make for the &quot;Região de Lisboa&quot; (Lisbon Region).

Administratively defined cities that exist in the vicinity of the capital are in fact part of the metropolitan perimeter of Lisbon. The urban area has, according to Government data, a population of approximately 2.96 million inhabitants and is the eleventh largest urban area in the European Union. Other sources also show similar figures: according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development the area had 2,797,612 inhabitants; according to the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations 2,890,000; according to the European Statistical Office Eurostat 2,839,908 and according to the Brookings Institution 2,968,600.

Lisbon&#x27;s population has steadily dropped over the years due to people searching better accommodations for lower prices elsewhere in Greater Lisbon. A reverse trend has been observed in recent years, with the population increasing to 567,131 people in 2023, an all-time high since 2001 census and a 4.52% increase since the 2011 census.

In addition, a plurality of the houses in the city centre have become tourist facilities, exacerbating the lack of offer in Lisbon&#x27;s housing market.

===Religion===
The largest religion is, according to 2021 Portuguese Census, Roman Catholicism. The proportion of Catholics in Lisbon city proper (around 66%) is significantly higher than in the city&#x27;s metropolitan area (55%). This may due to the fact that Lisbon city&#x27;s age structure is older than the one found in the surrounding areas and, in general, younger generations tend to be less religious.

===Immigration===

In 2019 around 17.48% of the population residing within the city&#x27;s boundaries held a foreign nationality, a share that stood at 8.87% in 2014. In general, the increase in Lisbon&#x27;s population is essentially attributable to the influx of people coming from abroad, who have more than tripled since 2017. Around 5.89% of Lisbon&#x27;s population was constituted by Brazilians as of 2023, not including those also holding Portuguese nationality.
==Economy==

The Lisbon region is the wealthiest region in Portugal, with a GDP per capita of nearly €40,000, and it is well above the European Union&#x27;s GDP per capita average – it produces more than 31% of Portuguese GDP by 2023.

The Lisbon region is rapidly growing, with GDP (PPP) per capita calculated for each year as follows: €22,745 (2004) – €23,816 (2005) – €25,200 (2006) – €26,100 (2007). The Lisbon metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $110.4 billion, and $32,434 per capita.

Lisbon&#x27;s economy is based primarily on the tertiary sector. Most of the headquarters of multinationals operating in Portugal are concentrated in the Grande Lisboa Subregion, especially in the Oeiras municipality. The Lisbon metropolitan area is heavily industrialized, especially the south bank of the Tagus river (Rio Tejo). The lisbonite industry has very large sectors in oil, as refineries are found just across the Tagus, textile mills, shipyards and fishing.
The country&#x27;s chief seaport, featuring one of the largest and most sophisticated regional markets on the Iberian Peninsula, Lisbon and its heavily populated surroundings are also developing as an important financial centre and a dynamic technological hub. Automobile manufacturers have erected factories in the suburbs, for example, AutoEuropa.

Lisbon has the largest and most developed mass media sector of Portugal and is home to several related companies ranging from leading television networks and radio stations to major newspapers. Based in Lisbon, Euronext Lisbon is a stock exchange which is part of the pan-European Euronext system of stock exchanges and market infrastructure.

Before Portugal&#x27;s sovereign debt crisis and an EU-IMF rescue plan, for the decade of 2010 Lisbon was expecting to receive many state-funded investments, including building a new airport, a new bridge, an expansion of the Lisbon Metro underground, the construction of a mega-hospital (or central hospital), the creation of two lines of a TGV to join Madrid, Porto, Vigo and the rest of Europe, the restoration of the main part of the town (between the Marquês de Pombal roundabout and Terreiro do Paço), the creation of a large number of bike lanes, as well as modernization and renovation of various facilities.

The sovereign debt crisis exacerbated poor labor conditions and low purchasing power. Although the city modernized its infrastructure and experienced significant tourism growth and income, this reality was not proportionally reflected in the average living conditions. Prices generally increased, but wages did not follow this trend. Labor conditions remain far below the standards of the rest of the European Union (EU).

Therefore, Lisbon is still the European capital with some of the lowest wages and purchasing power within the EU. Energy, electricity, gas, and fuel, as well as supermarkets and housing, are among the most expensive, even compared to the richest countries in Europe. The gap between the highest and lowest wages is the largest within the eurozone. The minimum wage can be as low as 6-7 euros per hour. Due to these reasons, Lisbon has a high level of youth emigration, mostly to other European countries such as France, the UK, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Belgium.

Lisbon was the 7th most &quot;livable city&quot; in the world in 2021 according to lifestyle magazine &quot;Monocle.&quot;

Tourism is also a significant industry. The city is the ninth-most-visited city in Southern Europe, after Istanbul, Rome, Barcelona, Milan, Athens, Venice, Madrid and Florence with 3,639,900 tourists in 2019. In 2022 there were around 6 tourists for every resident. The city is popular for both leisure and business tourism. Around 7.7 million tourists visited Lisbon region in 2022 alone, with 71.1% of them being international tourists. It is estimated that tourist receipts will stand at 17.4 billion euros (€) in 2023.

==Transport==

===Metro===

The Lisbon Metro connects the city centre with the upper and eastern districts, and also reaches some suburbs that are part of the Lisbon metropolitan area, such as Amadora and Loures. It is the fastest way to get around the city and it provides a good number of interchanging stations with other types of transportation. From the Lisbon Airport station to the city centre it may take roughly 25 mins. In 2019, the Lisbon Metro served around 173 million passengers (and 475.000 daily). As of 2018, the Lisbon Metro comprises four lines, identified by individual colours (blue, yellow, green and red) and 56 stations, with a total length of 44.2 km. Several expansion projects have been proposed, the most recent being the transformation of the Green Line into a circular line and the creation of two more stations (Santos and Estrela).

===Trams===

The tram is a traditional form of public transport in Lisbon. Introduced in 1901, electric trams were originally imported from the US, and thus called the &quot;americanos&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;American&quot;). Today these trams are called &quot;elétricos&quot; (literally meaning electric ones).

Other than on the modern Line 15, the Lisbon tramway system still employs small (four-wheel) vehicles of a design dating from the early twentieth century. These distinctive yellow trams are one of the tourist icons of modern Lisbon, and their size is well suited to the steep hills and narrow streets of the central city.

The earliest trams can still be seen in the Museu da Carris (the Lisbon Public Transport Museum).

The line has now a total length of 31 kilometers operating on 6 lines, down from a maximum of 76 kilometers for 27 lines. The slow decline of the network began with the construction of the Lisbon Metro and the expansion of the bus system. Starting in 2017 the system has been expanded and new vehicles are being progressively added, aiming at expanding significantly the current tramway system. There are currently 64 trams in operation in Lisbon and, during 2023-2026, 35 more will be added (Of which 10 will be &quot;Historical models&quot;).

===Trains===
There are four commuter train lines departing from Lisbon: the Sintra, Azambuja, Cascais and Sado lines (operated by CP – Comboios de Portugal), as well as a fifth line to Setúbal (operated by Fertagus), which crosses the Tagus river via the 25 de Abril Bridge. The major railway stations are Santa Apolónia, Rossio, Gare do Oriente, Entrecampos, and Cais do Sodré.

===Buses===
The local bus service within Lisbon is operated by Carris. Carris&#x27; fleet includes 741 buses and, in the period 2023-2026, other 342 buses will be added so as to increase the public transportation system reach. The bus network has a length of 748 km comprising 99 bus routes. Major investments have been made in recent years: for instance, in 2017 there were 600 buses operating on 674 km and 75 routes: 141 buses, 74 kilometers and 24 bus routes were added in 2018-2022.

Outside Lisbon, there are two main commuter bus services connecting the cities outside Lisbon amongst them and to Lisbon: Carris Metropolitana, a brand operated by 4 companies, all operating inside the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, and Barraqueiro Transportes (with 4 brands operating outside the Metropolitan Area with services to Lisbon), which operate from different terminals in the city.

===Bridges===
The city is connected to the far side of the Tagus by two important bridges:
* The 25 de Abril Bridge, inaugurated (as Ponte Salazar) on 6 August 1966, and later renamed after the date of the Carnation Revolution, was the longest suspension bridge in Europe.
* The Vasco da Gama Bridge, opened on 29 March 1998 is, at , the longest bridge in Europe.

The foundations for a third bridge across the Tagus have already been laid, but the overall project has been postponed due to economic crisis that affected Portugal, and other bureaucratic and political reasons.

=== Ferries ===
Another way of crossing the river is by taking the ferry. The operator Transtejo &amp; Soflusa, runs to different locations from within the city: Cacilhas, Seixal, Montijo, Porto Brandão and Trafaria under the brand Transtejo and to Barreiro under the brand Soflusa. Ferry stations in Lisbon include Belém Station, Terreiro do Paço River Station and Cais do Sodré River Station.

===Air travel===

Humberto Delgado Airport is located within the city limits.

It is the headquarters and hub for TAP Portugal as well as a hub for EasyJet, Azores Airlines, Ryanair, EuroAtlantic Airways, White Airways, and Hi Fly. Having served 35.1 million passengers in 2024, it is by far the busiest airport in Portugal, the third busiest in the Iberian Peninsula and the 12th busiest in Europe.

A second airport has been proposed and the project was initially put on hold because of the Portuguese and European economic crisis, and also because of the long discussion on whether a new airport is needed. In 2023 there were still 9 possible sites who are thought to be able to host the future New Lisbon airport. Finally, in 2024, the new government announced that the new international airport would be located in Alcochete, just across the Tagus from Lisbon.

Cascais Municipal Aerodrome, 20 km West of the city centre and hub for Sevenair, in Cascais, offers commercial domestic flights to Bragança, Portimão, Viseu and Vila Real. This location is where many of the country&#x27;s aviation schools are concentrated.

===Cycling===

Following the Covid-19 pandemic, Lisbon has seen a significant increase in cycling and plans to expand the current Gira bike hire system from 1,600 bikes to 2,600 by the end of 2023. Many of these bicycles are electric to deal with Lisbon&#x27;s hills. The city also plans to expand the number of bike recharging stations, now standing at 146. Gira service is integrated in the public transportation system, as youth up to 23 years old and seniors over 65 years old can use the service for free, while for other residents bikes are included in the Navegante card.

In 2023 there were over 200 kilometers of bike lanes within the city&#x27;s administrative area and the city plans to expand its network of cycle paths in the next years.

===Public transportation statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Lisbon, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 59 min. 11.5% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 23.1% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 6 km, while 10% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

=== Car ===
Lisbon is connected to its suburbs and throughout Portugal by an extensive motorway network. There are three circular motorways around the city; the 2ª Circular, the IC17 (CRIL), and the A9 (CREL).

===Higher education===
In the city, there are three public universities and a university institute. The University of Lisbon, which is the largest university in Portugal, was created in 2013 with the union of the Technical University of Lisbon and the Classical University of Lisbon (which was known as the University of Lisbon).

<text>The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way, where Earth is located. It has a total diameter of roughly , and a total mass of the order of .
It consists of two collections of galaxies in a &quot;dumbbell&quot; shape; the Milky Way and its satellites form one lobe, and the Andromeda Galaxy and its satellites constitute the other. The two collections are separated by about and are moving toward one another with a velocity of . The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster.
The exact number of galaxies in the Local Group is unknown as some are occluded by the Milky Way; however, at least 80 members are known, most of which are dwarf galaxies.

The two largest members, the Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxies, are both spiral galaxies with masses of about solar masses each. Each has its own system of satellite galaxies:
* The Andromeda Galaxy&#x27;s satellite system consists of Messier 32 (M32), Messier 110 (M110), NGC 147, NGC 185, Andromeda I (And I), And II, And III, And V, And VI (also known as the Pegasus Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, or Pegasus dSph), And VII (a.k.a. the Cassiopeia Dwarf Galaxy), And VIII, And IX, And X, And XI, And XIX, And XXI and And XXII, plus several additional ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
* The Milky Way&#x27;s satellite galaxies system comprises the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy (disputed, considered by some not a galaxy), Ursa Minor Dwarf Galaxy, Draco Dwarf Galaxy, Carina Dwarf Galaxy, Sextans Dwarf Galaxy, Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy, Fornax Dwarf Galaxy, Leo I (a dwarf galaxy), Leo II (a dwarf galaxy), Ursa Major I Dwarf Galaxy and Ursa Major II Dwarf Galaxy, plus several additional ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is the third-largest member of the Local Group, with a mass of approximately , and is the third spiral galaxy. It is unclear whether the Triangulum Galaxy is a companion of the Andromeda Galaxy; the two galaxies are 750,000 light years apart, and experienced a close passage 2–4 billion years ago which triggered star formation across Andromeda&#x27;s disk. The Pisces Dwarf Galaxy is equidistant from the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, so it may be a satellite of either.

The other members of the group are likely gravitationally secluded from these large subgroups: IC 10, IC 1613, Phoenix Dwarf Galaxy, Leo A, Tucana Dwarf Galaxy, Cetus Dwarf Galaxy, Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy, Wolf–Lundmark–Melotte, Aquarius Dwarf Galaxy, and Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy.

The membership of NGC 3109, with its companions Sextans A and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy as well as Sextans B, Leo P, Antlia B and possibly Leo A, is uncertain due to extreme distances from the center of the Local Group. The Antlia-Sextans Group is unlikely to be gravitationally bound to the Local Group due to probably lying outside the Local Group&#x27;s Zero-velocity surface—which would make it a true galaxy group of its own rather than a subgroup within the Local Group. This possible independence may, however, disappear as the Milky Way continues coalescing with Andromeda due to the increased mass, and density thereof, plausibly widening the radius of the zero-velocity surface of the Local Group. 

== History ==

The term &quot;The Local Group&quot; was introduced by Edwin Hubble in Chapter VI of his 1936 book &quot;The Realm of the Nebulae&quot;. There, he described it as &quot;a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field&quot; and delineated, by decreasing luminosity, its members to be M31, Milky Way, M33, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, M32, NGC 205, NGC 6822, NGC 185, IC 1613 and NGC 147. He also identified IC 10 as a possible part of the Local Group.

* Magellanic Stream, a stream of gas being stripped off the Magellanic Clouds due to their interaction with the Milky Way
* Monoceros Ring, a ring of stars around the Milky Way that is proposed to consist of a stellar stream torn from the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy
* Virgo Strem, a steam formed from a dwarf galaxy.
* Helni Stream

== Future ==
The galaxies of the Local Group are likely to merge together under their own mutual gravitational attractions over a timescale of tens of billions of years into a single elliptical galaxy, with the coalescence of Andromeda and the Milky Way being the predominant event in this process.

<text>The litre (Commonwealth spelling) or liter (American spelling) (SI symbols L and l, other symbol used: ℓ) is a metric unit of volume. It is equal to 1 cubic decimetre (dm3), 1000 cubic centimetres (cm3) or 0.001 cubic metres (m3). A cubic decimetre (or litre) occupies a volume of (see figure) and is thus equal to one-thousandth of a cubic metre.

The original French metric system used the litre as a base unit. The word &quot;litre&quot; is derived from an older French unit, the &quot;litron&quot;, whose name came from Byzantine Greek—where it was a unit of weight, not volume—via Late Medieval Latin, and which equalled approximately 0.831 litres. The litre was also used in several subsequent versions of the metric system and is accepted for use with the SI, although not an SI unit—the SI unit of volume is the cubic metre (m3). The spelling used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures is &quot;litre&quot;, a spelling which is shared by most English-speaking countries. The spelling &quot;liter&quot; is predominantly used in American English.

One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram, because the kilogram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice (). Subsequent redefinitions of the metre and kilogram mean that this relationship is no longer exact.

==Definition==
A litre is a cubic decimetre, which is the volume of a cube 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres × 10 centimetres (1 L ≡ 1 dm3 ≡ 1000 cm3). Hence 1 L ≡ 0.001 m3 ≡ 1000 cm3; and 1 m3 (i.e. a cubic metre, which is the SI unit for volume) is exactly 1000 L.

From 1901 to 1964, the litre was defined as the volume of one kilogram of pure water at maximum density (+3.98 °C) and standard pressure. The kilogram was in turn specified as the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (a specific platinum/iridium cylinder) and was intended to be of the same mass as the 1 litre of water referred to above. It was subsequently discovered that the cylinder was around 28 parts per million too large and thus, during this time, a litre was about . Additionally, the mass–volume relationship of water (as with any fluid) depends on temperature, pressure, purity and isotopic uniformity. In 1964, the definition relating the litre to mass was superseded by the current one. Although the litre is not an SI unit, it is accepted by the CGPM (the standards body that defines the SI) for use with the SI. CGPM defines the litre and its acceptable symbols.

A litre is equal in volume to the millistere, an obsolete non-SI metric unit formerly customarily used for dry measure.

==Explanation==

Litres are most commonly used for items (such as fluids and solids that can be poured) which are measured by the capacity or size of their container, whereas cubic metres (and derived units) are most commonly used for items measured either by their dimensions or their displacements. The litre is often also used in some calculated measurements, such as density (kg/L), allowing an easy comparison with the density of water.

One litre of water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram when measured at its maximal density, which occurs at 3.984 °C. It follows, therefore, that of a litre, known as one millilitre (1 mL), of water has a mass of about 1 g, while 1000 litres of water has a mass of about 1000 kg (1 tonne or megagram). 

This relationship holds because the gram was originally defined as the mass of 1 mL of water; however, this definition was abandoned in 1799 because the density of water changes with temperature and, very slightly, with pressure.

It is now known that the density of water also depends on the isotopic ratios of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in a particular sample. Modern measurements of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, which is pure distilled water with an isotopic composition representative of the average of the world&#x27;s oceans, show that it has a density of at its point of maximum density (3.984 °C) under one standard atmosphere (101.325 kPa) of pressure.

== SI prefixes applied to the litre==
The litre, though not an official SI unit, may be used with SI prefixes. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name &quot;cubic centimetre&quot;. It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine, cooking and automotive engineering. Other units may be found in the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, NIST advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the centilitre. There are two international standard symbols for the litre: L and l. In the United States the former is preferred because of the risk that (in some fonts) the letter and the digit may be confused.

==Non-metric conversions==
See also Imperial units and US customary units.

===Rough conversions===

One litre is about larger than a US liquid quart, and about smaller than an imperial quart.

A mnemonic for its volume relative to an imperial pint is &quot;a litre of water&#x27;s a pint and three-quarters&quot;; this is very close, as a litre is about 1.760 imperial pints.

A cubic foot has a volume of exactly .

==Symbol==

Originally, the only symbol for the litre was l (lowercase letter L), following the SI convention that only those unit symbols that abbreviate the name of a person start with a capital letter. In many English-speaking countries, however, the most common shape of a handwritten Arabic digit 1 is just a vertical stroke; that is, it lacks the upstroke added in many other cultures. Therefore, the digit &quot;1&quot; may easily be confused with the letter &quot;l&quot;. In some computer typefaces, the two characters are barely distinguishable. As a result, L (uppercase letter L) was adopted by the CIPM as an alternative symbol for litre in 1979. The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology now recommends the use of the uppercase letter L, a practice that is also widely followed in Canada and Australia. In these countries, the symbol L is also used with prefixes, as in mL and μL, instead of the traditional ml and μl used in Europe. In the UK and Ireland, as well as the rest of Europe, lowercase &quot;l&quot; is used with prefixes, though whole litres are often written in full (so, &quot;750 ml&quot; on a wine bottle, but often &quot;1 litre&quot; on a juice carton). In 1990, the International Committee for Weights and Measures stated that it was too early to choose a single symbol for the litre.

=== Script l and Unicode ===
Prior to 1979, the symbol came into common use in some countries; for example, it was recommended by South African Bureau of Standards publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s. This symbol can still be encountered occasionally in some English-speaking and European countries like Germany, and its use is ubiquitous in Japan and South Korea.

Fonts covering the CJK characters usually include not only the script small but also four precomposed characters: for the microlitre, millilitre, decilitre and kilolitre to allow correct rendering for vertically written scripts. These have Unicode equivalents for compatibility, which are not recommended for use with new documents:
* 
* 

The CJK Compatibility block also includes corresponding to , Japanese for &#x27;litre&#x27;.

==History==
The first name of the litre was &quot;cadil&quot;; standards are shown at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris.

The litre was introduced in France in 1795 as one of the new &quot;republican units of measurement&quot; and defined as one cubic decimetre.
One litre of liquid water has a mass of almost exactly one kilogram, due to the gram being defined in 1795 as one cubic centimetre of water at the temperature of melting ice.
The original decimetre length was 44.344 &quot;lignes&quot;, which was revised in 1798 to 44.3296 &quot;lignes&quot;. This made the original litre of today&#x27;s cubic decimetre. It was against this litre that the kilogram was constructed.

In 1879, the CIPM adopted the definition of the litre, with the symbol l (lowercase letter L).

In 1901, at the 3rd CGPM conference, the litre was redefined as the space occupied by 1 kg of pure water at the temperature of its maximum density (3.98 °C) under a pressure of 1 atm. This made the litre equal to about (earlier reference works usually put it at ).

In 1964, at the 12th CGPM conference, the original definition was reverted to, and thus the litre was once again defined in exact relation to the metre, as another name for the cubic decimetre, that is, exactly 1 dm3.

In 1979, at the 16th CGPM conference, the alternative symbol L (uppercase letter L) was adopted. It also expressed a preference that in the future only one of these two symbols should be retained, but in 1990 said it was still too early to do so.

==Everyday usage==
In spoken English, the symbol &quot;mL&quot; (for millilitre) can be pronounced as &quot;mil&quot;. This can potentially cause confusion with some other measurement words such as:
# &quot;mm&quot; for millimetre, a unit of length equal to one-thousandth of a metre
# &quot;mil&quot; for thousandth of an &quot;inch&quot;
# &quot;mil&quot;, a Scandinavian unit of length equal to 10 kilometres
# &quot;mil&quot;, unit of angular measurement

The abbreviation &quot;cc&quot; (for cubic centimetre, equal to a millilitre or mL) is a unit of the cgs system, which preceded the MKS system, which later evolved into the SI system. The abbreviation &quot;cc&quot; is still commonly used in many fields, including medical dosage and sizing for combustion engine displacement.

The microlitre (μL) has been known in the past as the lambda (λ), but this usage is now discouraged. In the medical field the microlitre is sometimes abbreviated as mcL on test results.
In the SI system, apart from prefixes for powers of 1000, use of the &quot;centi&quot; (10−2), &quot;deci&quot; (10−1), &quot;deca&quot; (10+1) and &quot;hecto&quot; (10+2) prefixes with litres is common. For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of beverages (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in Croatia, Switzerland and Scandinavia and often found in cookbooks, and restaurant and café menus; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial Dutch in Belgium, a &quot; and a &quot; (literally &quot;twenty-fiver&quot; and &quot;thirty-threer&quot;) are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25 cL and 33 cL. Bottles may also be 75 cL or half size at 37.5 cL for &quot;artisanal&quot; brews or 70 cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25 cL, 33 cL and 50 cL. Similarly, alcohol shots are often marked in cL in restaurant menus, typically .

In countries where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the SI standard was established, common usage eschews prefixes that are not powers of 1000. For example, in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. An exception is in pathology, where for instance blood lead level and blood sugar level may be measured in micrograms/milligrams per decilitre.

For larger volumes, kilolitres, megalitres, and gigalitres, have been used by the Northern Territory Government for measuring water consumption, reservoir capacities and river flows, although cubic metres are also used. Cubic metres are generally used for non-liquid commodities, such as sand and gravel, or storage space.

<doc id="18096" wikidata="Q276193" url="?curid=18096" title="Lavr Kornilov">
<text>Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (, ; – 13 April 1918) was a Russian military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. He served as Supreme Commander of the Russian Army and as the military leader of the Whites in the Russian Civil War. He is particularly remembered for the Kornilov affair, an unsuccessful coup d’etat against the Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky. The event became a significant turning point in the Russian Revolution, strengthening the Bolsheviks&#x27; position and influence.

Born in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kornilov began his military career after graduating from the Mikhailovsky Artillery School and the General Staff Academy. He distinguished himself during the Russo-Japanese War and later served as a military attaché in Qing China. During World War I, Kornilov commanded the 48th Infantry Division and gained recognition for his daring escape from Austrian captivity in 1915. His successes on the Eastern Front elevated him to prominence, leading to his appointment as Supreme Commander during the revolutionary upheaval of 1917.

After the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1917, Kornilov emerged as a key figure in the White movement. Following his escape from detention after the Kornilov Affair, he co-founded the Volunteer Army and led its forces in southern Russia during the early stages of the Russian Civil War. Kornilov was killed in 1918 during the siege of Yekaterinodar. His legacy remains deeply contested, viewed by some as a patriot fighting for Russia&#x27;s unity and by others as a reactionary figure whose actions exacerbated the nation’s descent into chaos.

==Pre-revolutionary career==

One story relates how Kornilov was originally born as a Don Cossack Kalmyk named Lavga Deldinov and adopted in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Russian Turkestan (now Kazakhstan) by the family of his mother&#x27;s brother, the Russian Cossack Khorunzhiy Georgy Nikolayevich Kornilov, whose wife was of Kazakh origin. But his sister wrote that he had not been adopted, had not been a Don Cossack, and that their mother had Polish and Altai Oirot descent. (Though their language was not a Kalmyk/Mongolian one, but because of their Asian race and their history in the Jungar Oirot (Kalmyk) state, Altai Oirots were called Altai Kalmyks by Russians. They were not Muslims or Kazakhs.) But Boris Shaposhnikov, who served with Pyotr Kornilov, the brother of Lavr, in 1903, mentioned the &quot;Kyrgyz&quot; ancestry of their mother - this name was usually used in reference to Kazakhs in 1903. Kornilov&#x27;s Siberian Cossack father was a friend of Potanin (1835–1920), a prominent figure in the Siberian autonomy movement.

Kornilov entered military school in Omsk in 1885 and went on to study at the Mikhailovsky Artillery School in St. Petersburg in 1889. In August 1892 he was assigned as a lieutenant to the Turkestan Military District, where he led several exploration missions in Eastern Turkestan, Afghanistan and Persia, learned several Central Asian languages, and wrote detailed reports about his observations.

Kornilov returned to St. Petersburg to attend the Nikolayev General Staff Academy and graduated as a captain in 1897. Again refusing a posting at St. Peterburg, he returned to the Turkestan Military District, where he resumed his duties as a military intelligence officer. Among his missions at this post was an attempt at traveling incognito to British India in 1904, though he was quickly discovered and subsequently kept under close surveillance.

During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 Kornilov became the Chief of staff of the 1st Infantry Brigade, and was heavily involved in the Battle of Sandepu (January 1905) and the Battle of Mukden (February/March 1905). He was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class) for bravery and promoted to the rank of colonel.

Following the end of the war, Kornilov served as military attache in China from 1907 to 1911. He studied the Chinese language, travelled extensively (researching data on the history, traditions and customs of the Chinese, which he intended to use as material for a book about life in contemporary China), and regularly sent detailed reports to the General Staff and Foreign Ministry. Kornilov paid much attention to the prospects of cooperation between Russia and China in the Far East and met with the future president of China, Chiang Kai-shek. In 1910 Kornilov was recalled from Beijing but remained in St. Petersburg for only five months before departing for western Mongolia and Kashgar to examine the military situation along China&#x27;s border with Russia. On 2 February 1911 he became Commander of the 8th Infantry Regiment of Estonia and was later appointed commander of the 9th Siberian Rifle Division, stationed in Vladivostok.

In 1914, at the start of World War I, Kornilov was appointed commander of the 48th Infantry Division, which saw combat in Galicia and the Carpathians. In 1915, he was promoted to the rank of major general. During heavy fighting, he was captured by the Austrians in April 1915, when his division became isolated from the rest of the Russian forces. After his capture, Field Marshal Conrad von Hötzendorf, the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Army, made a point of meeting him in person. As a major general, he was a high-value prisoner of war, but in July 1916 Kornilov managed to escape back to Russia and return to duty.

After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, he was given command of the Petrograd Military District in March 1917. On 8 March, Kornilov placed the Empress Alexandra and her children under house arrest at the Alexander Palace (Nicholas was still held at Stavka), replacing the Tsar&#x27;s Escort and Combined Regiments of the Imperial Guard with 300 revolutionary troops. On 21 April, when the Provisional Government declined to give him the authority he sought to deal with protestors in Petrograd, he resigned as commander of the Petrograd district and was transferred at his request to command the Russian Eighth Army. His army inflicted a spectacular defeat on the Austrians, taking 10,000 prisoners - Russia&#x27;s only notable military success in the year 1917 - though after five days, was forced to retreat. On 24 July, he was appointed commander of the southern front. A week later, he replaced Aleksei Brusilov as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Provisional Government&#x27;s armed forces.

==Kornilov Affair==

In the mass discontent following the July Days, the Russian populace grew highly skeptical about the Provisional Government&#x27;s abilities to alleviate the economic distress and social resentment among the lower classes. Pavel Milyukov, the Kadet leader, describes the situation in Russia in late July as, &quot;Chaos in the army, chaos in foreign policy, chaos in industry and chaos in the nationalist questions&quot;.Kornilov, appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army in July 1917, considered the Petrograd Soviet responsible for the breakdown in the military in recent times and believed that the Provisional Government lacked the power and confidence to dissolve the Petrograd Soviet. Following several ambiguous correspondences between Kornilov and Alexander Kerensky, Kornilov commanded an assault on the Petrograd Soviet.

Because the Petrograd Soviet was able to quickly gather a powerful army of workers and soldiers in defence of the Revolution, Kornilov&#x27;s coup was an abysmal failure, and he was placed under arrest. The Kornilov Affair resulted in significantly increased distrust among Russians towards the Provisional Government.

==Russian Civil War==
After the coup collapsed as his troops disintegrated, Kornilov and his fellow conspirators were placed under arrest in the Bykhov jail. On 19 November, a few weeks after the proclamation of Soviet power in Petrograd, they escaped from their confinement (eased by the fact that the jail was guarded by Kornilov&#x27;s supporters) and made their way to the Don region, which was controlled by the Don Cossacks. Here they linked up with General Mikhail Alekseev. Kornilov became the military commander of the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army with Alekseev as the political chief.

The Kornilov Shock Detachment of the 8th Army was the most famous and longest-lived volunteer unit in the Russian Imperial Army. It was also the last regiment of the Russian Imperial Army and the first of the Volunteer Army. In late 1917, the Kornilov Shock Regiment, one of the crack units of the Volunteer Army, was named after him, as well as many other autonomous White Army formations, such as the Kuban Cossack Kornilov Horse Regiment. Kornilov&#x27;s forces became recognizable for their Totenkopf insignia, which appeared on the regiment&#x27;s flags, pennants, and soldiers&#x27; sleeve patches.

Even before the Red Army was formed, Lavr Kornilov promised, &quot;the greater the terror, the greater our victories.&quot; He vowed that the goals of his forces must be fulfilled even if it was needed &quot;to set fire to half the country and shed the blood of three-quarters of all Russians.&quot; In the Don region village of Lezhanka alone, bands of Kornilov&#x27;s officers killed more than 500 people. On the other hand, Kornilov&#x27;s adjutant recalled that the general &quot;loved only the [Russia] itself&quot; and served it for all his life, having no time to think about political systems. The Bolsheviks for him were dangerous traitors, who ruined Russia&#x27;s unity and had to be stopped.

On 24 February 1918, as Rostov and the Don Cossack capital of Novocherkassk fell to the Bolsheviks, Kornilov led the Volunteer Army on the epic &#x27;Ice March&#x27; into the empty steppe towards the Kuban. Although badly outnumbered, he escaped destruction from the pursuing Bolshevik forces and laid siege to Ekaterinodar, the capital of the Kuban Soviet Republic, on 10 April. However, in the early morning of 13 April, a Soviet shell landed on his farmhouse headquarters and killed him. He was quietly buried in nearby Gnadau (modern day Dolinovskoe).

A few days later, when the Bolsheviks gained control of the village, they unearthed Kornilov&#x27;s coffin, dragged his corpse to the main square and burnt his remains on the local rubbish dump.

== Memorials ==
On 13 April 2013, a monument to the late General was erected in Krasnodar. Commemoration ceremonies took place with local cossacks, along with Cossacks from Don, Stavropol and Taman.

<text>L. L. Zamenhof (15 December 185914 April 1917) was the creator of Esperanto, the most widely used constructed international auxiliary language.

Zamenhof first developed the Esperanto language in 1873 while still in school. He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international auxiliary language. The language would be a tool to gather people together through neutral, fair, equitable communication. He successfully formed a community which has survived to this day despite the World Wars of the 20th century, and which continues making attempts to reform the language or create more modern IALs (the only other language like Esperanto at the time was Volapük). Additionally, Esperanto has developed like other languages: through the interaction and creativity of its users.

In light of his achievements, and his support of intercultural dialogue, UNESCO selected Zamenhof as one of its eminent personalities of 2017, on the 100th anniversary of his death. According to Esperanto communities, as of 2019 there are approximately 2 million people speaking Esperanto, including approximately 1,000 native speakers, although evidence to that has been heavily disputed, and the last major effort to improve the estimate occurred in 2004.

==Name==
Zamenhof came from a multilingual area. His name is transliterated as follows:
* English: &quot;Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof&quot; – 
* Esperanto: – 
* French: – 
* German: – 
* Lithuanian: 
* Polish: – 
* 

Born into an Ashkenazi family, at his birth Zamenhof was given the common Hebrew name &quot;Eliezer&quot; by his parents, which is translated into English as &quot;Lazarus&quot;. However, as the area was a part of the Russian Empire at the time, his name was recorded on his birth certificate as , using the Yiddish form of the forename and a russified version of his surname; many later Russian language documents also include the patronymic « son of Mark » (in reference to his father, Markus), as is the custom in the language. His family name is of German origin and was originally written &quot;Samenhof&quot;; this was later transcribed into Yiddish as , then re-romanized back as &quot;Zamenhof&quot;. The change of the initial letter from « S » to « Z » is not unusual, as in German an initial « s » is pronounced .

In his adolescence, he used both the Yiddish &quot;Leyzer&quot; and the Russian &quot;Lazar&quot; when writing his first name. While at university, Zamenhof began using the Russian name &quot;Lyudovik&quot; (also transcribed &quot;Ludovic&quot; or translated as &quot;Ludwig&quot;) in place of &quot;Lazar&quot;, possibly in honour of Francis Lodwick, who in 1652 had published an early conlang proposal. When his brother Leon became a doctor and started signing his name &quot;Dr L. Zamenhof&quot;, Zamenhof reclaimed his birth name &quot;Lazar&quot; and from 1901 signed his name &quot;Dr L. L. Zamenhof&quot; to avoid confusion with his brother. The two L&#x27;s do not seem to have specifically represented either name and the order &quot;Ludwik Lejzer&quot; is a modern convention.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Zamenhof was born on 15 December 1859, the son of Mark and Rozalia Zamenhof (), in the multi-ethnic city of Belostok (now Białystok in Poland). At that time, the city was in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire. His parents were of Litvak descent. He appears to have been natively bilingual in Yiddish and Russian. His father was a teacher of French and German. From him, Zamenhof learned both languages, as well as Hebrew. He also spoke some major languages of Białystok, such as Polish and Belarusian. Polish became the native language of his children in Warsaw. In school, he studied the classical languages Latin, Greek, and Aramaic. He later learned some English, though in his own words not very well. He had an interest in Italian and Lithuanian and learned Volapük when it came out in 1880. By that time, his international language project was already well-developed.

In addition to the Jewish Yiddish-speaking minority, the population of Białystok included Roman Catholic Poles and Eastern Orthodox Russians (mainly government officials), with smaller groups of Belarusians, Germans and other ethnicities. Zamenhof was saddened and frustrated by the many quarrels among these groups. He supposed that the main reason for the hate and prejudice lay in the mutual misunderstanding caused by the lack of a common language. If such a language existed, Zamenhof postulated, it could play the role of a neutral communication tool between people of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.

As a student at secondary school in Warsaw, Zamenhof attempted to create an international language with a grammar that was rich, but complex. When he later studied English, he decided that the international language must have simpler grammar. Apart from his parents&#x27; native languages Russian and Yiddish and his adopted language Polish, his projects were also aided by his mastery of German, a good passive understanding of Latin, Hebrew and French, and a basic knowledge of Greek, English and Italian.

By 1878, his project &quot;Lingwe uniwersala&quot; was finished. However, Zamenhof was too young then to publish his work. Soon after graduation, he began to study medicine, first in Moscow, and later in Warsaw. In 1885, Zamenhof graduated from university and began his practice as a doctor in Veisiejai. After 1886, he worked as an ophthalmologist in Płock and Vienna. While healing people there, he continued to work on his project of an international language.

For two years, he tried to raise funds to publish a booklet describing the language, until he received financial help from his future wife&#x27;s father. In 1887, the book titled &quot;Международный язык. Предисловие и полный учебникъ&quot; (International language: Introduction and complete textbook) was published in Russian under the pseudonym &quot;Doktoro Esperanto&quot; (Doctor Hoper, or literally &quot;Doctor One Who Hopes&quot;). Zamenhof initially called his language &quot;Lingvo internacia&quot; (international language), but those who learned it began to call it &quot;Esperanto&quot; after his pseudonym, and this soon became the official name for the language. For Zamenhof, this language, far from being merely a communication tool, was a way to promote peaceful coexistence between people of different cultures.

===Work on Yiddish language and Jewish issues===

In 1879, Zamenhof wrote the first grammar of Yiddish. It was partly published years later in the Yiddish magazine . The complete original Russian text of this manuscript was only published in 1982, with parallel Esperanto translation by Adolf Holzhaus, in (An attempt at a grammar of neo-Jewish language), Helsinki, pp. 9–36. In this work, not only does he provide a review of Yiddish grammar, but also proposes its transition to the Latin script and other orthographic innovations. In the same period, Zamenhof wrote some other works in Yiddish, including perhaps the first survey of Yiddish poetics (see p. 50 in the above-cited book).

A wave of pogroms within the Russian Empire in 1882, including Congress Poland, motivated Zamenhof to take part in the Hibbat Zion, and to found a Zionist student society in Warsaw. He left the movement following the publication of Unua Libro in 1887, and in 1901 published a statement in Russian with the title &quot;Hillelism&quot;, in which he argued that the Zionist project would fail due to Jews not having a common language.

In 1914, he declined an invitation to join a new organization of Jewish Esperantists, the TEHA. In his letter to the organizers, he said, &quot;I am profoundly convinced that every nationalism offers humanity only the greatest unhappiness ... It is true that the nationalism of oppressed peoples – as a natural self-defensive reaction – is much more excusable than the nationalism of peoples who oppress; but, if the nationalism of the strong is ignoble, the nationalism of the weak is imprudent; both give birth to and support each other&quot;. The Hebrew Bible is among the many works that Zamenhof translated into Esperanto.

Zamenhof died in Warsaw on 14 April 1917, possibly of a heart attack, and was buried at the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery. The farewell speech was delivered by the chief rabbi and preacher of the Great Synagogue in Warsaw, Samuel Abraham Poznański, who said: &quot;There will be a time where the Polish soil and nation will understand what fame gave this great son of God to his homeland.&quot;

===Family===
Zamenhof and his wife Klara Silbernik raised three children, a son, Adam, and two daughters, Zofia and Lidia. All three were murdered by the Nazis.

Lidia Zamenhof in particular took a keen interest in Esperanto, and as an adult became a teacher of the language, travelling through Europe and to America to teach classes in it. Through her friendship with Martha Root, Lidia accepted Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and became a member of the Baháʼí Faith. As one of its social principles, the Baháʼí Faith teaches that an auxiliary world language should be selected by the representatives of all the world&#x27;s nations.

Zamenhof&#x27;s grandson, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof (Adam&#x27;s son), lived in France from the 1960s until his death in 2019. As of 2020, Louis-Christophe&#x27;s daughter, , is active in the Esperanto movement.

===Religious philosophy===
Besides his linguistic work, Zamenhof published a religious philosophy he called &quot;Homaranismo&quot; (the term in Esperanto, usually rendered as &quot;humanitism&quot; in English, sometimes rendered loosely as humanitarianism or humanism), based on the principles and teachings of Hillel the Elder. He said of Homaranismo: &quot;It is indeed the object of my whole life. I would give up everything for it.&quot;

==Honours and namesakes==
In 1905, Zamenhof received the Légion d&#x27;honneur for creating Esperanto. In 1910, Zamenhof was first nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, by four British Members of Parliament (including James O&#x27;Grady and Philip Snowden) and Professor Stanley Lane Poole. (The Prize was instead awarded to the International Peace Bureau.) Ultimately Zamenhof was nominated 12 times for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the occasion of the fifth Universala Kongreso de Esperanto in Barcelona, Zamenhof was made a Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by King Alfonso XIII of Spain.

A monument or place linked to Zamenhof or Esperanto is known as a Zamenhof-Esperanto object (or ZEO).

The minor planet 1462 Zamenhof is named in his honour. It was discovered on 6 February 1938 by Yrjö Väisälä. There is also a minor planet named in honour of Esperanto (1421 Esperanto).

Hundreds of city streets, parks, and bridges worldwide have also been named after Zamenhof. In Lithuania, the best-known Zamenhof Street is in Kaunas, where he lived and owned a house for some time. There are others in Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Hungary, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Spain (mostly in Catalonia), Italy, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands and Brazil. There are Zamenhof Hills in Hungary and Brazil, and a Zamenhof Island in the Danube.

In some Israeli cities, street signs identify Esperanto&#x27;s creator and give his birth and death dates, but refer to him solely by his Jewish name Eliezer, his original birth name. Zamenhof is honoured as a deity by the Japanese religion Oomoto, which encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers. A genus of lichen has been named &quot;Zamenhofia&quot; in his honour, as well as the species &quot;Heteroplacidium zamenhofianum&quot;.

Russian writer , who lived in Odessa, together with , founded a branch of the first official Esperanto society Esrero in Russia. In the years 1896–97 N. A. Borovko became its chairman. A monument to L. Zamenhof was installed in Odessa in an ordinary residential courtyard. Esperantist sculptor Nikolai Vasilyevich Blazhkov lived in this house, who, in the early 1960s brought a sculptural portrait into the courtyard because the customs authorities did not allow the sculpture to be sent to the Esperanto Congress in Vienna.

A public square in Gothenburg, Sweden is named Esperantoplatsen, where a café named Zamenhof opened in 2018.
In Italy, a few streets are named after Esperanto, including Largo Esperanto in Pisa.

In 1959, UNESCO honoured Zamenhof on the occasion of his centenary. In 2015, it decided to support the celebration of the 100th anniversary of his death.

His birthday, 15 December, is celebrated annually as Zamenhof Day by users of Esperanto. On 15 December 2009, Esperanto&#x27;s green-starred flag flew on the Google homepage to commemorate Zamenhof&#x27;s 150th birthday.

The house of the Zamenhof family and a monument to Zamenhof are sites on the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok, which was opened in June 2008 by volunteers at The University of Białystok Foundation. Białystok is also home to the Ludwik Zamenhof Centre.

In 1960, Esperanto summer schools were established in Stoke-on-Trent in the United Kingdom by the Esperanto Association of Britain (EAB), which began to provide lessons and promote the language locally. There is a road named after Zamenhof in the city: Zamenhof Grove.

As Zamenhof was born on 15 December 1859, the Esperanto Society of New York gathers every December to celebrate Zamenhofa Tago (Zamenhof Day in Esperanto).

<doc id="18102" wikidata="Q207643" url="?curid=18102" title="Linear map">
<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in linear algebra, a linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation, vector space homomorphism, or in some contexts linear function) is a mapping formula_1 between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. The same names and the same definition are also used for the more general case of modules over a ring; see Module homomorphism.

If a linear map is a bijection then it is called a &#x27;. In the case where formula_2, a linear map is called a linear endomorphism. Sometimes the term &#x27; refers to this case, but the term &quot;linear operator&quot; can have different meanings for different conventions: for example, it can be used to emphasize that formula_3 and formula_4 are real vector spaces (not necessarily with formula_2), or it can be used to emphasize that formula_3 is a function space, which is a common convention in functional analysis. Sometimes the term &quot;linear function&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;linear map&quot;, while in analysis it does not.

A linear map from formula_3 to formula_4 always maps the origin of formula_3 to the origin of formula_4. Moreover, it maps linear subspaces in formula_3 onto linear subspaces in formula_4 (possibly of a lower dimension); for example, it maps a plane through the origin in formula_3 to either a plane through the origin in formula_4, a line through the origin in formula_4, or just the origin in formula_4. Linear maps can often be represented as matrices, and simple examples include rotation and reflection linear transformations.

In the language of category theory, linear maps are the morphisms of vector spaces, and they form a category equivalent to the one of matrices.

==Definition and first consequences==

Let formula_3 and formula_4 be vector spaces over the same field formula_19. 
A function formula_20 is said to be a &quot;linear map&quot; if for any two vectors formula_21 and any scalar formula_22 the following two conditions are satisfied:

* Additivity / operation of addition formula_23
* Homogeneity of degree 1 / operation of scalar multiplication formula_24

Thus, a linear map is said to be &quot;operation preserving&quot;. In other words, it does not matter whether the linear map is applied before (the right hand sides of the above examples) or after (the left hand sides of the examples) the operations of addition and scalar multiplication.

By the associativity of the addition operation denoted as +, for any vectors formula_25 and scalars formula_26 the following equality holds:
formula_27 Thus a linear map is one which preserves linear combinations.

Denoting the zero elements of the vector spaces formula_3 and formula_4 by formula_30 and formula_31 respectively, it follows that formula_32 Let formula_33 and formula_34 in the equation for homogeneity of degree 1:
formula_35

A linear map formula_36 with formula_19 viewed as a one-dimensional vector space over itself is called a linear functional.

These statements generalize to any left-module formula_38 over a ring formula_39 without modification, and to any right-module upon reversing of the scalar multiplication.

==Examples==

* A prototypical example that gives linear maps their name is a function formula_40, of which the graph is a line through the origin.
* More generally, any homothety formula_41 centered in the origin of a vector space is a linear map (here is a scalar). 
* The zero map formula_42 between two vector spaces (over the same field) is linear.
* The identity map on any module is a linear operator.
* For real numbers, the map formula_43 is not linear.
* For real numbers, the map formula_44 is not linear (but is an affine transformation).
* If formula_45 is a formula_46 real matrix, then formula_45 defines a linear map from formula_48 to formula_49 by sending a column vector formula_50 to the column vector formula_51. Conversely, any linear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented in this manner; see the , below.
* If formula_52 is an isometry between real normed spaces such that formula_53 then formula_54 is a linear map. This result is not necessarily true for complex normed space. 
* Differentiation defines a linear map from the space of all differentiable functions to the space of all functions. It also defines a linear operator on the space of all smooth functions (a linear operator is a linear endomorphism, that is, a linear map with the same domain and codomain). Indeed, formula_55
* A definite integral over some interval is a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on to formula_56. Indeed, formula_57
* An indefinite integral (or antiderivative) with a fixed integration starting point defines a linear map from the space of all real-valued integrable functions on formula_56 to the space of all real-valued, differentiable functions on formula_56. Without a fixed starting point, the antiderivative maps to the quotient space of the differentiable functions by the linear space of constant functions. 
* If formula_3 and formula_4 are finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field , of respective dimensions and , then the function that maps linear maps formula_52 to matrices in the way described in (below) is a linear map, and even a linear isomorphism.
* The expected value of a random variable (which is in fact a function, and as such an element of a vector space) is linear, as for random variables formula_63 and formula_64 we have formula_65 and formula_66, but the variance of a random variable is not linear.

===Linear extensions===

Often, a linear map is constructed by defining it on a subset of a vector space and then to the linear span of the domain. 
Suppose formula_63 and formula_64 are vector spaces and formula_69 is a function defined on some subset formula_70 
Then a &quot; of formula_54 to formula_72&quot; if it exists, is a linear map formula_73 defined on formula_63 that extends formula_54 (meaning that formula_76 for all formula_77) and takes its values from the codomain of formula_78 
When the subset formula_79 is a vector subspace of formula_63 then a (formula_64-valued) linear extension of formula_54 to all of formula_63 is guaranteed to exist if (and only if) formula_69 is a linear map. In particular, if formula_54 has a linear extension to formula_86 then it has a linear extension to all of formula_87

The map formula_69 can be extended to a linear map formula_89 if and only if whenever formula_90 is an integer, formula_91 are scalars, and formula_92 are vectors such that formula_93 then necessarily formula_94 
If a linear extension of formula_69 exists then the linear extension formula_89 is unique and
formula_97
holds for all formula_98 and formula_99 as above. 
If formula_79 is linearly independent then every function formula_69 into any vector space has a linear extension to a (linear) map formula_102 (the converse is also true).

For example, if formula_103 and formula_104 then the assignment formula_105 and formula_106 can be linearly extended from the linearly independent set of vectors formula_107 to a linear map on formula_108 The unique linear extension formula_109 is the map that sends formula_110 to
formula_111

Every (scalar-valued) linear functional formula_54 defined on a vector subspace of a real or complex vector space formula_63 has a linear extension to all of formula_87 
Indeed, the Hahn–Banach dominated extension theorem even guarantees that when this linear functional formula_54 is dominated by some given seminorm formula_116 (meaning that formula_117 holds for all formula_118 in the domain of formula_54) then there exists a linear extension to formula_63 that is also dominated by formula_121

==Matrices==
If formula_3 and formula_4 are finite-dimensional vector spaces and a basis is defined for each vector space, then every linear map from formula_3 to formula_4 can be represented by a matrix. This is useful because it allows concrete calculations. Matrices yield examples of linear maps: if formula_45 is a real formula_46 matrix, then formula_128 describes a linear map formula_129 (see Euclidean space).

Let formula_130 be a basis for formula_3. Then every vector formula_132 is uniquely determined by the coefficients formula_133 in the field formula_56:
formula_135

If formula_52 is a linear map,
formula_137

which implies that the function &quot;f&quot; is entirely determined by the vectors formula_138. Now let formula_139 be a basis for formula_4. Then we can represent each vector formula_141 as
formula_142

Thus, the function formula_54 is entirely determined by the values of formula_144. If we put these values into an formula_46 matrix formula_146, then we can conveniently use it to compute the vector output of formula_54 for any vector in formula_3. To get formula_146, every column formula_150 of formula_146 is a vector
formula_152
corresponding to formula_141 as defined above. To define it more clearly, for some column formula_150 that corresponds to the mapping formula_141,
formula_156
where formula_146 is the matrix of formula_54. In other words, every column formula_159 has a corresponding vector formula_141 whose coordinates formula_161 are the elements of column formula_150. A single linear map may be represented by many matrices. This is because the values of the elements of a matrix depend on the bases chosen.

The matrices of a linear transformation can be represented visually:

# Matrix for formula_163 relative to formula_164: formula_165
# Matrix for formula_163 relative to formula_167: formula_168
# Transition matrix from formula_167 to formula_164: formula_171
# Transition matrix from formula_164 to formula_167: formula_174

Such that starting in the bottom left corner formula_175 and looking for the bottom right corner formula_176, one would left-multiply—that is, formula_177. The equivalent method would be the &quot;longer&quot; method going clockwise from the same point such that formula_175 is left-multiplied with formula_179, or formula_180.

===Examples in two dimensions===
In two-dimensional space R2 linear maps are described by 2 × 2 matrices. These are some examples:

* rotation
** by 90 degrees counterclockwise: formula_181
** by an angle &quot;θ&quot; counterclockwise: formula_182
* reflection
** through the &quot;x&quot; axis: formula_183
** through the &quot;y&quot; axis: formula_184
** through a line making an angle &quot;θ&quot; with the origin: formula_185 
* scaling by 2 in all directions: formula_186
* horizontal shear mapping: formula_187
* skew of the &quot;y&quot; axis by an angle &quot;θ&quot;: formula_188
* squeeze mapping: formula_189
* projection onto the &quot;y&quot; axis: formula_190

If a linear map is only composed of rotation, reflection, and/or uniform scaling, then the linear map is a conformal linear transformation.

==Vector space of linear maps==

The composition of linear maps is linear: if formula_20 and formula_192 are linear, then so is their composition formula_193. It follows from this that the class of all vector spaces over a given field &quot;K&quot;, together with &quot;K&quot;-linear maps as morphisms, forms a category.

The inverse of a linear map, when defined, is again a linear map.

If formula_194 and formula_195 are linear, then so is their pointwise sum formula_196, which is defined by formula_197.

If formula_52 is linear and formula_199 is an element of the ground field formula_200, then the map formula_201, defined by formula_202, is also linear.

Thus the set formula_203 of linear maps from formula_204 to formula_205 itself forms a vector space over formula_200, sometimes denoted formula_207. Furthermore, in the case that formula_208, this vector space, denoted formula_209, is an associative algebra under composition of maps, since the composition of two linear maps is again a linear map, and the composition of maps is always associative. This case is discussed in more detail below.

Given again the finite-dimensional case, if bases have been chosen, then the composition of linear maps corresponds to the matrix multiplication, the addition of linear maps corresponds to the matrix addition, and the multiplication of linear maps with scalars corresponds to the multiplication of matrices with scalars.

===Endomorphisms and automorphisms===

A linear transformation formula_210 is an endomorphism of formula_204; the set of all such endomorphisms formula_212 together with addition, composition and scalar multiplication as defined above forms an associative algebra with identity element over the field formula_200 (and in particular a ring). The multiplicative identity element of this algebra is the identity map formula_214.

An endomorphism of formula_204 that is also an isomorphism is called an automorphism of formula_204. The composition of two automorphisms is again an automorphism, and the set of all automorphisms of formula_204 forms a group, the automorphism group of formula_204 which is denoted by formula_219 or formula_220. Since the automorphisms are precisely those endomorphisms which possess inverses under composition, formula_219 is the group of units in the ring formula_212.

If formula_204 has finite dimension formula_224, then formula_209 is isomorphic to the associative algebra of all formula_226 matrices with entries in formula_200. The automorphism group of formula_204 is isomorphic to the general linear group formula_229 of all formula_226 invertible matrices with entries in formula_200.

==Kernel, image and the rank–nullity theorem==

If formula_52 is linear, we define the kernel and the image or range of formula_233 by
formula_234

formula_235 is a subspace of formula_204 and formula_237 is a subspace of formula_205. The following dimension formula is known as the rank–nullity theorem:
formula_239

The number formula_240 is also called the rank of formula_233 and written as formula_242, or sometimes, formula_243; the number formula_244 is called the nullity of formula_233 and written as formula_246 or formula_247. If formula_204 and formula_205 are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and formula_233 is represented by the matrix formula_165, then the rank and nullity of formula_233 are equal to the rank and nullity of the matrix formula_165, respectively.

==Cokernel==
A subtler invariant of a linear transformation formula_52 is the &quot;co&quot;kernel, which is defined as
formula_255

This is the &quot;dual&quot; notion to the kernel: just as the kernel is a &quot;sub&quot;space of the &quot;domain,&quot; the co-kernel is a &quot;quotient&quot; space of the &quot;target.&quot; Formally, one has the exact sequence
formula_256

These can be interpreted thus: given a linear equation &quot;f&quot;(v) = w to solve,

* the kernel is the space of &quot;solutions&quot; to the &quot;homogeneous&quot; equation &quot;f&quot;(v) = 0, and its dimension is the number of degrees of freedom in the space of solutions, if it is not empty;
* the co-kernel is the space of that the solutions must satisfy, and its dimension is the maximal number of independent constraints.

The dimension of the co-kernel and the dimension of the image (the rank) add up to the dimension of the target space. For finite dimensions, this means that the dimension of the quotient space &quot;W&quot;/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) is the dimension of the target space minus the dimension of the image.

As a simple example, consider the map &quot;f&quot;: R2 → R2, given by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = (0, &quot;y&quot;). Then for an equation &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) to have a solution, we must have &quot;a&quot; = 0 (one constraint), and in that case the solution space is (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) or equivalently stated, (0, &quot;b&quot;) + (&quot;x&quot;, 0), (one degree of freedom). The kernel may be expressed as the subspace (&quot;x&quot;, 0) &lt; &quot;V&quot;: the value of &quot;x&quot; is the freedom in a solution – while the cokernel may be expressed via the map &quot;W&quot; → R, formula_257: given a vector (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;), the value of &quot;a&quot; is the &quot;obstruction&quot; to there being a solution.

An example illustrating the infinite-dimensional case is afforded by the map &quot;f&quot;: R∞ → R∞, formula_258 with &quot;b&quot;1 = 0 and &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 1 = &quot;an&quot; for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the zero sequence to the zero sequence), its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same sum as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel (formula_259), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an endomorphism have the same dimension (0 ≠ 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map &quot;h&quot;: R∞ → R∞, formula_260 with &quot;cn&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 1. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the zero sequence, its kernel has dimension 1.

===Index===
For a linear operator with finite-dimensional kernel and co-kernel, one may define &quot;index&quot; as:
formula_261
namely the degrees of freedom minus the number of constraints.

For a transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, this is just the difference dim(&quot;V&quot;) − dim(&quot;W&quot;), by rank–nullity. This gives an indication of how many solutions or how many constraints one has: if mapping from a larger space to a smaller one, the map may be onto, and thus will have degrees of freedom even without constraints. Conversely, if mapping from a smaller space to a larger one, the map cannot be onto, and thus one will have constraints even without degrees of freedom.

The index of an operator is precisely the Euler characteristic of the 2-term complex 0 → &quot;V&quot; → &quot;W&quot; → 0. In operator theory, the index of Fredholm operators is an object of study, with a major result being the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

==Algebraic classifications of linear transformations==

No classification of linear maps could be exhaustive. The following incomplete list enumerates some important classifications that do not require any additional structure on the vector space.

Let and denote vector spaces over a field and let be a linear map.

===Monomorphism===
 is said to be &quot;injective&quot; or a &quot;monomorphism&quot; if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:
# is one-to-one as a map of sets.
# 
# is monic or left-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space and any pair of linear maps and , the equation implies .
# is left-invertible, which is to say there exists a linear map such that is the identity map on .

===Epimorphism===
 is said to be &quot;surjective&quot; or an &quot;epimorphism&quot; if any of the following equivalent conditions are true:
# is onto as a map of sets.
# is epic or right-cancellable, which is to say, for any vector space and any pair of linear maps and , the equation implies .
# is right-invertible, which is to say there exists a linear map such that is the identity map on .

===Isomorphism===
 is said to be an &quot;isomorphism&quot; if it is both left- and right-invertible. This is equivalent to being both one-to-one and onto (a bijection of sets) or also to being both epic and monic, and so being a bimorphism.

If is an endomorphism, then:
* If, for some positive integer , the -th iterate of , , is identically zero, then is said to be nilpotent.
* If , then is said to be idempotent
* If , where is some scalar, then is said to be a scaling transformation or scalar multiplication map; see scalar matrix.

==Change of basis==

Given a linear map which is an endomorphism whose matrix is &quot;A&quot;, in the basis &quot;B&quot; of the space it transforms vector coordinates [u] as [v] = &quot;A&quot;[u]. As vectors change with the inverse of &quot;B&quot; (vectors coordinates are contravariant) its inverse transformation is [v] = &quot;B&quot;[v&#x27;].

Substituting this in the first expression
formula_262
hence
formula_263

Therefore, the matrix in the new basis is &quot;A′&quot; = &quot;B&quot;−1&quot;AB&quot;, being &quot;B&quot; the matrix of the given basis.

Therefore, linear maps are said to be 1-co- 1-contra-variant objects, or type (1, 1) tensors.

==Continuity==
A &quot;linear transformation&quot; between topological vector spaces, for example normed spaces, may be continuous. If its domain and codomain are the same, it will then be a continuous linear operator. A linear operator on a normed linear space is continuous if and only if it is bounded, for example, when the domain is finite-dimensional. An infinite-dimensional domain may have discontinuous linear operators.

An example of an unbounded, hence discontinuous, linear transformation is differentiation on the space of smooth functions equipped with the supremum norm (a function with small values can have a derivative with large values, while the derivative of 0 is 0). For a specific example, converges to 0, but its derivative does not, so differentiation is not continuous at 0 (and by a variation of this argument, it is not continuous anywhere).

==Applications==
A specific application of linear maps is for geometric transformations, such as those performed in computer graphics, where the translation, rotation and scaling of 2D or 3D objects is performed by the use of a transformation matrix. Linear mappings also are used as a mechanism for describing change: for example in calculus correspond to derivatives; or in relativity, used as a device to keep track of the local transformations of reference frames.

Another application of these transformations is in compiler optimizations of nested-loop code, and in parallelizing compiler techniques.

<text>A Leyden jar (or Leiden jar, or archaically, Kleistian jar) is an electrical component that stores a high-voltage electric charge (from an external source) between electrical conductors on the inside and outside of a glass jar. It typically consists of a glass jar with metal foil cemented to the inside and the outside surfaces, and a metal terminal projecting vertically through the jar lid to make contact with the inner foil. It was the original form of the capacitor (also called a &quot;condenser&quot;).

Its invention was a discovery made independently by German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leiden (Leyden), Netherlands, in 1745–1746.

The Leyden jar was used to conduct many early experiments in electricity, and its discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of electrostatics. It was the first means of accumulating and preserving electric charge in large quantities that could be discharged at the experimenter&#x27;s will, thus overcoming a significant limit to early research into electrical conduction. Leyden jars are still used in education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics.

== Previous work ==
The Ancient Greeks already knew that pieces of amber could attract lightweight particles after being rubbed. The amber becomes electrified by the triboelectric effect, mechanical separation of charge in a dielectric material. The Greek word for amber is ἤλεκτρον (&quot;ēlektron&quot;) and is the origin of the word &quot;electricity&quot;. Thales of Miletus, a pre-Socratic philosopher, is thought to have accidentally commented on the phenomenon of electrostatic charging, due to his belief that even lifeless things have a soul in them, hence the popular analogy of the spark. Around 1650, Otto von Guericke built a crude electrostatic generator: a sulphur ball that rotated on a shaft. When Guericke held his hand against the ball and turned the shaft quickly, a static electric charge built up. This experiment inspired the development of several forms of &quot;friction machines&quot;, which greatly helped in the study of electricity.

Georg Matthias Bose (22 September 1710 – 17 September 1761) was a famous electrical experimenter in the early days of the development of electrostatics. He is credited with being the first to develop a way of temporarily storing static charges by using an insulated conductor (called a prime conductor). His demonstrations and experiments raised the interests of the German scientific community and the public in the development of electrical research.

== Discovery ==
The Leyden jar was effectively discovered independently by two parties: German dean Ewald Georg von Kleist, who made the first discovery, and Dutch scientists Pieter van Musschenbroek and Andreas Cunaeus, who figured out why it only worked when held in the hand.

=== Von Kleist ===
Ewald Georg von Kleist was the dean at the cathedral of Cammin in Pomerania, a region now divided between Germany and Poland. Von Kleist is credited with first using the fluid analogy for electricity and demonstrated this to Bose by drawing sparks from water with his finger. He discovered the immense storage capability of the Leyden jar while attempting to demonstrate that a glass jar filled with alcohol would &quot;capture&quot; this fluid.

In October 1745, von Kleist tried to accumulate electricity in a small medicine bottle filled with alcohol with a nail inserted in the cork. He was following up on an experiment developed by Georg Matthias Bose where electricity had been sent through water to set alcoholic spirits alight. He attempted to charge the bottle from a large prime conductor (invented by Bose) suspended above his friction machine.

Von Kleist knew that the glass would provide an obstacle to the escape of the &quot;fluid&quot;, and so was convinced that a substantial electric charge could be collected and held within it. He received a significant shock from the device when he accidentally touched the nail through the cork while still cradling the bottle in his other hand. He communicated his results to at least five different electrical experimenters, in several letters from November 1745 to March 1746, but did not receive any confirmation that they had repeated his results, until April 1746. Polish-Lithuanian physicist Daniel Gralath learned about von Kleist&#x27;s experiment from seeing von Kleist&#x27;s letter to Paul Swietlicki, written in November 1745. After Gralath&#x27;s failed first attempt to reproduce the experiment in December 1745, he wrote to von Kleist for more information (and was told that the experiment would work better if the tube half-filled with alcohol was used). Gralath (in collaboration with ) succeeded in getting the intended effect on 5 March 1746, holding a small glass medicine bottle with a nail inside in one hand, moving it close to an electrostatic generator, and then moving the other hand close to the nail. Von Kleist didn&#x27;t understand the significance of his conducting hand holding the bottle—and both he and his correspondents were loath to hold the device when told that the shock could throw them across the room. It took some time before von Kleist&#x27;s student associates at Leyden worked out that the hand provided an essential element.

=== Musschenbroek and Cunaeus ===
The Leyden jar&#x27;s invention was long credited to Pieter van Musschenbroek, the physics professor at Leiden University, who also ran a family foundry which cast brass cannonettes, and a small business (&quot;De Oosterse Lamp&quot; – &quot;The Eastern Lamp&quot;) which made scientific and medical instruments for the new university courses in physics and for scientific gentlemen keen to establish their own &#x27;cabinets&#x27; of curiosities and instruments.

Like von Kleist, Musschenbroek was also interested in, and attempting to repeat, Bose&#x27;s experiment. During this time, Andreas Cunaeus, a lawyer, learned about this experiment from Musschenbroek, and attempted to duplicate the experiment at home with household items. Unaware of the &quot;Rule of Dufay&quot;, that the experimental apparatus should be insulated, Cunaeus held his jar in his hand while charging it, and was thus the first to discover that such an experimental setup could deliver a severe shock. He reported his procedure and experience to Swiss-Dutch natural philosopher Jean-Nicolas-Sebastian Allamand, Musschenbroek&#x27;s colleague. Allamand and Musschenbroek also received severe shocks. Musschenbroek communicated the experiment in a letter from 20 January 1746 to French entomologist René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, who was Musschenbroek&#x27;s appointed correspondent at the Paris Academy. Abbé Jean-Antoine Nollet read this report, confirmed the experiment, and then read Musschenbroek&#x27;s letter in a public meeting of the Paris Academy in April 1746 (translating from Latin to French).

Musschenbroek&#x27;s outlet in France for the sale of his company&#x27;s &#x27;cabinet&#x27; devices was the Abbé Nollet (who started building and selling duplicate instruments in 1735). Nollet then gave the electrical storage device the name &quot;Leyden jar&quot; and promoted it as a special type of flask to his market of wealthy men with scientific curiosity. The &quot;Kleistian jar&quot; was therefore promoted as the &quot;Leyden jar&quot;, and as having been discovered by Pieter van Musschenbroek and his acquaintance Andreas Cunaeus. Musschenbroek, however, never claimed that he had invented it, and some think that Cunaeus was mentioned only to diminish credit to him.

== Further developments ==
Within months after Musschenbroek&#x27;s report about how to reliably create a Leyden jar, other electrical researchers were making and experimenting with their own Leyden jars. One of his expressed original interests was to see if the total possible charge could be increased.

Johann Heinrich Winckler, whose first experience with a single Leyden jar was reported in a letter to the Royal Society on 29 May 1746, had connected three Leyden jars together in a kind of electrostatic battery on 28 July 1746. In 1746, Abbé Nollet performed two experiments for the edification of King Louis XV of France, in the first of which he discharged a Leyden jar through 180 royal guardsmen, and in the second through a larger number of Carthusian monks; all of whom sprang into the air more or less simultaneously. The opinions of neither the king nor the experimental subjects have been recorded.

Daniel Gralath reported in 1747 that in 1746 he had conducted experiments with connecting two or three jars, probably in series.

In 1746–1748, Benjamin Franklin experimented with charging Leyden jars in series, and developed a system involving 11 panes of glass with thin lead plates glued on each side, and then connected together. He used the term &quot;electrical battery&quot; to describe his electrostatic battery in a 1749 letter about his electrical research in 1748. It is possible that Franklin&#x27;s choice of the word &quot;battery&quot; was inspired by the humorous wordplay at the conclusion of his letter, where he wrote, among other things, about a salute to electrical researchers from a battery of guns. This is the first recorded use of the term &quot;electrical battery&quot;. The multiple and rapid developments for connecting Leyden jars during the period 1746–1748 resulted in a variety of divergent accounts in secondary literature about who made the first &quot;battery&quot; by connecting Leyden jars, whether they were in series or parallel, and who first used the term &quot;battery&quot;. The term was later used for combinations of multiple electrochemical cells, the modern meaning of the term &quot;battery&quot;.

The Swedish physicist, chemist, and meteorologist Torbern Bergman translated much of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s writings on electricity into German and continued to study electrostatic properties.

Starting in late 1756, Franz Aepinus, in a complicated combination of independent work and collaboration with Johan Wilcke, developed an &quot;air condenser&quot;, a variation on the Leyden jar, by using air rather than glass as the dielectric. This functioning apparatus, without glass, created a problem for Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s explanation of the Leyden jar, which maintained that the charge was located in the glass.

== Design ==

A typical design consists of a glass jar with conducting tin foil coating the inner and outer surfaces. The foil coatings stop short of the mouth of the jar, to prevent the charge from arcing between the foils. A metal rod electrode projects through the nonconductive stopper at the mouth of the jar, electrically connected by some means (usually a hanging chain) to the inner foil, to allow it to be charged. The jar is charged by an electrostatic generator, or other source of electric charge, connected to the inner electrode while the outer foil is grounded. The inner and outer surfaces of the jar store equal but opposite charges.

The original form of the device is just a glass bottle partially filled with water, with a metal wire passing through a cork closing it. The role of the outer plate is provided by the hand of the experimenter. Soon John Bevis found (in 1747) that it was possible to coat the exterior of the jar with metal foil, and he also found that he could achieve the same effect by using a plate of glass with metal foil on both sides. These developments inspired William Watson in the same year to have a jar made with a metal foil lining both inside and outside, dropping the use of water.

Early experimenters (such as Benjamin Wilson in 1746) reported that the thinner the dielectric and the greater the surface, the greater the charge that could be accumulated.

Further developments in electrostatics revealed that the dielectric material was not essential, but increased the storage capability (capacitance) and prevented arcing between the plates. Two plates separated by a small distance also act as a capacitor, even in a vacuum.

== Storage of the charge ==

It was initially believed that the charge was stored in the water in early Leyden jars. In the 1700s American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin performed extensive investigations of both water-filled and foil Leyden jars, which led him to conclude that the charge was stored in the glass, not in the water. A popular experiment, due to Franklin, which seems to demonstrate this involves taking a jar apart after it has been charged and showing that little charge can be found on the metal plates, and therefore it must be in the dielectric. The first documented instance of this demonstration is in a 1749 letter by Franklin. Franklin designed a &quot;dissectible&quot; Leyden jar &quot;(right)&quot;, which was widely used in demonstrations. The jar is constructed out of a glass cup nested between two fairly snugly fitting metal cups. When the jar is charged with a high voltage and carefully dismantled, it is discovered that all the parts may be freely handled without discharging the jar. If the pieces are re-assembled, a large spark may still be obtained from it.

This demonstration appears to suggest that capacitors store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar. In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred to the surface of the glass cup by corona discharge when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the residual charge after the jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all the surface charge. Soda glass is hygroscopic and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge. Addenbrooke (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates. Zeleny (1944) confirmed these results and observed the corona charge transfer.

If a charged Leyden jar is discharged by shorting the inner and outer coatings and left to sit for a few minutes, the jar will recover some of its previous charge, and a second spark can be obtained from it. Often this can be repeated, and a series of 4 or 5 sparks, decreasing in length, can be obtained at intervals. This effect is caused by dielectric absorption.

== Capacity ==
The Leyden jar is a high-voltage device; it is estimated that at a maximum the early Leyden jars could be charged to 20,000 to 60,000 volts. The center rod electrode has a metal ball on the end to prevent leakage of the charge into the air by corona discharge. It was first used in electrostatics experiments, and later in high-voltage equipment such as spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy machines.

Originally, the amount of capacitance was measured in number of &#x27;jars&#x27; of a given size, or through the total coated area, assuming reasonably standard thickness and composition of the glass. A typical Leyden jar of one pint size has a capacitance of about 1 nF.

== Uses ==
Beginning in the late 18th century it was used in the medical field of electrotherapy to treat a variety of diseases by electric shock. By the middle of the 19th century, the Leyden jar had become common enough for writers to assume their readers knew of and understood its basic operation. Around the turn of the century it began to be widely used in spark-gap transmitters and medical electrotherapy equipment.

The development of the new technology of radio in the early 20th century encouraged the reduction in the size of Leyden jars as well as the reduction of undesired inductance and resistance. These improvements along with improved dielectrics caused the Leyden jar to evolve into the modern compact form of capacitor.

<text>The Lennon Wall () or John Lennon Wall (Czech: &quot;Zeď Johna Lennona&quot;), located at &quot;Velkopřevorské náměstí&quot; (Grand Priory Square), Malá Strana, is a historic legal graffiti wall in Prague, Czechia. After the 1980 murder of John Lennon a mural of Lennon was painted by an unknown artist onto the wall and as more people expanded upon it, the wall slowly became a place for free expression of then communist Czechoslovakia. It has historically been used for demonstrations and carries a central theme of John Lennon, but it also features designs relating to local and global causes such as global warming. The wall has also inspired other walls across the globe, such as the Hong Kong Lennon wall.

The wall is owned by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which until 2019 allowed all graffiti. As of the latest reconstruction, the wall exists as a semi-legal graffiti wall; spray painting has been banned and only some areas of the wall are allowed to be used by the public.

==History==

=== Under communist Czechoslovakia ===
Located in a secluded square across from the French Embassy, the wall had love poems and short messages against the communist Czechoslovak government since the 1960s, but the first message connected to John Lennon was painted following the 1980 assassination of Lennon, when an unknown artist painted a single image of the singer-songwriter and some lyrics onto a stone slab foundation of a former public fountain. Following this, a small memorial was created with candles, flowers, photographs and newspaper clippings talking about the murder. Western media was banned in the country at the time, therefore the image and memorial was seen by the authorities as representative of western culture and political resistance, thus in April 1981 it was painted over with green paint and removed by the Czechoslovak secret police who saw it as a protest against the government. The day after the wall was repainted it was filled with political messages, such as &quot;Palach would cry&quot;, and poems once again. The wall would be repainted and re-graffiti-ed after that, with cameras and over-night guards being stationed at the wall to prevent further attempts, but this was ultimately fruitless as the wall would always end up being marked anyway.

In 1988, the wall was a source of irritation for Gustáv Husák&#x27;s Marxist–Leninist government. Following a short-lived era of democratization and political liberalization known as the Prague Spring, the newly installed communist government dismantled the reforms, inspiring anger and resistance. Young Czechs wrote their grievances on the wall and, according to a report of the time, this led to a clash between hundreds of students and security police on the nearby Charles Bridge. The liberalization movement these students followed was described as Lennonism (not to be confused with Leninism), and Czech authorities described participants variously as alcoholic, mentally deranged, sociopathic, and agents of Western free market capitalism.

=== Post velvet revolution and contemporary developments ===
After the fall of the iron curtain and replacement of the communist government the wall continuously underwent change and the original portrait of Lennon was long lost under layers of new paint and graffiti.

On 17 November 2014, the 25th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, a group of art students called Prážská Služba repainted the wall to white leaving a single line of black text, “wall is over”. The Knights of Malta initially filed a criminal complaint for vandalism against the students, which they later retracted after contacting them.

On 22 April 2019, Earth Day, the environmentalist group Extinction Rebellion repainted the wall as a demand for the Czech government to act on climate change. The wall was almost entirely painted white, with the unpainted parts of the wall reading in large, negative space, block print letters &quot;Klimatická Nouze&quot; (). Members of the public were encouraged to add their own messages, resulting in calls for action painted in several languages. A large image of a skull was also painted. The repaint was carried out in a manner which allowed some of the existing artwork to be included on the new wall.

In July 2019, artists painted a memorial on the wall for Hong Kong democracy activist Marco Leung Ling-kit, who became known as a martyr and a symbol of hope for the 2019 anti-extradition bill protest movement. The image on the wall depicts the yellow raincoat he was wearing during the banner drop that eventually led to a fall from the building, along with some words of solidarity: “Hong Kong, Add oil.”

In October 2019, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the administrative district of Prague 1 started a reconstruction of the Lennon Wall. A representative of the Order of Malta, Johannes Lobkowicz, in regards to why the wall would be renovated, said &quot;Our goal was to stop the wall from being a cheap tourist attraction, where anyone could draw nonsense or vulgarisms. It wasn&#x27;t a dignified state [for the wall]&quot;. Under the direction of Czech designer Pavel Šťastný over 30 Czech and foreign professional artists painted the wall with new designs. During the renovation a central piece made of reflective metal with a black outline of John Lennon was also installed. The wall opened to the public on the 30th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, 7 November 2019, as an open-air gallery with new rules - busking and spraying was banned, marking the wall was now only allowed in the designated white zones and in impermanent materials e.g. pencils, markers, or chalk. Police and cameras were stationed at the wall to deter further spray painting and rule breaking.

At the same time as the wall was being renovated the wall was also declared a memorial site, this being the first time the wall was given an officially recognized status as an important landmark.

In July 2021, a new museum about the history of the Lennon Wall, the Lennon Wall Story, was opened on Prokopská Street 8. The museum features varying objects related to the wall, such as photos, historic objects and Beatles memorabilia.

On 15 May 2024 the Romani artist Maxim Muchow added a portrait of the late Romani singer Věra Bílá to the wall.

==Lennon Walls in Hong Kong==

During the 2014 democracy protests in Hong Kong, a similar Lennon Wall appeared along the staircase outside of the Hong Kong Central Government Offices. Inspired by the original in Prague, many thousands of people posted colourful post-it notes expressing democratic wishes for Hong Kong. The wall was one of the major arts of the Umbrella Movement. Throughout several months of occupation and protest, many efforts were made by different groups to ensure physical and digital preservation of the Hong Kong Lennon Wall.

Five years later, during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, the same wall was created again, with new post-it notes. Within days, dozens of post-it note Lennon Walls had &quot;blossomed everywhere&quot; (遍地開花) throughout Hong Kong, including on Hong Kong Island itself, Kowloon, the New Territories, and on the many outlying islands. There are even some Lennon Walls located inside government offices, including RTHK and the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office. According to a crowd-sourced map of Hong Kong, there are over 150 Lennon Walls throughout the region.

On 21 September 2019, police in Hong Kong began tearing down Lennon Walls across the city to remove anti-government statements.

Lennon Walls have also appeared outside of Hong Kong in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Seoul, Tokyo, Berlin, London, Sydney, Manchester, Melbourne, Taipei, and Auckland.

<doc id="18110" wikidata="Q65" url="?curid=18110" title="Los Angeles">
<text>Los Angeles, often referred to by its initials L.A., is the most populous city in the U.S. state of California. With an estimated 3,820,914 residents within the city limits , it is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is also the commercial, financial and cultural center of Southern California. Los Angeles has an ethnically and culturally diverse population, and is the principal city of a metropolitan area of 12.8 million people (2023). Greater Los Angeles, which includes the Los Angeles and Riverside–San Bernardino metropolitan areas, is a sprawling metropolis of over 18.3 million residents.

The majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about , and is the county seat and most populated city of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents . It is the third-most visited city in the U.S. with over 2.7 million visitors as of 2023.

The area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga. It became a part of the First Mexican Empire in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.

Los Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries. Despite a steep exodus of film and television production since the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles is still one of the largest hubs of American film production, the world&#x27;s largest by revenue; the city is an important site in the history of film. It also has one of the busiest container ports in the Americas. In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0 trillion, making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world, after New York and Tokyo. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028. Despite a business exodus from downtown Los Angeles since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city&#x27;s urban core is evolving as a cultural center with the world&#x27;s largest showcase of architecture designed by Frank Gehry.

==Toponymy==

On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as &quot;Los Pobladores&quot; founded the (town) they called . The original name of the settlement is disputed; the Guinness Book of World Records rendered it as &quot;El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula&quot;; other sources have shortened or alternate versions of the longer name.

The local English pronunciation of the name of the city has varied over time. A 1953 article in the journal of the American Name Society asserts that the pronunciation was established following the 1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the pronunciation emerged from a trend in California to give places Spanish, or Spanish-sounding, names and pronunciations. In 1908, librarian Charles Fletcher Lummis, who argued for the name&#x27;s pronunciation with a hard &quot;g&quot; (), reported that there were at least 12 pronunciation variants. In the early 1900s, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; advocated for pronouncing it &quot;Loce AHNG-hayl-ais&quot; (), approximating Spanish , by printing the respelling under its masthead for several years. This did not find favor.

Since the 1930s, has been most common. In 1934, the United States Board on Geographic Names decreed that this pronunciation be used by the federal government. This was also endorsed in 1952 by a &quot;jury&quot; appointed by Mayor Fletcher Bowron to devise an official pronunciation.

Common pronunciations in the United Kingdom include . Phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis described the most common one, , as a spelling pronunciation based on analogy to Greek words ending in &quot;-es&quot;, &quot;reflecting a time when the classics were familiar if Spanish was not&quot;.

==History==

===Indigenous history===

The settlement of Indigenous Californians in the modern Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley was dominated by the Tongva (now also known as the &quot;Gabrieleño&quot; since the era of Spanish colonization). The historic center of Tongva power in the region was the settlement of Yaanga (Tongva: &quot;Iyáangẚ&quot;), meaning &quot;place of the poison oak&quot;, which would one day be the site where the Spanish founded the Pueblo de Los Ángeles. &quot;Iyáangẚ&quot; has also been translated as &quot;the valley of smoke&quot;.

===Spanish rule===
Maritime explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542, while on an official military exploring expedition, as he was moving northward along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America. Gaspar de Portolà and Franciscan missionary Juan Crespí reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.

In 1771, Franciscan friar Junípero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, the first mission in the area. On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as &quot;Los Pobladores&quot; founded the (town) they called . The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the Mexican or (New Spain) settlers were mestizo or mulatto, a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry. The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents. Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.

===Mexican rule===

New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo now existed within the new Mexican Republic. During Mexican rule, Governor Pío Pico made Los Angeles the regional capital of Alta California. By this time, the new republic introduced more secularization acts within the Los Angeles region. In 1846, during the wider Mexican-American war, marines from the United States occupied the pueblo. This resulted in the siege of Los Angeles where 150 Mexican militias fought the occupiers which eventually surrendered.

Mexican rule ended during following the American Conquest of California, part of the larger Mexican-American War. Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. The Mexican Cession was formalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which ceded Los Angeles and the rest of Alta California to the United States.

===Post-Conquest era===
Railroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific line from New Orleans to Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885. Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country&#x27;s largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world&#x27;s petroleum output.

By 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000, putting pressure on the city&#x27;s water supply. The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, ensured the continued growth of the city. Because of clauses in the city&#x27;s charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join Los Angeles.

Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.

In 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world&#x27;s film industry was concentrated in L.A. The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.

By 1930, the population surpassed one million. In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.

===Post-WWII===

During World War II Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country&#x27;s major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, &quot;We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.&quot;

After the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley. The expansion of the state owned Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city&#x27;s privately owned electrified rail system, once the world&#x27;s largest.

As a consequence of World War II, suburban growth, and population density, many amusement parks were built and operated in this area. An example is Beverly Park, which was located at the corner of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega before being closed and substituted by the Beverly Center.

In the second half of the 20th century, Los Angeles substantially reduced the amount of housing that could be built by drastically downzoning the city. In 1960, the city had a total zoned capacity for approximately 10 million people. By 1990, that capacity had fallen to 4.5 million as a result of policy decisions to ban housing through zoning.

Racial tensions led to the Watts riots in 1965, resulting in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.

In 1969, California became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park.

In 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as the city&#x27;s first African American mayor, serving for five terms until retiring in 1993. Other events in the city during the 1970s included the Symbionese Liberation Army&#x27;s South Central standoff in 1974 and the Hillside Stranglers murder cases in 1977–1978.

In early 1984, the city surpassed Chicago in population, thus becoming the second largest city in the United States.

In 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous, and the second Olympics to turn a profit; the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, was the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.

Racial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots.

In 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths. The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.

===21st century===
In 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.

In 2022, Karen Bass became the city&#x27;s first female mayor, making Los Angeles the largest U.S. city to have ever had a woman as mayor.

In January 2025, a series of devastating wildfires caused by severe winds swept through Southern California, with the Pacific Palisades fire causing widespread destruction in Los Angeles&#x27; northwestern community of Pacific Palisades, with many calling it the most destructive in the history of the city of Los Angeles.

Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.

==Geography==
===Topography===

The city of Los Angeles covers a total area of , comprising of land and of water. The city extends for from north to south and for from east to west. The perimeter of the city is .

Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens at , located in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains at the north extent of the Crescenta Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.

Surrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches . Further afield, the highest point in southern California is San Gorgonio Mountain, east of downtown Los Angeles, with a height of .

The Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel. The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.

===Vegetation===
Los Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland. Native plants include: the California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not native to the City of Los Angeles.

Los Angeles has a number of official flora:
*the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (&quot;Erythrina afra&quot;)
*the official flower is the Bird of Paradise (&quot;Strelitzia reginae&quot;) 
*the official plant is toyon (&quot;Heteromeles arbutifolia&quot;)

===Fauna===
The city has an urban population of bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;). Mange is a common problem in this population. Although Serieys &quot;et al.&quot; 2014 find selection of immune genetics at several loci they do not demonstrate that this produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange outbreaks.

===Geology===

Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt. The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system, which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every 110 to 140 years, and seismologists have warned about the next &quot;big one&quot;, as the last major earthquake was the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes. Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. All but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast, which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960, Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake in 2011.

===Cityscape===
The city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods, some of which had been separately incorporated cities that eventually merged with Los Angeles. These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them.

====Overview====

The city&#x27;s street patterns generally follow a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; Sepulveda Boulevard is long, while Foothill Boulevard is over long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.

Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings, in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common in Los Angeles. The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall. However, downtown Los Angeles has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center.

===Climate===

Los Angeles has a two-season semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) with dry summers and very mild winters, but it receives more annual precipitation than most semi-arid climates, narrowly missing the boundary of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot; on the coast, &quot;Csa&quot; otherwise). Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around . Autumn months tend to be hot, with major heat waves a common occurrence in September and October, while the spring months tend to be cooler and experience more precipitation. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.

Temperatures in the coastal basin exceed on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September. Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over . The average annual temperature of the sea is , from in January to in August. Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.

Due to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region, the Los Angeles area contains a large number of distinct microclimates, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For example, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is whereas it is in Canoga Park, away. The city, like much of the Southern Californian coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called &quot;June Gloom&quot;. This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.

More recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained the city&#x27;s water security. Downtown Los Angeles averages of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a short string of dry years of rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than . Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Niño conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Niña episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.

Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979; freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was on January 15, 1932. While the most recent snowfall occurred in February 2019, the first snowfall since 1962, with snow falling in areas adjacent to Los Angeles as recently as January 2021. Brief, localized instances of hail can occur on rare occasions, but are more common than snowfall. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is , on January 4, 1949. Within the City of Los Angeles, the highest temperature ever officially recorded is , on September 6, 2020, at the weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Woodland Hills. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles, and raise wildfire risk.
===Environmental issues===

Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.

The smog season lasts from approximately May to October. While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.

The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution. In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution. The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city&#x27;s power from renewable sources in 2010. The American Lung Association&#x27;s 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation&#x27;s worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.

Los Angeles is also home to the nation&#x27;s largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells within of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.

==Demographics==

=== Total population, age and sex ===
The 2020 U.S. census reported Los Angeles had a population of 3,898,747.

===Race and ethnicity===

According to the 2020 census, 37.3% of Los Angeles population is White, while 15.7% is Mixed, 12.0% Asian, 8.5% Black, 1.2% Native American and 0.1% Pacific Islander. Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.
Mexican ancestry makes up the largest origin among descendants of American countries other than the United States at 31.9% of the city&#x27;s population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%) and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. Descendants of Mexicans and Central Americans have long established communities in Los Angeles and are spread throughout the entire city and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown, such as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake.

The largest Asian ethnic groups are Filipinos (3.2%) and Koreans (2.9%), which have their own established ethnic enclaves—Koreatown in the Wilshire Center and Historic Filipinotown. Chinese people, which make up 1.8% of Los Angeles&#x27;s population, reside mostly outside of Los Angeles city limits, in the San Gabriel Valley of eastern Los Angeles County, but make a sizable presence in the city, notably in Chinatown. Chinatown and Thaitown are also home to many Thais and Cambodians, which make up 0.3% and 0.1% of Los Angeles&#x27;s population, respectively. The Japanese comprise 0.9% of the city&#x27;s population and have an established Little Tokyo in the city&#x27;s downtown, and another significant community of Japanese Americans is in the Sawtelle district of West Los Angeles. Vietnamese make up 0.5% of Los Angeles&#x27;s population. Indians make up 0.9% of the city&#x27;s population. 

Los Angeles is also home to Caucasian and Middle Eastern communities, such as Armenians, Assyrians, and Iranians, many of whom live in enclaves like Little Armenia and Tehrangeles.

African Americans have been the predominant ethnic group in South Los Angeles, which has emerged as the largest African-American community in the western United States since the 1960s. The neighborhoods of South Los Angeles with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts. Since the 1990s, the growing cost of living in the city has most impacted the African American population. African Americans are the fastest declining population in the city and many of the formerly predominately African American neighborhoods have become much more diverse. There is also a sizable Eritrean and Ethiopian community in the Fairfax region.

Los Angeles has the second-largest Mexican, Armenian, Salvadoran, Filipino, and Guatemalan populations by city in the world, the third-largest Canadian population in the world, and has the largest Japanese, Iranian/Persian, Cambodian, and Romani (Gypsy) populations in the country. The Italian community is concentrated in San Pedro.

Most of Los Angeles&#x27; foreign-born population were born in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines and South Korea.

===Religion===
According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Christianity is the most prevalently practiced religion in Los Angeles (65%). The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles is the largest archdiocese in the country. Cardinal Roger Mahony, as the archbishop, oversaw construction of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002 in downtown Los Angeles.

In 2011, the once common, but ultimately lapsed, custom of conducting a procession and Mass in honor of Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles, in commemoration of the founding of the City of Los Angeles in 1781, was revived by the Queen of Angels Foundation and its founder Mark Albert, with the support of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as several civic leaders. The recently revived custom is a continuation of the original processions and Masses that commenced on the first anniversary of the founding of Los Angeles in 1782 and continued for nearly a century thereafter.

With 621,000 Jews in the metropolitan area, the region has the second-largest population of Jews in the United States, after New York City. Many of Los Angeles&#x27;s Jews now live on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley, though Boyle Heights once had a large Jewish population prior to World War II due to restrictive housing covenants. Major Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods include Hancock Park, Pico-Robertson, and Valley Village, while Jewish Israelis are well represented in the Encino and Tarzana neighborhoods, and Persian Jews in Beverly Hills. Many varieties of Judaism are represented in the greater Los Angeles area, including Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist. The Breed Street Shul in East Los Angeles, built in 1923, was the largest synagogue west of Chicago in its early decades; it is no longer in daily use as a synagogue and is being converted to a museum and community center. The Kabbalah Centre also has a presence in the city.

The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel was founded in Los Angeles by Aimee Semple McPherson in 1923 and remains headquartered there to this day. For many years, the church convened at Angelus Temple, which, at its construction, was one of the largest churches in the country.

Los Angeles has had a rich and influential Protestant tradition. The first Protestant service in Los Angeles was a Methodist meeting held in a private home in 1850 and the oldest Protestant church still operating, First Congregational Church, was founded in 1867. In the early 1900s the Bible Institute Of Los Angeles published the founding documents of the Christian Fundamentalist movement and the Azusa Street Revival launched Pentecostalism. The Metropolitan Community Church also had its origins in the Los Angeles area. Important churches in the city include First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Bel Air Presbyterian Church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, West Angeles Church of God in Christ, Second Baptist Church, Crenshaw Christian Center, McCarty Memorial Christian Church, and First Congregational Church.
The Hollywood region of Los Angeles also has several significant headquarters, churches, and the Celebrity Center of Scientology.

Because of Los Angeles&#x27;s large multi-ethnic population, a wide variety of faiths are practiced, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, Baháʼí, various Eastern Orthodox Churches, Sufism, Shintoism, Taoism, Confucianism, Chinese folk religion and countless others. Immigrants from Asia for example, have formed a number of significant Buddhist congregations making the city home to the greatest variety of Buddhists in the world. The first Buddhist joss house was founded in the city in 1875. Atheism and other secular beliefs are also common, as the city is the largest in the Western U.S. Unchurched Belt.

===Homelessness===
As of January 2020, there are 41,290 homeless people in the City of Los Angeles, comprising roughly 62% of the homeless population of LA County.

==Government==


Los Angeles is a charter city as opposed to a general law city. The current charter was adopted on June 8, 1999, and has been amended many times. The elected government consists of the Los Angeles City Council and the mayor of Los Angeles, which operate under a mayor–council government, as well as the city attorney (not to be confused with the district attorney, a county office) and controller. The mayor is Karen Bass. There are 15 city council districts.

The city has many departments and appointed officers, including the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), and the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL).

The charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90 neighborhood councils.

Residents of Los Angeles elect supervisors for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.

==Crime==

In 1992, the city of Los Angeles recorded 1,092 murders. Los Angeles experienced a significant decline in crime in the 1990s and late 2000s and reached a 50-year low in 2009 with 314 homicides. This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population—a major decrease from 1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD&#x27;s history. Los Angeles totaled 251 murders in 2013, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time online. In 2021, murders rose to the highest level since 2008 and there were 348.

In 2015, it was revealed that the LAPD had been under-reporting crime for eight years, making the crime rate in the city appear much lower than it really was.

The Dragna crime family and Mickey Cohen dominated organized crime in the city during the Prohibition era and reached its peak during the 1940s and 1950s with the &quot;Battle of Sunset Strip&quot; as part of the American Mafia, but has gradually declined since then with the rise of various black and Hispanic gangs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 45,000 gang members, organized into 450 gangs. Among them are the Crips and Bloods, which are both African American street gangs that originated in the South Los Angeles region. Latino street gangs such as the Sureños, a Mexican American street gang, and Mara Salvatrucha, which has mainly members of Salvadoran descent, as well as other Central American descents, all originated in Los Angeles. This has led to the city being referred to as the &quot;Gang Capital of America&quot;.

<text>Lepus is a constellation lying just south of the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for hare. It is located below—immediately south—of Orion (the hunter), and is sometimes represented as a hare being chased by Orion or by Orion&#x27;s hunting dogs.

Although the hare does not represent any particular figure in Greek mythology, Lepus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

== History and mythology ==

Lepus is most often represented as a hare being hunted by Orion, whose hunting dogs (Canis Major and Canis Minor) pursue it. The constellation is also associated with the Moon rabbit.

Four stars of this constellation (α, β, γ, δ Lep) form a quadrilateral and are known as &quot;‘Arsh al-Jawzā&#x27;&quot;, &quot;the Throne of Jawzā&#x27;&quot; or &quot;Kursiyy al-Jawzā&#x27; al-Mu&#x27;akhkhar&quot;, &quot;the Hindmost Chair of Jawzā&#x27;&quot; and &quot;al-Nihāl&quot;, &quot;the Camels Quenching Their Thirst&quot; in Arabic.

== Features ==

===Stars===
There are a fair number of bright stars, both single and double, in Lepus. Alpha Leporis, the brightest star of Lepus, is a white supergiant of magnitude 2.6, 1300 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name, Arneb (&quot;أرنب&quot; &quot;’arnab&quot;), means &quot;hare&quot; in Arabic. Beta Leporis, traditionally known as Nihal (Arabic for &quot;quenching their thirst&quot;), is a yellow giant of magnitude 2.8, 159 light-years from Earth. Gamma Leporis is a double star divisible in binoculars. The primary is a yellow star of magnitude 3.6, 29 light-years from Earth. The secondary is an orange star of magnitude 6.2. Delta Leporis is a yellow giant of magnitude 3.8, 112 light-years from Earth. Epsilon Leporis is an orange giant of magnitude 3.2, 227 light-years from Earth. Kappa Leporis is a double star divisible in medium aperture amateur telescopes, 560 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 4.4 and the secondary is a star of magnitude 7.4.

There are several variable stars in Lepus. R Leporis is a Mira variable star. It is also called &quot;Hind&#x27;s Crimson Star&quot; for its striking red color and because it was named for John Russell Hind. It varies in magnitude from a minimum of 9.8 to a maximum of 7.3, with a period of 420 days. R Leporis is at a distance of 1500 light-years. The color intensifies as the star brightens. It can be as dim as magnitude 12 and as bright as magnitude 5.5. T Leporis is also a Mira variable observed in detail by ESO&#x27;s Very Large Telescope Interferometer. RX Leporis is a semi-regular red giant that has a period of 2 months. It has a minimum magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum magnitude of 5.0.

===Deep-sky objects===
There is one Messier object in Lepus, M79. It is a globular cluster of magnitude 8.0, 42,000 light-years from Earth. One of the few globular clusters visible in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere&#x27;s winter, it is a Shapley class V cluster, which means that it has an intermediate concentration towards its center. It is often described as having a &quot;starfish&quot; shape.

M79 was discovered in 1780 by Pierre Méchain.

<text>Lupus is a constellation of the mid-Southern Sky. Its name is Latin for wolf. Lupus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations but was long an asterism associated with the just westerly, larger constellation Centaurus.

==History and mythology==

In ancient times, the constellation was considered an asterism within Centaurus, and was considered to have been an arbitrary animal, killed, or about to be killed, on behalf of, or for, Centaurus. An alternative visualization, attested by Eratosthenes, saw this constellation as a wineskin held by Centaurus. It was not separated from Centaurus until Hipparchus of Bithynia named it ( meaning &quot;beast&quot;) in the 2nd century BC. 

The Greek constellation is probably based on the Babylonian figure known as the Mad Dog (UR.IDIM). This was a strange hybrid creature that combined the head and torso of a man with the legs and tail of a lion (the cuneiform sign &#x27;UR&#x27; simply refers to a large carnivore; lions, wolves and dogs are all included). It is often found in association with the sun god and another mythical being called the Bison-man, which is supposedly related to the Greek constellation of Centaurus.

In Arab folk astronomy, Lupus, together with Centaurus were collectively called الشماريخ , meaning the dense branches of the date palm&#x27;s fruit.

Later, in Islamic Medieval astronomy, it was named السبع , which is a term used for any predatory wild beast (same as the Greek ), as a separate constellation, but drawn together with Centaurus. In some manuscripts of Al-Sufi&#x27;s Book of Fixed Stars and celestial globes, it was drawn as a lion; in others, it is drawn as a wolf, both conforming to the &quot;Sab&quot;&#x27; name.

In Europe, no particular animal was associated with it until the Latin translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s work identified it with the wolf.

== Characteristics ==

Lupus is bordered by six different constellations, although one of them (Hydra) merely touches at the corner. The other five are Scorpius (the scorpion), Norma (the right angle), Circinus (the compass), Libra (the balance scale), and Centaurus (the centaur). Covering 333.7 square degrees and 0.809% of the night sky, it ranks 46th of the 88 modern constellations. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Lup&quot;. The official constellation boundaries are defined by a twelve-sided polygon (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and, while the declination coordinates are between −29.83° and −55.58°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 34°N.

==Features==
===Stars===

Overall, there are 127 stars within the constellation&#x27;s borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. In his book &quot;Star Names and Their Meanings&quot;, R. H. Allen gave the names Yang Mun for Alpha Lupi, the brightest star in Lupus, and KeKwan for the blue giant Beta Lupi, both from Chinese. However, the first name is in error; both stars were part of a large Chinese constellation known in modern transliteration as Qíguān, the Imperial Guards.

Most of the brightest stars in Lupus are massive members of the nearest OB association, Scorpius–Centaurus.

Alpha Lupi is an ageing blue giant star of spectral type B1.5 III that is 460 ± 10 light-years distant from Earth. It is a Beta Cephei variable, pulsating in brightness by 0.03 of a magnitude every 7 hours and 6 minutes.

===Deep-sky objects===

Towards the north of the constellation are globular clusters NGC 5824 and NGC 5986, and close by the dark nebula B 228. To the south are two open clusters, NGC 5822 and NGC 5749, as well as globular cluster NGC 5927 on the eastern border with Norma. On the western border are two spiral galaxies and the Wolf–Rayet planetary nebula IC 4406, containing some of the hottest stars in existence. IC 4406, also called the Retina Nebula, is a cylindrical nebula at a distance of 5,000 light-years. It has dust lanes throughout its center. Another planetary nebula, NGC 5882, is towards the center of the constellation. The transiting exoplanet Lupus-TR-3b lies in this constellation. The historic supernova SN 1006 is described by various sources as appearing on April 30 to May 1, 1006, in the constellation of Lupus.

ESO 274-1 is a spiral galaxy seen from edge-on that requires an amateur telescope with at least 12 inches of aperture to view. It can be found by using Lambda Lupi and Mu Lupi as markers, and can only be seen under very dark skies. It is 9 arcminutes by 0.7 arcminutes with a small, elliptical nucleus.

<doc id="18113" wikidata="Q10484" url="?curid=18113" title="Lyra">
<text>, from ; pronounced: ) is a small constellation. It is one of the 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and is one of the modern 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence is sometimes referred to as Vultur Cadens or Aquila Cadens (&quot;Falling Vulture&quot; or &quot;Falling Eagle&quot;), respectively. Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by Draco, Hercules, Vulpecula, and Cygnus. Lyra is nearly overhead in temperate northern latitudes shortly after midnight at the start of summer. From the equator to about the 40th parallel south it is visible low in the northern sky during the same (thus winter) months.

Vega, Lyra&#x27;s brightest star, is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, and forms a corner of the famed Summer Triangle asterism. Beta Lyrae is the prototype of a class of binary stars known as Beta Lyrae variables. These binary stars are so close to each other that they become egg-shaped and material flows from one to the other. Epsilon Lyrae, known informally as the Double Double, is a complex multiple star system. Lyra also hosts the Ring Nebula, the second-discovered and best-known planetary nebula.

==History==
In Greek mythology, Lyra represents the lyre of Orpheus. Orpheus&#x27;s music was said to be so great that even inanimate objects such as rocks could be charmed. Joining Jason and the Argonauts, his music was able to quell the voices of the dangerous Sirens, who sang tempting songs to the Argonauts.

At one point, Orpheus married Eurydice, a nymph. While fleeing from an attack by Aristaeus, she stepped on a snake that bit her, killing her. To reclaim her, Orpheus entered the Underworld, where the music from his lyre charmed Hades, the god of the Underworld. Hades relented and let Orpheus bring Eurydice back, on the condition that he never once look back until outside. Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered and looked back, causing Eurydice to be left in the Underworld forever. Orpheus spent the rest of his life strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.

There are two main competing myths relating to the death of Orpheus. According to Eratosthenes, Orpheus failed to make a necessary sacrifice to Dionysus due to his regard for Apollo as the supreme deity instead. Dionysus then sent his followers to rip Orpheus apart. Ovid tells a rather different story, saying that women, in retribution for Orpheus&#x27;s rejection of marriage offers, ganged up and threw stones and spears. At first, his music charmed them as well, but eventually their numbers and clamor overwhelmed his music and he was hit by the spears. Both myths then state that his lyre was placed in the sky by Zeus and Orpheus&#x27;s bones were buried by the muses. In a third myth, he was killed by the Thracian women because he looked on the rites of Father Liber (Dionysus).

The Roman book , attributed to Hyginus, also records another myth about Lyra, which said that it belonged to Theseus &quot;for he was skilful in all the arts and seems to have learned the lyre as well&quot;. The book reports that the neighbouring constellation now known as Hercules was said to depict many different mythical figures, including Theseus, Orpheus, or the musician Thamyris. The proximity of these two constellations and Corona Borealis (perhaps a symbol of Theseus&#x27; royalty) could indicate that the three constellations were invented as a group.

Vega and its surrounding stars are also treated as a constellation in other cultures. The area corresponding to Lyra was seen by the Arabs as a vulture or an eagle diving with folded wings. In Wales, Lyra is known as King Arthur&#x27;s Harp (&quot;Talyn Arthur&quot;), and King David&#x27;s harp. The Persian Hafiz called it the Lyre of Zurah.
It has been called the Manger of the Infant Saviour, Praesepe Salvatoris. In Australian Aboriginal astronomy, Lyra is known by the Boorong people in Victoria as the Malleefowl constellation. Lyra was known as Urcuchillay by the Incas and was worshipped as an animal deity.

== Characteristics ==
Lyra is bordered by Vulpecula to the south, Hercules to the west, Draco to the north, and Cygnus to the east. Covering 286.5 square degrees, it ranks 52nd of the 88 modern constellations in size. It appears prominently in the northern sky during the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s summer, and the whole constellation is visible for at least part of the year to observers north of latitude 42°S. Its main asterism consists of six stars, and 73 stars in total are brighter than magnitude 6.5. The constellation&#x27;s boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a 17-sided polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between and . The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation &quot;Lyr&quot; for the constellation in 1922.

===Stars===
German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters alpha through nu to label the most prominent stars in the constellation. English astronomer John Flamsteed observed and labelled two stars each as delta, epsilon, zeta and nu. He added pi and rho, not using xi and omicron as Bayer used these letters to denote Cygnus and Hercules on his map.

The brightest star in the constellation is Vega (Alpha Lyrae), a main-sequence star of spectral type A0Va. Only 7.7 parsecs distant, Vega is a Delta Scuti variable, varying between magnitudes −0.02 and 0.07 over 0.2 days. On average, it is the second-brightest star of the northern hemisphere (after Arcturus) and the fifth-brightest star in all, surpassed only by Arcturus, Alpha Centauri, Canopus, and Sirius. Vega was the pole star in the year 12,000 BCE, and will again become the pole star around 14,000 CE.

Vega is one of the most magnificent of all stars, and has been called &quot;arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun&quot;. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed, as well as the first to have a clear spectrum recorded, showing absorption lines for the first time. The star was the first single main-sequence star other than the Sun to be known to emit X-rays, and is surrounded by a circumstellar debris disk, similar to the Kuiper Belt. Vega forms one corner of the famous Summer Triangle asterism; along with Altair and Deneb, these three stars form a prominent triangle during the northern hemisphere summer.

Vega also forms one vertex of a much smaller triangle, along with Epsilon and Zeta Lyrae. Zeta forms a wide binary star visible in binoculars, consisting of an Am star and an F-type subgiant. The Am star has an additional close companion, bringing the total number of stars in the system to three. Epsilon is a more famous wide binary that can even be separated by the naked eye under excellent conditions. Both components are themselves close binaries which can be seen with telescopes to consist of A- and F-type stars, and a faint star was recently found to orbit component C as well, for a total of five stars.

In contrast to Zeta and Epsilon Lyrae, Delta Lyrae is an optical double, with the two stars simply lying along the same line of sight east of Zeta. The brighter and closer of the two, Delta2 Lyrae, is a 4th-magnitude red bright giant that varies semiregularly by around 0.2 magnitudes with a dominant period of 79 days, while the fainter Delta1 Lyrae is a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an unknown secondary. Both systems, however, have very similar radial velocities, and are the two brightest members of a sparse open cluster known as the Delta Lyrae cluster.

South of Delta is Sulafat (Gamma Lyrae), a blue giant and the second-brightest star in the constellation. Around 190 parsecs distant, it has been referred to as a &quot;superficially normal&quot; star.

The final star forming the lyre&#x27;s figure is Sheliak (Beta Lyrae), also a binary composed of a blue bright giant and an early B-type star. In this case, the stars are so close together that the larger giant is overflowing its Roche lobe and transferring material to the secondary, forming a semidetached system. The secondary, originally the less massive of the two, has accreted so much mass that it is now substantially more massive, albeit smaller, than the primary, and is surrounded by a thick accretion disk. The plane of the orbit is aligned with Earth and the system thus shows eclipses, dropping nearly a full magnitude from its 3rd-magnitude baseline every 13 days, although its period is increasing by around 19 seconds per year. It is the prototype of the Beta Lyrae variables, eclipsing semidetached binaries of early spectral types in which there are no exact onsets of eclipses, but rather continuous changes in brightness.
Another easy-to-spot variable is the bright R Lyrae, north of the main asterism. Also known as 13 Lyrae, it is a 4th-magnitude red giant semiregular variable that varies by several tenths of a magnitude. Its periodicity is complex, with several different periods of varying lengths, most notably one of 46 days and one of 64 days. Even further north is FL Lyrae, a much fainter 9th-magnitude Algol variable that drops by half a magnitude every 2.18 days during the primary eclipse. Both components are main-sequence stars, the primary being late F-type and the secondary late G-type. The system was one of the first main-sequence eclipsing binaries containing G-type star to have its properties known as well as the better-studied early-type eclipsing binaries.

At the very northernmost edge of the constellation is the even fainter V361 Lyrae, an eclipsing binary that does not easily fall into one of the traditional classes, with features of Beta Lyrae, W Ursae Majoris, and cataclysmic variables. It may be a representative of a very brief phase in which the system is transitioning into a contact binary. It can be found less than a degree away from the naked-eye star 16 Lyrae, a 5th-magnitude A-type subgiant located around 37 parsecs distant.

The brightest star not included in the asterism and the westernmost cataloged by Bayer or Flamsteed is Kappa Lyrae, a typical red giant around 73 parsecs distant. Similar bright orange or red giants include the 4th-magnitude Theta Lyrae, Lambda Lyrae, and HD 173780. Lambda is located just south of Gamma, Theta is positioned in the east, and HD 173780, the brightest star in the constellation with no Bayer or Flamsteed designation, is more southernly. Just north of Theta and of almost exactly the same magnitude is Eta Lyrae, a blue subgiant with a near-solar metal abundance. Also nearby is the faint HP Lyrae, a post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star that shows variability. The reason for its variability is still a mystery: first cataloged as an eclipsing binary, it was theorized to be an RV Tauri variable in 2002, but if so, it would be by far the hottest such variable discovered.

In the extreme east is RR Lyrae, the prototype of the large class of variables known as RR Lyrae variables, which are pulsating variables similar to Cepheids, but are evolved population II stars of spectral types A and F. Such stars are usually not found in a galaxy&#x27;s thin disk, but rather in the galactic halo. Such stars serve as standard candles, and thus are a reliable way to calculate distances to the globular clusters in which they reside. RR Lyrae itself varies between magnitudes 7 and 8 while exhibiting the Blazhko effect. The easternmost star designated by Flamsteed, 19 Lyrae, is also a small-amplitude variable, an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable with a period of just over one day.

Another evolved star is the naked-eye variable XY Lyrae, a red bright giant just north of Vega that varies between 6th and 7th magnitudes over a period of 120 days. Also just visible to the naked eye is the peculiar classical Cepheid V473 Lyrae. It is unique in that it is the only known Cepheid in the Milky Way to undergo periodic phase and amplitude changes, analogous to the Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae stars. At 1.5 days, its period was the shortest known for a classical Cepheid at the time of its discovery. W and S Lyrae are two of the many Mira variables in Lyra. W varies between 7th and 12th magnitudes over approximately 200 days, while S, slightly fainter, is a silicate carbon star, likely of the J-type. Another evolved star is EP Lyrae, a faint RV Tauri variable and an &quot;extreme example&quot; of a post-AGB star. It and a likely companion are surrounded by a circumstellar disk of material.

Rather close to Earth at a distance of only is Gliese 758. The sunlike primary star has a brown dwarf companion, the coldest to have been imaged around a sunlike star in thermal light when it was discovered in 2009. Only slightly farther away is V478 Lyrae, an eclipsing RS Canum Venaticorum variable whose primary star shows active starspot activity.

One of the most peculiar systems in Lyra is MV Lyrae, a nova-like star consisting of a red dwarf and a white dwarf. Originally classified as a VY Sculptoris star due to spending most time at maximum brightness, since around 1979 the system has been dominantly at minimum brightness, with periodic outbursts. Its nature is still not fully understood. Another outbursting star is AY Lyrae, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova that has undergone several superoutbursts. Of the same type is V344 Lyrae, notable for an extremely short period between superoutbursts coupled with one of the highest amplitudes for such a period. The true nova HR Lyrae flared in 1919 to a maximum magnitude of 6.5, over 9.5 magnitudes higher than in quiescence. Some of its characteristics are similar to those of recurring novae.

===Deep-sky objects===

M57, also known as the &quot;Ring Nebula&quot; and NGC 6720, at a distance of 2,550 light-years from Earth is one of the best known planetary nebulae and the second to be discovered; its integrated magnitude is 8.8. It was discovered in 1779 by Antoine Darquier, 15 years after Charles Messier discovered the Dumbbell Nebula. Astronomers have determined that it is between 6,000 and 8,000 years old; it is approximately one light-year in diameter. The outer part of the nebula appears red in photographs because of emission from ionized hydrogen. The middle region is colored green; doubly ionized oxygen emits greenish-blue light. The hottest region, closest to the central star, appears blue because of emission from helium. The central star itself is a white dwarf with a temperature of 120,000 kelvins. In telescopes, the nebula appears as a visible ring with a green tinge; it is slightly elliptical because its three-dimensional shape is a torus or cylinder seen from a slight angle. It can be found halfway between Gamma Lyrae and Beta Lyrae.

Another planetary nebula in Lyra is Abell 46. The central star, V477 Lyrae, is an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary, consisting of a white dwarf primary and an oversized secondary component due to recent accretion. The nebula itself is of relatively low surface brightness compared to the central star, and is undersized for the primary&#x27;s mass for reasons not yet fully understood.

NGC 6791 is a cluster of stars in Lyra. It contains three age groups of stars: 4 billion year-old white dwarfs, 6 billion year-old white dwarfs and 8 billion year-old normal stars.

NGC 6745 is an irregular spiral galaxy in Lyra that is at a distance of 208 million light-years. Several million years ago, it collided with a smaller galaxy, which created a region filled with young, hot, blue stars. Astronomers do not know if the collision was simply a glancing blow or a prelude to a full-on merger, which would end with the two galaxies incorporated into one larger, probably elliptical galaxy.

A remarkable long-duration gamma-ray burst was GRB 050525A, which flared in 2005. The afterglow re-brightened at 33 minutes after the original burst, only the third found to exhibit such an effect in the timeframe, and unable to be completely explained by known phenomena. The light curve observed over the next 100 days was consistent with that of a supernova or even a hypernova, dubbed SN 2005nc. The host galaxy proved elusive to find at first, although it was subsequently identified.

===Exoplanets===
In orbit around the orange subgiant star HD 177830 is one of the earliest exoplanets to be detected. A jovian-mass planet, it orbits in an eccentric orbit with a period of 390 days. A second planet closer to the star was discovered in 2011. Visible to the naked eye are HD 173416, a yellow giant hosting a planet over twice the mass of Jupiter discovered in 2009; and HD 176051, a low-mass binary star containing another high-mass planet. Just short of naked-eye visibility is HD 178911, a triple system consisting of a close binary and a visually separable sunlike star. The sunlike star has a planet with over 6 Jupiter masses discovered in 2001, the second found in a triple system after that of 16 Cygni.

One of the most-studied exoplanets in the night sky is TrES-1b, in orbit around the star GSC 02652-01324. Detected from a transit of its parent star, the planet has around 3/4 the mass of Jupiter, yet orbits its parent star in only three days. The transits have been reported to have anomalies multiple times. Originally thought to be possibly due to the presence of an Earth-like planet, it is now accepted that the irregularities are due to a large starspot. Also discovered by the transit method is WASP-3b, with 1.75 times the mass of Jupiter. At the time of its discovery, it was one of the hottest known exoplanets, in orbit around the F-type main-sequence star WASP-3. Similar to TrES-1b, irregularities in the transits had left open the possibility of a second planet, although this now appears unlikely as well.

Lyra is one of three constellations (along with neighboring Cygnus and Draco) to be in the Kepler Mission&#x27;s field of view, and as such it contains many more known exoplanets than most constellations. One of the first discovered by the mission is Kepler-7b, an extremely low-density exoplanet with less than half the mass of Jupiter, yet nearly 1.5 times the radius. Almost as sparse is Kepler-8b, only slightly more massive and of a similar radius. The Kepler-20 system contains five known planets; three of them are only slightly smaller than Neptune, while the other two are some of the first Earth-sized exoplanets to be discovered. Kepler-37 is another star with an exoplanet discovered by Kepler; the planet is the smallest known extrasolar planet known as of February 2013.

In April 2013, it was announced that of the five planets orbiting Kepler-62, at least two—Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f—are within the boundaries of the habitable zone of that star, where scientists think liquid water could exist, and are both candidates for being a solid, rocky, earth-like planet. The exoplanets are 1.6 and 1.4 times the diameter of Earth respectively, with their star Kepler-62 at a distance of 1,200 light-years.
