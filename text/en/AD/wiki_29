<doc id="16032" wikidata="Q192841" url="?curid=16032" title="Julio-Claudian dynasty">
<text>The Julio-Claudian dynasty comprised the first five Roman emperors: Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.

This line of emperors ruled the Roman Empire, from its formation (under Augustus, in 27 BC) until the last of the line, Emperor Nero, committed suicide (in AD 68).

The name &quot;Julio-Claudian&quot; is a historiographical term, deriving from the two families composing the imperial dynasty: the Julii Caesares and Claudii Nerones.

==Nomenclature==
&quot;Julius&quot; and &quot;Claudius&quot; were two Roman family names; in classical Latin, they came second. Roman family names were inherited from father to son, but a Roman aristocrat could—either during his life or in his will—adopt an heir if he lacked a natural son. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, the adopted son would replace his original family name with the name of his adopted family. A famous example of this custom is Julius Caesar&#x27;s adoption of his great-nephew, Gaius Octavius.

Primogeniture is notably absent in the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Augustus, Caligula and Nero failed to father biological and legitimate sons. Tiberius&#x27; own son, Drusus predeceased him. Only Claudius was outlived by his son, Britannicus, although he opted to promote his adopted son Nero as his successor to the throne. Adoption ultimately became a tool that most Julio-Claudian emperors utilized in order to promote their chosen heir to the front of the succession. Augustus—himself an adopted son of his great-uncle, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar—adopted his stepson Tiberius as his son and heir. Tiberius was, in turn, required to adopt his nephew Germanicus, the father of Caligula and brother of Claudius. Caligula adopted his cousin Tiberius Gemellus (grandson of the emperor Tiberius) shortly before executing him. Claudius adopted his great-nephew and stepson Nero, who, lacking a natural or adopted son of his own, ended the reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty with his fall from power and subsequent suicide.

Augustus (&quot;Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus&quot;), as Caesar&#x27;s adopted son and heir, discarded the family name of his natural father and initially renamed himself &quot;Gaius Julius Caesar&quot; after his adoptive father. It was also customary for the adopted son to acknowledge his original family by adding an extra name at the end of his new name. As such, Augustus&#x27; adopted name would have been &quot;Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus&quot;. However, there is no evidence that he ever used the name Octavianus.

Following Augustus&#x27; ascension as the first emperor of the Roman Empire in 27 BC, his family became a &quot;de facto&quot; royal house, known in historiography as the &quot;Julio-Claudian dynasty&quot;. For various reasons, the Julio-Claudians followed in the example of Julius Caesar and Augustus by utilizing adoption as a tool for dynastic succession. The next four emperors were closely related through a combination of blood relation, marriage and adoption.

Tiberius (&quot;Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus&quot;), a Claudian by birth, became Augustus&#x27; stepson after the latter&#x27;s marriage to Livia, who divorced Tiberius&#x27; natural father in the process. Tiberius&#x27; connection to the Julian side of the Imperial family grew closer when he married Augustus&#x27; only daughter, Julia the Elder. He ultimately succeeded Augustus as emperor in AD 14 after becoming his stepfather&#x27;s adopted son and heir.

Caligula (&quot;Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus&quot;) was born into the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family, thereby making him the first actual &quot;Julio-Claudian&quot; emperor. His father, Germanicus, was the son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, the son of Livia and the daughter of Octavia Minor respectively. Germanicus was also a great-nephew of Augustus on his mother&#x27;s side and nephew of Tiberius on his father&#x27;s side. His wife, Agrippina the Elder, was a granddaughter of Augustus. Through Agrippina, Germanicus&#x27; children—including Caligula—were Augustus&#x27; great-grandchildren. When Augustus adopted Tiberius, the latter was required to adopt his brother&#x27;s eldest son as well, thus allowing Germanicus&#x27; side of the Imperial family to inherit the Julius nomen.

Claudius (&quot;Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus&quot;), the younger brother of Germanicus, was a Claudian on the side of his father, Nero Claudius Drusus, younger brother of Tiberius. However, he was also related to the Julian branch of the Imperial family through his mother, Antonia Minor. As a son of Antonia, Claudius was a great-nephew of Augustus. Moreover, he was also Augustus&#x27; step-grandson due to the fact that his father was a stepson of Augustus. Unlike Tiberius and Germanicus, both of whom were born as Claudians and became adopted Julians, Claudius was not adopted into the Julian family. Upon becoming emperor, however, he added the Julian-affiliated cognomen &quot;Caesar&quot; to his full name.

Nero (&quot;Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus&quot;) was a great-great-grandson of Augustus and Livia through his mother, Agrippina the Younger. The younger Agrippina was a daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, as well as Caligula&#x27;s sister. Through his mother, Nero was related by blood to the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family. However, he was born into the Domitii Ahenobarbi on his father&#x27;s side. Nero became a Claudian in name as a result of Agrippina&#x27;s marriage to her uncle, Claudius, who ultimately adopted her son as his own. He succeeded Claudius in AD 54, becoming the last direct descendant of Augustus to rule the Roman Empire. Within a year of Nero&#x27;s suicide in AD 68, the Julio-Claudian dynasty was succeeded by the Flavian emperors following a brief civil war over the vacant Imperial throne.

== Rise and fall of the Julio-Claudians ==
=== Augustus ===

Lacking any male child and heir, Augustus married his only child—a daughter—Julia to his nephew Marcus Claudius Marcellus. Marcellus, however, died of food poisoning in 23 BC. Augustus then married his widowed daughter to his loyal friend, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, previously married to Augustus&#x27; niece, the sister of Marcellus. This marriage produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Agrippina the Elder, and Agrippa Postumus.

Gaius and Lucius, the first two children of Julia and Agrippa, were adopted by Augustus and became heirs to the throne; however, Augustus also showed great favour toward his wife Livia&#x27;s two children from her first marriage: Tiberius and Drusus. They were successful military leaders who had fought against the barbarian Germanic tribes.

Agrippa died in 12 BC, and Tiberius was ordered by Augustus to divorce his wife Vipsania Agrippina, daughter of Agrippa by his first marriage, and marry his stepsister, the twice-widowed Julia. Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, died in 9 BC after falling from a horse. Tiberius shared in Augustus&#x27; tribune powers, but shortly thereafter, in 6 BC, he went into voluntary exile in Rhodes. After the early deaths of both Lucius (AD 2) and Gaius (AD 4) and the exile of both Julia the Elder and Younger for adultery, a turn of events which saw the elder Julia&#x27;s half brother Publius Cornelius Scipio exiled for treason, Mark Antony&#x27;s son Iullus Antonius committing suicide and Julia the Younger&#x27;s husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus being executed for conspiracy, Augustus was forced to recognize Tiberius as the next Roman emperor. Augustus banished his grandson Postumus Agrippa, who was adopted after the death of his brothers, to the small island of Planasia (around AD 6 or 7) where he was later executed, and Tiberius was recalled to Rome and officially adopted by Augustus. By Augustus&#x27; request, Tiberius adopted his nephew Germanicus, son of his late brother Drusus and biological great-nephew of Augustus through his mother. Germanicus subsequently married Augustus&#x27; granddaughter Agrippina.

===Tiberius===
On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died. Tiberius had already been established as Princeps in all but name, and his position as heir was confirmed in Augustus&#x27; will.

Despite his difficult relationship with the Senate, Tiberius&#x27; first years were generally good. He stayed true to Augustus&#x27;s plans for the succession and favoured his adopted son and nephew Germanicus over his natural son, Drusus, as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius&#x27; request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military zone of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from AD 14 to 16. Germanicus died in Syria in AD 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, of murdering him at Tiberius&#x27;s orders. With Germanicus dead, Tiberius began elevating his own son Drusus to replace him as the Imperial successor. By this time Tiberius had left more of the day-to-day running of the Empire to Lucius Aelius Sejanus.

Sejanus created an atmosphere of fear in Rome, controlling a network of informers and spies whose incentive to accuse others of treason was a share in the accused&#x27;s property after their conviction and death. Treason trials became commonplace; few members of the Roman aristocracy were safe. The trials played up to Tiberius&#x27; growing paranoia, which made him more reliant on Sejanus, as well as allowing Sejanus to eliminate potential rivals. Victims of this reign of terror related to the imperial family included Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus, second husband of Tiberius&#x27; first wife Vipsania, who had since died, and Decimus Haterius Agrippa, grandson of Agrippa and husband of Augustus&#x27; great-niece.

Tiberius, perhaps sensitive to this ambition, rejected Sejanus&#x27;s initial proposal to marry Livilla, Germanicus&#x27; sister and the widow of Tiberius&#x27; son Drusus the Younger, who had since died, in AD 25, but later had withdrawn his objections so that, in AD 30, Sejanus was betrothed to Julia Livia, daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger. Sejanus&#x27; family connection to the Imperial house was now imminent, and in AD 31 Sejanus held the Consulship with the emperor as his colleague, an honour Tiberius reserved only for heirs to the throne. When he was summoned to a meeting of the Senate later that year on 18 October AD 31, he probably expected to receive a share of the tribunician power. Instead, however, Tiberius&#x27; letter to the Senate, completely unexpectedly, requested the destruction of Sejanus and his faction. A purge followed, in which Sejanus and his most prominent supporters were killed. With Drusus dead and having had Germanicus&#x27; elder two sons Nero and Drusus convicted of treason and killed, along with their mother Agrippina, Tiberius appointed Caligula, Germanicus&#x27; youngest son, and Tiberius Gemellus, the son of Drusus the Younger and grandson of Tiberius, co-heirs. Drusus III&#x27;s wife Aemilia Lepida was later forced to commit suicide after being accused of adultery.

Rome&#x27;s second Emperor died at the port town of Misenum on 16 March AD 37, at the age of 78 years, having reigned for 23 years. Suetonius writes that the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard Naevius Sutorius Macro smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula&#x27;s accession. According to Suetonius, he was known for his cruelty and debauchery through his perversion on the island of Capri where he forced young boys and girls into orgies. On one account when one of the boys complained, Tiberius had his legs broken.

===Caligula===

Although Augustus&#x27; succession plans were all but ruined due to the deaths of more than several family members, including many of his own descendants, in the end, Tiberius remained faithful to his predecessor&#x27;s wishes that the next emperor would hail from the Julian side of the Imperial family. Thus, Tiberius was succeeded by Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the sole-remaining son of his nephew and adopted son Germanicus. The new emperor was a great grandson of Augustus through his mother Agrippina the Elder thus making him a Julian but he was also a Claudian through his father Germanicus being the son of Livia&#x27;s younger son Drusus the Elder. More commonly remembered in history by his childhood nickname Caligula, he was the third Roman Emperor ruling from AD 37 to 41.

When Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, Caligula was well-positioned to assume power, despite the obstacle of Tiberius&#x27;s will, which named him and his cousin Tiberius Gemellus as joint heirs. Caligula ordered Gemellus killed within his first year in power. Backed by Naevius Sutorius Macro, Caligula asserted himself as sole princeps, though he later had Macro disposed of as well. Following Gemellus&#x27; death, Caligula marked his brother-in-law, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, husband of his sister Julia Drusilla, as his heir. However, after Drusilla&#x27;s death, Lepidus was accused of having affairs with Caligula&#x27;s other sisters Agrippina the Younger and Julia Livilla and he was executed. He had previously had Drusilla&#x27;s first husband Lucius Cassius Longinus killed and upon the death of Agrippina&#x27;s husband Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, he seized his inheritance.

Several unsuccessful assassination attempts were made on Caligula&#x27;s life. The successful conspiracy that ended Caligula&#x27;s life was hatched by the disgruntled Praetorian Guard with backing by the Senate. The historian Josephus claims that the conspirators wished to restore the Republic while the historian Suetonius claims their motivations were mostly personal. On 24 January AD 41, the Praetorian tribune Cassius Chaerea and his men stopped Caligula alone in an underground passage leading to a theater. They stabbed him to death. Together with another tribune, Cornelius Sabinus, he killed Caligula&#x27;s wife Caesonia and their infant daughter Julia Drusilla on the same day.

===Claudius===

After Caligula&#x27;s death, the Senate attempted and failed to restore the Republic. Claudius, Caligula&#x27;s paternal uncle, became emperor by the instigation of the Praetorian Guards.

Despite his lack of political experience, and the disapproval of the people of Rome, Claudius proved to be an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the invasion of Britain in AD 43. He took a personal interest in the law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day; however, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his rule, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position—resulting in the deaths of many senators. Claudius also suffered tragic setbacks in his personal life. He married four times (to, in order, Plautia Urgulanilla, Aelia Paetina, Valeria Messalina and, finally, Agrippina the Younger) and is referenced by Suetonius as being easily manipulated. This is particularly evident during his marriage to Agrippina the Younger, his niece. Messalina saw several members of the dynasty eliminated, notably arranging for the executions of Claudius&#x27; nieces Julia Livilla, daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, and Julia Livia, daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger, as well as Julia Livilla&#x27;s husband Marcus Vinicius, her mother&#x27;s husband Appius Junius Silanus, Gaius Asinius Pollio, son of Tiberius&#x27; first wife Vipsania by her second husband and whose brother Servius Asinius Celer was also killed around this time, Claudius&#x27; son-in-law Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, and his parents Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi and Scribonia. Messalina herself was finally executed after being charged with adultery.

Claudius&#x27; reign also included several attempts on his life. In order to gain political support, he married Agrippina and adopted his great-nephew Nero.

With his adoption on 25 February AD 50, Nero became heir to the throne, over Claudius&#x27; own son Britannicus. Claudius died on 13 October AD 54, and Nero became emperor. A number of ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning Claudius, but details on these private events vary widely. These events are recounted in book 12 of the Annals of Tacitus, book 61 of Cassius Dio&#x27;s Roman History, and in the biographies of Nero and Claudius by Suetonius.

===Nero===

Nero became emperor in AD 54 at sixteen, the youngest emperor yet. Like his maternal uncle Caligula before him, Nero was also a direct descendant of Augustus, a fact which made his ascension to the throne much easier and smoother than it had been for Tiberius or Claudius. Ancient historians describe Nero&#x27;s early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina the Younger, his tutor Seneca, and the Praetorian Prefect Burrus, especially in the first year. In the first year of his reign, Nero had left all of the day-to-day running of the Empire to his mother Agrippina the Younger. He was made Emperor over his step-brother, Claudius&#x27; son Britannicus, who he had killed. Agrippina was believed to have poisoned Claudius, having allegedly poisoned her second husband Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus. She had also arranged the deaths of Caligula&#x27;s third wife, Lollia Paulina and Messalina&#x27;s mother Domitia Lepida the Younger. She saw that the dynasty&#x27;s numbers dwindle with the execution of Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, a grandson of Julia the Younger, to strengthen Nero&#x27;s claim, having previously arranged the death of his brother Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus. In AD 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was consul four times between AD 55 and 60. Nero consolidated power over time through the execution and banishment of his rivals and slowly usurped authority from the Senate. He reportedly arranged the death of his own mother and after divorcing his wife Claudia Octavia, daughter of Claudius&#x27; and Messalina, he had her killed. Other relatives whom Nero was believed to have had killed were Claudius&#x27; daughter by Aelia Paetina, Claudia Antonia, her husband and half-brother of Messalina, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus, brother of Marcus and Lucius Junius Silanus Torquantus, as well as Marcus&#x27; son, also named Lucius, his aunt Domitia Lepida the Elder, and Rubellius Plautus, son of Julia Livia along with his wife, children and father-in-law.

In AD 64 Rome burned. Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as large reconstruction projects. To fund this, the provinces were heavily taxed following the fire.

By AD 65, senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the Pisonian conspiracy, led by Gaius Calpurnius Piso, an adoptive descendant of Triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, a governor of Syria who committed suicide after being accused of killing Germanicus, and first husband of Livia Orestilla, Caligula&#x27;s second wife. The conspiracy failed and its members were executed. Vacancies after the conspiracy allowed Nymphidius Sabinus, a grandson of former imperial freedman Gaius Julius Callistus, who claimed to be an illegitimate son of Caligula, to rise in the Praetorian Guard.

In late AD 67 or early 68, Vindex, the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis in Gaul, rebelled against Nero&#x27;s tax policies. Lucius Virginius Rufus, the governor of superior Germany, was sent to put down the rebellion. To gain support, Vindex called on Galba, the governor of Hispania Citerior (in the Iberian Peninsula), to become emperor. Virginius Rufus defeated Vindex&#x27;s forces and Vindex committed suicide. Galba was declared a public enemy and his legion was confined in the city of Clunia.

Nero had regained the control of the empire militarily, but this opportunity was used by his enemies in Rome. Nymphidius Sabinus, who desired to become emperor himself, bribed the Praetorian Guard to betray Nero. Sabinus was later murdered in favour of Galba.

Nero reportedly committed suicide with the help of his scribe Epaphroditus. The Senate had been trying to preserve the dynastic bloodline by saving Nero&#x27;s life, and were additionally reluctant to let someone who was not of the family become emperor; however, once he had committed suicide, and with Galba marching on the city, it had no choice but to declare him a public enemy posthumously. With his death, the reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos then ensued in the Year of the Four Emperors.

===Survival after the fall of Nero===
The lineage of Augustus endured into the era of the Nerva-Antonine dynasty, the house that succeeded the Flavians. Augustus&#x27; bloodline outlived his dynasty through the descendants of his first granddaughter, Julia the Younger, who married Lucius Aemilius Paullus and gave birth to Aemilia Lepida. After marrying Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus, Aemilia gave birth to several children, including Junia Calvina and Junia Lepida. Although Calvina died childless, she was married to Lucius Vitellius, whose elder brother was the short-lived emperor Vitellius. Her younger sister, Junia Lepida, married Gaius Cassius Longinus and produced a daughter called Cassia Longina. The Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo married Cassia, who provided him with two daughters, including Domitia Longina, later wife of the emperor Domitian. By her first husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia Plautius Aelianus, Domitia Longina may have been the mother or maternal grandmother of Lucius Fundanius Lamia Aelianus. Fundanius married Rupilia, sister of Rupilia Faustina, and had a son, Lucius Plautius Lamia Silvanus, consul in AD 145, as well as a daughter, Fundania, married to Marcus Annius Libo, consul in AD 128. Fundania&#x27;s offspring included Marcus Annius Libo, suffect consul in AD 161, and Annia Fundania Faustina (d. AD 192), wife of Titus Pomponius Proculus Vitrasius Pollio. Faustina and both of her children, Titus Fundanius Vitrasius Pollio (d. AD 182) and Vitrasia Faustina, were executed by Commodus on the charge of conspiracy.

In addition to Cassia Longina, Junia Lepida gave birth to a son called Cassius Lepidus. Around AD 80 Lepidus had a daughter named Cassia Lepida, who married Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus, a descendant of Herod the Great, Ptolemy VI Philometor and Antiochus VIII Gryphus. Julia Cassia Alexandria, Lepida&#x27;s daughter by Berenicianus, married Gaius Avidius Heliodorus and ultimately gave birth to Gaius Avidius Cassius. Avidius Cassius had three children with his wife (named either Volusia Vettia or Volusia Maeciana); they were Avidius Heliodorus, Avidius Maecianus and Avidia Alexandra. In AD 175 Cassius was proclaimed emperor after he received erroneous news of the death of Marcus Aurelius, whose survival made Cassius a usurper of the empire. Cassius&#x27; rebellion ended three months into his bid for the throne when one of his centurions assassinated him in favour of Marcus Aurelius. Cassius&#x27; daughter, Avidia, is known to have had four children with her husband, Titius Claudius Dryantianus Antonius: the senator Claudius Cassius Aggripinus, Claudia Maeciana Alexandra, Claudia Vettia Agrippina, and Claudia Dryantilla Platonis, one of the women who took part in the &quot;ludi saeculares&quot; of the year AD 204.

Tiberius&#x27; lineage may have survived into the 2nd century through the offspring of his granddaughter Julia Livia, wife of Gaius Rubellius Blandus. Apart from a son, Rubellius Plautus, executed by Nero in AD 62, Julia had a daughter or step-daughter, Rubellia Bassa, who married a maternal uncle of the future Roman Emperor Nerva by the name of Gaius Octavius Laenas. Together Laenas and Bassa had at least one child, a surmised son, who was the grandfather of Sergius Octavius Laenas Pontianus, consul in AD 131. 
==Relationships among the rulers==

The great-uncle/great-nephew blood relationship and/or adopted son relationship was commonly found among the rulers of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

# Augustus was the great-nephew and posthumously adopted son of Julius Caesar; his mother Atia was the daughter of Caesar&#x27;s sister Julia.
# Caligula was the great-nephew and adoptive grandson (via the adoption of his father Germanicus) of Tiberius; his father was the son of Tiberius&#x27; brother Drusus.
# Claudius was the great-nephew of Augustus, as well as the nephew of Tiberius (and the only Julio-Claudian who was not adopted); his mother Antonia was the daughter of Augustus&#x27; sister Octavia, and his father Drusus was the brother of Tiberius.
# Nero was the great-nephew and adopted son of Claudius; his mother Agrippina, in addition to being married to Claudius, was the daughter of Claudius&#x27; brother Germanicus.

The other recurring relationship between emperor and successor is that of stepfather/stepson, a relationship not by blood but by marriage:
# Tiberius was Augustus&#x27; stepson due to the latter&#x27;s marriage to Livia Drusilla. He and his brother Drusus were Livia&#x27;s sons through her previous marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero.
# Nero, biological son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, became the stepson of his great-uncle Claudius when the emperor married his niece Agrippina the Younger.

The uncle/nephew relationship is also prominent:
# Tiberius was Claudius&#x27;s paternal uncle, being the older brother of Drusus, Claudius&#x27; father.
# Claudius was Caligula&#x27;s paternal uncle, being the younger brother of Germanicus, Caligula&#x27;s father. 
# Caligula was Nero&#x27;s maternal uncle, being the older brother of Agrippina the Younger, Nero&#x27;s mother.

There were several instances of Emperors being father-in-law and son-in-law to each other:
#Tiberius, in addition to being Augustus&#x27; stepson and adopted son, was married to Julia the Elder, daughter of Augustus.
#Nero, in addition to being Claudius&#x27; great-nephew, stepson and adopted son, was married to Claudia Octavia, daughter of Claudius.

The following bullet points illustrate the lineage of Julio-Claudian emperors (adoptions included; emperors in bold):
*Augustus, adopted son of Julius Caesar
**Tiberius, adopted son of Augustus
***Germanicus, adopted son of Tiberius
****Caligula, son of Germanicus
**Drusus, stepson of Augustus
***Claudius, son of Drusus
****Nero, adopted son of Claudius

No Julio-Claudian emperor was a blood descendant of his immediate predecessor. Although Tiberius and Claudius had potential heirs (Tiberius Gemellus, grandson of Tiberius through his son Drusus, and Britannicus, son of Claudius, respectively) available for the succession, both were, in turn, ultimately succeeded by their great-nephews Caligula and Nero, respectively.

The fact that ordinary father-son (or grandfather-grandson) succession did not occur has contributed to the image of the Julio-Claudian court presented in Robert Graves&#x27;s &quot;I, Claudius&quot; as a dangerous world where scheming family members were all too ready to murder the direct heirs so as to bring themselves, their own immediate families, or their lovers closer to the succession.

<doc id="16034" wikidata="Q1059659" url="?curid=16034" title="Johnson solid">
<text>In geometry, a Johnson solid, sometimes also known as a Johnson–Zalgaller solid, is a convex polyhedron whose faces are regular polygons. They are sometimes defined to exclude the uniform polyhedrons. There are ninety-two solids with such a property: the first solids are the pyramids, cupolas. and a rotunda; some of the solids may be constructed by attaching with those previous solids, whereas others may not. These solids are named after mathematicians Norman Johnson and Victor Zalgaller.

== Definition and background ==

A Johnson solid is a convex polyhedron whose faces are all regular polygons. The convex polyhedron means as bounded intersections of finitely many half-spaces, or as the convex hull of finitely many points. Although there is no restriction that any given regular polygon cannot be a face of a Johnson solid, some authors required that Johnson solids are not uniform. This means that a Johnson solid is not a Platonic solid, Archimedean solid, prism, or antiprism. A convex polyhedron in which all faces are nearly regular, but some are not precisely regular, is known as a near-miss Johnson solid.

The Johnson solid, sometimes known as Johnson–Zalgaller solid, was named after two mathematicians Norman Johnson and Victor Zalgaller. published a list including ninety-two Johnson solids—excluding the five Platonic solids, the thirteen Archimedean solids, the infinitely many uniform prisms, and the infinitely many uniform antiprisms—and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only ninety-two, but he did conjecture that there were no others. proved that Johnson&#x27;s list was complete.

== Naming and enumeration ==
The naming of Johnson solids follows a flexible and precise descriptive formula that allows many solids to be named in multiple different ways without compromising the accuracy of each name as a description. Most Johnson solids can be constructed from the first few solids (pyramids, cupolae, and a rotunda), together with the Platonic and Archimedean solids, prisms, and antiprisms; the center of a particular solid&#x27;s name will reflect these ingredients. From there, a series of prefixes are attached to the word to indicate additions, rotations, and transformations:
* &quot;Bi-&quot; indicates that two copies of the solid are joined base-to-base. For cupolae and rotundas, the solids can be joined so that either like faces (&quot;ortho-&quot;) or unlike faces (&quot;gyro-&quot;) meet. Using this nomenclature, a pentagonal bipyramid is a solid constructed by attaching two bases of pentagonal pyramids. Triangular orthobicupola is constructed by two triangular cupolas along their bases.
* &quot;Elongated&quot; indicates a prism is joined to the base of the solid, or between the bases; &quot;gyroelongated&quot; indicates an antiprism. &quot;Augmented&quot; indicates another polyhedron, namely a pyramid or cupola, is joined to one or more faces of the solid in question.
*&quot;Diminished&quot; indicates a pyramid or cupola is removed from one or more faces of the solid in question.
*&quot;Gyrate&quot; indicates a cupola mounted on or featured in the solid in question is rotated such that different edges match up, as in the difference between ortho- and gyrobicupolae.

The last three operations—&quot;augmentation&quot;, &quot;diminution&quot;, and &quot;gyration&quot;—can be performed multiple times for certain large solids. &quot;Bi-&quot; &amp; &quot;Tri-&quot; indicate a double and triple operation respectively. For example, a &quot;bigyrate&quot; solid has two rotated cupolae, and a &quot;tridiminished&quot; solid has three removed pyramids or cupolae. In certain large solids, a distinction is made between solids where altered faces are parallel and solids where altered faces are oblique. &quot;Para-&quot; indicates the former, that the solid in question has altered parallel faces, and &quot;meta-&quot; the latter, altered oblique faces. For example, a &quot;parabiaugmented&quot; solid has had two parallel faces augmented, and a &quot;metabigyrate&quot; solid has had two oblique faces gyrated.

The last few Johnson solids have names based on certain polygon complexes from which they are assembled. These names are defined by Johnson with the following nomenclature:
*A &quot;lune&quot; is a complex of two triangles attached to opposite sides of a square.
*&quot;Spheno&quot;- indicates a wedgelike complex formed by two adjacent lunes. &quot;Dispheno-&quot; indicates two such complexes.
*&quot;Hebespheno&quot;- indicates a blunt complex of two lunes separated by a third lune.
*&quot;Corona&quot; is a crownlike complex of eight triangles.
*&quot;Megacorona&quot; is a larger crownlike complex of twelve triangles.
*The suffix -&quot;cingulum&quot; indicates a belt of twelve triangles.

The enumeration of Johnson solids may be denoted as formula_1, where formula_2 denoted the list&#x27;s enumeration (an example is formula_3 denoted the first Johnson solid, the equilateral square pyramid). The following is the list of ninety-two Johnson solids, with the enumeration followed according to the list of :
Some of the Johnson solids may be categorized as elementary polyhedra. This means the polyhedron cannot be separated by a plane to create two small convex polyhedra with regular faces; examples of Johnson solids are the first six Johnson solids—square pyramid, pentagonal pyramid, triangular cupola, square cupola, pentagonal cupola, and pentagonal rotunda—tridiminished icosahedron, parabidiminished rhombicosidodecahedron, tridiminished rhombicosidodecahedron, snub disphenoid, snub square antiprism, sphenocorona, sphenomegacorona, hebesphenomegacorona, disphenocingulum, bilunabirotunda, and triangular hebesphenorotunda. The other Johnson solids are composite polyhedron because they are constructed by attaching some elementary polyhedra.

== Properties ==
As the definition above, a Johnson solid is a convex polyhedron with regular polygons as their faces. However, there are several properties possessed by each of them.
* All but five of the 92 Johnson solids are known to have the Rupert property, meaning that it is possible for a larger copy of themselves to pass through a hole inside of them. The five which are not known to have this property are: gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, parabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, metabigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, trigyrate rhombicosidodecahedron, and paragyrate diminished rhombicosidodecahedron.
* From all of the Johnson solids, the elongated square gyrobicupola (also called the pseudorhombicuboctahedron) is unique in being locally vertex-uniform: there are four faces at each vertex, and their arrangement is always the same: three squares and one triangle. However, it is not vertex-transitive, as it has different isometry at different vertices, making it a Johnson solid rather than an Archimedean solid.

<doc id="16036" wikidata="Q326542" url="?curid=16036" title="John Peel">
<text>John Robert Parker Ravenscroft (30 August 1939 – 25 October 2004), better known as John Peel, was an English radio presenter and journalist. He was the longest-serving of the original disc jockeys on BBC Radio 1, broadcasting regularly from 1967 until his death in 2004.

Peel was one of the first broadcasters to play psychedelic rock and progressive rock records on British radio. He is widely acknowledged for promoting artists of many genres, including pop, dub reggae, punk rock and post-punk, electronic music and dance music, indie rock, extreme metal and British hip hop. Fellow DJ Paul Gambaccini described Peel as &quot;the most important single person in popular music from approximately 1967 through 1978. He broke more important artists than any individual.&quot;

Peel&#x27;s Radio 1 shows were notable for the regular &quot;Peel Sessions&quot;, which usually consisted of four songs recorded by an artist in the BBC&#x27;s studios, often providing the first major national coverage to bands that later achieved fame. The annual Festive Fifty countdown of his listeners&#x27; favourite records of the year was a notable part of his promotion of new music.

Peel appeared on television occasionally as one of the presenters of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the 1980s, and provided voice-over commentary for a number of BBC programmes. He became popular with the audience of BBC Radio 4 for his &quot;Home Truths&quot; programme, which ran from the 1990s, featuring unusual stories from listeners&#x27; domestic lives.

== Early life ==
Peel was born John Robert Parker Ravenscroft at a nursing home in Heswall on 30 August 1939, the son of Joan Mary (née Swainson) and cotton merchant Robert Leslie Ravenscroft. He had two younger brothers and grew up in the nearby village of Burton. He was educated as a boarder at Shrewsbury School, where future Monty Python member Michael Palin was his contemporary. In his posthumously published autobiography, Peel said that he was raped by an older pupil while at the school.

Peel was an avid radio listener and record collector from an early age, firstly of music offered by the American Forces Network and Radio Luxembourg. He recalled an early desire to host a radio programme of his own &quot;so that I could play music that I heard and wanted others to hear&quot;. His housemaster, R. H. J. Brooke, whom Peel described as &quot;extraordinarily eccentric&quot; and &quot;amazingly perceptive&quot;, wrote on one of his school reports, &quot;Perhaps it&#x27;s possible that John can form some kind of nightmarish career out of his enthusiasm for unlistenable records and his delight in writing long and facetious essays.&quot;

Peel completed his national service in 1959 in the Royal Artillery as a B2 radar operator. Afterwards, he worked as a mill operative at Townhead Mill in Rochdale and returned each weekend to Heswall on a scooter borrowed from his sister. While in Rochdale during the week, he stayed in a bed-and-breakfast in the area of Milkstone Road and Drake Street, and developed long-term associations with the town as the years progressed.

== Career ==
=== United States ===
In 1960, aged 21, Peel went to the United States to work for a cotton producer who had business dealings with his father. He took a number of other jobs afterwards, including working as a travelling insurance salesman. While in Dallas, Texas, where the insurance company he worked for was based, he conversed with the presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, and his running mate Lyndon B. Johnson, who were touring the city during the 1960 election campaign, and took photographs of them. Following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963, Peel passed himself off as a reporter for the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; in order to attend the arraignment of Lee Harvey Oswald. He and a friend can be seen in the footage of the 22/23 November midnight press conference at the Dallas Police Department when Oswald was paraded before the media. He later phoned in the story to the &quot;Echo&quot;.

While working for the insurance company, Peel wrote programs for punched card entry for an IBM 1410 computer (which led to his entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; noting him as a former computer programmer), and he got his first radio job working unpaid for WRR (AM) in Dallas. There, he presented the second hour of the Monday night programme &quot;Kat&#x27;s Karavan&quot;, which was primarily hosted by the American singer and radio personality Jim Lowe. Following this, and as Beatlemania hit the United States, Peel was hired by the Dallas radio station KLIF as the official Beatles correspondent on the strength of his connection to Liverpool. He later worked for KOMA in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, until 1965, when he moved to KMEN in San Bernardino, California, and used his birth name, John Ravenscroft, to present the breakfast show.

=== Return to England ===
Peel returned to England in early 1967 and found work with the offshore pirate radio station Radio London. He was offered the midnight-to-two shift, which gradually developed into a programme, &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;.

Peel&#x27;s show was an outlet for the music of the UK underground scene. He played classic blues, folk music and psychedelic rock, with an emphasis on the new music emerging from Los Angeles and San Francisco. As important as the musical content of the programme was the personal – sometimes confessional – tone of Peel&#x27;s presentation, and the listener participation it engendered. Underground events he had attended during his periods of shore leave, such as the UFO Club and the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, together with causes célèbres like the drug busts of the Rolling Stones and John &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins, were discussed between records. All this was far removed from Radio London&#x27;s daytime format. Listeners sent Peel letters, poems and records from their own collections so that the programme became a vehicle for two-way communication; by the final week of Radio London he was receiving far more mail than any other DJ on the station.

After the closure of Radio London in 1967, Peel wrote a column, &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot;, for the underground newspaper the &quot;International Times&quot; (from autumn 1967 to mid-1969).

=== BBC ===
When Radio London closed on 14 August 1967, Peel joined the BBC&#x27;s new music station, BBC Radio 1, which was first broadcast on 30 September 1967. Unlike Big L, Radio 1 was not a full-time station but a broadcaster of a mixture of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel said he felt he was hired because the BBC &quot;had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn&#x27;t anybody else&quot;. Peel presented a programme called &quot;Top Gear.&quot; At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of &quot;Top Gear.&quot; He presented the show until it ended in 1975. 

In 1969, after hosting a trailer for a BBC programme on VD on his &quot;Night Ride&quot; programme, Peel received significant media attention because he divulged on air that he had suffered from a sexually transmitted disease earlier that year. This admission was later used in an attempt to discredit him when he appeared as a defence witness in the 1971 &quot;Oz&quot; obscenity trial.

The &quot;Night Ride&quot; programme, advertised by the BBC as an exploration of words and music, seemed to take up from where &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; had left off. It featured rock, folk, blues, classical and electronic music. A unique feature of the programme was the inclusion of tracks, mostly of exotic non-Western music, drawn from the BBC Sound Archive; the most popular of these were gathered on a BBC Records LP, &quot;John Peel&#x27;s Archive Things&quot; (1970). &quot;Night Ride&quot; also featured poetry readings and numerous interviews with a wide range of guests, including his friends Marc Bolan, journalist and musician Mick Farren, poet Pete Roche, singer-songwriter Bridget St John and stars such as the Byrds, the Rolling Stones and John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The programme captured much of the creative activity of the underground scene. Its anti-establishment stance and unpredictability, however, did not find approval with the BBC hierarchy and it ended in September 1969 after 18 months. 

In his sleeve notes to the &quot;Archive Things&quot; LP Peel calls the free-form nature of &quot;Night Ride&quot; his preferred radio format. His subsequent shows featured a mixture of records and live sessions, a format that would characterise his Radio 1 programmes for the rest of his career.

=== Punk era ===
Peel&#x27;s enthusiasm for music outside the mainstream occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters and asked him to confirm that the show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) had read about in the press and of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters&#x27; reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.

In a 1990 interview, Peel recalled his 1976 discovery of the first album by New York punk band the Ramones as a seminal event,

In 1979, Peel stated: &quot;They leave you to get on with it. I&#x27;m paid money by the BBC not to go off and work for a commercial radio station ... I wouldn&#x27;t want to go to one anyway, because they wouldn&#x27;t let me do what the BBC let me do.&quot;
Peel&#x27;s reputation as an important DJ who broke unsigned acts into the mainstream was such that young hopefuls sent him an enormous number of records, CDs, and tapes. When he returned home from a three-week holiday at the end of 1986 there were 173 LPs, 91 12&quot;s and 179 7&quot;s waiting for him. In 1983 Alan Melina and Jeff Chegwin, the music publishers for unsigned artist Billy Bragg, drove to the Radio 1 studios with a mushroom biryani and a copy of his record after hearing Peel mention that he was hungry; the subsequent airplay launched Billy Bragg&#x27;s career.

In addition to his Radio 1 show, Peel broadcast as a disc jockey on the BBC World Service, on the British Forces Broadcasting Service (&quot;John Peel&#x27;s Music on BFBS&quot;) for 30 years, VPRO Radio3 in the Netherlands, YLE Radio Mafia in Finland, Ö3 in Austria (Nachtexpress), and on Radio 4U, Radio Eins (Peel ...), Radio Bremen (Ritz) and some independent radio stations around FSK Hamburg in Germany. As a result of his BFBS programme he was voted, in Germany, &quot;Top DJ in Europe&quot;.

Peel was an occasional presenter of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC1 from the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, and in particular from 1982 to 1987 when he appeared regularly. In 1971 he appeared not as presenter but performer, alongside Rod Stewart and the Faces, pretending to play mandolin on &quot;Maggie May&quot;. He often presented the BBC&#x27;s television coverage of music events, notably the Glastonbury Festival.

From 26 September to 31 October 1987, Peel produced a six-part radio series on BBC Radio 1 called &quot;Peeling Back the Years&quot;. In it, he discussed his life and career at length with his long-time producer John Walters and also played some of his favorite records. The show&#x27;s theme music was &quot;Blue Tango&quot; by Ray Martin which, Peel revealed, was the first record he ever bought.

=== Later years ===
Between 1995 and 1997, Peel presented &quot;Offspring&quot;, a show about children, on BBC Radio 4. In 1998, &quot;Offspring&quot; grew into the magazine-style documentary show &quot;Home Truths&quot;. When he took on the job presenting the programme, which was about everyday life in British families, Peel requested that it be free from celebrities, as he found real-life stories more entertaining. &quot;Home Truths&quot; was described by occasional stand-in presenter John Walters as being &quot;about people who had fridges called Renfrewshire&quot;. Peel also made regular contributions to BBC Two&#x27;s humorous look at the irritations of modern life &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;. His only appearances in an acting role in film or television were in Harry Enfield&#x27;s &quot;Smashie and Nicey: The End of an Era&quot; as John Past Bedtime, and in 1999 as a &quot;grumpy old man who catalogues records&quot; in the film &quot;Five Seconds to Spare&quot;. However, he had provided narration for others.

He appeared as a celebrity guest on a number of TV shows, including &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; (1996, BBC), &quot;Travels With My Camera&quot; (1996, Channel 4 TV) and &quot;Going Home&quot; (2002, ITV TV), and presented the 1997 Channel 4 series &quot;Classic Trains&quot;. He was also in demand as a voice-over artist for television documentaries, such as BBC One&#x27;s &quot;A Life of Grime&quot;.

In April 2003, the publishers Transworld successfully wooed Peel with a package worth £1.5 million for his autobiography, having placed an advert in a national newspaper aimed only at Peel. Unfinished at the time of his death, it was completed by Sheila and journalist Ryan Gilbey. It was published in October 2005 under the title &quot;Margrave of the Marshes&quot;. A collection of Peel&#x27;s miscellaneous writings, &quot;The Olivetti Chronicles&quot;, was published in 2008.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
At the age of 25, while residing in Dallas in 1965, Peel married 15-year-old American girl Shirley Anne Milburn. The marriage was never happy, with reports that she was often violent towards him. Although she accompanied Peel back to England in 1967, they were soon separated and the divorce became final in 1973. In 1987, Milburn took her own life.

Peel married Sheila Gilhooly on 31 August 1974. The reception was held at Regent&#x27;s Park, with Rod Stewart as best man. In the 1970s, Peel and Gilhooly moved to &quot;Peel Acres&quot;, a thatched cottage in Great Finborough. In later years, Peel broadcast many of his shows from a studio in the house, with Gilhooly and their children often being involved or at least mentioned. Peel&#x27;s passion for Liverpool FC was reflected in his children&#x27;s names: William Robert Anfield Ravenscroft, Alexandra Mary Anfield Ravenscroft, Thomas James Dalglish Ravenscroft, and Florence Victoria Shankly Ravenscroft. Thomas, now better known as Tom Ravenscroft, also became a radio DJ.

=== Health problems ===
At the age of 62, in 2001, Peel was diagnosed with diabetes following many years of fatigue.

=== Allegations of sexual misconduct ===
Peel has been accused of sexual misconduct, although he was never charged with any offences. The journalists Sarah Woolley and Fiona Sturges, in &quot;The Independent&quot;, cite Peel&#x27;s first marriage to Milburn in 1965 as an example, as Milburn was aged 15 and Peel 25 when they married; this was legal in Texas at the time.

Peel told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1975, regarding his relations with young women, &quot;All they wanted me to do was abuse them, sexually, which, of course, I was only too happy to do.&quot; He told &quot;The Sunday Correspondent&quot; in 1989, &quot;Girls used to queue up outside. By and large not usually for shagging. Oral sex they were particularly keen on, I remember. [...] One of my, er, regular customers, as it were, turned out to be 13, though she looked older.&quot; He jokingly added that he &quot;didn&#x27;t ask for ID&quot;. An interview originally published in &quot;The Herald&quot; in April 2004 stated that he admitted to sexual contact with &quot;an awful lot&quot; of underage girls. He said that the only available women in the early 1960s were in high school.

In 2012 a woman stated that she had a three-month affair with Peel in 1969, when she was 15 and he was 30. She said they had unprotected sex; this was shortly after Peel discussed contracting a sexually transmitted disease. The relationship resulted in a &quot;traumatic&quot; abortion. She stated that, &quot;Looking back, it was terribly wrong and I was perhaps manipulated.&quot;

In July 2022 a petition was launched to rename the &quot;John Peel Stage&quot; at the Glastonbury Festival, because of the accusations. In 2023 the stage was renamed &quot;Woodsies&quot;. Emily Eavis, co-organiser of the festival, said the name change &quot;was not related to a recent petition&quot;.

== Death ==
On 25 October 2004, during a working holiday in the Peruvian city of Cusco, Peel suffered a heart attack and died suddenly at the age of 65. Shortly after the announcement of his death, fans and supporters paid tribute to him. The following day, BBC Radio 1 cleared its schedule to broadcast a day of tributes. London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; boards that afternoon read &quot;the day the music died&quot;, quoting Don McLean&#x27;s hit &quot;American Pie&quot;.

Peel had often spoken wryly of his eventual death. He once said on the Channel 4 miniseries &quot;Sounds of the Suburbs&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve always imagined I&#x27;d die by driving into the back of a truck while trying to read the name on a cassette and people would say, &#x27;He would have wanted to go that way.&#x27; Well, I want them to know that I wouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

Peel once said that if he died before his producer John Walters, he wanted Walters to play Roy Harper&#x27;s song &quot;When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease&quot;. Walters had died in 2001, leaving Andy Kershaw to end his tribute programme to Peel on BBC Radio 3 with the song. Peel&#x27;s stand-in on his Radio 1 slot, Rob da Bank, also played the song at the start of the final show before his funeral. Another time, Peel said he would like to be remembered with a gospel song. He stated that the final record he would play would be the C. L. Franklin sermon &quot;Dry Bones in the Valley&quot;.

On his &quot;Home Truths&quot; BBC radio show, Peel once commented about his own death: &quot;I definitely want to be buried, although not yet. I&#x27;m 61 on Wednesdayjust a working day for me, I&#x27;m afraidso actually I should have a mile or two left in me, but I do want the children to be able to stand solemnly at my graveside and think lovely thoughts along the lines of &#x27;get out of that one, you swine&#x27;, which they won&#x27;t be able to do if I&#x27;ve been cremated.&quot;
Peel&#x27;s funeral took place in Bury St Edmunds on 12 November 2004 and was attended by over 1,000 people, including many of the artists he had championed. Eulogies were read by his brother Alan and fellow DJ Paul Gambaccini. The service ended with clips of him talking about his life. His coffin was carried out to the accompaniment of his favourite song, the Undertones&#x27; &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot;. Peel had written that, apart from his name, all he wanted on his gravestone were the &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; lyrics &quot;teenage dreams, so hard to beat&quot;. A headstone featuring the lyrics and the liver bird from his favourite football team, Liverpool FC, was placed at his grave in 2008. He was buried in the graveyard of St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Great Finborough.

== Life in music ==

=== Peel Sessions ===
John Peel Sessions were a feature of his BBC Radio 1 shows, which usually consisted of four pieces of music pre-recorded at the BBC&#x27;s studios. The sessions originally came about due to restrictions imposed on the BBC by the Musicians&#x27; Union and Phonographic Performance Limited which represented the record companies dominated by the EMI cartel. 

Due to these restrictions, the BBC had been forced to hire bands and orchestras to render cover versions of recorded music. The theory behind this device was that it would create employment and force people to buy records and not listen to them free of charge on the air. One of the reasons why the offshore broadcasting stations of the 1960s were called &quot;pirates&quot; was because they operated outside of British laws and were not bound by the needle time restriction on the number of records they could play on the air.

The BBC employed its own house bands and orchestras and it also engaged outside bands to record exclusive tracks for its programmes in BBC studios. This was the reason why Peel was able to use &quot;session men&quot; in his own programmes. Sessions were usually four tracks recorded and mixed in a single day; as such they often had a rough-and-ready, demo-like feel, somewhere between a live performance and a finished recording. During the 37 years Peel remained on BBC Radio 1, over 4,000 sessions were recorded by over 2,000 artists. Many classic Peel Sessions have been released on record, particularly by the Strange Fruit label. In May 2020, an alphabetised catalogue of hundreds of classic Peel Sessions others had previously uploaded to YouTube was published.

=== Festive Fifty ===

The Festive Fifty – a countdown of the best tracks of the year as voted for by the listeners – was an annual tradition of Peel&#x27;s Radio 1 show. Despite his eclectic play list, it tended to be composed largely of &quot;white boys with guitars&quot;, as Peel complained in 1988. In 1991, the broadcast of the chart was cancelled due to a lack of votes.

Topped by Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, this Phantom Fifty was eventually broadcast at the rate of one track per programme in 1993. The 1997 chart was initially cancelled due to the lack of air-time Peel had been allocated for the period, but enough &quot;spontaneous&quot; votes were received over the phone that a Festive Thirty-One was compiled and broadcast.

Peel wrote that &quot;The Festive 50 dates back to what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 management of the time for programmes with alliterative titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy &quot;Radio Times&quot; billing. In the course of our historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, when I could have been out and about having fun, fun, fun.&quot;

After his death, the Festive Fifty was continued on Radio 1 by Rob da Bank, Huw Stephens and Ras Kwame for two years, but then given to Peel-inspired Internet radio station Dandelion Radio, and continues to be compiled.

=== Dandelion Records and Strange Fruit ===
In 1969, Peel founded Dandelion Records (named after his pet hamster) so that he could release the debut album by Bridget St John, which he also produced. The label released 27 albums by 18 different artists before folding in 1972. Of its albums, &quot;There is Some Fun Going Forward&quot; was a sampler intended to present its acts to a wide audience, but Dandelion was never a great success, with only two releases charting nationally: Medicine Head in the UK with &quot;(And the) Pictures in the Sky&quot; and Beau in Lebanon with &quot;1917 Revolution&quot;. Having had an affinity with the Manchester area from working in a cotton mill in Rochdale in 1959, Peel signed Manchester bands Stack Waddy and Tractor to Dandelion and was always supportive of both bands throughout his life. It is alleged that Peel spotted a Rochdale postmark on the envelope containing the tape sent to him by Tractor, then called &quot;The Way We Live&quot;.

As Peel stated:

It was never a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I remember correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent as it would have been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I&#x27;ve never been a good business man.

Peel appeared on one Dandelion release: the David Bedford album &quot;Nurses Song with Elephants&quot;, recorded at the Marquee Studios, as part of a group playing twenty-seven plastic pipe twirlers on the track &quot;Some Bright Stars for Queen&#x27;s College&quot;.

In the 1980s Peel set up Strange Fruit Records with Clive Selwood to release material recorded by the BBC for Peel Sessions.

John Peel is sometimes confused with the more prolific record producer Jonathan Peel, who was an in-house music producer for EMI before going freelance in 1970.

=== Favourite music ===
John Peel wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Margrave of the Marshes&quot;, that the band of which he owned the most records was The Fall. Regulars in the Festive 50, and easily recognised by vocalist Mark E. Smith&#x27;s distinctive delivery, The Fall became synonymous with Peel&#x27;s Radio 1 show through the 1980s and 1990s. Peel kept in contact with many of the artists he championed but only met Smith on two, apparently awkward, occasions.

The Misunderstood is the only band that Peel ever personally managed – he first met the band in Riverside, California in 1966 and convinced them to move to London. He championed their music throughout his career; in 1968, he described their 1966 single &quot;I Can Take You to the Sun&quot; as &quot;the best popular record that&#x27;s ever been recorded.&quot; and shortly before his death, he stated, &quot;If I had to list the ten greatest performances I&#x27;ve seen in my life, one would be The Misunderstood at Pandora&#x27;s Box, Hollywood, 1966 ... My god, they were a great band!&quot;

His favourite single is widely known to have been &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; by The Undertones; in an interview in 2001, he stated &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you could add to it or subtract from it that would improve it.&quot; In the same 2001 interview, he also listed &quot;No More Ghettos in America&quot; by Stanley Winston, &quot;There Must Be Thousands&quot; by The Quads and &quot;Lonely Saturday Night&quot; by Don French as being among his all-time favourites. He also described Lianne Hall as one of the great English voices.

In 1997 &quot;The Guardian&quot; asked Peel to list his top 20 albums. He listed Captain Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; as his number 1, having previously described it as &quot;a work of art&quot;. The top 20 also included LPs by The Velvet Underground, The Ramones, Pulp, Misty in Roots, Nirvana, Neil Young, Pink Floyd, The Four Brothers, Dave Clarke, Richard and Linda Thompson and The Rolling Stones.

A longer list of his favourite singles was revealed in 2005 when the contents of a wooden box in which he stored the records that meant the most to him were made public. The box was the subject of a television documentary, &quot;John Peel&#x27;s Record Box&quot;. Out of 130 vinyl singles in the box, 11 of them were by The White Stripes, more than any other band in the box.

In 1999 Peel presented a nightly segment on his programme titled the Peelennium, in which he played four recordings from each year of the 20th century.

=== Awards and honorary degrees ===
Peel was 11 times &quot;Melody Maker&quot;′s DJ of the year, Sony Broadcaster of the Year in 1993, winner of the publicly voted Godlike Genius Award from the &quot;NME&quot; in 1994, Sony Gold Award winner in 2002 and is a member of the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. At the NME awards in 2005, he was Hero of the Year and was posthumously given a special award for &quot;Lifelong Service To Music&quot;. At the same event the &quot;John Peel Award For Musical Innovation&quot; was awarded to The Others.

He was awarded many honorary degrees including an MA from the University of East Anglia, doctorates (Anglia Polytechnic University and Sheffield Hallam University), various degrees (University of Liverpool, Open University, University of Portsmouth, University of Bradford) and a fellowship of Liverpool John Moores University.

He was appointed an OBE in 1998, for his services to British music. In 2002, the BBC conducted a vote to discover the 100 Greatest Britons of all time, in which Peel was voted 43rd.

=== Various shows ===
== Legacy ==
Since his death various parties have recognised Peel&#x27;s influence. A stage for new bands at the Glastonbury Festival, previously known as &quot;The New Bands Tent&quot; was renamed &quot;The John Peel Stage&quot; in 2005, although this was renamed again as &quot;Woodsies&quot; in 2023.

In 2008 Merseytravel announced it would be naming a train after him.

The John Peel Centre for Creative Arts opened in Stowmarket in early 2013. The main purposes of the centre is to serve as a live venue for music and performance and as a community meeting point.

The 2005 Mogwai live compilation album &quot;Government Commissions: BBC Sessions 1996–2003&quot; was dedicated to Peel as some of the tracks had been performed during the Peel Sessions. Peel&#x27;s voice announces &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, Mogwai!&quot; at the intro to &quot;Hunted by a Freak&quot;, the album&#x27;s opener.

On 8 October 2005 Cotswold Rail locomotive 47813 was named &quot;John Peel&quot; by Peel&#x27;s widow Sheila at Bury St Edmunds station.

On 13 October 2005, the first &quot;John Peel Day&quot; was held to mark the anniversary of his last show. The BBC encouraged as many bands as possible to stage gigs on the 13th, and over 500 gigs took place in the UK and as far away as Canada and New Zealand, from bands ranging from Peel favourites New Order and The Fall, to many new and unsigned bands. A second John Peel day was held on 12 October 2006, and a third on 11 October 2007. The BBC had originally planned to hold a John Peel Day annually, but Radio 1 has not held any official commemoration of the event since 2007, though gigs still took place around the country to mark the anniversary for a number of years afterwards.

In 2007, ambient duo Stars of the Lid released a tour EP (&#x27;Carte De Visite&#x27;) with a track titled &#x27;J.P.R.I.P&#x27; with a soundbyte of Peel during the intro.

At the annual Gilles Peterson&#x27;s Worldwide Awards, the &quot;John Peel Play More Jazz Award&quot; was named in his honour.

In Peel&#x27;s hometown of Heswall, a pub was opened in his honour in 2007. Named The Ravenscroft, the pub was converted from the old Heswall Telephone Exchange but has since been renamed.

In 2012 Peel was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover.

Several Peel-related compilation albums have been released since his death, including &quot;John Peel and Sheila: The Pig&#x27;s Big 78s: A Beginner&#x27;s Guide&quot;, a project Peel started with his wife that was left unfinished when he died, and &quot;Kats Karavan: The History of John Peel on the Radio&quot; (2009), a 4 CD box set. Rock music critic Peter Paphides said in a review of the box set that &quot;[s]ome artists remain forever associated with him&quot;, including ...And the Native Hipsters with &quot;There Goes Concorde Again&quot;, and Ivor Cutler with &quot;Jam&quot;. A sizable online community has also emerged dedicated to sharing recordings of his radio shows.

In May 2012 a campaign was started to turn demolition-threatened Bradford Odeon into the John Peel Creative Arts Centre in the North, though this was ultimately unsuccessful.

=== Blue plaques ===
In 2009 blue plaques bearing Peel&#x27;s name were unveiled at two former recording studios in Rochdale – one at the site of Tractor Sound Studios in Heywood, the other at the site of the Kenion Street Music Building – to recognise Peel&#x27;s contribution to the local music industry.

In June 2017 Peel&#x27;s widow Sheila unveiled a blue plaque in his honour in Great Finborough.

<doc id="16037" wikidata="Q1127893" url="?curid=16037" title="Josephus on Jesus">
<text>The first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus provides external information on some people and events found in the New Testament. The extant manuscripts of Josephus&#x27; book &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, written around AD 93–94, contain two references to Jesus of Nazareth and one reference to John the Baptist.

The first and most extensive reference to Jesus in the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, found in , states that Jesus was the Messiah and a wise teacher who was crucified by Pontius Pilate. It is commonly called the &quot;Testimonium Flavianum&quot;. Though nearly all modern scholars hold that the passage, in its present form, cannot be authentic; most nevertheless hold that it contains an authentic nucleus referencing the life of Jesus and his execution by Pilate, which was then subjected to Christian interpolation and alteration. However, the exact nature and extent of the original statement remains unclear. The passage exists in all extant manuscripts of &quot;Antiquities&quot;.

Modern scholarship has largely acknowledged the authenticity of the second reference to Jesus in the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, found in , which mentions &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James.&quot; 

Almost all modern scholars consider the reference in of the &quot;Antiquities&quot; to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist also to be authentic and not a Christian interpolation. A number of differences exist between the statements by Josephus regarding the death of John the Baptist and the New Testament accounts. Scholars generally view these variations as indications that the Josephus passages are not interpolations, since a Christian interpolator would likely have made them correspond to the New Testament accounts, not differ from them. Scholars have provided explanations for their inclusion in Josephus&#x27; later works.

==Extant manuscripts==

Josephus wrote all of his surviving works after his establishment in Rome () under the patronage of the Flavian Emperor Vespasian. As is common with ancient texts, however, there are no known manuscripts of Josephus&#x27; works that can be dated before the 11th century, and the oldest which do survive were copied by Christian monks. Jews are not known to have preserved the writings of Josephus perhaps because he was considered a traitor, and/or because his works circulated in Greek, the use of which declined among Jews shortly after Josephus&#x27; era.

There are about 120 extant Greek manuscripts of Josephus, of which 33 predate the 14th century, with two thirds from the Komnenos period. The earliest surviving Greek manuscript that contains the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is the 11th century Ambrosianus 370 (F 128), preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, which includes almost all of the second half of the &quot;Antiquities&quot;. There are about 170 extant Latin translations of Josephus, some of which go back to the sixth century. According to Louis Feldman these have proven very useful in reconstructing the Josephus texts through comparisons with the Greek manuscripts, confirming proper names and filling in gaps. One of the reasons the works of Josephus were copied and maintained by Christians was that his writings provided a good deal of information about a number of figures mentioned in the New Testament, and the background to events such as the death of James during a gap in Roman governing authority.

===Slavonic Josephus===

The three references found in and of the &quot;Antiquities&quot; do not appear in any other versions of Josephus&#x27; &quot;The Jewish War&quot; except for a Slavonic version of the &quot;Testimonium Flavianum&quot; (at times called &quot;Testimonium Slavonium&quot;) which surfaced in the west at the beginning of the 20th century, after its discovery in Russia at the end of the 19th century.

Although originally hailed as authentic (notably by Robert Eisler), it is now almost universally acknowledged by scholars to have been the product of an 11th-century creation as part of a larger ideological struggle against the Khazars. As a result, it has little place in the ongoing debate over the authenticity and nature of the references to Jesus in the &quot;Antiquities.&quot; Craig A. Evans states that although some scholars had in the past supported the &quot;Slavonic Josephus&quot;, &quot;to my knowledge no one today believes that they contain anything of value for Jesus research&quot;.

===Arabic and Syriac Josephus===
In 1971, a 10th-century Arabic version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; from the chronicle of Agapius of Hierapolis was brought to light by Shlomo Pines, who also discovered a 12th-century Syriac version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; in the chronicle of Michael the Syrian. These additional manuscript sources of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; have furnished additional ways to evaluate Josephus&#x27; mention of Jesus in the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, principally through a close textual comparison between the Arabic, Syriac and Greek versions to the &quot;Testimonium&quot;.

There are subtle yet key differences between the Greek manuscripts and these texts. For instance, the Arabic version does not blame the Jews for the death of Jesus. The key phrase &quot;at the suggestion of the principal men among us&quot; reads instead &quot;Pilate condemned him to be crucified&quot;. Instead of &quot;he was Christ&quot;, the Syriac version has the phrase &quot;he was believed to be Christ&quot;. Drawing on these textual variations, scholars have suggested that these versions of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; more closely reflect what a non-Christian Jew might have written.

====Potential dependence on Eusebius====
In 2008, however, Alice Whealey published an article arguing that Agapius&#x27; and Michael&#x27;s versions of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; are not independent witnesses to the original text of Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities&quot;. Rather, they both ultimately derive from the Syriac translation of the &quot;Church History&quot; written by Eusebius, which in turn quotes the &quot;Testimonium&quot;. Whealey notes that Michael&#x27;s Syriac &quot;Testimonium&quot; shares several peculiar choices of vocabulary with the version found in the Syriac translation of the &quot;Church History&quot;. These words and phrases are not shared by an independent Syriac translation of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; from Eusebius&#x27; book &quot;Theophania&quot;, strongly indicating that Agapius&#x27;s text is simply a paraphrased quotation from the Syriac &quot;Church History&quot;, and not a direct quotation of Josephus himself. Michael&#x27;s text, in contrast, she concludes is much closer to what Josephus actually wrote.

One of the key prongs in her argument is that Agapius&#x27; and Michael&#x27;s &quot;Testimonia&quot; share the unique peculiarity that they both explicitly state that Jesus died after being condemned to the cross, while the Greek original does not include this detail. According to Whealey, the differences between the two &quot;Testimonia&quot; are simply due to the fact that Agapius&#x27; chronicle more freely paraphrases and abbreviates its sources, whereas Michael&#x27;s version is probably a &quot;verbatim&quot; copy. The implication of this argument, if valid, is that Agapius&#x27; abbreviated &quot;Testimonium&quot; cannot be an earlier version of the passage than what we find in extant manuscripts of Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities&quot;.

Whealey furthermore notices that Michael&#x27;s version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; shares common features with Jerome&#x27;s Latin translation. Most importantly for her, instead of &quot;&quot;he was the Messiah&quot;, as in the Greek &quot;Testimonium&quot;, Jerome&#x27;s and Michael&#x27;s versions both read, &quot;he was thought to be the Messiah&quot;&quot;. She considers it likely, therefore, that the Latin and Arabic translations go back to an original Greek version with the same reading. Since they otherwise have no substantial disagreement from the Greek version we possess, and since that sole variant is sufficient to explain the most powerful objections to the &quot;Testimonium&quot;″s integrity, she concludes that it is &quot;the only major alteration&quot; that has been made to what Josephus originally wrote.

==The &quot;Testimonium Flavianum&quot;==
The &quot;Testimonium Flavianum&quot; (meaning the testimony of Flavius Josephus) is a passage found in (or see Greek text) of the &quot;Antiquities&quot; which describes the condemnation and crucifixion of Jesus at the hands of the Roman authorities. The &quot;Testimonium&quot; is probably the most discussed passage in Josephus.

The earliest secure reference to this passage is found in the writings of the fourth-century Christian apologist and historian Eusebius, who used Josephus&#x27; works extensively as a source for his own &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. Writing no later than 324, Eusebius quotes the passage in essentially the same form as that preserved in extant manuscripts. It has therefore been suggested by a minority of scholars that part or all of the passage may have been Eusebius&#x27; own invention, in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Christ. Some argue that the wording in the Testimonium differs from Josephus&#x27; usual writing style, and that a traditional Jew would not have proclaimed &quot;ὁ χριστὸς οὗτος ἦν&quot; (&quot;he was the Christ,&quot; at Josephus&#x27; time simply meaning &quot;Messiah.&quot;) See also the arguments for authenticity in the sections below.

The consensus among scholars holds that while the Testimonium Flavianum cannot be authentic in its entirety, it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus with a reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate which was then subject to interpolation. James Dunn states that there is &quot;broad consensus&quot; among scholars regarding the nature of an authentic reference to Jesus in the &quot;Testimonium&quot; and what the passage would look like without the interpolations. Among other things, the authenticity of this passage would help make sense of the later reference in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; where Josephus refers to the stoning of &quot;James the brother of Jesus&quot;.

===Three perspectives on authenticity===

Paul L. Maier and Zvi Baras state that there are three possible perspectives on the authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot;: 
# It is entirely authentic.
# It is entirely a Christian forgery.
# It has authentic material about Jesus, but Christian interpolations exist in some parts.

Paul Maier states that the first case is generally seen as hopeless given that as a Jew, Josephus would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and that the second option is hardly tenable given the presence of the passage in all extant Greek manuscripts; thus a large majority of modern scholars accept the third alternative, i.e., partial authenticity. Baras adds that the third position is more plausible because it accepts parts of the passage as genuine, but discounts other parts as interpolations. Craig Evans (and separately Robert Van Voorst) state that most modern scholars accept the position that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is partially authentic, had a kernel with an authentic reference to Jesus, and that the analysis of its content and style support this conclusion.

While before the advent of literary criticism most scholars considered the &quot;Testimonium&quot; entirely authentic, thereafter the number of supporters of full authenticity declined. Most scholars now accept partial authenticity and many attempt to reconstruct their own version of the authentic kernel, and scholars such as Geza Vermes have argued that the overall characterizations of Jesus in the &quot;Testimonium&quot; are in accord with the style and approach of Josephus.

===Arguments for complete authenticity===
====Pre-modern criticism====
Until the rise of modern criticism, many scholars believed the &quot;Testimonium&quot; was nearly or completely authentic with little or no Christian interpolations. Some of these arguments relied on the language used in the &quot;Testimonium&quot;. For instance, Jesus is called &quot;a wise man&quot; (and Josephus described others like Solomon, Daniel, and John the Baptist in the same fashion), which would not have been a common Christian label for Christ at the time. He referred to Jesus merely as &quot;a worker of amazing deeds&quot; and nothing more, again disagreeing with how Christians viewed Christ. Referring to Jesus as &quot;a teacher of people who accept the truth with pleasure&quot;, where &quot;pleasure&quot; (ἡδονή) connotes hedonistic value, is not in line with how Christians saw the point of Jesus&#x27; teachings. Claiming that Jesus won over &quot;both Jews and Greeks&quot; is a misunderstanding that a Christian scribe would not likely have made, knowing that Jesus mainly ministered to Jews. Also, the phrase &quot;Those who had first loved him did not cease doing so&quot; is Josephan in style, and calling Christians a &quot;tribe&quot; would not have made sense to a Christian writer.

=== The Paraphrase Model of Josephan Authenticity ===
The &quot;paraphrase model&quot;, advanced by G. J. Goldberg in 2022, is based on the observation that Josephus wrote most of the &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; by paraphrasing Greek and Hebrew sources. Goldberg proposes that the Jesus passage in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; is also a paraphrase in the same manner. Josephus&#x27;s methods of revising his sources have been well established and can be used to objectively test whether a proposed candidate source could have been adapted in the same way for the Jesus passage. In a phrase-by-phrase study, Goldberg finds that the Jesus account can be derived from Luke&#x27;s Emmaus narrative using transformations Josephus is demonstrated to have employed in paraphrasing known sources for the &quot;Antiquities&quot;. He finds these paraphrase precedents in word adoption, word and phrase substitution, content order preservation and content modification. As these stylistic pairings are unlike the relationships found among any other ancient Jesus texts, Goldberg proposes the most plausible explanation of these findings is that the Jesus passage in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; is indeed Josephus&#x27;s paraphrase of a Christian text very much like, if not identical to, Luke&#x27;s Emmaus narrative (Luke 24:18–24).

This paraphrase model, Goldberg argues, is not only a natural application of Josephus&#x27;s writing processes but also resolves the questions that researchers have raised about the passage, shedding light on the origin of specific difficult phrases and accounting for its brevity and its mixture of Josephan language with a Christian creedal structure. While many had previously suspected that an original Josephus passage had been edited by a later Christian to give the creedal appearance, the paraphrase model argues such edits cannot explain the end-to-end consistency of a paraphrase relationship with the Emmaus text. The more plausible explanation is rather the reverse: an original Christian document was edited by Josephus by applying his usual revision method for the &quot;Antiquities&quot;.

The historical implications of the model, Goldberg argues, include the following. First, it shows Jesus was a historical figure and not a myth, based on the reasoning that Josephus&#x27;s treatment of his source indicates he thought it reliable; it must have conformed with what he knew of events under Pilate. The model also provides unique evidence about the dating of at least one passage of Luke&#x27;s Gospel. And as the paraphrase shows Josephus had obtained a Christian source and treated it with a degree of respect, it provides an unexpected window into a cordial relationship between Christians and Jews in Rome at the end of the first century.

===Arguments for presence of Christian interpolations===
The &quot;Testimonium&quot; has been the subject of a great deal of research and debate among scholars, being one of the most discussed passages among all antiquities. Louis Feldman has stated that in the period from 1937 to 1980 at least 87 articles had appeared on the topic, the overwhelming majority of which questioned the total or partial authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot;. While early scholars considered the &quot;Testimonium&quot; to be a total forgery, the majority of modern scholars consider it partially authentic, despite some clear Christian interpolations in the text.

The arguments surrounding the authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; fall into two categories: internal arguments that rely on textual analysis and compare the passage with the rest of Josephus&#x27; work; and external arguments, that consider the wider cultural and historical context. Some of the external arguments are &quot;arguments from silence&quot; that question the authenticity of the entire passage not for what it says, but due to lack of references to it among other ancient sources.

The external analyses of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; have even used computer-based methods, e.g. the matching of the text of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; with the Gospel of Luke performed by Gary Goldberg in 1995. Goldberg found some partial matches between the &quot;Testimonium&quot; and Luke 24:19–21, 26–27 stating &quot;the Emmaus narrative more closely resembles the Testimonium in its phrase-by-phrase outline of content and order than any other known text of comparable age.&quot; Goldberg&#x27;s analyses suggested three possibilities: that the matches were random, that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; was a Christian interpolation based on Luke, or that both the &quot;Testimonium&quot; and Luke were based on the same sources. In a later work, published in 2022, Goldberg investigated Josephus&#x27;s paraphrase style and concluded only the last of these possibilities could explain why the Emmaus-Testimonium language relationships were end-to-end consistent with Josephus&#x27;s methods of revision.

===Internal arguments===
====Christian phraseology====
One of the key internal arguments against the complete authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is that the clear inclusion of Christian phraseology strongly indicates the presence of some interpolations. For instance, the phrases &quot;if it be lawful to call him a man&quot; suggests that Jesus was more than human and is likely a Christian interpolation. Some scholars have attempted to reconstruct the original &quot;Testimonium&quot;, but others contend that attempts to discriminate the passage into Josephan and non-Josephan elements are inherently circular.

====Eusebian phraseology====
Another example of the textual arguments against the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is that it uses the Greek term &quot;poietes&quot; to mean &quot;doer&quot; (as part of the phrase &quot;doer of wonderful works&quot;), but elsewhere in his works Josephus only uses the term &quot;poietes&quot; to mean &quot;poet&quot;, whereas this use of &quot;poietes&quot; seems consistent with the Greek of Eusebius.

===External arguments===
====Origen&#x27;s references to Josephus====
According to Wataru Mizugaki, the Testimonium passage that Origen had seen in the third century was likely to have been neutral or skeptical on Jesus without Christian interpolation and this may have looked unsatisfactory to a Christian editor. Origen&#x27;s statement in his &quot;Commentary on Matthew&quot; () that Josephus &quot;did not accept Jesus as Christ&quot;, is usually seen as a confirmation of the generally accepted fact that Josephus did not believe Jesus to be the Messiah. This forms a key external argument against the total authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; in that Josephus, as a Jew, would not have claimed Jesus as the Messiah, and the reference to &quot;he was the Christ&quot; in the &quot;Testimonium&quot; must be a Christian interpolation. Based on this observation alone, Paul L. Maier calls the case for the total authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; &quot;hopeless&quot;. Almost all modern scholars reject the total authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot;, while the majority of scholars still hold that it includes an authentic kernel.

===Arguments from silence===
A different set of external arguments against the authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; (either partial or total) are &quot;arguments from silence&quot;, e.g. that although twelve Christian authors refer to Josephus before Eusebius in AD 324, none mentions the &quot;Testimonium&quot;.

Even after Eusebius&#x27; AD 324 reference, it is not until Jerome&#x27;s &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot; () that the passage from Josephus is referenced again, even though the &quot;Testimonium&quot;″s reference to Jesus would seem appropriate in the works of many intervening patristic authors. However, Bart D. Ehrman and John P. Meier have argued that this silence is mainly due to the fact that the original &quot;Testimonium&quot; probably had a neutral tone toward Jesus and did not contain elements that would have been useful to Christian apologetics, since it did not recognize him as the Messiah, nor did it speak about his resurrection; it was, therefore, not a useful instrument in their polemics with Pagan writers.

Some scholars also point to the silence of Photios as late as the 9th century, and the fact that he does not mention the &quot;Testimonium&quot; at all in his broad review of Josephus. However, Photios argues in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; that Josephus&#x27;s works mention the Massacre of the Innocents and the virgin birth of Jesus (which no works of Josephus make any reference to), leading many scholars to think that he actually had a scant knowledge of the writings he was reviewing or that the documents he was working on were grossly interpolated. Also, Photios had clearly read Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Church History&quot; and Jerome&#x27;s &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot;, since he lists them both in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;.

====Table of Josephus excludes the Testimonium====
A separate argument from silence against the total or partial authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is that a 5th- or 6th-century table of contents of Josephus (albeit selective) makes no mention of it.

====Arabic Testimonium lacks Christian terminology====
Andreas Köstenberger argues that the fact that the 10th-century Arabic version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; (discovered in the 1970s) lacks distinct Christian terminology while sharing the essential elements of the passage indicates that the Greek &quot;Testimonium&quot; has been subject to interpolation.

====No parallel in other works====
A final argument from silence relates to Josephus&#x27; own writings and questions the authenticity of &quot;Testimonium&quot; based on the fact that it has no parallel in the &quot;Jewish War&quot;, which includes a discussion of Pontius Pilate at about the same level of detail.

====Timing of the interpolations====
Zvi Baras believes that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; was subject to interpolation before Eusebius wrote. Baras believes that Origen had seen the original &quot;Testimonium&quot; but that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; seen by Origen had no negative reference to Jesus, else Origen would have reacted against it. Baras states that the interpolation in the &quot;Testimonium&quot; took place between Origen and Eusebius.

Paul L. Maier states that a comparison of Eusebius&#x27; reference with the 10th-century Arabic version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; due to Agapius of Hierapolis indicates that the Christian interpolation present in the &quot;Testimonium&quot; must have come early, before Eusebius. Robert E. Van Voorst also states that the interpolation likely took place some time between Origen and Eusebius.

===Arguments for partial authenticity===
====Arguments from style and content====

====Lack of Jewish deicide====
Craig Evans states that an argument in favor of the partial authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is that the passage does not stress the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus. According to Evans, if the passage had been an interpolation after the emergence of conflicts between Jews and Christians, it would have had a more accusatory tone, but in its current form reads as one would expect it to read for a passage composed by Josephus towards the end of the first century. Geza Vermes concurs, arguing that if the &quot;Testimonium&quot; had been the work of a Christian forger, it would have placed blame on the Jewish leaders, but as is it is &quot;perfectly in line&quot; with the attitude of Josephus towards Pilate. Vermes also states that the detached depiction of the followers of Jesus is not the work of a Christian interpolator. Vermes calls the Jesus notice in the &quot;Testimonium&quot; a &quot;veritable tour de force&quot; in which Josephus plays the role of a neutral witness.

====Josephan vocabulary and style====
Andreas Köstenberger argues that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; includes vocabulary that is typically Josephan, and the style is consistent with that of Josephus. Köstenberger (and separately Van Voorst) state that the Josephus&#x27; reference to the large number of followers of Jesus during his public ministry is unlikely to have been due to a Christian scribe familiar with the New Testament accounts, and is hence unlikely to be an interpolation.

====Josephan beliefs about Jesus====
Claudia Setzer holds that while &quot;tribe is an odd way to describe Christians,&quot; it does not necessarily have negative connotations. Setzer argues for the existence of an authentic kernel because &quot;the style and vocabulary are Josephan&quot; and specific parts (e.g. the use of &quot;wise man&quot;) are not what one would expect from a Christian forger. Setzer argues that the Testimonium indicates that Josephus had heard of Jesus and the basic elements surrounding his death, and that he saw Jesus as primarily a miracle worker. Van Voorst also states that calling Christians a &quot;tribe&quot; would have been very out of character for a Christian scribe, while Josephus has used it to refer both to Jewish and Christian groups.

===Arguments from external attestation===

====Origen&#x27;s complaint about Josephus referencing Jesus====
Lester L. Grabbe notes that in two works (&quot;Commentary on Matthew&quot; 10.17 and &quot;Contra Celsum&quot; 1.47; see ) Origen had actually complained that Josephus had mentioned Jesus, while not recognizing Jesus as the messiah, and this provided an early independent support of the partial Testimonium in a more neutral form. Zvi Baras argues from this that Origen had seen a version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; that included no interpolations. Baras asserts that a &quot;Testimonium&quot; seen by Origen must have had a neutral tone, and included no derogatory references towards Christians, and hence required no reaction from Origen. He claims that the neutral tone of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; was then modified between the time of Origen and Eusebius. John P. Meier similarly argues that the fact that Origen complains that Josephus had not recognized Jesus as the Messiah points to the fact that Origen had read the original version of the &quot;Testimonium&quot;, since such a clear statement could not have simply arisen from the &quot;James, brother of Jesus&quot; passage.

====Arabic Testimonium more authentic version====
Andreas Köstenberger argues that a comparison of the Greek manuscripts with the Arabic quotation discovered by Shlomo Pines in the 1970s provides an indication of the original Josephan text. Köstenberger states that many modern scholars believe that the Arabic version reflects the state of Josephus&#x27; original text before it was subject to Christian interpolation.

===Other arguments===

====Comparison to Philo&#x27;s works====
Steve Mason has argued for partial authenticity for the &quot;Testimonium&quot; because no other parts of any of the works of Josephus have been contested to have had scribal tempering, Christian copyists were usually conservative when transmitting texts in general, and seeing that the works of Philo were unaltered by Christian scribes through the centuries strongly support that it is very unlikely that the passage was invented out of thin air by a Christian scribe. Philo often wrote in a way that was favorable to Christian ideas and yet no Christian scribes took advantage of that to insert Jesus or Christian beliefs into Philo&#x27;s text.

===Authenticity of the James passage===
Chilton and Evans state that the general acceptance of the authenticity of the James passage lends support to the partial authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; in that the brief reference to &quot;Jesus, who was called Christ&quot; in &quot;Antiquities&quot; &quot;clearly implies a prior reference&quot; and that &quot;in all probability the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is that prior reference&quot;. Paul L. Maier concurs with the analysis of Chilton and Evans and states that Josephus&#x27; first reference was the &quot;Testimonium&quot;. Geza Vermes also considers the &quot;who was called Christ&quot; reference in the James passage as the second reference to Jesus in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; and states that the first reference is likely to be the &quot;Testimonium&quot;.

====Reconstruction of an authentic kernel====

Robert Van Voorst states that most modern scholars believe that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is partially authentic, and has a reference to Jesus. However, he states that scholars are divided on the tone of the original reference and while some scholars believe that it had a negative tone which was softened by Christian interpolators, others believe that it had a neutral tone, in keeping with the style and approach of Josephus regarding the issue. According to Van Voorst, scholars who support the negative reconstruction contend that the reference read something like &quot;source of further trouble in Jesus a wise man&quot; and that it stated &quot;he was the so-called Christ&quot;. Van Voorst states that most scholars support a neutral reconstruction which states &quot;Around this time lived Jesus, a wise man&quot; and includes no reference to &quot;he was the Christ&quot;. Van Voorst states that if the original references to Jesus had had a negative tone, the Christian scribes would have likely deleted it entirely. Van Voorst also states that the neutral reconstruction fits better with the Arabic &quot;Testimonium&quot; discovered by Pines in the 1970s. Van Voorst states that the neutral reconstruction is supported by the majority of scholars because it involves far less conjectural wording and fits better with the style of Josephus.

====Exclusion of three divisive elements====
Craig Blomberg states that if the three elements &quot;lawful to call him a man&quot;, &quot;he was the Christ&quot; and the reference to the resurrection are removed from the &quot;Testimonium&quot; the rest of the passage flows smoothly within the context, fits the style of Josephus and is likely to be authentic. Blomberg adds that after the removal of these three elements (which are likely interpolations) from the Greek versions the remaining passage fits well with the Arabic version and supports the authenticity of the reference to the execution of Jesus by Pilate. Joel B. Green also states that the removal of some elements from the &quot;Testimonium&quot; produces a passage that is likely to be an authentic reference to the death of Jesus.

In the estimation of James Dunn, there is &quot;broad consensus&quot; among scholars regarding what the &quot;Testimonium&quot; would look like without the interpolations. According to Dunn&#x27;s reconstruction, the original passage likely read:

In this passage, which is based on John P. Meier&#x27;s reconstruction, Jesus is called a &quot;wise man&quot;, but &quot;lawful to call him a man&quot; and &quot;he was the Christ&quot; are removed, as is the reference to the resurrection. According to Bart D. Ehrman, Meier&#x27;s reconstruction is currently the most accepted among scholars.

Géza Vermes has performed a detailed analysis of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; and modified it to remove what he considers the interpolations. In Vermes&#x27; reconstruction &quot;there was Jesus, a wise man&quot; is retained, but the reference to &quot;he was the Christ&quot; is changed to &quot;he was called the Christ&quot; and the resurrection reference is omitted. Vermes states that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; provides Josephus&#x27; authentic portrayal of Jesus, depicting him as a wise teacher and miracle worker with an enthusiastic group of followers who remained faithful to him after his crucifixion by Pilate, up to the time of Josephus. Vermes&#x27;s version reads:Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man. For he was a doer of startling deeds, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. And he gained a following both among many Jews and many of Greek origin. He was called the Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.

===Arguments for complete forgery===

====Textual similarities to Eusebian works====
In addition to the arguments listed above, a minority of scholars have put forward arguments to the effect that the entire &quot;Testimonium&quot; is a Christian interpolation. For example, Kenneth Olson has argued that the entire &quot;Testimonium&quot; must have been forged by Eusebius himself, basing his argument on textual similarities between the &quot;Testimonium&quot; and Eusebius&#x27; writings in the &quot;Demonstrations of the Gospels&quot;.

====Three Eusebian phrases====
In 2012, Josephus scholar Louis Feldman reversed his prior support for the partial authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot;, proposing that the passage was interpolated in its entirety by Eusebius. In support of this view, Feldman points out, following Olson, that the &quot;Testimonium&quot; features three phrases (&quot;one who wrought surprising feats&quot;, &quot;the tribe of the Christians&quot;, and &quot;still to this day&quot;) which are used nowhere else in the whole of Greek literature except Eusebius. Feldman&#x27;s new theory was criticized by James Carleton Paget, who accused Feldman of misreading the data and of using anachronistic criteria.

Both Carleton Paget and Alice Whealey had already responded to Olson&#x27;s argument, rejecting its arguments and conclusion. In his 2000 book Van Voorst had also argued that the word &quot;tribe&quot; is actually used by Josephus to describe other Jewish groups, while Geza Vermes argued in 2009 that the expression &quot;surprising feats&quot; (&quot;paradoxon ergon&quot;) is repeatedly used by Josephus in his works to describe many miracles associated with the Old Testament (such as the burning bush and the miracles of Moses and Elisha).

====4th-century Christian creedal statements====
In 2014, Carnegie Mellon linguistics professor Paul Hopper wrote a book chapter in which he argued that the style and narrative structure of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; is sharply in contrast with the rest of Josephus&#x27; work. According to Hopper, the language of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; has more in common with fourth-century Christian creedal statements than the historiographical work of first-century authors, including Josephus. He concluded that the most likely explanation is that the passage was simply interpolated in its entirety by a Christian scribe.

The concordance of the language used in the &quot;Testimonium&quot;, its flow within the text, and its length have formed components of the internal arguments against its authenticity, e.g. that the brief and compact character of the &quot;Testimonium&quot; stands in marked contrast to Josephus&#x27; more extensive accounts presented elsewhere in his works. For example, Josephus&#x27; description of the death of John the Baptist includes consideration of his virtues, the theology associated with his baptismal practices, his oratorical skills, his influence, the circumstances of his death, and the belief that the destruction of Herod&#x27;s army was a divine punishment for Herod&#x27;s slaughter of John. G. A. Wells has argued against the authenticity of the &quot;Testimonium&quot;, stating that the passage is noticeably shorter and more cursory than such notices generally used by Josephus in the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, and that had it been authentic, it would have included more details and a longer introduction.

====Intrusion that breaks the narrative====
A further internal argument against the &quot;Testimonium&#x27;s&quot; authenticity is the context of the passage in the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. Some scholars argue that the passage is an intrusion into the progression of Josephus&#x27; text at the point in which it appears in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; and breaks the thread of the narrative.

==&quot;James, the brother of Jesus&quot; passage==
In the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; () Josephus refers to the stoning of &quot;James the brother of Jesus&quot; (James the Just) by order of Ananus ben Ananus, a Herodian-era High Priest. The James referred to in this passage is most likely the James to whom the &quot;Epistle of James&quot; has been attributed. The translations of Josephus&#x27; writing into other languages have at times included passages that are not found in the Greek texts, raising the possibility of interpolation, but this passage on James is found in all manuscripts, including the Greek texts.

The context of the passage is the period following the death of Porcius Festus, and the journey to Alexandria by Lucceius Albinus, the new Roman Procurator of Judea, who held that position from AD 62 to 64. Because Albinus&#x27; journey to Alexandria had to have concluded no later than the summer of AD 62, the date of James&#x27; death can be assigned with some certainty to around that year. The 2nd century chronicler Hegesippus also left an account of the death of James, and while the details he provides diverge from those of Josephus, the two accounts share similar elements.

Modern scholarship has almost universally acknowledged the authenticity of the reference to &quot;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James&quot; (τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ἰησοῦ τοῦ λεγομένου Χριστοῦ, Ἰάκωβος ὄνομα αὐτῷ) and has rejected its being the result of later Christian interpolation. Moreover, in comparison with Hegesippus&#x27; account of James&#x27; death, most scholars consider Josephus&#x27; to be the more historically reliable. However, a few scholars question the authenticity of the reference, based on various arguments, but primarily based on the observation that various details in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; differ from it.

===Early references===
====Origen of Alexandria====
In the 3rd century, Origen of Alexandria claimed in two works that Josephus had mentioned James, the brother of Jesus. In Origen&#x27;s commentary on Matthew, he writes:

In Origen&#x27;s apologetic work &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, he made a similar remark:

Many commentators have concluded that Origen is making reference to the &quot;James, the brother of Jesus&quot; passage found in &quot;Antiquities&quot;, Book 20 here, but there are some problems with this view. Origen is attributing statements to Josephus that he never wrote in any of his extant works (such as the claim that the killing of James caused the destruction of the Jerusalem temple), suggesting that he is at least partially confused.

====Eusebius of Caesarea====
In of his &quot;Church History&quot;, Eusebius mentions Josephus&#x27; reference to the death of James. Eusebius attributes the following quote to Josephus: &quot;These things happened to the Jews to avenge James the Just, who was a brother of Jesus, that is called the Christ. For the Jews slew him, although he was a most just man.&quot; However, this statement does not appear in the extant manuscripts of Josephus. Moreover, in Book III, ch. 11 of his &quot;Church History&quot; Eusebius states that the conquest of Jerusalem immediately followed the martyrdom of James setting the martyrdom at rather than the given by Josephus.

===Arguments for authenticity===
Louis Feldman states that the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James has been &quot;almost universally acknowledged.&quot; Feldman states that this passage, above others, indicates that Josephus did say something about Jesus. Feldman states that it would make no sense for Origen to show amazement that Josephus did not acknowledge Jesus as Christ (), if Josephus had not referred to Jesus at all. Paul L. Maier states that most scholars agree with Feldman&#x27;s assessment that &quot;few have doubted the genuineness of this passage&quot; Zvi Baras also states that most modern scholars consider the James passage to be authentic.
According to Robert E. Van Voorst the overwhelming majority of scholars consider both the reference to &quot;the brother of Jesus called Christ&quot; and the entire passage that includes it as authentic. Van Voorst states that the James passage fits well in the context in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; and an indication for its authenticity is the lack of the laudatory language that a Christian interpolator would have used to refer to Jesus as &quot;the Lord&quot;, or a similar term. Van Voorst also states that the use of a neutral term &quot;called Christ&quot; which neither denies nor affirms Jesus as the Messiah points to authenticity, and indicates that Josephus used it to distinguish Jesus from the many other people called Jesus at the time, in the same way that James is distinguished, given that it was also a common name.

Richard Bauckham states that although a few scholars have questioned the James passage, &quot;the vast majority have considered it to be authentic&quot;, and that among the several accounts of the death of James the account in Josephus is generally considered to be historically the most reliable. Bauckham states that the method of killing James by stoning, and the description provided by Josephus via the assembly of the Sanhedrin of judges are consistent with the policies of the Temple authorities towards the early Christian Church at the time.

Andreas Köstenberger considers the James passage to be authentic and states that the James passage attests to the existence of Jesus as a historical person, and that his followers considered him the Messiah.(Köstenberger pages 104–5) Köstenberger states that the statement by Josephus that some people recognized Jesus as the Messiah is consistent with the grammar of Josephus elsewhere but does not imply that Josephus himself considered Jesus the Messiah.(Köstenberger pages 104–5) Köstenberger concurs with John Meier that it is highly unlikely for the passage to be a Christian interpolation given that in New Testament texts James is referred to as the &quot;brother of the Lord&quot; rather than the &quot;brother of Jesus&quot;, and that a Christian interpolator would have provided a more detailed account at that point.(Köstenberger pages 104–5)

Claudia Setzer states that few have questioned the authenticity of the James passage, partly based on the observation that a Christian interpolator would have provided more praise for James. Setzer states that the passage indicates that Josephus, a Jewish historian writing towards the end of the first century, could use a neutral tone towards Christians, with some tones of sympathy, implying that they may be worthy of Roman protection.

John Painter states that nothing in the James passage looks suspiciously like a Christian interpolation and that the account can be accepted as historical.(Painter pages 139–42). Painter discusses the role of Ananus and the background to the passage, and states that after being deposed as High Priest for killing James and being replaced by Jesus the son of Damnaeus, Ananus had maintained his influence within Jerusalem through bribery.(Painter page 136) Painter points out that as described in the Antiquities of the Jews () Ananus was bribing both Albinus and Jesus the son of Damnaeus so that his men could take the tithes of other priests outside Jerusalem, to the point that some priests then starved to death.(Painter pages 139–42). Philip Carrington states that there is no reason to question the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James, and elaborates the background by stating that Ananus continued to remain a power within the Jewish circles at the time even after being deposed, and that it is likely that the charges brought against James by Ananus were not only because of his Christian association but because he objected to the oppressive policies against the poor; hence explaining the later indignation of the more moderate Jewish leaders.

===Arguments against authenticity===

A comparative argument made against the authenticity of the James passage by scholars such as Tessa Rajak is that the passage has a negative tone regarding the High Priest Ananus, presenting him as impulsive while in the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; Josephus presents a positive view of Ananus and portrays him as prudent.

A textual argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that the use of the term &quot;Christos&quot; there seems unusual for Josephus. An argument based on the flow of the text in the document is that given that the mention of Jesus appears in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; before that of John the Baptist, a Christian interpolator may have inserted it to place Jesus in the text before John. A further argument against the authenticity of the James passage is that it would have read well even without a reference to Jesus.

===Differences with Christian sources===
Josephus&#x27;s account places the date of the death of James as AD 62. This date is supported by Jerome&#x27;s &#x27;seventh year of the Emperor Nero&#x27;, although Jerome may simply be drawing this from Josephus. However, James&#x27;s successor as leader of the Jerusalem church, Simeon, is not, in tradition, appointed till after the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, and Eusebius&#x27;s notice of Simeon implies a date for the death of James immediately before the siege, i.e. about AD 69. The method of death of James is not mentioned in the New Testament. However, the account of Josephus differs from that of later works by Hegesippus, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen, and Eusebius of Caesarea in that it simply has James stoned while the others have other variations such as having James thrown from the top of the Temple, stoned, and finally beaten to death by a fuller as well as his death occurring during the siege of Jerusalem in AD 69.
John Painter states that the relationship of the death of James to the siege is an important in the early church. On the basis of the Gospel accounts it was concluded that the fate of the city was determined by the death there of Jesus. To account for the 35 year difference, Painter states that the city was preserved temporarily by the presence within it of a &#x27;just man&#x27; (see also Sodom); who was identified with James, as confirmed by Origen. Hence Painter states that the killing of James restarted the clock that led to the destruction of the city and that the traditional dating of AD 69 simply arose from an over-literal application of the theologoumenon, and is not to be regarded as founded on a historical source. The difference between Josephus and the Christian accounts of the death of James is seen as an indication that the Josephus passage is not a Christian interpolation by scholars such as Eddy, Boyd, and Kostenberger. Géza Vermes states that compared to the Christian accounts: &quot;the sober picture of Josephus appears all the more believable&quot;. G. A. Wells, on the other hand, has stated that in view of Origen&#x27;s statements these variations from the Christian accounts may be signs of interpolation in the James passage.

==John the Baptist passage==
In the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; () Josephus refers to the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist by order of Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee and Perea. The context of this reference is the AD 36 defeat of Herod Antipas in his conflict with Aretas IV of Nabatea, which the Jews of the time attributed to misfortune brought about by Herod&#x27;s unjust execution of John.

Almost all modern scholars consider this passage to be authentic in its entirety, although a small number of authors have questioned it. Because the death of John also appears prominently in the Christian gospels, this passage is considered an important connection between the events Josephus recorded, the chronology of the gospels and the dates for the ministry of Jesus. A few scholars have questioned the passage, contending that the absence of Christian tampering or interpolation does not itself prove authenticity. While this passage is the only reference to John the Baptist outside the New Testament, it is widely seen by most scholars as confirming the historicity of the baptisms that John performed. According to Marsh, any contrast between Josephus and the Gospel&#x27;s accounts of John would be because the former lacked interest in the messianic element of John&#x27;s mission.

===Arguments for authenticity===

Craig Evans states that almost all modern scholars consider the Josephus passage on John to be authentic in its entirety, and that what Josephus states about John fits well both with the general depiction of John in the New Testament and within the historical context of the activities of other men, their preachings and their promises during that period.

Louis Feldman, who believes the Josephus passage on John is authentic, states that Christian interpolators would have been very unlikely to have devoted almost twice as much space to John (163 words) as to Jesus (89 words). Feldman also states that a Christian interpolator would have likely altered Josephus&#x27;s passage about John the Baptist to make the circumstances of the death of John become similar to the New Testament, and to indicate that John was a forerunner of Jesus.
James Dunn states that the accounts of Josephus and the New Testament regarding John the Baptist are closer than they may appear at a first reading. Dunn states that Josephus positions John as a righteous preacher (&quot;dikaiosyne&quot;) who encourages his followers to practice &quot;righteousness towards one another, and piety towards God&quot; and that similarly calls John &quot;a righteous (&quot;dikaios&quot;) and holy man&quot;. Dunn states that Antipas likely saw John as a figure whose ascetic lifestyle and calls for moral reform could provoke a popular uprising on moral grounds, as both Josephus and the New Testament suggest.

Justin Meggitt states that there are fundamental similarities between the Josephus portrayal of John the Baptist and the New Testament narrative in that in both accounts John is positioned as a preacher of morality, not as someone who had challenged the political authority of Herod Antipas. W. E. Nunnally states that the John passage is considered authentic and that Josephus&#x27; emphasis on the egalitarian nature of John&#x27;s teachings fit well into the biblical and historical traditions.

In Origen&#x27;s apologetic work &quot;Contra Celsum&quot;, made an explicit reference to the Josephus passage discussing John the Baptist:

Here, Origen provides a clear, unambiguous indication that the passage concerning John the Baptist existed in his early manuscript of &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. This implies that the John the Baptist passage would have had to have been interpolated into the &quot;Antiquities&quot; at quite an early date, before the time of Origen, if it is inauthentic.

In Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s 4th-century work &quot;Church History&quot; (), Eusebius also discusses the Josephus reference to Herod Antipas&#x27;s killing of John the Baptist, and mentions the marriage to Herodias in paragraphs 1 to 6.

===Arguments against authenticity===
Rivka Nir argues that the kind of baptism performed by John the Baptist was not considered legitimate in the mainstream Jewish circles to which Josephus belonged, and therefore Josephus could not have described John as positively as he is in &quot;Antiquities&quot;, Book 18. Nir therefore concludes that the passage is likely a Christian interpolation. Joel Marcus states that Nir&#x27;s argument is based on an outdated notion of &quot;mainstream Judaism&quot; which fails to consider the essential diversity of Second Temple Judaism during this period.

Claire Rothschild has stated that the absence of Christian interpolations in the Josephus passage on John the Baptist can not by itself be used as an argument for its authenticity, but is merely an indication of the lack of tampering.

===Differences with Christian sources===
The marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias is mentioned both in Josephus and in the gospels, and scholars consider Josephus as a key connection in establishing the approximate chronology of specific episodes related to John the Baptist. However, although both the gospels and Josephus refer to Herod Antipas killing John the Baptist, they differ on the details and motives, e.g. whether this act was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in , ), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in . Jean Daniélou contends that Josephus missed the religious meaning while recording only the political aspect of the conflict between Herod and John, which led to the latter&#x27;s death.

While Josephus identifies the location of the imprisonment of John as Machaerus, southeast of the mouth of the Jordan river, the gospels mention no location for the place where John was imprisoned. According to other historical accounts Machaerus was rebuilt by Herod the Great around 30 BC and then passed to Herod Antipas. The AD 36 date of the conflict with Aretas IV (mentioned by Josephus) is consistent with the approximate date of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias estimated by other historical methods.

Louis Feldman has stated that there is &quot;no necessary contradiction between Josephus and the gospels as to the reason why John was put to death&quot; in that the Christians chose to emphasize the moral charges while Josephus emphasized the political fears that John stirred in Herod.

Josephus stated () that the AD 36 defeat of Herod Antipas in the conflicts with Aretas IV of Nabatea was widely considered by the Jews of the time as misfortune brought about by Herod&#x27;s unjust execution of John the Baptist. The approximate dates presented by Josephus are in concordance with other historical records, and most scholars view the variation between the motive presented by Josephus and the New Testament accounts is seen as an indication that the Josephus passage is not a Christian interpolation.

==The three passages in relation to &quot;The Jewish Wars&quot;==

Louis Feldman states that it is significant that the passages on James and John are found in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; and not in the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot;, but provides three explanations for their absence from the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot;. One explanation is that the &quot;Antiquities&quot; covers the time period involved at a greater length than the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot;. The second explanation is that during the gap between the writing of the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; () and &quot;Antiquities&quot; (after AD 90) Christians had become more important in Rome and were hence given attention in the &quot;Antiquities&quot;. Another explanation is that the passages were added to the &quot;Antiquities&quot; to highlight the power of the Pharisees, but he considers the last explanation less likely than the others.

One of the arguments against the authenticity of the James passage has been that in the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; Josephus portrays the High Priest Ananus in a positive manner, while in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; he writes of Ananus in a negative tone. Louis Feldman rejects these arguments against the authenticity of the James passage and states that in several other unrelated cases the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; also differs from the &quot;Antiquities&quot;, and that an interpolator would have made the two accounts correspond more closely to each other, not make them differ.

The twenty-year gap between the writing of the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; and the &quot;Antiquities&quot; has also been used to explain some of the differences in tone between them. Clemens Thoma provides an explanation for this based on the observation that Josephus may have learned of the details of the actions of Ananus in the twenty-year gap between the writing of the Jewish Wars and the Antiquities, and thus avoided a positive tone when writing of Ananus in the &quot;Antiquities&quot;.

John Painter also states that the difference in the context for the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; and the &quot;Antiquities&quot; may account for some of the differences in tone between them. When writing of Ananus in a positive tone in the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot;, the context was Ananus&#x27; prudence in avoiding a war and hence Josephus considered that a positive aspect. However, when writing in the &quot;Antiquities&quot; about the actions of Ananus which resulted in his demotion from the High Priesthood, the context required the manifestation of a negative aspect of Ananus&#x27; character.

<doc id="16043" wikidata="Q1218" url="?curid=16043" title="Jerusalem">
<text>Jerusalem is a city in the Southern Levant, on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, and is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions — Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Both the State of Israel and the State of Palestine claim Jerusalem as their capital city. Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there, and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power. Neither claim is widely recognized internationally.

Throughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice, besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52 times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE), Jerusalem was named as &quot;Urusalim&quot; on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably meaning &quot;City of Shalem&quot; after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE, the city had developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. In 1538, the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been divided into four quarters – the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860, Jerusalem has grown far beyond the Old City&#x27;s boundaries. In 2022, Jerusalem had a population of some 971,800 residents, of which almost 60% were Jews and almost 40% Palestinians. In 2020, the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).

According to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First Temple. Modern scholars argue that Israelites branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous — and later monotheistic — religion centered on El/Yahweh. These foundational events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city () was probably attached to Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity, conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Islam, Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition, Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he spoke to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only , the Old City is home to many sites of seminal religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall, Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

At present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Under the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, Jerusalem was to be &quot;established as a &quot;corpus separatum&quot; under a special international regime&quot; administered by the United Nations. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, West Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan. Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and subsequently annexed it into the city&#x27;s municipality, together with additional surrounding territory. One of Israel&#x27;s Basic Laws, the 1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country&#x27;s undivided capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem, including the Knesset (Israel&#x27;s parliament), the residences of the prime minister and president, and the Supreme Court. The international community rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.

==Etymology and names==
===Etymology===
The name &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is variously etymologized to mean &quot;foundation (Semitic &quot;yry&quot;&#x27; &#x27;to found, to lay a cornerstone&#x27;) of the pagan god Shalem&quot;; the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.

Shalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion, whose name is based on the same root S-L-M from which the Hebrew word for &quot;peace&quot; is derived (&quot;Shalom&quot; in Hebrew, cognate with Arabic &quot;Salam&quot;). The name thus offered itself to etymologizations such as &quot;The City of Peace&quot;, &quot;Abode of Peace&quot;, &quot;Dwelling of Peace&quot; (&quot;founded in safety&quot;), or &quot;Vision of Peace&quot; in some Christian authors.

The ending &quot;-ayim&quot; indicates the dual, thus leading to the suggestion that the name &quot;Yerushalayim&quot; refers to the fact that the city initially sat on two hills.

===Ancient Egyptian sources===
The Execration Texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE), which refer to a city called &quot;rwšꜣlmm&quot; or &quot;&quot;, variously transcribed as &quot;Rušalimum&quot;, or &quot;Urušalimum&quot;, may indicate Jerusalem. Alternatively, the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE), which reference an &quot;Úrušalim&quot;, may be the earliest mention of the city.

===Hebrew Bible and Jewish sources===
The form &quot;Yerushalem&quot; or &quot;Yerushalayim&quot; first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of two names united by God, &quot;Yireh&quot; (&quot;the abiding place&quot;, the name given by Abraham to the place where he planned to sacrifice his son) and &quot;Shalem&quot; (&quot;Place of Peace&quot;, the name given by high priest Shem).

===Oldest written mention of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;===
One of the earliest extra-biblical Hebrew writing of the word &quot;Jerusalem&quot; is dated to the sixth or seventh century BCE and was discovered in Khirbet Beit Lei near Beit Guvrin in 1961. The inscription states: &quot;I am Yahweh thy God, I will accept the cities of Judah and I will redeem Jerusalem&quot;, or as other scholars suggest: &quot;Yahweh is the God of the whole earth. The mountains of Judah belong to him, to the God of Jerusalem&quot;. An earlier example of the name appears in a papyrus from the 7th century BCE.

In extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the &quot;-ayim&quot; ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.

===Jebus, Zion, City of David===
An ancient settlement of Jerusalem, founded as early as the Bronze Age on the hill above the Gihon Spring, was, according to the Bible, named Jebus. Called the &quot;Fortress of Zion&quot; (&quot;metsudat Zion&quot;), it was renamed as the &quot;City of David&quot;, and was known by this name in antiquity. Another name, &quot;Zion&quot;, initially referred to a distinct part of the city, but later came to signify the city as a whole, and afterwards to represent the whole biblical Land of Israel.

===Greek, Roman and Byzantine names===
In Greek and Latin, the city&#x27;s name was transliterated &quot;Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma&quot; (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek &quot;hieròs&quot;, &quot;ἱερός&quot;, means holy), and was the term used by Matthew and Mark in their gospels instead of the Hebrew term.

Up until the 2010s the consensus among historians was that following Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the Seleucid kingdom, and to be Hellenized as &quot;Hierapolis.&quot; However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the polis would be similar to &quot;Hierolophos&quot;.

The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina for part of the Roman period of its history.

===Salem===
The Aramaic Apocryphon of Genesis of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1QapGen 22:13) equates Jerusalem with the earlier &quot;Salem&quot; (שלם), said to be the kingdom of Melchizedek in Genesis 14. Other early Hebrew sources, early Christian renderings of the verse and &quot;targumim&quot;, however, put Salem in Northern Israel near Shechem (Sichem), now Nablus, a city of some importance in early sacred Hebrew writing. Possibly the redactor of the Apocryphon of Genesis wanted to dissociate Melchizedek from the area of Shechem, which at the time was in possession of the Samaritans. However that may be, later Rabbinic sources also equate Salem with Jerusalem, mainly to link Melchizedek to later Temple traditions.

===Arabic names===

Originally titled Bayt al-Maqdis, today, Jerusalem is most commonly known in Arabic as , transliterated as &quot;al-Quds&quot; and meaning &quot;the holy&quot; or &quot;the holy sanctuary&quot;, cognate with . The name is possibly a shortened form of &quot;Madīnat al-Quds&quot; &quot;city of the holy sanctuary&quot; after the Hebrew nickname with the same meaning, &quot;Ir ha-Qodesh&quot; (). The (Q) is pronounced either with a voiceless uvular plosive (/q/), as in Classical Arabic, or with a glottal stop (ʔ) as in Levantine Arabic. Official Israeli government policy mandates that , transliterated as &quot;Ūrušalīm&quot;, which is the name frequently used in Christian translations of the Bible into Arabic, be used as the Arabic language name for the city in conjunction with , giving , Ūrušalīm-al-Quds. Palestinian Arab families who hail from this city are often called &quot;&quot;Qudsi&quot; () or &quot;Maqdasi&quot;&quot; (), while Palestinian Muslim Jerusalemites may use these terms as a demonym.

==History==

Jerusalem is one of the world&#x27;s oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian Execration texts around 2000 BCE as &quot;Rusalimum.&quot; By the 17th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age, Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.

The city&#x27;s importance grew during the &quot;Israelite period&quot;, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel. David&#x27;s son, Solomon, built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious center. Following the kingdom&#x27;s split, Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the &quot;Second Temple period&quot;. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish autonomy, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.

In 63 BCE, Jerusalem was conquered by Pompey and became part of the Roman Empire. The city remained under Roman control until the Jewish-Roman Wars, which culminated in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The city was renamed &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot; and rebuilt as a Roman colony after the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), with Jews banned from entering the city. Jerusalem gained significance during the Byzantine Empire as a center of Christianity, particularly after Constantine the Great endorsed the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.

During the Crusades, Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517. In the modern period, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city&#x27;s history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasize the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city&#x27;s broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem&#x27;s status and future.

==Political status==
From 1923 until 1948, Jerusalem served as the administrative capital of Mandatory Palestine.

From 1949 until 1967, West Jerusalem served as Israel&#x27;s capital, but was not recognized as such internationally because UN General Assembly Resolution 194 envisaged Jerusalem as an international city. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem came under Israeli control. On 27 June 1967, the government of Levi Eshkol extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the Jordanian waqf, under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.

In 1988, Israel ordered the closure of Orient House, home of the Arab Studies Society, but also the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, for security reasons. The building reopened in 1992 as a Palestinian guesthouse. The Oslo Accords stated that the final status of Jerusalem would be determined by negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. The accords banned any official Palestinian presence in the city until a final peace agreement, but provided for the opening of a Palestinian trade office in East Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority regards East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.

President Mahmoud Abbas has said that any agreement that did not include East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine would be unacceptable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has similarly stated that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. Due to its proximity to the city, especially the Temple Mount, Abu Dis, a Palestinian suburb of Jerusalem, has been proposed as the future capital of a Palestinian state by Israel. Israel has not incorporated Abu Dis within its security wall around Jerusalem. The Palestinian Authority has built a possible future parliament building for the Palestinian Legislative Council in the town, and its Jerusalem Affairs Offices are all located in Abu Dis.

===International status===
While the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the occupied Palestinian territories, neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the State of Palestine. Under the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a corpus separatum administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city.

===Status under Israeli rule===
Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.

In 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister Moshe Kahlon said that the bill sent &quot;a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided&quot;, and that &quot;all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel&#x27;s sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading&quot;.

The status of the city, and especially its holy places, remains a core issue in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The Israeli government has approved building plans in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City in order to expand the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem, while some Islamic leaders have made claims that Jews have no historical connection to Jerusalem, alleging that the 2,500-year-old Western Wall was constructed as part of a mosque. Palestinians regard Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Palestine, and the city&#x27;s borders have been the subject of bilateral talks. A team of experts assembled by the then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in 2000 concluded that the city must be divided, since Israel had failed to achieve any of its national aims there.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in 2014 that &quot;Jerusalem will never be divided&quot;. A poll conducted in June 2013 found that 74% of Israeli Jews reject the idea of a Palestinian capital in any portion of Jerusalem, though 72% of the public regarded it as a divided city. A poll conducted by Palestinian Centre for Public Opinion and American Pechter Middle East Polls for the Council on Foreign Relations, among East Jerusalem Arab residents in 2011 revealed that 39% of East Jerusalem Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship contrary to 31% who opted for Palestinian citizenship. According to the poll, 40% of Palestinian residents would prefer to leave their neighbourhoods if they would be placed under Palestinian rule.
===Jerusalem as capital of Israel===
On 5 December 1949, Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, proclaimed Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s &quot;eternal&quot; and &quot;sacred&quot; capital, and eight days later specified that only the war had &quot;compelled&quot; the Israeli leadership &quot;to establish the seat of Government in Tel Aviv&quot;, while &quot;for the State of Israel there has always been and always will be one capital only – Jerusalem the Eternal&quot;, and that after the war, efforts had been ongoing for creating the conditions for &quot;the Knesset... returning to Jerusalem.&quot; This indeed took place, and since the beginning of 1950 all branches of the Israeli government — legislative, judicial, and executive — have resided there, except for the Ministry of Defense, which is located at HaKirya in Tel Aviv. At the time of Ben Gurion&#x27;s proclamations and the ensuing Knesset vote of 24 January 1950, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan, and thus the proclamation only applied to West Jerusalem.

In July 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as Basic Law. The law declared Jerusalem the &quot;complete and united&quot; capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Law was condemned by the international community, which did not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 478 on 20 August 1980, which declared that the Jerusalem Law is &quot;a violation of international law&quot;, is &quot;null and void and must be rescinded forthwith&quot;. Member states were called upon to withdraw their diplomatic representation from Jerusalem.

Following the resolution, 22 of the 24 countries that previously had their embassy in (West) Jerusalem relocated them in Tel Aviv, where many embassies already resided prior to Resolution 478. Costa Rica and El Salvador followed in 2006. There are five embassies — United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Papua-New Guinea and Kosovo
 — and two consulates located within the city limits of Jerusalem, and two Latin American states maintain embassies in the Jerusalem District town of Mevaseret Zion (Bolivia and Paraguay). There are a number of consulates-general located in Jerusalem, which work primarily either with Israel, or the Palestinian authorities.

In 1995, the United States Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which required, subject to conditions, that its embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On 6 December 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital and announced his intention to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of United States policy on the issue. The move was criticized by many nations. A resolution condemning the US decision was supported by all the 14 other members of the UN Security Council, but was vetoed by the US on 18 December 2017. A subsequent resolution condemning the US decision was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. On 14 May 2018, the United States officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem, transforming its Tel Aviv location into a consulate. Due to the general lack of international recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, some non-Israeli media outlets use Tel Aviv as a metonym for Israel.

In April 2017, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced it viewed Western Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital in the context of UN-approved principles which include the status of East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. On 15 December 2018, Australia officially recognized West Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, but said their embassy in Tel Aviv would stay until a two-state resolution was settled. The decision was reversed in October 2022.

====Government precinct and national institutions====
The Kiryat HaLeom (national precinct) project is intended to house most government agencies and national cultural institutions. They are located in the Kiryat HaMemshala (government complex) in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Some government buildings are located in Kiryat Menachem Begin. The city is home to the Knesset, the Supreme Court, the Bank of Israel, the National Headquarters of the Israel Police, the official residences of the President and Prime Minister, the Cabinet, and all ministries except for the Ministry of Defense (which is located in central Tel Aviv&#x27;s HaKirya district) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (which is located in Rishon LeZion, in the wider Tel Aviv metropolitan area, near Beit Dagan).

====Israeli settlements====

Since its capture in 1967, the Israeli government has built 12 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, with a population amounting to 220,000 Israeli Jewish settlers as of 2019. The international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law.

===Jerusalem as capital of Palestine===

The Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as occupied territory according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. The Palestinian Authority claims Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif, as the capital of the State of Palestine, The PLO claims that West Jerusalem is also subject to permanent status negotiations. However, it has stated that it would be willing to consider alternative solutions, such as making Jerusalem an open city.

The PLO&#x27;s position is that East Jerusalem, as defined by the pre-1967 municipal boundaries, shall be the capital of Palestine and West Jerusalem the capital of Israel, with each state enjoying full sovereignty over its respective part of the city and with its own municipality. A joint &quot;development council&quot; would be responsible for coordinated development. Orient House in East Jerusalem served as the headquarters of the PLO in the 1980s and 1990s. It was closed by Israel in 2001, two days after the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing.

Some states, such as Russia and China, recognize the Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/292 affirmed that the Palestinian people have the right to sovereignty over East Jerusalem.

==== Palestinian offices and institutions ====
Government offices are located outside the Israeli municipal limits include the Palestinian Security Services, Force 17, the Preventative Security Service and the Ministry of Interior. There is a Palestinian Authority regional office and an electoral office located in the Dahiyat al Barid neighborhood.

==Municipal administration==
The Jerusalem City Council is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies. The former mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, was elected in 2003. In the November 2008 city elections, Nir Barkat was elected. In November 2018, Moshe Lion was elected mayor.

Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was Teddy Kollek, who spent 28 years — six consecutive terms — in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public. Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.

The headquarters of the Jerusalem Municipality and the mayor&#x27;s office are at Safra Square (&quot;Kikar Safra&quot;) on Jaffa Road. The municipal complex, comprising two modern buildings and ten renovated historic buildings surrounding a large plaza, opened in 1993 when it moved from the old town hall building built by the Mandate authorities. The city falls under the Jerusalem District, with Jerusalem as the district&#x27;s capital. 37% of the population is Palestinian, but in 2014 not more than 10% of tax revenues were allocated for them. In East Jerusalem, 52% of the land was excluded from development, 35% designated for Jewish settlements, and 13% for Palestinian use, almost all of which was already built upon.

In Oslo I Accord, certain parts of few neighborhoods were allotted to the Palestinian Authority. Parts of Sur Baher, Wadi al-Hummus, Umm Leisun and Umm Tuba, altogether came under Area A, which is completely controlled by the Palestinian Authority. Al-Ram and Dahiyat al-Barid are mostly in Area B, where both Palestine and Israel has control. Other parts of Beit Hanina, Kafr Aqab and Arab al-Jahalin also falls under Area B.

==Geography==
Jerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately . The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds (&quot;wadis&quot;). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom, a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of Gehenna or Hell.

The Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate, ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times, Jerusalem was surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.

Water supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns found in the city.

Jerusalem is east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On the opposite side of the city, approximately away, is the Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma&#x27;ale Adumim to the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev to the north.

Mount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest, serves as the national cemetery of Israel.

===Climate===

The city is characterized by a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. Snow flurries usually occur once or twice a winter, although the city experiences heavy snowfall every three to four years, on average, with short-lived accumulation.

January is the coldest month of the year, with an average temperature of ; July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of , and the summer months are usually rainless. The average annual precipitation is around , with rain occurring almost entirely between October and May. Snowfall is rare, and large snowfalls are even more rare. Jerusalem received over of snow on 13 December 2013, which nearly paralyzed the city. A day in Jerusalem has on average, 9.3 sunshine hours. With summers averaging similar temperatures as the coastline, the maritime influence from the Mediterranean Sea is strong, in particular given that Jerusalem is located on a similar latitude as scorching hot deserts not far to its east.

The highest recorded temperature in Jerusalem was on 28 and 30 August 1881, and the lowest temperature recorded was on 25 January 1907.

Most of the air pollution in Jerusalem comes from vehicular traffic. Many main streets in Jerusalem were not built to accommodate such a large volume of traffic, leading to traffic congestion and more carbon monoxide released into the air. Industrial pollution inside the city is sparse, but emissions from factories on the Israeli Mediterranean coast can travel eastward and settle over the city.

==Demographics==
===Demographic history===
Jerusalem&#x27;s population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the Old City of Jerusalem has been divided into Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and Armenian quarters. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the 1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem, or at least Reverend George Williams&#x27; subsequent labelling of it.

Most population data before 1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the Jerusalem District. These estimates suggest that since the end of the Crusades, Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.

Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.

===Current demographics===

In December 2007, Jerusalem had a population of 747,600 — 63.7% were Jewish, 33.1% Muslim, and 2% Christian.

According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city&#x27;s population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim birth rate, and Jewish residents leaving. The study also found that about nine percent of the Old City&#x27;s 32,488 people were Jews. Of the Jewish population, 200,000 live in East Jerusalem settlements which are considered illegal under international law.

In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former Soviet Union. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in. Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the Haredi Jewish and Arab communities. Consequently, the total fertility rate in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem&#x27;s 180,000 households is 3.8 people.

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%) — similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.

In 1967, Jews accounted for 74 percent of the population, while the figure for 2006 is down nine percent. Possible factors are the high cost of housing, fewer job opportunities and the increasingly religious character of the city, although proportionally, young Haredim are leaving in higher numbers. The percentage of secular Jews, or those who &#x27;wear their faith lightly&#x27; is dropping, with some 20,000 leaving the city over the past seven years (2012). They now number 31% of the population, the same percentage as the rising Haredi population.

In 2010, 61% of all Jewish children in Jerusalem studied in Haredi (Ultra-Orthodox) schools. This correlates with the high number of children in Haredi families.

While some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a &quot;Jerusalem resident status&quot; are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as Hadassah Medical Centre are available to residents.

Demographics and the Jewish-Arab population divide play a major role in the dispute over Jerusalem. In 1998, the Jerusalem Development Authority expanded city limits to the west to include more areas heavily populated with Jews.

Within the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate. In May 2012, it was reported that the Jewish birthrate had overtaken the Arab birthrate. The city&#x27;s birthrate stands about 4.2 children per Jewish family and 3.9 children per Arab family. In addition, increasing numbers of Jewish immigrants chose to settle in Jerusalem. In the last few years, thousands of Palestinians have moved to previously fully Jewish neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem, built after the 1967 Six-Day War. In 2007, 1,300 Palestinians lived in the previously exclusively Jewish neighbourhood of Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev and constituted three percent of the population in Neve Ya&#x27;akov. In the French Hill neighbourhood, Palestinians today constitute one-sixth of the overall population.At the end of 2008, the population of East Jerusalem was 456,300, comprising 60% of Jerusalem&#x27;s residents. Of these, 195,500 (43%) were Jews, (comprising 40% of the Jewish population of Jerusalem as a whole), and 260,800 (57%) were Muslim (comprising 98% of the Muslim population of Jerusalem). In 2008, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported the number of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem was 208,000 according to a recently completed census.

Jerusalem&#x27;s Jewish population is overwhelmingly religious. Only 18% of Jewish residents are secular. In addition, Haredi Jews comprise 35% of the city&#x27;s adult Jewish population. In a phenomenon seen rarely around the world, the percentage of Jewish women who work, 81%, exceeds the percentage of Jewish men who work, 70%.

Jerusalem had a population of 804,400 in 2011, of which Jews comprised 499,400 (62.1%), Muslims 281,100 (34.9%), Christians 14,700 (1.8%), and 9,000 (1.1%) were not classified by religion.

Jerusalem had a population of 882,700 in 2016, of which Jews comprised 536,600 (60.8%), Muslims 319,800 (36.2%), Christians 15,800 (1.8%), and 10,300 unclassified (1.2%).

Jerusalem had a population of 951,100 in 2020, of which Jews comprised 570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353.800 (37.2%), Christians 16.300 (1.7%), and 10,800 unclassified (1.1%).

According to Peace Now, approvals for building in Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem have expanded by 60% under Donald Trump&#x27;s term as U.S. president. Since 1991, Palestinians, who make up the majority of the residents in East Jerusalem, have only received 30% of the building permits.

===Urban planning issues===
Critics of efforts to promote a Jewish majority in Jerusalem say that government planning policies are motivated by demographic considerations and seek to limit Arab construction while promoting Jewish construction. According to a World Bank report, the number of recorded building violations between 1996 and 2000 was four and half times higher in Jewish neighbourhoods but four times fewer demolition orders were issued in West Jerusalem than in East Jerusalem; Arabs in Jerusalem were less likely to receive construction permits than Jews, and &quot;the authorities are much more likely to take action against Palestinian violators&quot; than Jewish violators of the permit process. In recent years, private Jewish foundations have received permission from the government to develop projects on disputed lands, such as the City of David archaeological site in the 60% Arab neighbourhood of Silwan (adjacent to the Old City), and the Museum of Tolerance on Mamilla Cemetery (adjacent to Zion Square).

==Religious significance==
Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The Temple Mount is the holiest spot in Judaism and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former Temples and Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Great Mosque of Mecca to this location during the Night Journey.

=== Judaism ===

Jerusalem has been the holiest city in Judaism and the ancestral and spiritual homeland of the Jewish people since King David proclaimed it his capital in the 10th century BCE. Without counting its other names, Jerusalem appears in the Hebrew Bible 669 times. The first section, the Torah (Pentateuch), only mentions Moriah, but in later parts of the Bible, the city is mentioned explicitly. The Temple Mount, which was the site of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the Second Temple, is the holiest site in Judaism and the place Jews turn towards during prayer. The Western Wall, a remnant of the wall surrounding the Second Temple, is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray. Synagogues around the world are traditionally built with the Holy Ark facing Jerusalem, and Arks within Jerusalem face the Holy of Holies. As prescribed in the Mishna and codified in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, daily prayers are recited while facing towards Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Many Jews have &quot;Mizrach&quot; plaques hung on a wall of their homes to indicate the direction of prayer. The Western Wall is a remnant of the Second Temple and the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray.

=== Christianity ===

Jerusalem is generally considered the cradle of Christianity. Christianity reveres Jerusalem for its Old Testament history, and also for its significance in the life of Jesus. According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Jerusalem soon after his birth and later in his life cleansed the Second Temple. The Cenacle, believed to be the site of Jesus&#x27; Last Supper, is located on Mount Zion in the same building that houses the Tomb of King David. Another prominent Christian site in Jerusalem is Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion. The Gospel of John describes it as being located outside Jerusalem, but recent archaeological evidence suggests Golgotha is a short distance from the Old City walls, within the present-day confines of the city. The land occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered one of the top candidates for Golgotha and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past 2000 years. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is generally considered the most important church in Christendom. It contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified, and Jesus&#x27;s empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.

=== Islam ===
Jerusalem is the third-holiest city in Sunni Islam. Islamic tradition holds that for approximately a year, before it was permanently switched to the Kaaba in Mecca, the &quot;qibla&quot; (direction of prayer) for Muslims was Jerusalem. The city&#x27;s lasting place in Islam, however, is primarily due to Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey (). Muslims believe that Muhammad was miraculously transported one night from the Great Mosque of Mecca to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whereupon he ascended to Heaven to meet previous prophets of Islam. The first verse in the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s &quot;Surat al-Isra&quot; notes the destination of Muhammad&#x27;s journey as &quot;al-masjid al-aqṣā&quot; (&quot;the farthest place of prayer&quot;). In the earliest days of Islam, this was understood as a reference to a site in the heavens, however, Post-Rashidun Islamic scholars understood it as relating to Jerusalem, and particularly to the site of the former Jewish Temple. The hadith, a collection of the sayings of Muhammad, mentions that the location of the Al-Aqsa Mosque is in Jerusalem. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, originally named after the wider compound it sits within, was built on the Temple Mount under the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid several decades after Muhammad&#x27;s death to commemorate the place from which Muslims believe he had ascended to Heaven.
==Economy==

Historically, Jerusalem&#x27;s economy was supported almost exclusively by religious pilgrims, as it was far from the major ports of Jaffa and Gaza. Jerusalem&#x27;s religious and cultural landmarks today remain the top draw for foreign visitors, with the majority of tourists visiting the Western Wall and the Old City. In 2010, Jerusalem was named the top leisure travel city in Africa and the Middle East by &quot;Travel + Leisure magazine&quot;.
in 2013, 75% of the 3.5 million tourists to Israel visited Jerusalem.
Since the establishment of the State of Israel, the national government has remained a major player in Jerusalem&#x27;s economy. The government, centred in Jerusalem, generates a large number of jobs, and offers subsidies and incentives for new business initiatives and start-ups. Although Tel Aviv remains Israel&#x27;s financial centre, a growing number of high tech companies are moving to Jerusalem, providing 12,000 jobs in 2006. Northern Jerusalem&#x27;s Har Hotzvim industrial park and the Jerusalem Technology Park in south Jerusalem are home to large Research and Development centres of international tech companies, among them Intel, Cisco Systems, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, IBM, Mobileye, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Medtronic and more. In April 2015, Time Magazine picked Jerusalem as one of the five emerging tech hubs in the world, proclaiming that &quot;The city has become a flourishing centre for biomed, cleantech, Internet/mobile startups, accelerators, investors and supporting service providers.&quot;
Higher than average percentages are employed in education (17.9% vs. 12.7%); health and welfare (12.6% vs. 10.7%); community and social services (6.4% vs. 4.7%); hotels and restaurants (6.1% vs. 4.7%); and public administration (8.2% vs. 4.7%). During the British Mandate, a law was passed requiring all buildings to be constructed of Jerusalem stone in order to preserve the unique historic and aesthetic character of the city. Complementing this building code, which is still in force, is the discouragement of heavy industry in Jerusalem; only about 2.2% of Jerusalem&#x27;s land is zoned for &quot;industry and infrastructure&quot;. By comparison, the percentage of land in Tel Aviv zoned for industry and infrastructure is twice as high, and in Haifa, seven times as high. Only 8.5% of the Jerusalem District work force is employed in the manufacturing sector, which is half the national average (15.8%).

Although many statistics indicate economic growth in the city, since 1967, East Jerusalem has lagged behind the development of West Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the percentage of households with employed persons is higher for Arab households (76.1%) than for Jewish households (66.8%). The unemployment rate in Jerusalem (8.3%) is slightly better than the national average (9.0%), although the civilian labour force accounted for less than half of all persons fifteen years or older — lower in comparison to that of Tel Aviv (58.0%) and Haifa (52.4%). Poverty remains a problem in the city as 37% of the families in Jerusalem lived in 2011 below the poverty line. According to a report by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), 78% of Arabs in Jerusalem lived in poverty in 2012, up from 64% in 2006. While the ACRI attributes the increase to the lack of employment opportunities, infrastructure and a worsening educational system, Ir Amim blames the legal status of Palestinians in Jerusalem.

The increasing number of educated Palestinians in Jerusalem has brought about positive economic changes. Through reforms and initiatives in sectors like technology, tourism, trade, and infrastructure, they have helped drive economic growth, create jobs, and improve living conditions in the city. Various joint summits between Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs have been held in the city. Palestine Investment Fund have proposed various projects in Jerusalem. Palestinian industrialist Bashar Masri sought to make heavy investments in the city. PA controlled industrial areas are located outskirts of Jerusalem, primarily in Bir Nabala, Abu Dis and Eizariya, engaging in manufacture of tires, food products and concretes.

High-tech industry is emerged among Palestinian society of Jerusalem. In 2023, Israel opened a technology park in East Jerusalem, known as EasTech. Local Palestinian engineers are employed in the complex by multinational companies, some of which includes AT&amp;T, Natural Intelligence, Nvidia, Unity and Synamedia. Station J, an innovation hub is located in Sheikh Jarrah, which is yet another tech hub for Palestinians in the city. Hani Alami, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian entrepreneur has set up a start-+up accelerator. As a part of Israeli–Palestinian economic peace efforts, interaction between Israeli and Palestinian business community, also contributes in growth of Palestinian IT sector in the city.

== Urban structure ==

===High-rise construction===
Jerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem&#x27;s tallest building, is a skyscraper by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.

A new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line Jaffa Road and King George Street. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the Jerusalem Chords Bridge and the Central Bus Station, twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an underground train station serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city&#x27;s main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city&#x27;s courts and the prosecutor&#x27;s office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and Israel State Archives. The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem. In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by Daniel Libeskind and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it is set to break ground by 2019.

=== New projects in Jerusalem ===
In 2021, Bashar Masri announced and launched &quot;Lana&quot;, a massive mix-used project in East Jerusalem, which is located in the neighborhood of Beit Hanina. The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial center that hosts well-known global brands, cinemas, restaurants, cafes, and offices. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a kindergarten, catering to the needs of residents. In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasizes the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings. This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents&#x27; vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors. It is situated just 15 minutes away from the historic Old City of Jerusalem.

==Transportation==
===Public transport===
Jerusalem is served by highly developed communication infrastructures, making it a leading logistics hub for Israel.

The Jerusalem Central Bus Station, located on Jaffa Road, is the busiest bus station in Israel. It is served by Egged Bus Cooperative, which is the second-largest bus company in the world, The Dan serves the Bnei Brak-Jerusalem route along with Egged, and Superbus serves the routes between Jerusalem, Modi&#x27;in Illit, and Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut. The companies operate from Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Arab neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem and routes between Jerusalem and locations in the West Bank are served by the East Jerusalem Central Bus Station, a transportation hub located near the Old City&#x27;s Damascus Gate.

===Railway===
The Jerusalem Light Rail initiated service in August 2011. According to plans, the first rail line will be capable of transporting an estimated 200,000 people daily, and has 23 stops. The route is from Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev in the north via the Old City and city centre to Mt. Herzl in the south.

A high-speed rail line connecting Tel Aviv to Jerusalem became partially operational in 2018 and was completed in 2019. Its terminus is at the new underground station ( deep) serving the International Convention Centre and the Central Bus Station, and is planned to be extended eventually to Malha station. Israel Railways operated train services to Malha train station from Tel Aviv via Beit Shemesh, but this service was discontinued in 2020.

Begin Expressway is one of Jerusalem&#x27;s major north–south thoroughfares; it runs on the western side of the city, merging in the north with Route 443, which continues toward Tel Aviv. Route 60 runs through the centre of the city near the Green Line between East and West Jerusalem. Construction is progressing on parts of a ring road around the city, fostering faster connection between the suburbs. The eastern half of the project was conceptualized decades ago, but reaction to the proposed highway is still mixed.

===Airport===
In the past, Jerusalem was also served by the local Jerusalem International Airport, locally known as Atarot Airport. It was the first airport built in the British Mandate of Palestine. Palestinians considered the Atarot Airport as a &quot;symbol of Palestinian sovereignty&quot;. The airport falls beyond Green Line. After 1948 war, it came under control of Jordan. Following the Six Day War of 1967, the airport came under control of Israel. With increase of violence in the second intifada, Atarot Airport ceased operation in 2000. Today Jerusalem is served by Ben Gurion Airport, some northwest of the Jerusalem, on the route to Tel Aviv. The Tel Aviv–Jerusalem railway runs non-stop from Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station to the airport and began operation in 2018.

Australian businessman Kevin Bermeister proposed a masterplan of Jerusalem, which also includes the development of an airport for Jerusalem in the Jordan Valley, near Jericho. The airport is sought to be a joint Israeli-Palestinian airport. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh have also appealed to Israeli authorities to redevelop the airport. In 2021, the Israeli government planned to redevelop Atarot Airport as a joint Israeli–Palestinian airport. The new Atarot Airport will include two separate Israeli and Palestinian terminals.

==Education==
===Universities===
Jerusalem is home to several prestigious universities offering courses in Hebrew, Arabic and English.

Founded in 1925, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has been ranked among the top 100 schools in the world. The Board of Governors has included such prominent Jewish intellectuals as Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The university has produced several Nobel laureates; recent winners associated with Hebrew University include Avram Hershko, David Gross, and Daniel Kahneman. One of the university&#x27;s major assets is the Jewish National and University Library, which houses over five million books. The library opened in 1892, over three decades before the university was established, and is one of the world&#x27;s largest repositories of books on Jewish subjects. Today it is both the central library of the university and the national library of Israel. The Hebrew University operates three campuses in Jerusalem, on Mount Scopus, on Giv&#x27;at Ram and a medical campus at the Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. The Academy of the Hebrew Language are located in the Hebrew university in Givat Ram and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities located near the Presidents House.
The Jerusalem College of Technology, founded in 1969, combines training in engineering and other high-tech industries with a Jewish studies programme. It is one of many schools in Jerusalem, from elementary school and up, that combine secular and religious studies. Numerous religious educational institutions and &quot;Yeshivot&quot;, including some of the most prestigious yeshivas, among them the Brisk, Chevron, Midrash Shmuel and Mir, are based in the city, with the Mir Yeshiva claiming to be the largest. There were nearly 8,000 twelfth-grade students in Hebrew-language schools during the 2003–2004 school year. However, due to the large portion of students in Haredi Jewish frameworks, only fifty-five percent of twelfth graders took matriculation exams (&quot;Bagrut&quot;) and only thirty-seven percent were eligible to graduate. Unlike public schools, many Haredi schools do not prepare students to take standardized tests. To attract more university students to Jerusalem, the city has begun to offer a special package of financial incentives and housing subsidies to students who rent apartments in downtown Jerusalem.

Al-Quds University was established in 1984 to serve as a flagship university for the Arab and Palestinian peoples. It describes itself as the &quot;only Arab university in Jerusalem&quot;. Bard College of Annandale-on-Hudson, New York and Al-Quds University agreed to open a joint college in a building originally built to house the Palestinian Legislative Council and Yasser Arafat&#x27;s office. The college gives Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Al-Quds University resides southeast of the city proper on a Abu Dis campus. Other campuses of AQU are located within city limits of Jerusalem. A campus of university in Sheikh Jarrah, which is one of the oldest faculties, is known as Hind Al Husseini College for Arts. It was named after Hind al-Husseini, a Palestinian activists known for rescuing orphaned survivors of Deir Yassin massacre and giving them shelter in a palace of her grandfather, which was converted into an orphanage and later a college, which is a part today&#x27;s Al Quds University. A joint campus of AQU and Bard College is located in Beit Hanina. Bayt Mal Al Qods Acharif Agency, a Moroccan organization is constructing a new campus in same neighborhood.

Other institutions of higher learning in Jerusalem are the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, whose buildings are located on the campuses of the Hebrew University.

===Arab schools===
Israel&#x27;s public schools for Arabs in Jerusalem and other parts of the country have been criticized for offering a lower quality education than those catering to Israeli Jewish students. While many schools in the heavily Arab East Jerusalem are filled to capacity and there have been complaints of overcrowding, the Jerusalem Municipality is building over a dozen new schools in the city&#x27;s Arab neighbourhoods. Schools in Ras el-Amud and Umm Lison opened in 2008. In March 2007, the Israeli government approved a five-year plan to build 8,000 new classrooms in the city, 40 percent in the Arab sector and 28 percent in the Haredi sector. A budget of 4.6 billion shekels was allocated for this project. In 2008, Jewish British philanthropists donated $3 million for the construction of schools for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Arab high school students take the &quot;Bagrut&quot; matriculation exams, so that much of their curriculum parallels that of other Israeli high schools and includes certain Jewish subjects.

==Culture==
Although Jerusalem is known primarily for its religious significance, the city is also home to many artistic and cultural venues. The Israel Museum attracts nearly one million visitors a year, approximately one-third of them tourists. The museum complex comprises several buildings featuring special exhibits and extensive collections of Judaica, archaeological findings, and Israeli and European art. The Dead Sea scrolls, discovered in the mid-20th century in the Qumran Caves near the Dead Sea, are housed in the Museum&#x27;s Shrine of the Book. The Youth Wing, which mounts changing exhibits and runs an extensive art education programme, is visited by 100,000 children a year. The museum has a large outdoor sculpture garden and includes the Holyland Model of Jerusalem, a scale-model of the city during the late Second Temple period. The Ticho House in downtown Jerusalem houses the paintings of Anna Ticho and the Judaica collections of her husband, an ophthalmologist who opened Jerusalem&#x27;s first eye clinic in this building in 1912.

Next to the Israel Museum is the Bible Lands Museum, near The National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel, which includes the Israel Antiquities Authority offices. A World Bible Centre is planned to be built adjacent to Mount Zion at a site called the &quot;Bible Hill&quot;. A planned World Kabbalah Centre is to be located on the nearby promenade, overlooking the Old City. The Rockefeller Museum, located in East Jerusalem, was the first archaeological museum in the Middle East. It was built in 1938 during the British Mandate. In 2006, a Jerusalem Trail was opened, a hiking trail that goes to many cultural sites and national parks in and around Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has ranked consistently as Israel&#x27;s top tourist attraction for Israelis. The national cemetery of Israel is located at the city&#x27;s western edge, near the Jerusalem Forest on Mount Herzl. The western extension of Mount Herzl is the Mount of Remembrance, where the main Holocaust museum of Israel is located. Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, houses the world&#x27;s largest library of Holocaust-related information. It houses an estimated 100,000 books and articles. The complex contains a state-of-the-art museum that explores the genocide of the Jews through exhibits that focus on the personal stories of individuals and families killed in the Holocaust. An art gallery featuring the work of artists who perished is also present. Further, Yad Vashem commemorates the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis, and honours the Righteous among the Nations.

The Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, established in the 1940s, has appeared around the world. The International Convention Centre (&quot;Binyanei HaUma&quot;) near the entrance to city houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The Jerusalem Cinemateque, the Gerard Behar Centre (formerly Beit Ha&#x27;Am) in downtown Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Music Centre in Yemin Moshe, and the Targ Music Centre in Ein Kerem also present the arts. The Israel Festival, featuring indoor and outdoor performances by local and international singers, concerts, plays, and street theatre has been held annually since 1961, and Jerusalem has been the major organizer of this event. The Jerusalem Theatre in the Talbiya neighbourhood hosts over 150 concerts a year, as well as theatre and dance companies and performing artists from overseas. The Khan Theatre, located in a caravanserai opposite the old Jerusalem train station, is the city&#x27;s only repertoire theatre. The station itself has become a venue for cultural events in recent years as the site of &quot;Shav&#x27;ua Hasefer&quot; (an annual week-long book fair) and outdoor music performances. The Jerusalem Film Festival is held annually, screening Israeli and international films. In 1974 the Jerusalem Cinematheque was founded. In 1981 it was moved to a new building on Hebron Road near the Valley of Hinnom and the Old City.

Jerusalem was declared the Capital of Arab Culture in 2009. Jerusalem is home to the Palestinian National Theatre, which engages in cultural preservation as well as innovation, working to rekindle Palestinian interest in the arts. The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music sponsors the Palestine Youth Orchestra which toured Arab states of the Persian Gulf and other Middle East countries in 2009. The Islamic Museum on the Temple Mount, established in 1923, houses many Islamic artifacts, from tiny kohl flasks and rare manuscripts to giant marble columns. Al-Hoash, established in 2004, is a gallery for the preservation of Palestinian art. While Israel approves and financially supports some Arab cultural activities, Arab Capital of Culture events were banned because they were sponsored by the Palestine National Authority. In 2009, a four-day culture festival was held in the Beit &#x27;Anan suburb of Jerusalem, attended by more than 15,000 people

Palestinian cinema is based in the city. Jerusalem has been location for &quot;Jerusalem Arab Film Festival&quot;, for exhibiting Palestinian films. The city is home to numerous artists, singers, actors, actresses and filmmakers. Established in 1991, Riwaq have been working on various projects to restore cultural and historical sites across Palestine. Difficulties to operate in the annexed areas of Palestinian Jerusalem, it have successfully worked across those neighborhoods, rural and suburban area and Jerusalem Mountains (&quot;Jibal al-Quds&quot;), where the Palestinian government has control. So far, the organization have restored a number of sites across neighborhoods of Kafr &#x27;Aqab, Al Jib, Jaba and Qalandia. Those restored structures serves as local community centers, cultural sites and headquarters of several NGOs and cultural groups. Yabous Cultural Center is the largest cultural center in the city, opened by Palestinian groups in 1997. Edward Said National Conservatory of Music have a branch in Jerusalem.

Hadassah Medical Center and the Hebrew University have unveiled a &quot;Tree of Peace&quot; statue at the Al Quds University School of Dental Medicine. The Museum on the Seam, which explores issues of coexistence through art, is situated on the road dividing eastern and western Jerusalem. The Abraham Fund and the Jerusalem Intercultural Centre (JICC) promote joint Jewish-Palestinian cultural projects. The Jerusalem Centre for Middle Eastern Music and Dance is open to Arabs and Jews and offers workshops on Jewish-Arab dialogue through the arts. The Jewish-Arab Youth Orchestra performs both European classical and Middle Eastern music. In 2008, the Tolerance Monument, an outdoor sculpture by Czesław Dźwigaj, was erected on a hill between Jewish Armon HaNetziv and Arab Jebl Mukaber as a symbol of Jerusalem&#x27;s quest for peace.

=== Media ===
The headquarters of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and its successor Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation are located in Jerusalem, as well as television and radio studios for Channel 12, Channel 13, and part of the radio studios of BBC News. &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; and &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; are also headquartered in Jerusalem. Local newspapers include the Israeli &quot;Kol Ha&#x27;ir&quot; and the Palestinian &quot;Jerusalem Times&quot;. God TV, an international Christian television network, is also based in the city. PYALARA, an organisation based in Jerusalem, transformed Jaba into a digital hub, which is the Middle East&#x27;s first digital village and is also home to first Media Interactive Learning Center in the Middle East.

=== Sports ===


The two most popular sports are football (soccer) and basketball. Beitar Jerusalem Football Club is one of the most well known in Israel. Fans include political figures who often attend its games. Jerusalem&#x27;s other major football team, and one of Beitar&#x27;s top rivals, is Hapoel Jerusalem F.C. Whereas Beitar has been Israel State Cup champion seven times, Hapoel has won the Cup only once. Beitar has won the top league six times, while Hapoel has never succeeded. Beitar plays in the more prestigious Ligat HaAl, while Hapoel is in the second division Liga Leumit.

<text>John Edgar Hoover (January 1, 1895 – May 2, 1972) was an American attorney and law enforcement administrator who served as the fifth and final Director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) and the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). President Calvin Coolidge first appointed Hoover as director of the BOI, the predecessor to the FBI, in 1924. After 11 years in the post, Hoover became instrumental in founding the FBI in June 1935, where he remained as director for an additional 37 years until his death in May 1972 – serving a total of 48 years leading both the BOI and the FBI under eight Presidents.

Hoover expanded the FBI into a larger crime-fighting agency and instituted a number of modernizations to policing technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories. Hoover also established and expanded a national blacklist, referred to as the FBI Index or Index List.

Later in life and after his death, Hoover became a controversial figure as evidence of his secretive abuses of power began to surface. He was also found to have routinely violated both the FBI&#x27;s own policies and the very laws which the FBI was charged with enforcing, to have used the FBI to harass and sabotage political dissidents, and to have extensively collected information on officials and private citizens using illegal surveillance, wiretapping, and burglaries. Hoover consequently amassed a great deal of power and was able to intimidate and threaten high-ranking political figures.

==Early life and education==

Hoover was born on New Year&#x27;s Day 1895 in Washington, D.C., to German American Anna Marie (&quot;née&quot; Scheitlin; 1860–1938) and Dickerson Naylor Hoover (1856–1921), chief of the printing division of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, formerly a plate maker for the same organization. Dickerson Hoover was of English and German ancestry. Hoover&#x27;s maternal great-uncle, John Hitz, was a Swiss honorary consul general to the United States. Among his family, he was the closest to his mother, who despite being &quot;inclined to instruction&quot;, showed great affection towards her son.

Hoover was born in a house on the present site of Capitol Hill United Methodist Church, located on Seward Square near Eastern Market in Washington&#x27;s Capitol Hill neighborhood. A stained glass window in the church is dedicated to him. Hoover did not have a birth certificate filed upon his birth, although it was required in 1895 in Washington. Two of his siblings did have certificates, but Hoover&#x27;s was not filed until 1938 when he was 43.

Hoover lived his entire life in Washington, D.C. He attended Central High School, where he sang in the school choir, participated in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program, and competed on the debate team. During debates, he argued against women getting the right to vote and against the abolition of the death penalty. The school newspaper applauded his &quot;cool, relentless logic.&quot; Hoover stuttered as a boy, which he later learned to manage by teaching himself to talk quickly—a style that he carried through his adult career. He eventually spoke with such ferocious speed that stenographers had a hard time following him.

Hoover was 18 years old when he accepted his first job, an entry-level position as messenger in the orders department at the Library of Congress. The library was a half mile from his house. The experience shaped both Hoover and the creation of the FBI profiles; as Hoover noted in a 1951 letter: &quot;This job ... trained me in the value of collating material. It gave me an excellent foundation for my work in the FBI where it has been necessary to collate information and evidence.&quot;

Hoover obtained a Bachelor of Laws from the George Washington University Law School in 1916, where he was a member of the Alpha Nu Chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order, a Southern fraternity that was born out of a desire to &quot;carry on the legacy of the &#x27;incomparable flower of Southern Knighthood&#x27;&quot; after the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865. Some prominent Kappa Alpha alumni, who had an influence on Hoover&#x27;s future beliefs, included author Thomas Dixon and John Temple Graves. Hoover graduated with an LL.M. in 1917 from the same university. While a law student, Hoover became interested in the career of Anthony Comstock, the New York City U.S. Postal Inspector, who waged prolonged campaigns against fraud, vice, pornography, and birth control.

==Department of Justice==
===War Emergency Division===
Immediately after getting his LL.M. degree, Hoover was hired by the Justice Department to work in the War Emergency Division. He accepted the clerkship on July 27, 1917, aged 22. The job paid $990 a year ($ in 2025 dollars) and was exempt from the draft.

Hoover soon became the head of the Division&#x27;s Alien Enemy Bureau, authorized by President Woodrow Wilson at the beginning of World War I to arrest and jail allegedly disloyal foreigners without trial. He received additional authority from the 1917 Espionage Act. Out of a list of 1,400 suspicious Germans living in the U.S., the Bureau arrested 98 and designated 1,172 as arrestable.

===Bureau of Investigation===
====Head of the Radical Division====
In August 1919, the 24-year-old Hoover became head of the Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s new General Intelligence Division, also known as the Radical Division because its goal was to monitor and disrupt the work of domestic radicals. America&#x27;s First Red Scare was beginning, and one of Hoover&#x27;s first assignments was to carry out the Palmer Raids. Hoover and his chosen assistant, George Ruch, monitored a variety of U.S. radicals. Targets during this period included Marcus Garvey; Rose Pastor Stokes and Cyril Briggs; Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman; and future Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, who, Hoover maintained, was &quot;the most dangerous man in the United States.&quot; In 1920, the 25-year-old Edgar Hoover was initiated as a Freemason at D.C.&#x27;s Federal Lodge No. 1 in Washington, D.C. He went on to join the Scottish Rite in which he was made a 33rd Degree Inspector General Honorary in 1955.

====Head of the Bureau of Investigation====
In 1921, Hoover rose in the Bureau of Investigation to deputy head, and in 1924 the Attorney General made him the acting director. On May 10, 1924, President Calvin Coolidge appointed Hoover as the fifth Director of the Bureau of Investigation, partly in response to allegations that the prior director, William J. Burns, was involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents. Hoover fired all female agents and banned the future hiring of them.
Hoover was sometimes unpredictable in his leadership. He frequently fired Bureau agents, singling out those he thought &quot;looked stupid like truck drivers,&quot; or whom he considered &quot;pinheads.&quot; He also relocated agents who had displeased him to career-ending assignments and locations. Melvin Purvis was a prime example: Purvis was one of the most effective agents in capturing and breaking up 1930s gangs, and it is alleged that Hoover maneuvered him out of the Bureau because he was envious of the substantial public recognition Purvis received.

In December 1929, Hoover oversaw the protection detail for the Japanese Naval Delegation who were visiting Washington, D.C., on their way to attend negotiations for the 1930 London Naval Treaty (officially called Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament). The Japanese delegation was greeted at Washington Union (train) Station by U.S. Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson and the Japanese Ambassador Katsuji Debuchi. The Japanese delegation then visited the White House to meet with President Herbert Hoover.

===Depression-era gangsters===
In the early 1930s, criminal gangs carried out large numbers of bank robberies in the Midwest. They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest. Many of these criminals frequently made newspaper headlines across the United States, particularly John Dillinger, who became famous for leaping over bank cages, and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps.

The robbers operated across state lines, and Hoover pressed to have their crimes recognized as federal offenses so that he and his men would have the authority to pursue them and get the credit for capturing them. Initially, the Bureau suffered some embarrassing foul-ups, in particular with Dillinger and his conspirators. A raid on a summer lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, called &quot;Little Bohemia&quot;, left a Bureau agent and a civilian bystander dead and others wounded; all the gangsters escaped.
Hoover realized that his job was then on the line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits. In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the Chicago office, received a tip on Dillinger&#x27;s whereabouts that paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed, and killed by Bureau agents outside the Biograph Theater. Hoover was credited for overseeing several highly publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and bank robbers. These included those of Machine Gun Kelly in 1933, of Dillinger in 1934, and of Alvin Karpis in 1936, which led to the Bureau&#x27;s powers being broadened.

In 1935, the Bureau of Investigation was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). It was not simply a name change. A great deal of restructuring was done. In fact, Hoover visited the lab of Canadian forensic scientist Wilfrid Derome twice – in 1929 and 1932 – to plan the foundation of his own FBI laboratory in the USA.

In 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in domestic intelligence, thanks in large part to changes made by Hoover, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division, to compiling the largest collection of fingerprints to date, and Hoover&#x27;s help to expand the FBI&#x27;s recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine and analyze evidence found by the FBI.

===American Mafia===
During the 1930s, Hoover persistently denied the existence of organized crime, despite numerous organized crime shootings as Mafia groups struggled for control of the lucrative profits deriving from illegal alcohol sales during Prohibition, and later for control of prostitution, illegal drugs and other criminal enterprises. 
Many writers believe Hoover&#x27;s denial of the Mafia&#x27;s existence and his failure to use the full force of the FBI to investigate it were due to Mafia gangsters Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello&#x27;s possession of embarrassing photographs of Hoover in the company of his &quot;protégé&quot;, FBI Deputy Director Clyde Tolson. Other writers believe Costello corrupted Hoover by providing him with horseracing tips, passed through a mutual friend, gossip columnist Walter Winchell. Hoover had a reputation as &quot;an inveterate horseplayer&quot; and was known to send Special Agents to place $100 bets for him. Hoover once said the Bureau had &quot;much more important functions&quot; than arresting bookmakers and gamblers.

Although Hoover built the reputation of the FBI arresting bank robbers in the 1930s, his main interest had always been Communist subversion, and during the Cold War he was able to focus the FBI&#x27;s attention on these investigations. From the mid-1940s through the mid-50s, he paid little attention to criminal vice rackets such as illegal drugs, prostitution, extortion, and flatly denied the existence of the Mafia in the United States. In the 1950s, evidence of the FBI&#x27;s unwillingness to investigate the Mafia became a topic of public criticism. After the Apalachin meeting of crime bosses in 1957, Hoover could no longer deny the existence of a nationwide crime syndicate. In fact, Cosa Nostra&#x27;s control of the Syndicate&#x27;s many branches operating criminal activities throughout North America prevailed and was heavily reported in popular newspapers and magazines. Hoover created the &quot;Top Hoodlum Program&quot; and went after the syndicate&#x27;s top bosses throughout the country.

===Investigation of subversion and radicals===

Hoover was concerned about what he claimed was subversion, and under his leadership, the FBI investigated tens of thousands of suspected subversives and radicals. According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating that perceived threat. William G. Hundley, a Justice Department prosecutor, joked that Hoover&#x27;s investigations had actually helped the American communist movement survive, as Hoover&#x27;s &quot;informants were nearly the only ones that paid the party dues.&quot; Due to the FBI&#x27;s aggressive targeting, by 1957 CPUSA membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the FBI.

====Florida and Long Island U-boat landings====

The FBI investigated rings of German saboteurs and spies starting in the late 1930s and had primary responsibility for counterespionage. The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938 and continued throughout World War II. In the Quirin affair, during World War II, German U-boats set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in Florida and on Long Island to cause acts of sabotage within the country. The two teams were apprehended after one of the agents contacted the FBI and told them everything – he was also charged and convicted.

====Illegal wiretapping====
During this time period President Franklin D. Roosevelt, out of concern over Nazi agents in the United States, gave &quot;qualified permission&quot; to wiretap persons &quot;suspected ... [of] subversive activities&quot;. He went on to add, in 1941, that the United States Attorney General had to be informed of its use in each case.

Attorney General Robert H. Jackson left it to Hoover to decide how and when to use wiretaps, as he found the &quot;whole business&quot; distasteful. Jackson&#x27;s successor at the post of Attorney General, Francis Biddle, did turn down Hoover&#x27;s requests on occasion.

====Concealed espionage discoveries====
In the late 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave Hoover the task to investigate both foreign espionage in the United States and the activities of domestic communists and fascists. When the Cold War began in the late 1940s, the FBI under Hoover undertook the intensive surveillance of communists and other left-wing activists in the United States.

The FBI also participated in the Venona project, a pre-World War II joint project with the British to eavesdrop on Soviet spies in the UK and the United States. They did not initially realize that espionage was being committed, but the Soviets&#x27; multiple use of one-time pad ciphers (which with single use are unbreakable) created redundancies that allowed some intercepts to be decoded. These established that espionage was being carried out.

Hoover kept the intercepts – America&#x27;s greatest counterintelligence secret – in a locked safe in his office. He chose not to inform President Truman, Attorney General J. Howard McGrath, or Secretaries of State Dean Acheson and General George Marshall while they held office. He informed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the Venona Project in 1952.

====Plans for expanding the FBI to do global intelligence====
After World War II, Hoover advanced plans to create a &quot;World-Wide Intelligence Service&quot;. These plans were shot down by the Truman administration. Truman objected to the plan, emerging bureaucratic competitors opposed the centralization of power inherent in the plans, and there was a considerable aversion to creating an American version of the &quot;Gestapo&quot;.

====Plans for suspending &quot;habeas corpus&quot;====
In 1946, Attorney General Tom C. Clark authorized Hoover to compile a list of potentially disloyal Americans who might be detained during a wartime national emergency. In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean War, Hoover submitted a plan to President Truman to suspend the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty. Truman did not act on the plan.

====COINTELPRO and the 1950s====
In 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by U.S. Supreme Court decisions that limited the Justice Department&#x27;s ability to prosecute people for their political opinions, most notably communists. Some of his aides reported that he purposely exaggerated the threat of communism to &quot;ensure financial and public support for the FBI.&quot; At this time he formalized a covert &quot;dirty tricks&quot; program under the name COINTELPRO. COINTELPRO was first used to disrupt the Communist Party USA, where Hoover ordered observation and pursuit of targets that ranged from suspected citizen spies to larger celebrity figures, such as Charlie Chaplin, whom he saw as spreading Communist Party propaganda.

COINTELPRO&#x27;s methods included infiltration, burglaries, setting up illegal wiretaps, planting forged documents, and spreading false rumors about key members of target organizations. Some authors have charged that COINTELPRO methods also included inciting violence and arranging murders.

This program remained in place until it was exposed to the public in 1971, after the burglary by a group of eight activists of many internal documents from an office in Media, Pennsylvania, whereupon COINTELPRO became the cause of some of the harshest criticism of Hoover and the FBI. COINTELPRO&#x27;s activities were investigated in 1975 by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called the &quot;Church Committee&quot; after its chairman, Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho); the committee declared COINTELPRO&#x27;s activities were illegal and contrary to the Constitution.

Hoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on many powerful people, especially politicians. According to Laurence Silberman, appointed Deputy Attorney General in early 1974, FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley thought such files either did not exist or had been destroyed. After &quot;The Washington Post&quot; broke a story in January 1975, Kelley searched and found them in his outer office. The House Judiciary Committee then demanded that Silberman testify about them.

===Reaction to civil rights groups===

In 1956, several years before he targeted Martin Luther King Jr., Hoover had a public showdown with T. R. M. Howard, a civil rights leader from Mound Bayou, Mississippi. During a national speaking tour, Howard had criticized the FBI&#x27;s failure to investigate thoroughly the racially motivated murders of George W. Lee, Lamar Smith, and Emmett Till. Hoover wrote an open letter to the press singling out these statements as &quot;irresponsible.&quot;

In the 1960s, Hoover&#x27;s FBI monitored John Lennon, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali. The COINTELPRO tactics were later extended to organizations such as the Nation of Islam, the Black Panther Party, King&#x27;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and others. Hoover&#x27;s moves against people who maintained contacts with subversive elements, some of whom were members of the civil rights movement, also led to accusations of trying to undermine their reputations.

The treatment of Martin Luther King Jr. and actress Jean Seberg are two examples: Jacqueline Kennedy recalled that Hoover told President John F. Kennedy that King had tried to arrange a sex party while in the capital for the March on Washington and that Hoover told Robert F. Kennedy that King had made derogatory comments during the President&#x27;s funeral. Under Hoover&#x27;s leadership, the FBI sent an anonymous blackmail letter to King shortly before he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, indicating that &quot;There is only one thing left for you to do,&quot; which King interpreted as an exhortation for him to commit suicide. However, King&#x27;s interpretation of the letter has not been proven, with more portions of the letter being made public in 2014 which revealed that it also praised &quot;older leaders&quot; in the civil right movement such as Roy Wilkins and urged King to step aside and let other men lead the movement. The Church Committee, a U.S. Senate subcommittee led by U.S. Senator Frank Church which investigated numerous controversial FBI activities, found in 1976 that the FBI&#x27;s intent was to push King out of SCLC leadership.
King&#x27;s aide Andrew Young claimed in a 2013 interview with the Academy of Achievement that the main source of tension between the SCLC and FBI was the government agency&#x27;s lack of black agents, and that both parties were willing to co-operate with each other by the time the Selma to Montgomery marches had taken place.

In one 1965 incident, white civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo was murdered by Ku Klux Klansmen, who had given chase and fired shots into her car after noticing that her passenger was a young black man; one of the Klansmen was Gary Thomas Rowe, an acknowledged FBI informant. The FBI spread rumors that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African Americans involved in the civil rights movement. FBI records show that Hoover personally communicated these insinuations to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Nevertheless, three Klansmen would be convicted in a federal trial for Liuzzo&#x27;s murder in December 1965.

Hoover also personally ordered to cease the Federal inquiry into the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing by members of the Ku Klux Klan that killed four girls. By May 1965, local investigators and the FBI had identified suspects in the bombing and witnesses, and this information was relayed to Hoover. No prosecutions of the four suspects ensued, however, even though the evidence was reportedly &quot;so strong that even a white Alabama jury would convict&quot;. There had been a history of mistrust between local and federal investigators. 

Hoover wrote in a memo that the chances of a conviction were remote and told his agents not to share their results with federal or state prosecutors. In 1968, the FBI formally closed their investigation into the bombing without filing charges against any of their named suspects. The files were sealed by order of Hoover. Hoover in 1970 personally authorized &quot;black-bag&quot; jobs against the Weather Underground per testimony from William C. Sullivan.

===Late career and death===
One of his biographers, Kenneth Ackerman, wrote that the allegation that Hoover&#x27;s secret files kept presidents from firing him &quot;is a myth.&quot; However, Richard Nixon was recorded in 1971 as stating that one of the reasons he would not fire Hoover was that he was afraid of Hoover&#x27;s reprisals against him. Similarly, Presidents Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy considered dismissing Hoover as FBI Director, but ultimately concluded that the political cost of doing so would be too great. In 1964, Hoover&#x27;s FBI investigated Jack Valenti, a special assistant and confidant of President Lyndon Johnson, married to Johnson&#x27;s personal secretary, but who allegedly maintained a gay relationship with a commercial photographer friend.

Hoover personally directed the FBI investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson waived the then mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of 70, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director &quot;for an indefinite period of time&quot;. The House Select Committee on Assassinations issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies. The report criticized the FBI&#x27;s (Hoover&#x27;s) reluctance to investigate thoroughly the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.

When Nixon took office in January 1969, Hoover had just turned 74. There was a growing sentiment in Washington, D.C., that the aging FBI chief should retire, but Hoover&#x27;s power and friends in Congress remained too strong for him to be forced to do so. Hoover remained director of the FBI until he died of a heart attack in his Washington home, on May 2, 1972, whereupon operational command of the Bureau was passed onto Associate Director Clyde Tolson. On May 3, 1972, Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray – a Justice Department official with no FBI experience – as acting director of the FBI, with W. Mark Felt becoming associate director.

Hoover&#x27;s body lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, where Chief Justice Warren Burger eulogized him. Up to that time, Hoover was the only civil servant to have lain in state, according to &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;. At the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that this was &quot;an honor accorded to only 21 persons before, of whom eight were Presidents or former Presidents.&quot; President Nixon delivered another eulogy at the funeral service in The National Presbyterian Church, and called Hoover &quot;one of the Giants, [whose] long life brimmed over with magnificent achievement and dedicated service to this country which he loved so well&quot;. Hoover was buried in the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., next to the graves of his parents and a sister who had died in infancy.

==Legacy==
=== FBI ===

Biographer Kenneth D. Ackerman summarizes Hoover&#x27;s legacy thus:
For better or worse, he built the FBI into a modern, national organization stressing professionalism and scientific crime-fighting. For most of his life, Americans considered him a hero. He made the G-Man brand so popular that, at its height, it was harder to become an FBI agent than to be accepted into an Ivy League college. 

Hoover worked to groom the image of the FBI in American media; he was a consultant to Warner Brothers for a theatrical film about the FBI, &quot;The FBI Story&quot; (1959), and in 1965 on Warner&#x27;s long-running spin-off television series, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; U.S. President Harry S. Truman said that Hoover transformed the FBI into his private secret police force:
... we want no Gestapo or secret police. The FBI is tending in that direction. They are dabbling in sex-life scandals and plain blackmail. J. Edgar Hoover would give his right eye to take over, and all congressmen and senators are afraid of him.

Because Hoover&#x27;s actions came to be seen as abuses of power, FBI directors are now limited to one 10-year term, subject to extension by the United States Senate. Jacob Heilbrunn, journalist and senior editor at &quot;The&quot; &quot;National Interest&quot;, gives a mixed assessment of Hoover&#x27;s legacy:

The FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. is named the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the controversial nature of Hoover&#x27;s legacy, both Republicans and Democrats have periodically introduced legislation in the House and Senate to rename it. The first such proposal came just two months after the building&#x27;s inauguration. On December 12, 1979, Gilbert Gude – a Republican congressman from Maryland – introduced H.R. 11137, which would have changed the name of the edifice from the &quot;J. Edgar Hoover F.B.I. Building&quot; to simply the &quot;F.B.I. Building&quot;. However, that bill never made it out of committee, nor did two subsequent attempts by Gude. Another notable attempt came in 1993 when Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum pushed for a name change following a new report about Hoover&#x27;s ordered &quot;loyalty investigation&quot; of future Senator Quentin Burdick. 

In 1998, Democratic Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover&#x27;s name from the building, stating that &quot;J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s name on the FBI building is a stain on the building.&quot; The Senate did not adopt the amendment. The building is &quot;aging&quot; and &quot;deteriorating&quot; and its naming might eventually be made moot by the FBI moving its headquarters to a new suburban site. Hoover&#x27;s practice of violating civil liberties for the stated sake of national security has been questioned in reference to recent national surveillance programs. An example is a lecture titled &quot;Civil Liberties and National Security: Did Hoover Get it Right?&quot;, given at The Institute of World Politics on April 21, 2015.

Some qualified praise for Hoover came from the Soviet double agent Kim Philby, who spent time in Washington. Philby respected the way Hoover had built the FBI as a serious intelligence agency from virtually nothing, but Joseph McCarthy was a fake; and Hoover knew that McCarthy was a fake, but found it useful to manipulate McCarthy.

=== White Christian nationalism ===
Through his 2023 book &quot;The Gospel of J. Edgar Hoover&quot;, Lerone Martin argues that an understated but long-lasting influence of Hoover has been to normalize &quot;white Christian nationalism&quot; in the country, Hoover framing his work with the FBI as a crusade modelled after Catholic orders such as the Jesuits, despite himself being Protestant, favoring religiosity among FBI members (including &quot;spiritual retreats&quot;) as well weaponizing traditional Christian rhetoric against what he perceived to be the atheist and Communist menace to the United States, for him founded on Christian principles. Martin also says that such social conservatism was not only religious but also racial in nature, as Hoover aimed to maintain the ethnic dynamics of his days, including the legal superiority of the White Americans over the minorities.

==Private life==
===Pets===
Hoover received his first dog from his parents when he was a child, after which he was never without one. He owned many throughout his lifetime and became an aficionado especially knowledgeable in breeding of pedigrees, particularly Cairn Terriers and Beagles. He gave many dogs to notable people, such as Presidents Herbert Hoover (not closely related) and Lyndon B. Johnson, and buried seven canine pets, including a Cairn Terrier named Spee De Bozo, at Aspen Hill Memorial Park, in Silver Spring, Maryland.

===Sexuality===

Rumors began circulating in the 1940s that Hoover was homosexual. The historians John Stuart Cox and Athan G. Theoharis speculated that Clyde Tolson, who became an assistant director to Hoover in his mid 40s and became his primary heir, had a sexual relationship with Hoover until the latter&#x27;s death. Hoover reportedly hunted down and threatened anyone who made insinuations about his sexuality. Truman Capote, who enjoyed repeating rumors about Hoover, once remarked that he was more interested in making Hoover angry than determining whether the rumors were true. On May 2, 1969, &quot;Screw&quot; published the first reference in print to Hoover&#x27;s sexuality, titled &quot;Is J. Edgar Hoover a Fag?&quot;

Some associates and scholars dismiss rumors about Hoover&#x27;s sexuality, and rumors about his relationship with Tolson in particular, as unlikely, while others have described them as probable or even &quot;confirmed&quot;. Still other scholars have reported the rumors without expressing an opinion. Cox and Theoharis concluded that &quot;the strange likelihood is that Hoover never knew sexual desire at all.&quot; Anthony Summers, who wrote &quot;Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; (1993), stated that there was no ambiguity about the FBI director&#x27;s sexual proclivities and described him as &quot;bisexual with failed heterosexuality.&quot;

====Hoover and Tolson====

Hoover described Tolson as his alter ego: the men worked closely together during the day and, both single, frequently took meals, went to night clubs, and vacationed together. This closeness between the two men is often cited as evidence that they were lovers. Some FBI employees who knew them, such as Mark Felt, say the relationship was &quot;brotherly&quot;; however, former FBI executive assistant director Mike Mason suggested that some of Hoover&#x27;s colleagues denied that he had a sexual relationship with Tolson in an effort to protect Hoover&#x27;s image.

The novelist William Styron told Summers that he once saw Hoover and Tolson in a California beach house, where the director was painting his friend&#x27;s toenails. Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society, one of the first gay rights organizations, said Hoover and Tolson sat in boxes owned by and used exclusively by gay men at the Del Mar racetrack in California. Hoover bequeathed his estate to Tolson, who moved into Hoover&#x27;s house after Hoover died. Tolson accepted the American flag that draped Hoover&#x27;s casket. Tolson is buried a few yards away from Hoover in the Congressional Cemetery. Mob leader Meyer Lansky is credited with having &quot;controlled&quot; compromising pictures of a sexual nature featuring Hoover with Tolson. In his book, &quot;Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover&quot;, biographer Anthony Summers cites multiple primary sources regarding Lansky&#x27;s use of blackmail to gain influence with politicians, policemen and judges. One stage for Lansky&#x27;s acquisition of blackmail materials was orgies held by late attorney and Hoover protégé, Roy Cohn, and liquor magnate, Lewis Rosenstiel, who had lasting ties with the Mafia from his bootleg operations during Prohibition.

====Other romantic allegations====
One of Hoover&#x27;s biographers, Richard Hack, does not believe the director was gay. Hack notes that Hoover was romantically linked to actress Dorothy Lamour in the late 1930s and early 1940s and that after Hoover&#x27;s death, Lamour did not deny rumors that she had had an affair with him. Hack further reported that, during the 1940s and 1950s, Hoover attended social events with Lela Rogers, the divorced mother of dancer and actress Ginger Rogers, so often that many of their mutual friends assumed the pair would eventually marry.

====Pornography for blackmail====
Hoover kept a large collection of pornographic films, photographs, and written materials, with particular emphasis on nude photos of celebrities. He reportedly used these for his own titillation and held them for blackmail purposes.

====Cross-dressing story====
Lewis Rosenstiel, founder of Schenley Industries, was a close friend of Hoover&#x27;s and the primary contributor to the J. Edgar Hoover Foundation. In his biography &quot;Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover&quot; (1993), journalist Anthony Summers quoted Rosenstiel&#x27;s fourth wife, Susan, as claiming to have seen Hoover engaging in cross-dressing in the 1950s at all-male parties at the Plaza Hotel with Rosenstiel, attorney Roy Cohn, and young male prostitutes. Another Hoover biographer, Burton Hersh, later corroborated this story. Summers alleged the Mafia had blackmail material on Hoover, which made Hoover reluctant to pursue organized crime. According to Summers, organized crime figures Meyer Lansky and Frank Costello obtained photos of Hoover having sex with Tolson and used them to ensure that the FBI did not target their illegal activities. Additionally, Summers claimed that Hoover was friends with Billy Byars Jr., an alleged child pornographer and producer of the film &quot;The Genesis Children&quot;.

Fashion expert Tim Gunn relayed a story on the radio news quiz show &quot;Wait Wait...Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;. Gunn&#x27;s father was Hoover&#x27;s speech writer and as a child Tim Gunn and his sister were on a tour of the FBI offices when their father asked them if they would like to meet Vivian Vance. They had a pleasant meeting with a woman in Hoover&#x27;s office. Reflecting on this later as adults the Gunn children realized that Hoover was not present in the office and deemed this highly unusual. Later when Gunn included this visit in his &quot;Gunn&#x27;s Golden Rules&quot; book the Simon and Schuster legal team attempted to corroborate the story of Vivian Vance visiting the FBI offices. Her biographers could not confirm this and a search of the FBI visitor logs did not show Vance had visited. Gunn&#x27;s conclusion was that Hoover was impersonating Vance the day of his visit.

Another Hoover biographer who heard the rumors of homosexuality and blackmail, said he was unable to corroborate them, though it has been acknowledged that Lansky and other organized crime figures had frequently been allowed to visit the Del Charro Hotel in La Jolla, California, which was owned by Hoover&#x27;s friend, and staunch Lyndon Johnson supporter, Clint Murchison Sr. Hoover and Tolson also frequently visited the Del Charro Hotel. Summers quoted a source named Charles Krebs as saying, &quot;on three occasions that I knew about, maybe four, boys were driven down to La Jolla at Hoover&#x27;s request.&quot;

Skeptics of the cross-dressing story point to Susan Rosenstiel&#x27;s lack of credibility (she pleaded guilty to attempted perjury in a 1971 case and later served time in a New York City jail). Recklessly indiscreet behavior by Hoover would have been totally out of character, whatever his sexuality. Most biographers consider the story of Mafia blackmail unlikely in light of the FBI&#x27;s investigations of the Mafia.
Although never corroborated, the allegation of cross-dressing has been widely repeated. In the words of author Thomas Doherty, &quot;For American popular culture, the image of the zaftig FBI director as a Christine Jorgensen wanna-be was too delicious not to savor.&quot; Biographer Kenneth Ackerman says that Summers&#x27; accusations have been &quot;widely debunked by historians&quot;. The journalist Liz Smith wrote that Cohn told her about Hoover&#x27;s rumored transvestism &quot;long before it became common gossip.&quot;

====Lavender Scare====

The attorney Roy Cohn served as general counsel on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations during Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s tenure as chairman and assisted Hoover during the 1950s investigations of Communists and was generally known to be a closeted homosexual. According to Richard Hack, Cohn&#x27;s opinion was that Hoover was too frightened of his own sexuality to have anything approaching a normal sexual or romantic relationship. Some of Cohn&#x27;s former clients, including Bill Bonanno, son of crime boss Joseph Bonanno, also cite photographs of Hoover in drag allegedly possessed by Cohn.

During the Lavender scare, Cohn and McCarthy further enhanced anti-Communist fervor by suggesting that Communists overseas had convinced several closeted homosexuals within the U.S. government to leak important government information in exchange for the assurance that their sexual identity would remain a secret. A federal investigation that followed convinced President Dwight D. Eisenhower to sign Executive Order 10450 on April 29, 1953, that barred homosexuals from obtaining jobs at the federal level.

In his 2004 study of the event, historian David K. Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover&#x27;s homosexuality as relying on &quot;the kind of tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected: guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip.&quot; He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose &quot;description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy.&quot; He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.

====Supportive friends====
Some people associated with Hoover have supported the rumors about his homosexuality. According to Anthony Summers, Hoover often frequented New York City&#x27;s Stork Club. Luisa Stuart, a model who was 18 or 19 at the time, told Summers that she had seen Hoover holding hands with Tolson as they all rode in a limo uptown to the Cotton Club in 1936.

Actress and singer Ethel Merman was a friend of Hoover&#x27;s since 1938, and familiar with all parties during his alleged romance of Lela Rogers. In a 1978 interview and in response to Anita Bryant&#x27;s anti-gay campaign, she said: &quot;Some of my best friends are homosexual: Everybody knew about J. Edgar Hoover, but he was the best chief the FBI ever had.&quot;

=== Alleged African-American Ancestry ===
Since the release of the 2011 film &quot;J. Edgar&quot;, Hoover’s genealogy has become a topic of interest.  There are theories that Hoover had African American heritage, which have been investigated and yet unsubstantiated.  

Also, there are family stories and genealogies recorded by writer Millie McGhee in her 2000 book &quot;&quot;Secrets Uncovered: J. Edgar Hoover — Passing for White&quot;?&quot;, where she and Hoover are said to have a common ancestor.  Nevertheless, their relatedness remains unproven.

==Written works==
J. Edgar Hoover was the nominal author of a number of books and articles, although it is widely believed that all of these were ghostwritten by FBI employees. Hoover received the credit and royalties.

<text>James Grover Thurber (December 8, 1894 – November 2, 1961) was an American cartoonist, writer, humorist, journalist, and playwright. He was best known for his cartoons and short stories, published mainly in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and collected in his numerous books.

Thurber was one of the most popular humorists of his time and celebrated the comic frustrations and eccentricities of ordinary people. His works have frequently been adapted into films, including &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1942), &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot; (1959, based on Thurber&#x27;s &quot;The Catbird Seat&quot;), and &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (adapted twice, in 1947 and in 2013).

==Life==
Thurber was born in Columbus, Ohio, to Charles L. Thurber and Mary Agnes &quot;Mame&quot; (née Fisher) Thurber on December 8, 1894. Both of his parents greatly influenced his work. His father was a sporadically employed clerk and minor politician who dreamed of being a lawyer or an actor. Thurber described his mother as a &quot;born comedian&quot; and &quot;one of the finest comic talents I think I have ever known&quot;. She was a practical joker and on one occasion pretended to be disabled, and attended a faith healer revival only to jump up and proclaim herself healed.

Due to overcrowding in his grandfather&#x27;s house, where his family had moved while his father recovered from an illness, Thurber often stayed at the home of his aunt, Margery Albright. Albright lived in Downtown Columbus near Holy Cross Church, the clock and bell of which Thurber would reference in later writing.

When Thurber was seven years old, he and one of his brothers were playing a game of William Tell, when his brother shot James in the eye with an arrow. He lost that eye, and the injury later caused him to become almost entirely blind. He was unable to participate in sports and other activities in his childhood because of this injury, but he developed a creative mind, which he used to express himself in writings. Neurologist V. S. Ramachandran suggests that Thurber&#x27;s imagination may be partly explained by Charles Bonnet syndrome, a neurological condition that causes complex visual hallucinations in people who have had some level of visual loss. (This was the basis for the piece &quot;The Admiral on the Wheel&quot;.)


From 1913 to 1918, Thurber attended Ohio State University where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and editor of the student magazine, the &quot;Sundial&quot;. It was during this time that he rented the house on 77 Jefferson Avenue,&lt;ref name=&quot;csmonitor/life-James-Thurber&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which became Thurber House in 1984. He never graduated from the university because his poor eyesight prevented him from taking a mandatory Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) course. In 1995 he was posthumously awarded a degree.

From 1918 to 1920, Thurber worked as a code clerk for the United States Department of State, first in Washington, D.C., and then at the embassy in Paris. On returning to Columbus, he began his career as a reporter for &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; from 1921 to 1924. During part of this time, he reviewed books, films, and plays in a weekly column called &quot;Credos and Curios&quot;, a title that was given to a posthumous collection of his work. Thurber returned to Paris during this period, where he wrote for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and other newspapers.

===Move to New York===
In 1925, Thurber moved to Greenwich Village in New York City, obtaining a job as a reporter with the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. He joined the staff of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1927 as an editor, with the help of E. B. White, his friend and fellow &quot;New Yorker&quot; contributor. His career as a cartoonist began in 1930 after White found some of Thurber&#x27;s drawings in a trash can and submitted them for publication; White inked-in some of these earlier drawings to make them reproduce better for the magazine, and years later expressed deep regret he had done such a thing. Thurber contributed both his writings and his drawings to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; until the 1950s.

===Marriage and family===
Thurber married Althea Adams in 1922, although the marriage, as he later wrote to a friend, devolved into &quot;a relationship charming, fine, and hurting&quot;. They lived in the Sanford–Curtis–Thurber House, in Fairfield County, Connecticut, with their daughter Rosemary&lt;ref name=&quot;lithub/grandfathers-book&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (b. 1931).&lt;ref name=&quot;connecticutcreativeplaces/sanford-curtis-thurber&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newstimes/11055925&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended in divorce in May 1935, and Althea kept&lt;ref name=&quot;ctpost/11055925&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sanford–Curtis–Thurber House. He married his editor, Helen Muriel Wismer (1902–1986) in June 1935. After meeting Mark Van Doren on a ferry to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Thurber began summering in Cornwall, Connecticut, along with many other prominent artists and authors of the time. After three years of renting, Thurber found a home, which he referred to as &quot;The Great Good Place&quot;, in Cornwall, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=&quot;connecticutcreativeplaces/Great Good Place&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Thurber&#x27;s behavior became erratic in his last year. Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4, 1961, and underwent emergency surgery, drifting in and out of consciousness. Although the operation was initially successful, Thurber died a few weeks later, on November 2, aged 66, due to complications from pneumonia. The doctors said his brain was senescent from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries. His last words, aside from the repeated word &quot;God&quot;, were &quot;God bless... God damn&quot;, according to his wife, Helen.

==Legacy and honors==
* Established in 1997, the annual Thurber Prize honors outstanding examples of American humor.
* In 2008, the Library of America selected Thurber&#x27;s story, &quot;A Sort of Genius&quot;, first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.
* Two of his residences have been listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places: his childhood Thurber House in Ohio and the Sanford–Curtis–Thurber House in Fairfield County, Connecticut.

==Career==
Thurber also became well known for his simple, outlandish drawings and cartoons. Both his literary and his drawing skills were helped along by the support of, and collaboration with, fellow &quot;New Yorker&quot; staff member E. B. White, who insisted that Thurber&#x27;s sketches could stand on their own as artistic expressions. Thurber drew six covers and numerous classic illustrations for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

===Writer===
Many of Thurber&#x27;s short stories are humorous fictional memoirs from his life, but he also wrote darker material, such as &quot;The Whip-Poor-Will&quot;, a story of madness and murder. His best-known short stories are &quot;The Dog That Bit People&quot; and &quot;The Night the Bed Fell&quot;; they can be found in &quot;My Life and Hard Times&quot;, which was his &quot;break-out&quot; book. Among his other classics are &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, &quot;The Catbird Seat&quot;, &quot;The Night the Ghost Got In&quot;, &quot;A Couple of Hamburgers&quot;, &quot;The Greatest Man in the World&quot;, and &quot;If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox&quot;. &quot;The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze&quot; has several short stories with a tense undercurrent of marital discord. The book was published the year of his divorce and remarriage.

Although his 1941 story &quot;You Could Look It Up&quot;, about a three-foot adult being brought in to take a walk in a baseball game, has been said to have inspired Bill Veeck&#x27;s stunt with Eddie Gaedel with the St. Louis Browns in 1951, Veeck claimed an older provenance for the stunt.

In addition to his other fiction, Thurber wrote more than seventy-five fables, some of which were first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (1939), then collected in &quot;Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated&quot; (1940) and &quot;Further Fables for Our Time&quot; (1956). These were short stories that featured anthropomorphic animals (e.g. &quot;The Little Girl and the Wolf&quot;, his version of Little Red Riding Hood) as main characters, and ended with a moral as a tagline. An exception to this format was his most famous fable, &quot;The Unicorn in the Garden&quot;, which featured an all-human cast except for the unicorn, which does not speak. Thurber&#x27;s fables were satirical, and the morals served as punch lines as well as advice to the reader, demonstrating &quot;the complexity of life by depicting the world as an uncertain, precarious place, where few reliable guidelines exist.&quot; His stories also included several book-length fairy tales, such as &quot;The White Deer&quot; (1945), &quot;The 13 Clocks&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Wonderful O&quot; (1957). The latter two were among several of Thurber&#x27;s works illustrated by Marc Simont. 

Thurber&#x27;s prose for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other venues included numerous humorous essays. A favorite subject, especially toward the end of his life, was the English language. Pieces on this subject included &quot;The Spreading &#x27;You Know&#x27;,&quot; which decried the overuse of that pair of words in conversation, &quot;The New Vocabularianism&quot;, and &quot;What Do You Mean It &quot;Was&quot; Brillig?&quot;. His short pieces – whether stories, essays or something in between – were referred to as &quot;casuals&quot; by Thurber and the staff of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Thurber wrote a five-part &quot;New Yorker&quot; series, between 1947 and 1948, examining in depth the radio soap opera phenomenon, based on near-constant listening and researching over the same period. Leaving nearly no element of these programs unexamined, including their writers, producers, sponsors, performers, and listeners alike, Thurber republished the series in his anthology, &quot;The Beast in Me and Other Animals&quot; (1948), under the section title &quot;Soapland.&quot; The series was one of the first to examine such a pop-culture phenomenon in depth.

The last twenty years of Thurber&#x27;s life were filled with material and professional success in spite of his blindness. He published at least fourteen books in that era, including &quot;The Thurber Carnival&quot; (1945), &quot;Thurber Country&quot; (1953), and the extremely popular book about &quot;New Yorker&quot; founder/editor Harold Ross, &quot;The Years with Ross&quot; (1959). A number of Thurber&#x27;s short stories were made into movies, including &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; in 1947.

===Cartoonist===
While Thurber drew his cartoons in the usual fashion in the 1920s and 1930s, his failing eyesight later required changes. He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon (or on black paper using white chalk, from which they were photographed and the colors reversed for publication). Regardless of method, his cartoons became as noted as his writings; they possessed an eerie, wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life. He once wrote that people said it looked like he drew them under water. Dorothy Parker, a contemporary and friend of Thurber, referred to his cartoons as having the &quot;semblance of unbaked cookies&quot;. The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on black paper, which was featured as the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on July 9, 1951. The same drawing was used for the dust jacket of &quot;The Thurber Album&quot; (1952).

===Adaptations===
* Thurber teamed with college schoolmate (and actor/director) Elliott Nugent to write &quot;The Male Animal&quot;, a comic drama that became a major Broadway hit in 1939. The play was adapted as a film by the same name in 1942, starring Henry Fonda, Olivia de Havilland and Jack Carson.
* In 1947 his short story &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, was loosely adapted as a film by the same name. Danny Kaye played the title character.
* In 1951 United Productions of America announced an animated feature to be based on Thurber&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Men, Women and Dogs&quot;. The only part of the ambitious project that was eventually released was the UPA cartoon &quot;The Unicorn in the Garden&quot; (1953).
* In 1958, Thurber&#x27;s short story &quot;One Is a Wanderer&quot; was adapted for General Electric Theatre, resulting in Emmy nominations for writer Samuel Taylor and director Herschel Daugherty.
* The 1959 film &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot; was based on Thurber&#x27;s 1942 short story &quot;The Catbird Seat&quot;.
* In 1960, Thurber fulfilled a long-standing desire to be on the professional stage and played himself in 88 performances of the revue &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot; (which echoes the title of his 1945 book, &quot;The Thurber Carnival&quot;). It was based on a selection of Thurber&#x27;s stories and cartoon captions. Thurber appeared in the sketch &quot;File and Forget&quot;. The sketch consists of Thurber dictating a series of letters in a vain attempt to keep one of his publishers from sending him books he did not order, and the escalating confusion of the replies. Thurber received a Special Tony Award for the adapted script of the &quot;Carnival&quot;.
* In 1961, &quot;The Secret Life of James Thurber&quot; aired on &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;. Adolphe Menjou appeared in the program as Fitch, and Orson Bean and Sue Randall portrayed John and Ellen Monroe.
* In 1969–70, a full series based on Thurber&#x27;s writings and life, titled &quot;My World... and Welcome to It,&quot; was broadcast on NBC. It starred William Windom as the Thurber figure, John Monroe. Featuring animated portions in addition to live actors, the show won a 1970 Emmy Award as the year&#x27;s best comedy series. Windom won an Emmy as well. He went on to perform Thurber material in a one-man stage show.
* In 1972 another film adaptation, &quot;The War Between Men and Women&quot;, starring Jack Lemmon, concludes with an animated version of Thurber&#x27;s classic anti-war work &quot;The Last Flower&quot;.
* In 2013, a new adaptation of &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; was produced, starring Ben Stiller as the title character.

==In popular culture==
* In Season Nine, Episode 13 of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, titled “The Cartoon”, Elaine mentions learning of gossip about Thurber while interviewing for a job at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.
* Beginning during his own father&#x27;s terminal illness, television broadcaster Keith Olbermann read excerpts from Thurber&#x27;s short stories during the closing segment of his MSNBC program &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; on Fridays, which he called &quot;Fridays with Thurber&quot;. He reintroduced this during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, reading Thurber stories daily at 8:00 p.m. EDT on Twitter, and continued on his podcast, also called &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;.
* On an episode of Norm Macdonald&#x27;s video podcast, &quot;Norm Macdonald Live&quot;, Norm tells a story in which comedian Larry Miller acknowledges that his biggest influence in comedy was Thurber.
* In 2021 film &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; by Wes Anderson, he was mentioned in the end title credits as inspiration.

<text>James Francis Cagney Jr. (; July 17, 1899March 30, 1986) was an American actor and dancer. On stage and in film, he was known for his consistently energetic performances, distinctive vocal style, and deadpan comic timing. He won acclaim and major awards for a wide variety of performances.

Cagney is remembered for playing multifaceted tough guys in films such as &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931), &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1932), &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938), &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; (1939), &quot;City for Conquest&quot; (1940) and &quot;White Heat&quot; (1949), finding himself typecast or limited by this reputation earlier in his career. He was able to negotiate dancing opportunities in his films and ended up winning the Academy Award for his role in the musical &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942). In 1999 the American Film Institute ranked him eighth on its list of greatest male stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Orson Welles described him as &quot;maybe the greatest actor who ever appeared in front of a camera&quot;.

In his first professional acting performance in 1919, Cagney was costumed as a woman when he danced in the chorus line of the revue &quot;Every Sailor&quot;. He spent several years in vaudeville as a dancer and comedian, until he got his first major acting part in 1925. He secured several other roles, receiving good notices, before landing the lead in the 1929 play &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. Al Jolson saw him in the play and bought the movie rights, before selling them to Warner Bros. with the proviso that James Cagney and Joan Blondell be able to reprise their stage roles in the movie. After rave reviews, Warner Bros. signed him for an initial $400-a-week, three-week contract; when the executives at the studio saw the first dailies for the film, Cagney&#x27;s contract was immediately extended.

Cagney&#x27;s fifth film, &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, became one of the most influential gangster movies of the period. Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney pushes half a grapefruit against Mae Clarke&#x27;s face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He became one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading stars and one of Warner Bros.&#x27; biggest contracts at the time. In 1938 he received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan in &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;. In 1942 Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; with Doris Day. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961. He came out of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.

Cagney walked out on Warner Bros. twice over the course of his career, each time returning on much improved personal and artistic terms. In 1935 he sued Warner for breach of contract and signed with Edward L. Alperson&#x27;s independent company Grand National Pictures. In 1942 he established his own production company, Cagney Productions, before returning to Warner seven years later. In reference to Cagney&#x27;s refusal to be pushed around, Jack L. Warner called him &quot;the Professional Againster&quot;. Cagney also made numerous USO troop tours before and during World War II and served as president of the Screen Actors Guild for two years.

==Early life==
James Francis &quot;Jimmy&quot; Cagney Jr. was born in 1899 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City. His biographers disagree as to the actual location: either on the corner of Avenue D and 8th Street, or in a top-floor apartment at 391 East 8th Street, the address that is on his birth certificate. His father, James Francis Cagney Sr. (1875–1918), was of Irish descent. At the time of his son&#x27;s birth, he was a bartender and amateur boxer, although on Cagney&#x27;s birth certificate, he is listed as a telegraphist. His mother was Carolyn Elizabeth (née Nelson; 1877–1945); her father was a Norwegian ship&#x27;s captain, and her mother was Irish.

Cagney was the second of seven children, two of whom died within months of their births. He was sickly as an infant—so much so that his mother feared he would die before he could be baptized. He later attributed his sickly health to the poverty his family endured. The family moved twice while he was still young, first to East 79th Street, and then to East 96th Street. He was confirmed at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan; his funeral service would eventually be held in the same church.

The red-haired, blue-eyed Cagney graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City in 1918, and attended Columbia College, where he intended to major in Art. He also took German and joined the Student Army Training Corps, but he dropped out after one semester, returning home upon the death of his father during the 1918 flu pandemic.

Cagney held a variety of jobs early in his life: junior architect, copy boy for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, book custodian at the New York Public Library, bellhop, draughtsman, and night doorkeeper. He gave all his earnings to his family. While Cagney was working for the New York Public Library, he met Florence James, who helped him into an acting career. Cagney believed in hard work, later stating, &quot;It was good for me. I feel sorry for the kid who has too cushy a time of it. Suddenly he has to come face-to-face with the realities of life without any mama or papa to do his thinking for him.&quot;

He started tap dance as a boy (a skill that eventually contributed to his Academy Award) and was nicknamed &quot;Cellar-Door Cagney&quot; after his habit of dancing on slanted cellar doors. He was a good street fighter, defending his older brother Harry, a medical student, when necessary. He engaged in amateur boxing, and was a runner-up for the New York state lightweight title. His coaches encouraged him to turn professional, but his mother would not allow it. He also played semi-professional baseball for a local team, and entertained dreams of playing in the Major Leagues.

His introduction to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt who lived in Brooklyn, opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House (one of the first settlement houses in the nation) where his brother Harry performed and Florence James directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake.

==Career==
===1919–1930: Early career===
In 1919, while Cagney was working at Wanamaker&#x27;s Department Store, a colleague saw him dance and informed him about a role in the upcoming production, &quot;Every Sailor&quot;. It was a wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women that was originally titled &quot;Ever Sailor&quot;. Cagney auditioned for the chorus, although considering it a waste of time, as he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers&#x27; moves and added them to his repertoire while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own naturally shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: &quot;For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles.&quot;

Had Cagney&#x27;s mother had her way, his stage career would have ended when he quit &quot;Every Sailor&quot; after two months; proud as she was of his performance, she preferred that he get an education. Cagney appreciated the $35 a week he was paid, which he later remembered as &quot;a mountain of money for me in those worrisome days.&quot; In deference to his mother&#x27;s concerns, he got a job as a brokerage house runner. This did not stop him from looking for more stage work, however, and he went on to audition successfully for a chorus part in the William B. Friedlander musical &quot;Pitter Patter&quot;, for which he earned $55 a week. (He sent $40 to his mother each week.) So strong was his habit of holding down more than one job at a time, that he also worked as a dresser for one of the leads, portered the casts&#x27; luggage, and understudied for the lead. Among the chorus line performers was 20-year-old Frances Willard &quot;Billie&quot; Vernon; they married in 1922.

The show began Cagney&#x27;s 10-year association with vaudeville and Broadway. The Cagneys were among the early residents of Free Acres, a social experiment established by Bolton Hall in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.

&quot;Pitter Patter&quot; was not hugely successful, but it did well enough to run for 32 weeks, making it possible for Cagney to join the vaudeville circuit. He and Vernon toured separately with a number of different troupes, reuniting as &quot;Vernon and Nye&quot; to do simple comedy routines and musical numbers. &quot;Nye&quot; was a rearrangement of the last syllable of Cagney&#x27;s surname. One of the troupes Cagney joined was Parker, Rand, and Leach, taking over the spot vacated when Archie Leach—who later changed his name to Cary Grant—left.

In 1924, after years of touring and struggling to make money, Cagney and Vernon moved to Hawthorne, California, partly for Cagney to meet his new mother-in-law, who had just moved there from Chicago, and partly to investigate breaking into the movies. Their train fares were paid for by a friend, the press officer of &quot;Pitter Patter&quot;, who was also desperate to act. They were not successful at first; the dance studio Cagney set up had few clients and folded; Vernon and he toured the studios, but there was no interest. Eventually, they borrowed some money and headed back to New York via Chicago and Milwaukee, enduring failure along the way when they attempted to make money on the stage.
Cagney secured his first significant nondancing role in 1925. He played a young tough guy in the three-act play &quot;Outside Looking In&quot; by Maxwell Anderson, earning $200 a week. As with &quot;Pitter Patter&quot;, Cagney went to the audition with little confidence he would get the part. At this point, he had had no experience with drama. Cagney felt that he only got the role because his hair was redder than that of Alan Bunce, the only other red-headed performer in New York. Both the play and Cagney received good reviews; &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Mr. Cagney, in a less spectacular role [than his co-star] makes a few minutes silence during his mock-trial scene something that many a more established actor might watch with profit.&quot; Burns Mantle wrote that it &quot;...contained the most honest acting now to be seen in New York.&quot;

Following the four-month run of &quot;Outside Looking In&quot;, the Cagneys were financially secure enough for Cagney to return to vaudeville over the next few years, achieving various success. During this period, he met George M. Cohan, whom he later portrayed in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, though they never spoke.

Cagney secured the lead role in the 1926–27 season West End production of &quot;Broadway&quot; by George Abbott. The show&#x27;s management insisted that he copy Broadway lead Lee Tracy&#x27;s performance, despite Cagney&#x27;s discomfort in doing so, but the day before the show sailed for England, they decided to replace him. This was a devastating turn of events for Cagney apart from the logistical difficulties this presented - the couple&#x27;s luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment. He almost quit show business. As Vernon recalled, &quot;Jimmy said that it was all over. He made up his mind that he would get a job doing something else.&quot;

The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, which lasted as long as the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, providing them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, and then landed a part in the play &quot;Women Go On Forever&quot;, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.

Cagney had built a reputation as an innovative teacher; when he was cast as the lead in &quot;Grand Street Follies of 1928&quot;, he was also appointed choreographer. The show received rave reviews and was followed by &quot;Grand Street Follies of 1929&quot;. These roles led to a part in George Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Maggie the Magnificent&quot;, a play the critics disliked, though they liked Cagney&#x27;s performance. Cagney saw this role (and &quot;Women Go on Forever&quot;) as significant because of the talented directors he met. He learned &quot;...what a director was for and what a director could do. They were directors who could play all the parts in the play better than the actors cast for them.&quot;

===1930–1935: Warner Bros.===

====&quot;Sinners&#x27; Holiday&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Doorway to Hell&quot; (1930)====
Playing opposite Cagney in &quot;Maggie the Magnificent&quot; was Joan Blondell, who starred again with him a few months later in Marie Baumer&#x27;s new play, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. While the critics panned &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled &quot;Sinners&#x27; Holiday&quot;, the film was released in 1930, starring Grant Withers and Evalyn Knapp. Joan Blondell recalled that when they were casting the film, studio head Jack Warner believed that she and Cagney had no future, and that Withers and Knapp were destined for stardom. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract with Warner Bros.

In the film, he portrayed Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic &quot;bad&quot; guy was to become a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of &quot;Sinners&#x27; Holiday&quot;, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his attitude toward the work. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: &quot;There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother&#x27;s breast... [The line] was &#x27;I&#x27;m your baby, ain&#x27;t I?&#x27; I refused to say it. Adolfi said &#x27;I&#x27;m going to tell Zanuck.&#x27; I said &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a shit what you tell him, I&#x27;m not going to say that line. They took the line out.

Despite this outburst, the studio liked him, and before his three-week contract was up—while the film was still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which was followed by a full seven-year contract at $400 a week. However, the contract allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively guaranteeing him only 40 weeks’ income at a time. As he did when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately played another colorful gangster supporting role in &quot;The Doorway to Hell&quot; (1930) starring Lew Ayres. The film was a financial hit, and helped to cement Cagney&#x27;s growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.

====&quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931)====

Warner Brothers&#x27; succession of gangster movie hits, in particular &quot;Little Caesar&quot; with Edward G. Robinson, culminated in the 1931 film &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;. Due to the strong reviews he had received in his short film career, Cagney was cast as nice-guy Matt Doyle, opposite Edward Woods as Tom Powers. However, after the initial rushes, the actors switched roles. Years later, Joan Blondell recalled that a few days into the filming, director William Wellman turned to Cagney and said &quot;Now you’re the lead, kid!&quot; &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s charisma was so outstanding&quot;, she added. The film cost only $151,000 to make, but it became one of the first low-budget films to gross $1 million.

Cagney received widespread praise for his performance. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; described his interpretation as &quot;...the most ruthless, unsentimental appraisal of the meanness of a petty killer the cinema has yet devised.&quot; He received top billing after the film, but while he acknowledged the importance of the role to his career, he always disputed the suggestion that it changed the way heroes and leading men were portrayed. He cited Clark Gable&#x27;s slapping of Barbara Stanwyck six months earlier (in &quot;Night Nurse&quot;) as more important. &quot;Night Nurse&quot; was actually released three months after &quot;The Public Enemy.&quot; Gable&#x27;s character punched Stanwyck&#x27;s, knocking the nurse unconscious.

Many critics view the scene in which Cagney pushes half a grapefruit into Mae Clarke&#x27;s face as one of the most famous moments in movie history. The scene itself was a late addition, and the origin of the idea is a matter of debate: producer Darryl Zanuck claimed he thought of it in a script conference, Wellman said the idea came to him when he saw the grapefruit on the table during the shoot, and writers Glasmon and Bright claimed it was based on the real life of gangster Hymie Weiss, who threw an omelette into his girlfriend&#x27;s face. Joan Blondell recalled that the change was made when Cagney decided the omelette wouldn&#x27;t work. Cagney himself usually cited the writers&#x27; version, but the fruit&#x27;s victim, Clarke, agreed that it was Wellman&#x27;s idea, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry I ever agreed to do the grapefruit bit. I never dreamed it would be shown in the movie. Director Bill Wellman thought of the idea suddenly. It wasn&#x27;t even written into the script.&quot; However, according to Turner Classic Movies (TCM), the grapefruit scene was a practical joke that Cagney and costar Mae Clarke decided to play on the crew while the cameras were rolling. Wellman liked it so much that he left it in. TCM also notes that the scene made Clarke&#x27;s ex-husband, Lew Brice, very happy. &quot;He saw the film repeatedly just to see that scene, and was often shushed by angry patrons when his delighted laughter got too loud.&quot;

Cagney&#x27;s stubbornness became well known behind the scenes, especially after he refused to join in a 100% participation-free charity drive pushed by Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Cagney did not object to donating money to charity, but he did object to being forced to give. Already he had acquired the nickname &quot;The Professional Againster&quot;.

====&quot;Smart Money&quot; (1931), &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot; (1931), and &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1932)====

Warner Bros. was quick to team its two rising gangster stars, Edward G. Robinson and Cagney, for the 1931 film &quot;Smart Money&quot;. Eager to follow the success of Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, the studio filmed &quot;Smart Money&quot; concurrently with &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;.

With the introduction of the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 that placed limits upon on-screen violence, Warner Bros. allowed Cagney a change of pace, casting him in the comedy &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot;, again opposite Blondell.

&quot;The Public Enemy&quot; was an enormous box-office success, and Cagney began to compare his pay with that of his peers, believing that his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. However, Warner Bros. refused to allow him a pay raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even those in which he did not appear, despite his opposition. Cagney returned to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.

While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had effectively become his agent, sought a substantial pay raise and more personal freedom for him. Following the success of &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; and &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot;, Warner Bros. offered Cagney a contract for $1,000 per week. Cagney&#x27;s first film upon returning from New York was &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1932), a critical success in which Cagney danced for the first time on screen. It also marked the last time that he permitted live ammunition to be shot at him, a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were rare and expensive. During filming for &quot;Taxi!&quot;, he was almost hit by gunfire. In the film&#x27;s opening scene, Cagney speaks fluent Yiddish, a language that he had learned during childhood in New York City.

&quot;Blonde Crazy&quot; and &quot;Taxi!&quot; contain lines that became the basis of many misquoted celebrity impersonations of Cagney. He never said &quot;Mmm, you dirty rat!&quot; on film; in &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot;, he says: &quot;That dirty, double-crossin&#x27; rat!&quot; and in &quot;Taxi!&quot;, he says: &quot;Come out and take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat, or I&#x27;ll give it to you through the door!&quot; The quote from &quot;Blonde Crazy&quot; was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2005 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.

The film was swiftly followed by &quot;The Crowd Roars&quot; and &quot;Winner Take All&quot;.

====Fighting with Warner Bros.====


Despite his success, Cagney remained dissatisfied with his contract. He wanted more money for his successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended him. Cagney announced that he would do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney&#x27;s salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.

Having learned about the block-booking studio system that virtually guaranteed the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, though he did not generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.

Cagney returned to the studio and made &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; (1933). This was followed by a steady stream of crowd-pleasing films, including the highly regarded &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley-choreographed routines. In 1934, &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; paired him with Pat O&#x27;Brien for the first of nine films together. The two would have an enduring friendship. Also in 1934, Cagney made his first of two raucous comedies with Bette Davis, &quot;Jimmy the Gent&quot;, for which he had himself heavily made up with thick eyebrows and procured an odd haircut for the period without the studio&#x27;s permission, shaved on the back and sides. Cagney initially had the make-up department put prominent scars on the back of his head for a close-up but the studio demanded that he remove them. Cagney&#x27;s and Davis&#x27;s fast-paced scenes together were particularly energetic.

In 1935 Cagney was listed as one of the Top Ten Moneymakers in Hollywood for the first time, and was cast more frequently in non-gangster roles; he played a lawyer who joins the FBI in &quot;G-Men&quot;, and he also took on his first, and only, Shakespearean role, as top-billed Nick Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; alongside Joe E. Brown as Francis Flute and Mickey Rooney as Puck.

Cagney&#x27;s last movie in 1935 was &quot;Ceiling Zero&quot;, his third film with Pat O&#x27;Brien. O&#x27;Brien received top billing, which was a clear breach of Cagney&#x27;s contract. This, combined with the fact that Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.

===1936–1937: Independent years===
Cagney spent most of the next year on his farm, and went back to work only when Edward L. Alperson of Grand National Pictures, a newly established, independent studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two features for Grand National: the crime drama &quot;Great Guy&quot; (1936) with Cagney as a federal inspector, and the musical &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; (1937) with Cagney as a bandleader and dancer. He received good reviews for both. 

Cagney might have continued with Grand National but the studio, having spent lavishly on the Cagney films, couldn&#x27;t recoup the production costs. Grand National usually made low-budget features for small, neighborhood theaters, and the Cagney films proved too expensive for the intended market. Grand National had acquired a promising story property from author Rowland Brown, &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;, for $30,000. Cagney was slated to star in the film version but, with the studio in financial trouble, the project went no further. Cagney took the script to Warner Bros., which bought it from Grand National and filmed it in 1938.

Cagney also became involved in political causes, and in 1936, agreed to sponsor the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League. Unknown to Cagney, the League was in fact a front organization for the Communist International (Comintern), which sought to enlist support for the Soviet Union and its foreign policies.

The courts eventually decided the Warner Bros. lawsuit in Cagney&#x27;s favor. He had done what many thought unthinkable: taking on the studios and winning. Not only did he win, but Warner Bros. also knew that he was still their foremost box office draw and invited him back for a five-year, $150,000-a-film deal, with no more than two pictures a year. Cagney also had full say over what films he did and did not make. Additionally, William Cagney was guaranteed the position of assistant producer for the movies in which his brother starred.

Cagney had demonstrated the power of the walkout in holding the studios to their word. He later explained his reasons, saying, &quot;I walked out because I depended on the studio heads to keep their word on this, that, or other promise, and when the promise was not kept, my only recourse was to deprive them of my services.&quot; Cagney himself acknowledged the importance of the walkout for other actors in breaking the dominance of the studio system. Normally, when a star walked out, the time he or she was absent was added onto the end of an already long contract, as happened with Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis. Cagney, however, walked out and came back to a better contract. Many in Hollywood watched the case closely for hints of how future contracts might be handled.

===1938–1942: Return to Warner Bros.===
====&quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; (1938)====


Cagney&#x27;s two films of 1938, &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot; and &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot;, both costarred Pat O&#x27;Brien. The former was a fast-paced farce with a Hollywood theme, with Cagney and O&#x27;Brien playing for laughs, and received mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was anxious to get him back to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative.

Cagney starred as Rocky Sullivan, a gangster fresh out of jail and looking for his former associate, played by Humphrey Bogart, who owes him money. While revisiting his old haunts, he runs into his old friend Jerry Connolly, played by O&#x27;Brien, who is now a priest concerned about the Dead End Kids&#x27; futures, particularly as they idolize Rocky. After a messy shootout, Sullivan is eventually captured by the police and sentenced to death in the electric chair. Connolly pleads with Rocky to &quot;turn yellow&quot; on his way to the chair so the Kids will lose their admiration for him, and hopefully avoid turning to crime. Sullivan refuses, but on his way to his execution, he breaks down and begs for his life. It is unclear whether this cowardice is real or just feigned for the Kids&#x27; benefit. Cagney himself refused to say, insisting he liked the ambiguity. The film is regarded by many as one of Cagney&#x27;s finest, and garnered him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for 1938. He lost to Spencer Tracy in &quot;Boys Town&quot;. Cagney had been considered for the role, but lost out on it due to his typecasting. (He also lost the role of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; to his friend Pat O&#x27;Brien for the same reason.) Cagney did, however, win that year&#x27;s New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor.

His earlier insistence on not filming with live ammunition proved to be a good decision. Having been told while filming &quot;Angels with Dirty Faces&quot; that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.

====&quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; (1939)====
During his first year back at Warner Bros., Cagney became the studio&#x27;s highest earner, making $324,000. He starred with George Raft in the smash hit &quot;Each Dawn I Die&quot;, an extremely entertaining prison movie that was so successful at the box office that it prompted the studio to offer Raft an important contract in the wake of his departure from Paramount. In addition, Cagney made &quot;The Oklahoma Kid&quot;, a memorable Western with Humphrey Bogart as the black-clad villain. Cagney completed his first decade of movie-making in 1939 with &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, his first film with Raoul Walsh and his last with Bogart. After &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, it would be a decade before Cagney made another gangster film. Cagney again received good reviews; Graham Greene stated, &quot;Mr. Cagney, of the bull-calf brow, is as always a superb and witty actor&quot;. &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; was the last film in which Cagney&#x27;s character&#x27;s violence was explained by poor upbringing, or his environment, as was the case in &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;. From that point on, violence was attached to mania, as in &quot;White Heat&quot;. In 1939 Cagney was second to only Gary Cooper in the national acting wage stakes, earning $368,333.

====1940–1941: &quot;City for Conquest&quot;, &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, and &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot;====

In 1940, Cagney portrayed a boxer in the epic thriller &quot;City for Conquest&quot; with Ann Sheridan as Cagney&#x27;s leading lady, Arthur Kennedy in his first screen role as Cagney&#x27;s younger brother attempting to compose musical symphonies, Anthony Quinn as a brutish dancer, and Elia Kazan as a flamboyantly dressed young gangster originally from the local neighborhood. The well-received film with its shocking plot twists features one of Cagney&#x27;s most moving performances. 
Later the same year, Cagney and Sheridan reunited with Pat O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Torrid Zone&quot;, a turbulent comedy set in a Central American country in which a labor organizer is turning the workers against O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s character&#x27;s banana company, with Cagney&#x27;s &quot;Nick Butler&quot; intervening. The supporting cast features Andy Devine and George Reeves.

Cagney&#x27;s third film in 1940 was &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, a World War I film about a real-life unit with Cagney playing a fictional private, alongside Pat O&#x27;Brien as Father Francis P. Duffy, George Brent as future OSS leader Maj. &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, and Jeffrey Lynn as famous young poet Sgt. Joyce Kilmer. Alan Hale Sr., Frank McHugh and Dick Foran also appear. In 1941, Cagney and Bette Davis reunited for a comedy set in the contemporary West titled &quot;The Bride Came C.O.D.&quot;, followed by a change of pace with the gentle turn-of-the-century romantic comedy &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; (1941) featuring songs of the period and also starring Olivia de Havilland and rising young phenomenon Rita Hayworth, along with Alan Hale Sr. and Jack Carson.

====&quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942)====
In 1942, Cagney portrayed George M. Cohan in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, a film Cagney &quot;took great pride in&quot; and considered his best. Producer Hal Wallis said that having seen Cohan in &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Right&quot;, he never considered anyone other than Cagney for the part. Cagney, though, insisted that Fred Astaire had been the first choice, but turned it down. Many critics of the time and since have declared it Cagney&#x27;s best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney&#x27;s for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always maintained that in this business, you&#x27;re only as good as the other fellow thinks you are. It&#x27;s nice to know that you people thought I did a good job. And don&#x27;t forget that it was a good part, too.&quot;

Filming began the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the cast and crew worked in a &quot;patriotic frenzy&quot; as the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II gave the workers a feeling that &quot;they might be sending the last message from the free world&quot;, according to actress Rosemary DeCamp. Cohan was given a private showing of the film shortly before his death, and thanked Cagney &quot;for a wonderful job,&quot; exclaiming, &quot;My God, what an act to follow!&quot; A paid première, with seats ranging from $25 to $25,000, raised $5,750,000 for war bonds for the US treasury.

===1942–1948: Independent again===
Cagney announced in March 1942 that his brother William and he were setting up Cagney Productions to release films through United Artists. Free of Warner Bros. again, Cagney spent some time relaxing on his farm in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard before volunteering to join the USO. He spent several weeks touring the US, entertaining troops with vaudeville routines and scenes from &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;. In September 1942, he was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild.

Almost a year after its creation, Cagney Productions produced its first film, &quot;Johnny Come Lately&quot;, in 1943. While the major studios were producing patriotic war movies, Cagney was determined to continue dispelling his tough-guy image, so he produced a movie that was a &quot;complete and exhilarating exposition of the Cagney &#x27;alter-ego&#x27; on film&quot;. According to Cagney, the film &quot;made money but it was no great winner&quot;, and reviews varied from excellent (&quot;Time&quot;) to poor (New York&#x27;s &quot;PM&quot;).
Following the film&#x27;s completion, Cagney went back to the USO and toured US military bases in the UK. He refused to give interviews to the British press, preferring to concentrate on rehearsals and performances. He gave several performances a day for the Army Signal Corps of &quot;The American Cavalcade of Dance&quot;, which consisted of a history of American dance, from the earliest days to Fred Astaire, and culminated with dances from &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.

The second movie Cagney&#x27;s company produced was &quot;Blood on the Sun&quot;. Insisting on doing his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys had hoped that an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse at the box office than &quot;Johnny Come Lately&quot;. At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.

While negotiating the rights for his third independent film, Cagney starred in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;13 Rue Madeleine&quot; for $300,000 for two months of work. The wartime spy film was a success, and Cagney was keen to begin production of his new project, an adaptation of William Saroyan&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;. Saroyan himself loved the film, but it was a commercial disaster, costing the company half a million dollars to make; audiences again struggled to accept Cagney in a nontough-guy role.

Cagney Productions was in serious trouble; poor returns from the produced films, and a legal dispute with Sam Goldwyn Studio over a rental agreement forced Cagney back to Warner Bros. He signed a distribution-production deal with the studio for the film &quot;White Heat&quot;, effectively making Cagney Productions a unit of Warner Bros.

===1949–1955: Back to Warner Bros.===
====&quot;White Heat&quot; (1949)====
Cagney&#x27;s portrayal of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film &quot;White Heat&quot; is one of his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot;), and the actor&#x27;s portrayal of gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney&#x27;s hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a dashing romantic commodity in precisely the same way he obviously was before, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, &quot;it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed so we put in all those fits and headaches.&quot;

Cagney&#x27;s final lines in the film – &quot;Made it, Ma! Top of the world!&quot; – was voted the 18th-greatest movie line by the American Film Institute. Likewise, Jarrett&#x27;s explosion of rage in prison on being told of his mother&#x27;s death is widely hailed as one of Cagney&#x27;s most memorable performances. Some of the extras on set actually became terrified of the actor because of his violent portrayal. Cagney attributed the performance to his father&#x27;s alcoholic rages, which he had witnessed as a child, as well as someone that he had seen on a visit to a mental hospital.
The film was a critical success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic. Cagney was still struggling against his gangster typecasting. He said to a journalist, &quot;It&#x27;s what the people want me to do. Some day, though, I&#x27;d like to make another movie that kids could go and see.&quot; However, Warner Bros., perhaps searching for another &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, assigned Cagney a musical for his next picture, 1950&#x27;s &quot;The West Point Story&quot; with Doris Day, an actress he admired.

His next film, &quot;Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye&quot;, was another gangster movie, which was the first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition. While compared unfavorably to &quot;White Heat&quot; by critics, it was fairly successful at the box office, with $500,000 going straight to Cagney Productions&#x27; bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, &quot;A Lion Is in the Streets&quot;, a drama loosely based on flamboyant politician Huey Long, the company came to an end.

====&quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; (1955)====

Cagney&#x27;s next notable role was the 1955 film &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot;, his third with Doris Day, who was top-billed above Cagney for this picture, the first movie for which he&#x27;d accepted second billing since &quot;Smart Money&quot; in 1931. Cagney played Martin &quot;Moe the Gimp&quot; Snyder, a lame Jewish-American gangster from Chicago, a part Spencer Tracy had turned down. Cagney described the script as &quot;that extremely rare thing, the perfect script&quot;. When the film was released, Snyder reportedly asked how Cagney had so accurately copied his limp, but Cagney himself insisted he had not, having based it on personal observation of other people when they limped: &quot;What I did was very simple. I just slapped my foot down as I turned it out while walking. That&#x27;s all&quot;.

His performance earned him another Best Actor Academy Award nomination, 17 years after his first. Reviews were strong, and the film is considered one of the best of his later career. In Day, he found a co-star with whom he could build a rapport, such as he had had with Blondell at the start of his career. Day herself was full of praise for Cagney, stating that he was &quot;the most professional actor I&#x27;ve ever known. He was always &#x27;real&#x27;. I simply forgot we were making a picture. His eyes would actually fill up when we were working on a tender scene. And you never needed drops to make your eyes shine when Jimmy was on the set.&quot;

====&quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1955)====

Cagney&#x27;s next film was &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, directed by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. Tracy&#x27;s involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role in his close friend&#x27;s movie, although in the end, Tracy did not take part and Henry Fonda played the titular role instead. Cagney enjoyed working with the film&#x27;s superb cast despite the absence of Tracy. Major film star William Powell played a rare supporting role as &quot;Doc&quot; in the film, his final picture before retirement from a stellar career that had spanned 33 years, since his first appearance in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; with John Barrymore in 1922. Cagney had worked with Ford on &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; three years earlier, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford had met Cagney at the airport for that film, the director warned him that they would eventually &quot;tangle asses&quot;, which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, &quot;I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man.&quot; The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying &quot;When I started this picture, you said that we would tangle asses before this was over. I&#x27;m ready now – are you?&quot; Ford walked away, and they had no more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.

Cagney&#x27;s skill at noticing tiny details in other actors&#x27; performances became apparent during the shooting of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;. While watching the &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; anthology television show some months before, Cagney had noticed Jack Lemmon performing left-handed, doing practically everything with his left hand. The first thing that Cagney asked Lemmon when they met was if he was still using his left hand. Lemmon was shocked; he had done it on a whim, and thought no one else had noticed. He said of his co-star, &quot;his powers of observation must be absolutely incredible, in addition to the fact that he remembered it. I was very flattered.&quot;

The film was a success, securing three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon, who won. While Cagney was not nominated, he had thoroughly enjoyed the production. Filming on Midway Island and in a more minor role meant that he had time to relax and engage in his hobby of painting. He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew.

===1955–1961: Later career===
In 1955 Cagney replaced Spencer Tracy on the Western film &quot;Tribute to a Bad Man&quot; for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received praise for his performance, and the studio liked his work enough to offer him &quot;These Wilder Years&quot; with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they had both previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained the cast and crew off-screen by singing and dancing.

In 1956 Cagney undertook one of his very rare television roles, starring in Robert Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Soldiers From the War Returning&quot;. This was a favor to Montgomery, who needed a strong fall season opener to stop the network from dropping his series. Cagney&#x27;s appearance ensured that it was a success. The actor made it clear to reporters afterwards that television was not his medium: &quot;I do enough work in movies. This is a high-tension business. I have tremendous admiration for the people who go through this sort of thing every week, but it&#x27;s not for me.&quot;

The following year, Cagney appeared in &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot;, in which he played a fictionalized version of Lon Chaney. He received excellent reviews, with the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; rating it one of his best performances, and the film, made for Universal, was a box office hit. Cagney&#x27;s skill at mimicry, combined with a physical similarity to Chaney, helped him generate empathy for his character.

Later in 1957, Cagney ventured behind the camera for the first and only time to direct &quot;Short Cut to Hell&quot;, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel &quot;A Gun for Sale&quot;. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an excellent director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, &quot;We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, I have no desire to tell other people their business&quot;.

In 1959 Cagney played a labor leader in what proved to be his final musical, &quot;Never Steal Anything Small&quot;, which featured a comical song and dance duet with Cara Williams, who played his girlfriend.

For Cagney&#x27;s next film, he traveled to Ireland for &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped to spend some time tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.

====&quot;The Gallant Hours&quot; (1960)====

Cagney&#x27;s career began winding down, and he made only one film in 1960, the critically acclaimed &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot;, in which he played Admiral William F. &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey. The film, although set during the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater during World War II, was not a war film, but instead focused on the impact of command. Cagney Productions, which shared the production credit with Robert Montgomery&#x27;s company, made a brief return, though in name only. The film was a success, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Bosley Crowther singled out its star for praise: &quot;It is Mr. Cagney&#x27;s performance, controlled to the last detail, that gives life and strong, heroic stature to the principal figure in the film. There is no braggadocio in it, no straining for bold or sharp effects. It is one of the quietest, most reflective, subtlest jobs that Mr. Cagney has ever done.&quot;

====&quot;One, Two, Three&quot; (1961)====

Cagney&#x27;s penultimate film was a comedy. He was hand-picked by Billy Wilder to play a hard-driving Coca-Cola executive in the film &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;. Cagney had concerns with the script, remembering back 23 years to &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;, in which scenes were reshot to try to make them funnier by speeding up the pacing, with the opposite effect. Cagney received assurances from Wilder that the script was balanced. Filming did not go well, though, with one scene requiring 50 takes, something to which Cagney was unaccustomed. In fact, it was one of the worst experiences of his long career. Cagney noted, &quot;I never had the slightest difficulty with a fellow actor. Not until &quot;One, Two, Three&quot;. In that picture, Horst Buchholz tried all sorts of scene-stealing didoes. I came close to knocking him on his ass.&quot; For the first time, Cagney considered walking out of a film. He felt he had worked too many years inside studios, and combined with a visit to Dachau concentration camp during filming, he decided that he had had enough, and retired afterward. One of the few positive aspects was his friendship with Pamela Tiffin, to whom he gave acting guidance, including the secret that he had learned over his career: &quot;You walk in, plant yourself squarely on both feet, look the other fella in the eye, and tell the truth.&quot;

===1961–1986: Later years and retirement===
Cagney remained in retirement for 20 years, conjuring up images of Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, he found it easier to rebuff others, including a part in &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha&#x27;s Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.

====American Film Institute Life Achievement Award (1974)====
Cagney was diagnosed with glaucoma and began taking eye drops, but continued to have vision problems. On Zimmermann&#x27;s recommendation, he visited a different doctor, who determined that glaucoma had been a misdiagnosis, and that Cagney was actually diabetic. Zimmermann then took it upon herself to look after Cagney, preparing his meals to reduce his blood triglycerides, which had reached alarming levels. Such was her success that, by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his American Film Institute Life Achievement Award ceremony in 1974, he had lost and his vision had improved. Charlton Heston opened the ceremony, and Frank Sinatra introduced Cagney. So many Hollywood stars attended—said to be more than for any event in history—that one columnist wrote at the time that a bomb in the dining room would have ended the movie industry. In his acceptance speech, Cagney lightly chastised the impressionist Frank Gorshin, saying, &quot;Oh, Frankie, just in passing, I never said &#x27;MMMMmmmm, you dirty rat!&#x27; What I actually did say was &#x27;Judy, Judy, Judy!&#x27;&quot;—a joking reference to a similar misquotation attributed to Cary Grant.

====&quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981)====

While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After he spent two weeks in the hospital, Zimmermann became his full-time caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever they went. After the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981).

This film was shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, and on his arrival at Southampton aboard the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot;, Cagney was mobbed by hundreds of fans. Cunard Line officials, who were responsible for security at the dock, said they had never seen anything like it, although they had experienced past visits by Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.

Despite the fact that &quot;Ragtime&quot; was his first film in 20 years, Cagney was immediately at ease: Flubbed lines and miscues were committed by his co-stars, often simply through sheer awe. Howard Rollins, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, said, &quot;I was frightened to meet Mr. Cagney. I asked him how to die in front of the camera. He said &#x27;Just die!&#x27; It worked. Who would know more about dying than him?&quot; Cagney also repeated the advice he had given to Pamela Tiffin, Joan Leslie, and Lemmon. As filming progressed, Cagney&#x27;s sciatica worsened, but he finished the nine-week filming, and reportedly stayed on the set after completing his scenes to help the other actors with their dialogue.

Cagney&#x27;s frequent co-star, Pat O&#x27;Brien, appeared with him on the British chat show &quot;Parkinson&quot; in the early 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother&#x27;s command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance onstage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.

====&quot;Terrible Joe Moran&quot; (1984)====
Cagney made a rare TV appearance in the lead role of the movie &quot;Terrible Joe Moran&quot; in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney&#x27;s health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney&#x27;s boxing movie &quot;Winner Take All&quot; (1932).

==Personal life==

In 1920, Cagney was a member of the chorus for the show &quot;Pitter Patter&quot;, where he met Frances Willard &quot;Billie&quot; Vernon. They married on September 28, 1922, and the marriage lasted until his death in 1986. Frances Cagney died in 1994. In 1940 they adopted a son whom they named James Francis Cagney III, and later a daughter, Cathleen &quot;Casey&quot; Cagney. Cagney was a very private man, and while he was willing to give the press opportunities for photographs, he generally spent his personal time out of the public eye.

Cagney&#x27;s son died from a heart attack on January 27, 1984, in Washington, D.C., two years before his father&#x27;s death. James III had become estranged from him, and they had not seen or talked to one another since 1982. Cagney&#x27;s daughter Cathleen was also estranged from her father during the final years of his life. She died on August 11, 2004.

As a young man, Cagney became interested in farming – sparked by a soil conservation lecture he had attended – to the extent that during his first walkout from Warner Bros., he helped to found a farm in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Cagney loved that no paved roads surrounded the property, only dirt tracks. The house was rather run-down and ramshackle, and Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love the place as well. After being inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security. The ruse proved so successful that when Spencer Tracy came to visit, his taxi driver refused to drive up to the house, saying, &quot;I hear they shoot!&quot; Tracy had to go the rest of the way on foot.

In 1955, having shot three films, Cagney bought a farm in Stanfordville, Dutchess County, New York, for $100,000. Cagney named it Verney Farm, taking the first syllable from Billie&#x27;s maiden name and the second from his own surname. He turned it into a working farm, selling some of the dairy cattle and replacing them with beef cattle. He expanded it over the years to . Such was Cagney&#x27;s enthusiasm for agriculture and farming that his diligence and efforts were rewarded by an honorary degree from Florida&#x27;s Rollins College. Rather than just &quot;turning up with Ava Gardner on my arm&quot; to accept his honorary degree, Cagney turned the tables upon the college&#x27;s faculty by writing and submitting a paper on soil conservation.

He studied judo specifically for the movie &quot;Blood on the Sun&quot; in 1945, and then continued to study it for some time after the film was finished. His use of actual judo throws and holds in the movie has been noted as the first appearance of eastern martial arts in Western film.

Cagney was born in 1899 (prior to the widespread use of automobiles) and loved horses from childhood. As a child, he often sat on the horses of local deliverymen and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother. As an adult, well after horses were replaced by automobiles as the primary mode of transportation, Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in Morgans, a breed of which he was particularly fond.

Cagney was a keen sailor and owned boats that were harbored on both coasts of the U.S., including the &quot;Swift of Ipswich&quot;. His joy in sailing, however, did not protect him from occasional seasickness—becoming ill, sometimes, on a calm day while weathering rougher, heavier seas at other times. Cagney greatly enjoyed painting, and claimed in his autobiography that he might have been happier, if somewhat poorer, as a painter than a movie star. The renowned painter Sergei Bongart taught Cagney in his later life and owned two of Cagney&#x27;s works. Cagney often gave away his work but refused to sell his paintings, considering himself an amateur. He signed and sold only one painting, purchased by Johnny Carson to benefit a charity.

==Political views==
In his autobiography, Cagney said that as a young man, he had no political views, since he was more concerned with from where his next meal was coming. However, the emerging labor movement of the 1920s and 1930s soon forced him to take sides. The first version of the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935, and growing tensions between labor and management fueled the movement. Fanzines in the 1930s, however, described his politics as &quot;radical&quot;.

This somewhat exaggerated view was enhanced by his public contractual wranglings with Warner Bros. at the time, his joining of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933, and his involvement in the revolt against the so-called &quot;Merriam tax&quot;. The &quot;Merriam tax&quot; was an underhanded method of funnelling studio funds to politicians; during the 1934 Californian gubernatorial campaign, the studio executives would &quot;tax&quot; their actors, automatically taking a day&#x27;s pay from their biggest earners, ultimately sending nearly half a million dollars to the gubernatorial campaign of Frank Merriam. Cagney (as well as Jean Harlow) publicly refused to pay and Cagney even threatened that, if the studios took a day&#x27;s pay for Merriam&#x27;s campaign, he would give a week&#x27;s pay to Upton Sinclair, Merriam&#x27;s opponent in the race.

He supported political activist and labor leader Thomas Mooney&#x27;s defense fund, but was repelled by the behavior of some of Mooney&#x27;s supporters at a rally. Around the same time, he gave money for a Spanish Republican Army ambulance during the Spanish Civil War, which he put down to being &quot;a soft touch&quot;. This donation enhanced his liberal reputation. He also became involved in a &quot;liberal group...with a leftist slant,&quot; along with Ronald Reagan. However, when he and Reagan saw the direction in which the group was heading, they resigned on the same night.

Cagney was accused of being a communist sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter&#x27;s writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney&#x27;s donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr. on the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Cagney became president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the Guild&#x27;s fight against the Mafia and the Chicago Outfit, which had been using the threat of strike action by a mob-controlled labor union to extort protection money from Hollywood studios. His wife, Billie Vernon, once received a phone call telling her that Cagney had died in an automobile accident. According to Cagney, having failed to scare off the Guild and him, the Chicago Outfit allegedly sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the contract was supposedly canceled.

During World War II, Cagney raised money for war bonds by taking part in racing exhibitions at the Roosevelt Raceway and selling seats for the premiere of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;. He also let the United States Army practice maneuvers at his Martha&#x27;s Vineyard estate.

After the war, Cagney&#x27;s politics started to change. He had worked on Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidential campaigns, including the 1940 presidential election against Wendell Willkie. By the time of the 1948 election, he had become disillusioned with Harry S. Truman, and he voted for Thomas E. Dewey, his first non-Democratic vote. He would also support Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election.

By 1980, Cagney was contributing financially to the Republican Party, supporting his friend Ronald Reagan&#x27;s bid for the presidency in the 1980 election. As he got older, Cagney even began referring to himself in his autobiography as &quot;arch-conservative&quot;. He regarded his move away from Marxism as &quot;a totally natural reaction once I began to see undisciplined elements in our country stimulating a breakdown of our system... Those functionless creatures, the hippies ... just didn&#x27;t appear out of a vacuum&quot;.

==Death==

Cagney died of a heart attack at his Dutchess County farm in Stanford, New York, on Easter Sunday 1986, aged 86. A funeral Mass was held at St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan. The eulogy was delivered by his close friend, Ronald Reagan, who was also the President of the United States at the time. His pallbearers included boxer Floyd Patterson, dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov (who had hoped to play Cagney on Broadway), actor Ralph Bellamy, and director Miloš Forman. Governor Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Edward I. Koch were also in attendance at the service.

Cagney was interred in a crypt in the Garden Mausoleum at Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne, New York.

==Honors and legacy==
Cagney won the Academy Award in 1943 for his performance as George M. Cohan in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;.

For his contributions to the film industry, Cagney was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 6504 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1974, Cagney received the American Film Institute&#x27;s Life Achievement Award. Charlton Heston, in announcing that Cagney was to be honored, called him &quot;one of the most significant figures of a generation when American film was dominant, Cagney, that most American of actors, somehow communicated eloquently to audiences all over the world ... and to actors as well.&quot;

He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1980, and a Career Achievement Award from the U.S. National Board of Review in 1981. In 1984, Ronald Reagan awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 1999, the United States Postal Service issued a 33-cent stamp honoring Cagney.

Cagney was among the most favored actors for director Stanley Kubrick and actor Marlon Brando, and was considered by Orson Welles to be &quot;maybe the greatest actor to ever appear in front of a camera.&quot; Warner Bros. arranged private screenings of Cagney films for Winston Churchill.

On May 19, 2015, a new musical celebrating Cagney, and dramatizing his relationship with Warner Bros., opened off-Broadway in New York City at the York Theatre. &quot;Cagney, The Musical&quot; then moved to the Westside Theatre until May 28, 2017.

<text>Jonathan Michael Richman (born May 16, 1951) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. In 1970, he founded the Modern Lovers, an influential proto-punk band. Since the mid-1970s, Richman has worked either solo or with low-key acoustic and electric backing. He is known for his wide-eyed, unaffected, and childlike outlook, and music that, while rooted in rock and roll, is influenced by music from around the world.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Born into a Jewish family in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Natick, Massachusetts, Richman began playing music and writing his own songs in the mid-1960s. He became infatuated with the Velvet Underground and, in 1969, he moved to New York City, lived on the couch of their manager, Steve Sesnick, worked odd jobs, and tried to break in as a professional musician. Failing at this, he returned to Boston.

===The Modern Lovers===

Richman formed the Modern Lovers, a proto-punk garage rock band, in Boston, Massachusetts. Other notable members of the group were keyboard player Jerry Harrison and drummer David Robinson, who later joined Talking Heads and the Cars, respectively.

In 1972, they recorded a series of demos with producer John Cale (formerly of the Velvet Underground). Among these songs were the seminal &quot;Roadrunner&quot; and &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot;, which were eventually released four years later in August 1976 as &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot; by which time the group had broken up. The album was strange for its time, featuring Velvets-influenced basic three-chord rock (&quot;Roadrunner&quot; – based on just two chords – is an homage to &quot;Sister Ray&quot;) at a time when glam and progressive rock were the norm.

Later in 1972, the group re-recorded some songs, along with other material, with producer Kim Fowley. These demos were eventually released in 1981 as &quot;The Original Modern Lovers&quot; LP. Despite playing live regularly, the Modern Lovers had a difficult time securing a recording contract. By late 1973, Richman wanted to scrap the recorded tracks and start again with a mellower, more lyrical sound, influenced by the laid-back local music he had heard when the band had a residency at the Inverurie Hotel in Bermuda earlier in the year. These stymied efforts to complete a debut album led to the breakup of the original Modern Lovers in February 1974.

===Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers===
In 1975, Richman moved to California to record as a solo singer/songwriter with the independent Beserkley Records label. His first released recordings appeared on 1975&#x27;s &quot;Beserkley Chartbusters&quot; compilation, where he was backed by members of Earth Quake and the Rubinoos. The four songs on the compilation also appeared on singles released by Beserkley.

In January 1976, Richman put together a new version of the Modern Lovers, which included original Modern Lovers drummer David Robinson, former Rubinoos bassist Greg &#x27;Curly&#x27; Keranen and Leroy Radcliffe on guitar. The new group, now billed as Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers, found Richman turning away from the harder, Velvet Underground-influenced electric rock of the original Modern Lovers, toward a gentler sound mixing pop with 1950s rock and roll, and including a bigger emphasis on harmony vocals. During this period Richman recorded a mix of original songs and material by other writers, including Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Back in the USA&quot;, the traditional spiritual songs &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and &quot;Angels Watching Over Me&quot;, and older pop songs like &quot;Emaline&quot;, &quot;Buzz, Buzz, Buzz&quot;, and &quot;Lydia&quot;.

Richman&#x27;s own songs continued to mix straightforward love themes with more whimsical themes like Martians (&quot;Here Come the Martian Martians&quot;), Leprechauns (&quot;Rockin&#x27; Rockin&#x27; Leprechauns&quot;), the Abominable Snowman (&quot;Abominable Snowman in the Market&quot;), and mosquitoes (&quot;I&#x27;m Nature&#x27;s Mosquito&quot;). Richman&#x27;s 1977 recording of the children&#x27;s music standard &quot;The Wheels on the Bus&quot; made explicit his interest in making music for listeners of all ages.

The album &quot;Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers&quot; was released in May 1976, three months before the older &quot;The Modern Lovers&quot; sessions were finally released. Drummer David Robinson left the group soon thereafter, due to frustration with Richman&#x27;s quest for lower volume levels, and joined with Ric Ocasek in forming the band the Cars.

After several months as a trio, Richman found a new drummer, D. Sharpe, an avant-garde jazz player on the Boston scene, who later went on to become a member of pianist Carla Bley&#x27;s band.

&quot;Rock and Roll with the Modern Lovers&quot; was released in 1977 and, just as this record began to climb the charts in Europe, Keranen left the group to attend college. A subsequent live album, &quot;Modern Lovers Live&quot;, was released in 1978, with Asa Brebner on bass.
In the United Kingdom, Richman was recognised as a progenitor of the punk rock scene, and several of his singles became hits. &quot;Roadrunner&quot; reached number 11 in the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, the instrumental &quot;Egyptian Reggae&quot;, made number 5 in late 1977. &quot;Egyptian Reggae&quot; was a version of Jamaican musician Earl Zero&#x27;s reggae song &quot;None Shall Escape the Judgment&quot;; Zero was credited as co-writer on Richman&#x27;s later versions of the track.

&quot;Back in Your Life&quot; was released in 1979 under the &quot;Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers&quot; moniker, but only about half the disc featured a backup band. The balance of the album was Richman playing solo. Following this version of The Modern Lovers&#x27; final breakup, Richman went on sabbatical for a few years, staying in Appleton, Maine, and playing at local bars in Belfast, Maine.

By 1981, Richman was recording and touring once again with various combinations of musicians under the band name Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. The touring band was as large as five backup musicians during parts of 1981, when the group had bassist Curly Keranen once again, along with drummer Michael Guardabascio, keyboard player Ken Forfia, vocalist and guitarist Ellie Marshall, and vocalist Beth Harrington for a gig at New York&#x27;s Bottom Line. This expanded Modern Lovers group would go on to record much of the music on the &quot;Jonathan Sings&quot; (1983), &quot;Rockin&#x27; &amp; Romance&quot; (1985), and &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers&quot; (1986) albums.

From 1981 to 1984, Richman most often played live in a trio with Keranen and Marshall. In 1985, the group was reconfigured, and consisted of bassist Asa Brebner and drummer Andy Paley. From 1986 to 1988, most of Richman&#x27;s concerts were played with guitarist Brennan Totten and drummer Johnny Avila. Signing with Rounder Records in 1987, Richman recorded his final album using the &quot;Modern Lovers&quot; group name (&quot;Modern Lovers 88&quot;). After this, the &quot;Modern Lovers&quot; moniker was retired.

===Solo===
From 1988 to 1992, Richman performed mostly as a solo act to support his Rounder albums &quot;Jonathan Richman&quot; (1989), &quot;Jonathan Goes Country&quot; (1990), and &quot;Having a Party with Jonathan Richman&quot; (1991). Around the time of his &quot;I, Jonathan&quot; album (1992), he formed his performance duo with drummer Tommy Larkins (Giant Sand, Yard Trauma, Naked Prey, et al.), who would continue to play and record with Richman for more than 25 years.

In 1993, he contributed the track &quot;Hot Nights&quot; to the AIDS-benefit album &quot;No Alternative&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Always possessing an ardent cult following, Richman became better known in the 1990s thanks to a series of appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Another career boost came with the Farrelly Brothers&#x27; 1998 film &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;, where Richman and Larkins served as a two-man Greek chorus, commenting on the plot while performing their music within the framed action itself. He also appeared briefly in a bar scene in a previous Farrelly Brothers film, &quot;Kingpin&quot;, and performed the song &quot;As We Walk to Fenway Park&quot; for their 2005 comedy, &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;.

Richman continued to release albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s, with the Spanish-language &quot;¡Jonathan, Te Vas a Emocionar!&quot; (1994), followed by &quot;You Must Ask the Heart&quot; (1995), &quot;Surrender to Jonathan!&quot; (1996), &quot;I&#x27;m So Confused&quot; (1998), &quot;Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow&quot; (2001), and &quot;Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love&quot; (2004). In 1998, a live album of Modern Lovers recordings from the early 1970s was released, &quot;Live at the Long Branch &amp; More&quot;. A live filmed performance, &quot;Take Me to the Plaza&quot;, was released on DVD in 2002.

Richman&#x27;s most recent albums are on the Cleveland, Ohio, based Blue Arrow Records: 2016&#x27;s &quot;Ishkode! Ishkode!&quot;, 2018&#x27;s &quot;SA&quot; and 2022&#x27;s &quot;Want to Visit My Inner House?&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
His first marriage was to Gail Clook of Vermont, in 1982, with whom he has a daughter, Jenny Rae, and stepson, Jason (Gail&#x27;s son from a previous relationship). This marriage ended in divorce sometime shortly before the release of &quot;Surrender to Jonathan!&quot; (1996).

In 2003, Richman married Nicole Montalbano of Chico, California. She contributed backing vocals to the album &quot;Not So Much to Be Loved as to Love&quot; (2004).

Richman also runs a business, Arcane Masonry, in Chico, making bread ovens as well as other projects.

== Artistry and instruments ==
Richman&#x27;s minimalist songwriting style has been described as whimsical and childlike. He himself has stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t write, really. I just make up songs.&quot;

Richman has played a variety of electric and acoustic guitars throughout his career. In promotional and concert photos from the early 1970s (such as those reproduced in the album &quot;Precise Modern Lovers Order&quot;), Richman is frequently seen using a white Fender Stratocaster. He later wrote a song (&quot;Fender Stratocaster&quot;) expressing his affection for the Stratocaster design.

In the late 1970s, working with his group The Modern Lovers, Richman often played a Fender Jazzmaster. He can be seen playing this guitar in the Dutch TV program &quot;TopPop&quot; filmed on September 16, 1978. A contemporaneous stage photo used on the cover of the &quot;Egyptian Reggae&quot; single shows Richman playing a sunburst Stratocaster.

Late-1970s studio recordings, such as the &quot;Rock and Roll with the Modern Lovers&quot; album, also featured Richman playing nylon-stringed acoustic guitar. On a 1979 performance on French television, and in the cover photo of &quot;The Best of Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers&quot;, Richman plays a late-1970s Ibanez model 2453CW hollow-body electric guitar, a guitar similar in style to the Epiphone he would use extensively a decade later.

In the early- and mid-1980s, working with The Modern Lovers, Richman was frequently photographed playing a Harmony Hollywood hollow-body electric guitar. This guitar is seen on the back cover of Richman&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Time For&quot; album. By the late 1980s, Richman was frequently performing solo concerts using a blonde 1980s Epiphone Regent hollow-body electric guitar. He can be seen holding this guitar on the back cover of the &quot;Having a Party with Jonathan Richman&quot; CD.

Richman was still using his Epiphone Regent on stage when he began performing as a duo with drummer Tommy Larkins in 1992. After a short stint playing other electric guitars on stage including a Gibson SG, Richman switched to exclusively playing nylon-stringed acoustic guitars (of the classical and flamenco styles) in concert. Richman has played a number of different nylon-stringed guitars since the mid-1990s.

After switching to nylon-stringed acoustic guitars, Richman initially used a pick and played in a style close to that of his electric guitar playing. Eventually, he stopped using both a guitar pick and a guitar strap in concert, preferring to play only with his fingers and to move frequently between playing guitar, dancing, and playing percussion instruments.

Richman has also been photographed playing a Fender Telecaster and other electric and acoustic guitars, and he does not consider any specific instrument to be essential to his sound. In a 2006 interview with musician Chuck Prophet, Richman said &quot;It&#x27;s not the guitar, it&#x27;s the player. In fact, my most recent Flamenco guitar isn&#x27;t even a real Flamenco guitar. It&#x27;s not made out of the right woods. Made out of walnut. It&#x27;s twangy. I bought it and I like it.&quot;

During the early- and mid-1980s, Richman frequently played tenor saxophone during his concerts with The Modern Lovers. He can be heard playing the instrument on &quot;California Desert Party&quot;, a song on his &quot;Modern Lovers 88&quot; album. The album also shows him holding the instrument in the cover photograph.

== Influence ==

Richman&#x27;s work with the first incarnation of Modern Lovers is a major influence on punk rock. One critic called him the &quot;Godfather of Punk&quot;. On his second solo album, Brian Eno made mention of Richman&#x27;s band in his lyrics, and the Sex Pistols and Joan Jett were among the first artists of note to cover the song &quot;Roadrunner&quot; in the 1970s. A version of &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; performed by Burning Sensations was included in the 1984 cult film, &quot;Repo Man&quot;. David Bowie covered &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; on his album &quot;Reality&quot;. Velvet Underground founding member John Cale has a version of the song on his 1975 album, &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;, and continues to include the song in his live shows. Iggy Pop has performed &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; live and wrote an extra verse for it. Echo and the Bunnymen covered &quot;She Cracked&quot; in concert in 1984 and 1985 and Siouxsie and the Banshees have a version of the song on &quot;Downside Up&quot;.

Richman&#x27;s music has set the tone for many alternative rock bands, such as Violent Femmes, Galaxie 500, They Might Be Giants (&quot;Roadrunner&quot; reportedly inspired John Flansburgh to become a musician), Weezer, Tullycraft, Jens Lekman, Pixies leader Black Francis aka Frank Black (who composed the tribute song &quot;The Man Who Was Too Loud&quot;), Brandon Flowers, Art Brut, Craig Finn of the Hold Steady &amp; Lifter Puller, Mac DeMarco and Nerf Herder who composed a song about him, titled &quot;Jonathan&quot;, which appeared on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;How To Meet Girls&quot;. British country rock band the Rockingbirds released the single &quot;Jonathan, Jonathan&quot; in tribute to Richman in 1992. The Silos also covered the Modern Lovers&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Straight&quot;. Boston ska-punk band Big D and the Kids Table also covered Richman&#x27;s song &quot;New England&quot; for their &quot;Gypsy Hill&quot; EP. A tribute album, &quot;If I Were a Richman: a Tribute to the Music of Jonathan Richman&quot;, was released by Wampus Multimedia in 2001.

The Modern Lovers&#x27; song &quot;Roadrunner&quot; appears on the soundtrack to the film &quot;School of Rock&quot;. In the commentary, director Richard Linklater mentions it is often called &quot;the first punk song&quot; and wanted to include it for that reason, along with all the other seminal rock songs in that film. Rapper M.I.A. featured the opening lyrics from &quot;Roadrunner&quot; in the song &quot;Bamboo Banga&quot; on her 2007 album, &quot;Kala&quot;.

As a producer himself, Richman and drummer Tommy Larkins produced Vic Chesnutt&#x27;s final album &quot;Skitter on Take-Off&quot; in 2009 which appeared on Vapor Records. Chesnutt opened for Richman at concerts many times during his later years.

<text>Johann Bayer (; 1572 – 7 March 1625) was a German lawyer and uranographer (celestial cartographer). He was born in Rain in 1572. In 1592, aged 20, he began his study of philosophy and law at the University of Ingolstadt, after which he moved to Augsburg to begin work as a lawyer, becoming legal adviser to the city council in 1612.

Bayer had several interests outside his work, including archaeology and mathematics. However, he is primarily known for his work in astronomy; particularly for his work on determining the positions of objects on the celestial sphere. He remained unmarried and died in 1625.

Bayer&#x27;s star atlas &quot;Uranometria Omnium Asterismorum&quot; (&quot;Uranometry of all the asterisms&quot;) was first published in 1603 in Augsburg and dedicated to two prominent local citizens. This was the first atlas to cover the entire celestial sphere. It was based upon the work of Tycho Brahe and may have borrowed from Alessandro Piccolomini&#x27;s 1540 star atlas, &quot;De le stelle fisse&quot; (&quot;Of the fixed stars&quot;), although Bayer included an additional 1,000 stars. The &quot;Uranometria&quot; introduced a new system of star designation which has become known as the Bayer designation. Bayer&#x27;s atlas included twelve new constellations invented a few years earlier to fill in the far south of the night sky, which was unknown to ancient Greece and Rome.

The crater Bayer on the Moon is named after him.

<doc id="16069" wikidata="Q48987" url="?curid=16069" title="Jonathan Demme">
<text>Robert Jonathan Demme ( ; February 22, 1944 – April 26, 2017) was an American filmmaker, whose career directing, producing, and screenwriting spanned more than 30 years and 70 feature films, documentaries, and television productions. He was an Academy Award and a Directors Guild of America Award winner, and received nominations for a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, and three Independent Spirit Awards.

Beginning his career under B-movie producer Roger Corman, Demme made his directorial debut with the 1974 women-in-prison film &quot;Caged Heat&quot;, before becoming known for his casually humanist films such as &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; (1980), &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984), &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986), and &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988). His 1991 psychological horror film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, based on the novel of the same title, won five Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture.

His subsequent films earned similar acclaim, notably the HIV/AIDS-themed drama &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993), the supernatural Gothic horror &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998), the conspiracy thriller &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004), and the independent drama &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008). Demme also directed numerous concert films such as &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; (1984), &quot;Neil Young: Heart of Gold&quot; (2006), and &quot;Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids&quot; (2016), and worked on several television series as both a producer and director.

==Early life==
Demme was born on February 22, 1944, in Baldwin, New York, the son of Dorothy Louise ( Rogers) and Robert Eugene Demme, a public relations executive. He was raised in Rockville Centre, New York and Miami, where he graduated from Southwest Miami High School before attending the University of Florida.

==Career==
===Early films===
Demme broke into feature film working for exploitation film producer Roger Corman early in his career, co-writing and producing &quot;Angels Hard as They Come&quot; (1971), a motorcycle movie very loosely based on &quot;Rashomon&quot;, and &quot;The Hot Box&quot; (1972). He then moved on to directing three films for Corman&#x27;s studio New World Pictures: &quot;Caged Heat&quot; (1974), &quot;Crazy Mama&quot; (1975), and &quot;Fighting Mad&quot; (1976). After &quot;Fighting Mad&quot;, Demme directed the comedy film &quot;Handle with Care&quot; (originally titled &quot;Citizens Band&quot;, 1977) for Paramount Pictures. The film was well received by critics, but received little promotion, and performed poorly at the box office. He also directed a 1978 episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;.

Demme&#x27;s next film, &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; (1980), did not get a wide release, but received a groundswell of critical acclaim and film award recognition, including Academy Award nominations, winning two of its three nominations (Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress – Mary Steenburgen, and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay – Bo Goldman). This acclaim led to the signing of Demme to direct the Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell star vehicle &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984). Intended as a prestige picture for Warner Bros. as well as a major commercial vehicle for Demme, it instead became a troubled production due to the conflicting visions of Demme and star Hawn. Demme ended up renouncing the finished product, and when the film was released in May 1984, it was generally panned by critics and neglected by moviegoers. After &quot;Swing Shift&quot;, Demme stepped back from Hollywood to make the Talking Heads concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; (also 1984) which won the National Society of Film Critics Award for best documentary; the eclectic screwball action-romantic comedy &quot;Something Wild&quot; (1986); a film-version of the stage production &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot; (1987), by monologist Spalding Gray; and the New York Mafia-by-way-of Downtown comedy &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988).

Demme formed his production company, Clinica Estetico, with producers Edward Saxon and Peter Saraf in 1987. They were based out of New York City for fifteen years.
===Later films===
Demme won the Academy Award for &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1991)—one of only three films to win all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress). Inspired by his friend Juan Suárez Botas&#x27;s illness with AIDS and fueled by his own moral convictions, Demme then used his influence to make &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993), one of the first major films to address the AIDS crisis and which garnered star Tom Hanks his first Best Actor Oscar. He also co-directed (with his nephew Ted) the music video for Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s Best Song Oscar-winning &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot; from the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Jonathan used several of the same actors for both movies.

Subsequently, his films included an adaptation of Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998), and remakes of two films from the 1960s: &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot; (2002), based on &quot;Charade&quot;, that starred Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role; and &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004), with Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep. Demme&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Man from Plains&quot; (2007), a documentary about former U.S. President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s promotional tour publicizing his book &quot;&quot;, had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival.

His art-house hit &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008) was compared by many critics to Demme&#x27;s films of the late 1970s and 1980s. It was included in many 2008 &quot;best of&quot; lists, and received numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress by lead Anne Hathaway. In 2010, Demme made his first foray into theater, directing &quot;Family Week&quot;, a play by Beth Henley. The play was produced by MCC Theater and co-starred Rosemarie DeWitt and Kathleen Chalfant.

At one time, Demme was signed on to direct, produce, and write an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s sci-fi novel &quot;11/22/63&quot;, but later left the project due to disagreements with King on what should be included in the script.

He returned to the concert documentary format with &quot;Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids&quot; (2016), which he described as a &quot;performance film, but also a portrait of an artist at a certain moment in the arc of his career&quot;, and his last project was a history of rock &amp; roll for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame compiled from footage from Hall of Fame induction ceremonies set to debut in summer 2017.

Demme directed music videos for artists such as Suburban Lawns, New Order, KRS-One&#x27;s H.E.A.L. project and Bruce Springsteen. He also produced a compilation of Haitian music called &quot;Konbit: Burning Rhythms of Haiti&quot; that was released in 1989. (Lou Reed selected &quot;Konbit...&quot; as one of his &#x27;picks of 1989&#x27;).

Demme was on the board of directors at Jacob Burns Film Center in Pleasantville, New York. In addition to his role on the board, he curated and hosted a monthly series called &quot;Rarely Seen Cinema&quot;.

==Style==
Throughout 1986–2004, Demme was known for his dramatic close-ups in films. This style of close-ups involves the character looking directly into the camera during crucial moments. According to Demme, this was done to put the viewer into the character&#x27;s shoes. Beginning with &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008), Demme adopted a documentary style of filmmaking.

He was known for his use of recurring supporting players, including Charles Napier, Harry Northup, Tracey Walter, Ann Dowd, LisaGay Hamilton, Kimberly Elise, Paul Lazar, Ron Vawter, Dean Stockwell, Obba Babatundé, Ted Levine, Paul Le Mat, Mary Steenburgen, Jason Robards, Scott Glenn, and his former producer Roger Corman, as well as casting musicians and bands in roles. These included Sister Carol, Chris Isaak, Tunde Adebimpe, the Feelies, Charles Aznavour, Steve Scales, the Flirtations, Manno Charlemagne, Bernie Worrell, David Johansen, Beau Sia, Q Lazzarus, and Rick Springfield. In addition to Corman, Demme cast a number of other fellow directors in cameos, including John Sayles, Agnès Varda, George A. Romero, Sidney Lumet, and John Waters. Many of these performers received opening credits billing in films they appeared in, despite sometimes having only one or two lines.

Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has paid homage to Demme in his films and has cited him as a major influence in his work. In an interview, Anderson jokingly stated that the three filmmakers who inspired him the most are &quot;Jonathan Demme, Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Demme.&quot; Other directors such as Alexander Payne and Wes Anderson have been known to be inspired by his close-ups in their own work.

==Political activism==
Demme was involved in various political projects. In 1981, he directed a series of commercials for the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way. The spots, titled &quot;Eggs&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, and &quot;Sports&quot;, were produced by Norman Lear and featured Muhammad Ali, Carol Burnett, and Goldie Hawn celebrating Freedom of Expression. In 1985, he directed a video for Artists United Against Apartheid. The short, featured various international musicians including Afrika Bambaataa, Rubén Blades, Jimmy Cliff, Herbie Hancock, Little Steven, Run–D.M.C., and Bruce Springsteen, calling for a boycott of the South African luxury resort Sun City during Apartheid. His documentary &quot;Haiti Dreams of Democracy&quot; (1988) captured Haiti&#x27;s era of democratic rebuilding after dictatorship, while his documentary &quot;The Agronomist&quot; (2008) profiled Haitian journalist and human rights activist Jean Dominique. Demme spent six years on the documentary &quot;I&#x27;m Carolyn Parker&quot; (2011), which highlighted rebuilding efforts in New Orleans Lower Ninth Ward after Hurricane Katrina.

==Personal life==
Demme was married twice. His first marriage to Evelyn Purcell ended in divorce. In 1987, he married artist Joanne Howard, with whom he had three children. He was the uncle of film director Ted Demme, who died in 2002. Demme&#x27;s cousin was the Rev. Robert Wilkinson Castle Jr., an Episcopal priest who appeared in some of Demme&#x27;s films.

Demme was a member of the steering committee of the Friends of the Apollo Theater, Oberlin, Ohio, along with Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. In 2013, he returned to Oberlin as part of an alumni reunion during the class of 2013 graduation ceremony and received the award for Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts.

In 2009, Demme signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

Demme was an avid collector and devotee of Haitian art, in particular of Hector Hyppolite - so much so that he called it &quot;an addiction&quot;. In 2014, he held an auction in Philadelphia selling thousands from his collection, much of which was donated to a cultural center in Port-au-Prince.

==Death==
Demme died at his home in Manhattan on April 26, 2017, from complications from esophageal cancer and heart disease; he was 73.
Director Brady Corbet dedicated his 2018 film &quot;Vox Lux&quot; to Demme&#x27;s memory, as did Luca Guadagnino with his 2018 film &quot;Suspiria&quot; and Paul Thomas Anderson with his 2017 film &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; starring Daniel Day Lewis. Demme is thanked in the credits of Spike Lee&#x27;s 2020 concert film &quot;American Utopia&quot; starring David Byrne. The album &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; by musicians Sufjan Stevens and Angelo De Augustine is dedicated to Demme, with one of its songs, &quot;Cimmerian Shade&quot;, mentioning him and referencing &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; within its lyrics.

<doc id="16073" wikidata="Q151152" url="?curid=16073" title="Juan Gris">
<text>José Victoriano González-Pérez (23 March 1887 – 11 May 1927), better known as Juan Gris (; ), was a Spanish painter born in Madrid who lived and worked in France for most of his active period. Closely connected to the innovative artistic genre Cubism, his works are among the movement&#x27;s most distinctive.

==Life==
Gris was born in Madrid and later studied engineering at the Madrid School of Arts and Sciences. There, from 1902 to 1904, he contributed drawings to local periodicals. From 1904 to 1905, he studied painting with the academic artist José Moreno Carbonero. It was in 1905 that José Victoriano González adopted the more distinctive name Juan Gris.

In 1909, Lucie Belin (1891–1942)—Gris&#x27; wife—gave birth to Georges Gonzalez-Gris (1909–2003), the artist&#x27;s only child. The three lived at the Bateau-Lavoir, 13 Rue Ravignan, Paris, from 1909 to 1911. In 1912 Gris met Charlotte Augusta Fernande Herpin (1894–1983), also known as Josette. Late 1913 or early 1914 they lived together at the Bateau-Lavoir until 1922. Josette Gris was Juan Gris&#x27; second companion and unofficial wife.

==Career==

In 1906, after he sold all his possessions, he moved to Paris and became friends with the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, and artists Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Jean Metzinger. He submitted darkly humorous illustrations to journals such as the anarchist satirical magazine &quot;L&#x27;Assiette au Beurre&quot;, and also &quot;Le Rire&quot;, &quot;Le Charivari&quot;, and &quot;Le Cri de Paris&quot;. In Paris, Gris followed the lead of Metzinger and another friend and fellow countryman, Pablo Picasso.

Gris began to paint seriously in 1911 (when he gave up working as a satirical cartoonist), developing at this time a personal Cubist style. In &quot;A Life of Picasso&quot;, John Richardson writes that Jean Metzinger&#x27;s 1911 work, &quot;Le goûter (Tea Time)&quot;, persuaded Juan Gris of the importance of mathematics in painting. Gris exhibited for the first time at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled &quot;Hommage à Pablo Picasso&quot;).

&quot;He appears with two styles&quot;, writes art historian Peter Brooke, &quot;In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the &quot;Goûter&quot; and of Metzinger&#x27;s later work in 1912.&quot; In the other, Brooke continues, &quot;the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken. Their presence is suggested by the heavy, often triangular, shading of the angles between them... Both styles are distinguished from the work of Picasso and Braque by their clear, rational and measurable quality.&quot; Although Gris regarded Picasso as a teacher, Gertrude Stein wrote in &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot; that &quot;Juan Gris was the only person whom Picasso wished away&quot;.
In 1912, Gris exhibited at the &quot;Exposició d&#x27;art cubista&quot;, Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, the first declared group exhibition of Cubism worldwide; the gallery Der Sturm in Berlin; the &quot;Salon de la Société Normande de Peinture Moderne&quot; in Rouen; and the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or in Paris. Gris, in that same year, signed a contract that gave Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler exclusive rights to his work.

At first Gris painted in the style of &quot;Analytical Cubism&quot;, a term he himself later coined, but after 1913 he began his conversion to &quot;Synthetic Cubism&quot;, of which he became a steadfast interpreter, with extensive use of papier collé or, collage. Unlike Picasso and Braque, whose Cubist works were practically monochromatic, Gris painted with bright harmonious colors in daring, novel combinations in the manner of his friend Matisse. Gris exhibited with the painters of the Puteaux Group in the Salon de &quot;la Section d&#x27;Or&quot; in 1912. His preference for clarity and order influenced the Purist style of Amédée Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), and made Gris an important exemplar of the post-war &quot;return to order&quot; movement. In 1915 he was painted by his friend, Amedeo Modigliani. In November 1917 he made one of his few sculptures, the polychrome plaster &quot;Harlequin&quot;.

==Crystal Cubism==

Gris&#x27;s works from late 1916 through 1917 exhibit a greater simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in &quot;Woman with Mandolin, after Corot&quot; (September 1916) and in its epilogue, &quot;Portrait of Josette Gris&quot; (October 1916; Museo Reina Sofia).

The clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly controls the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point.

The geometric structure of Juan Gris&#x27;s Crystal period is already palpable in &quot;Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan&quot; (June 1915; Philadelphia Museum of Art). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come.

In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this &#x27;synthetic&#x27; approach, and to assert its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.

==Designer and theorist==
In 1924, he designed ballet sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev and the famous Ballets Russes.

Gris articulated most of his aesthetic theories during 1924 and 1925. He delivered his definitive lecture, &quot;Des possibilités de la peinture&quot;, at the Sorbonne in 1924. Major Gris exhibitions took place at the Galerie Simon in Paris and the Galerie Flechtheim in Berlin in 1923 and at the Galerie Flechtheim in Düsseldorf in 1925.

==Death==
After October 1925, Gris was frequently ill with bouts of uremia and cardiac problems. He died of kidney failure in Boulogne-sur-Seine (Paris) on 11 May 1927, at the age of 40, leaving a wife, Josette, and a son, Georges.

==Art market==

The top auction price for a Gris work is $57.1 million (£34.8 million), achieved for his 1915 painting &quot;Nature morte à la nappe à carreaux (Still Life with Checked Tablecloth)&quot;. This surpassed previous records of $20.8 million for his 1915 still life &quot;Livre, pipe et verres&quot;, $28.6 million for the 1913 artwork &quot;Violon et guitare&quot; and $31.8 million for &quot;The musician&#x27;s table&quot;, now in the Met.

<doc id="16074" wikidata="Q381831" url="?curid=16074" title="James Whale">
<text>James Whale (22 July 1889 – 29 May 1957) was an English film director, theatre director and actor, who spent the greater part of his career in Hollywood. He is best remembered for several horror films: &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933) and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), all considered classics. Whale also directed films in other genres, including the 1936 film version of the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;.

Whale was born into a large family in Dudley, Worcestershire now Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. He discovered his artistic talent early on and studied art. With the outbreak of World War I, he enlisted in the British Army and became an officer. He was captured by the Germans and during his time as a prisoner of war he realised he was interested in drama. Following his release at the end of the war he became an actor, set designer and director. His success directing the 1928 play &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; led to his move to the US, first to direct the play on Broadway and then to Hollywood, California, to direct films. He lived in Hollywood for the rest of his life, most of that time with his longtime romantic partner, producer David Lewis. Apart from &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (1930), which was released by Tiffany Films, and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930), released by United Artists, he directed a dozen films for Universal Pictures between 1931 and 1937, developing a style characterised by the influence of German Expressionism and a highly mobile camera.

At the height of his career as a director, Whale directed &quot;The Road Back&quot; (1937), a sequel to &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film&#x27;s being altered from Whale&#x27;s vision, and it was a critical failure. A run of box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was effectively over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He took his own life on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.

Whale was openly gay throughout his career, something that was very rare in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more widespread, some of his films, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext and it has been claimed that his refusal to remain in the closet led to the end of his career. Other commentators have contended that his retirement was provoked by a succession of poorly received projects with which Whale was growing personally dissatisfied (particularly deleterious to his career was &quot;The Road Back&quot;, which went through development hell at multiple stages, whereafter the buck was perceived to stop with Whale as principal director).

==Early years==

Whale was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, at the heart of the Black Country, the sixth of seven children of William, a blast furnaceman, and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years, because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a cobbler, reclaiming the nails he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and price tags for his neighbors. He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.

World War I broke out in early August 1914. Although Whale had little interest in the politics behind the war, he realized that conscription was inevitable, so he voluntarily enlisted just before it was introduced, into the British Army&#x27;s Inns of Court Officer Training Corps in October 1915, and was stationed initially at Bristol. He was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Worcestershire Regiment in July 1916. He was taken prisoner of war in battle on the Western Front in Flanders in August 1917, and was held at Holzminden Officers&#x27; Camp, where he remained until the war&#x27;s end, being repatriated to England in December 1918. While imprisoned he became actively involved, as an actor, writer, producer and set-designer, in the amateur theatrical productions that took place in the camp, finding them &quot;a source of great pleasure and amusement&quot;. He also developed a talent for poker, and after the war he cashed in the chits and IOUs from his fellow prisoners that he had amassed in gambling to provide himself with finances for re-entry into civilian life.

==Career==
===Theatre===
After the armistice, he returned to Birmingham and tried to find work as a cartoonist. He sold two cartoons to the &quot;Bystander&quot; in 1919 but was unable to secure a permanent position. Later that year he embarked on a professional stage career. Under the tutelage of actor-manager Nigel Playfair, he worked as an actor, set designer and builder, &quot;stage director&quot; (akin to a stage manager) and director. In 1922, while with Playfair, he met Doris Zinkeisen. They were considered a couple for some two years, despite Whale&#x27;s living as an openly gay man. They were reportedly engaged in 1924, but by 1925 the engagement was off.

In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R. C. Sherriff&#x27;s then-unknown play &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope&#x27;s fiancée. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of &quot;Beau Geste&quot;. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play &quot;managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like&quot;. After three weeks at the Savoy, &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years.

With the success of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; at home, Broadway producer Gilbert Miller acquired the rights to mount a New York production with an all-British cast headed by Colin Keith-Johnston as Stanhope and Derek Williams as Raleigh. Whale also directed this version, which premiered at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre on 22 March 1929. The play ran for over a year and cemented its reputation as the greatest play about World War I.

===Early work in Hollywood===
The success of the various productions of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; brought Whale to the attention of movie producers. Coming at a time when motion pictures were making the transition from silent to talking, producers were interested in hiring actors and directors with experience with dialogue. Whale traveled to Hollywood in 1929 and signed a contract with Paramount Pictures. He was assigned as &quot;dialogue director&quot; for a film called &quot;The Love Doctor&quot; (1929). He completed work on the film in 15 days and his contract was allowed to expire. It was at around this time that he met David Lewis.

Whale was hired by independent film producer and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes, who planned to turn the previously silent Hughes production &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930) into a talkie. Whale directed the dialogue sequences. When his work for Hughes was completed, he headed to Chicago to direct another production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;.

Having purchased the film rights to &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, British producers Michael Balcon and Thomas Welsh agreed that Whale&#x27;s experience directing the London and Broadway productions of the play made him the best choice to direct the film. The two partnered with a small American studio, Tiffany-Stahl, to shoot it in New York. Colin Clive reprised his role as Stanhope, and David Manners was cast as Raleigh. Filming got underway on 6 December 1929 and wrapped on 22 January 1930. &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; was released in Great Britain on 14 April and in the United States on 15 April. On both sides of the Atlantic the film was a tremendous critical and commercial success.

===With the Laemmles at Universal===

Universal Studios signed Whale to a five-year contract in 1931 and his first project was &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot;. Based on the Broadway play by Robert E. Sherwood, the film stars Mae Clarke as Myra, a chorus girl in World War I London who becomes a prostitute. It too was a critical and popular success. At around this time, Whale and Lewis began living together.

In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale his choice of any property the studio owned. He chose &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, mostly because none of Universal&#x27;s other properties particularly interested him, and he wanted to make something other than a war picture. While Mary Shelley&#x27;s 1818 novel &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot; itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to the little known Boris Karloff, who had wide-ranging experience in supporting roles. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.

Next from Whale were &quot;The Impatient Maiden&quot; and &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (both 1932). &quot;The Impatient Maiden&quot; made little impression but &quot;The Old Dark House&quot;, starring Karloff and Charles Laughton, is credited with reinventing the &quot;dark house&quot; subgenre of horror films. Thought lost for some years, a print was found by filmmaker Curtis Harrington in the Universal vaults in 1968. It was restored by George Eastman House, and released on Blu-ray disk in 2017.

Whale&#x27;s next film was &quot;The Kiss Before the Mirror&quot; (1933), a critical success but a box-office failure. He returned to horror with &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933). Shot from a script approved by H. G. Wells, the film blended horror with humor and confounding visual effects. Much admired, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed it in their list of the ten best films of the year, and the film broke box-office records in cities across America. So highly regarded was the film that France, which restricted the number of theatres in which undubbed American films could play, granted it a special waiver because of its &quot;extraordinary artistic merit&quot;.

Also in 1933 Whale directed the romantic comedy &quot;By Candlelight&quot; which gained good reviews and was a modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed &quot;One More River&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by John Galsworthy. The film tells the story of a woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale&#x27;s films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband&#x27;s abusive behavior.
&quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935) was Whale&#x27;s next project. He had resisted making a sequel to &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as he feared being pigeonholed as a horror director. &quot;Bride&quot; hearkened back to an episode from Mary Shelley&#x27;s original novel in which the Monster promises to leave Frankenstein and humanity alone if Frankenstein makes him a mate. He does, but the mate is repelled by the monster who then, setting Frankenstein and his wife free to live, chooses to destroy himself and his &quot;bride&quot;. The film was a critical and box office success, having earned some $2 million for Universal by 1943. Lauded as &quot;the finest of all gothic horror movies&quot;, &quot;Bride&quot; is frequently hailed as Whale&#x27;s masterpiece.
With the success of &quot;Bride&quot;, Laemmle was eager to put Whale to work on &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1936), the sequel to Universal&#x27;s first big horror hit of the sound era. Whale, wary of doing two horror films in a row and concerned that directing &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; could interfere with his plans for the first all-sound version of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (previously filmed as a part-talkie by Harry A. Pollard), instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a novel called &quot;The Hangover Murders&quot;. The novel is a comedy-mystery in the style of &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, about a group of friends who were so drunk the night one of them was murdered that none can remember anything. Retitled &quot;Remember Last Night?&quot;, the film was one of Whale&#x27;s personal favorites, but met with sharply divided reviews and commercial uninterest.

With the completion of &quot;Remember Last Night?&quot; Whale immediately went to work on &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936). Whale gathered as many of those as he could who had been involved in one production or another of the musical, including Helen Morgan, Paul Robeson, Charles Winninger, Sammy White, conductor Victor Baravalle, orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett, and, as Magnolia, Irene Dunne, who believed that Whale was the wrong director for the piece. The 1936 version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, faithfully adapted from the original stage production, is believed to be the definitive film version of the musical by many critics, but became unavailable following the 1951 remake. In 2014, a restoration of the film became available on DVD in the U.S. as part of Warner Home Video&#x27;s Archive Collection line; and in 2020, a 4K restoration Blu-Ray was released by The Criterion Collection.

&quot;Show Boat&quot; was the last of Whale&#x27;s films to be produced under the Laemmle family. The studio was now bankrupt, and the Laemmles lost control to J. Cheever Cowdin, head of the Standard Capital Corporation, and Charles R. Rogers, who was installed in Junior Laemmle&#x27;s old job.

===Career decline===
Whale&#x27;s career went into sharp decline following the release of his next film, &quot;The Road Back&quot; (1937). The sequel to Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, which Universal had filmed in 1930, the novel and film follow the lives of several young German men who have returned from the trenches of World War I and their struggles to re-integrate into society. The Los Angeles consul for Nazi Germany, Georg Gyssling, learned that the film was in production. He protested to PCA enforcer Joseph Breen, arguing that the film gave an &quot;untrue and distorted picture of the German people&quot;. Gyssling eventually met Whale, but nothing came of it. Gyssling then sent letters to members of the cast, threatening that their participation in the film might lead to difficulties in obtaining German filming permits for them and for anyone associated in a film with them. While the low volume of business conducted by Universal in Germany made such threats largely hollow, the State Department, under pressure from the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and the Screen Actors Guild, stepped in and the German government backed down. Whale&#x27;s original cut of the film was given generally positive reviews, but some time between preview screenings and the film&#x27;s general release, Rogers capitulated to the Germans, ordering that cuts be made and additional scenes be shot and inserted. Whale was furious, and the altered film was banned in Germany anyway. The Germans were successful in persuading China, Greece, Italy and Switzerland to ban the film as well.

Following the debacle of &quot;The Road Back&quot;, Charles Rogers tried to get out of his contract with Whale; Whale refused. Rogers then assigned him to a string of B movies to run out his contractual obligation. Whale only made one additional successful feature film, &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1939), before retiring from the film industry in 1942.

==Post-film life==
With his film career behind him, Whale found himself at a loose end. He was offered the occasional job, including the opportunity to direct &quot;Since You Went Away&quot; for David O. Selznick, but turned them down. Lewis, meanwhile, was busier than ever with his production duties and often worked late hours, leaving Whale lonely and bored. Lewis bought him a supply of paint and canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.

With the outbreak of World War II, Whale volunteered his services to make a training film for the United States Army. He shot the film, called &quot;Personnel Placement in the Army&quot;, in February 1942. Later that year, in association with actress Claire DuBrey, he created the Brentwood Service Players. The Players took over a 100–seat theatre. Sixty seats were provided free of charge to service personnel; the remaining were sold to the public, with the box office proceeds donated to wartime charities. The group expanded to the Playtime Theatre during the summer, where a series of shows ran through October.

Whale returned to Broadway in 1944 to direct the psychological thriller &quot;Hand in Glove&quot;. It was his first return to Broadway since his failed &quot;One, Two, Three!&quot; in 1930. &quot;Hand in Glove&quot; would fare no better than his earlier play, running the same number of performances, 40.

Whale directed his final film in 1950, a short subject based on the William Saroyan one-act play &quot;Hello Out There&quot;. The film, financed by supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, was the story of a man in a Texas jail falsely accused of rape and the woman who cleans the jail. Hartford intended for the short to be part of an anthology film along the lines of &quot;Quartet&quot;. However, attempts to find appropriate short fiction companion pieces to adapt were unsuccessful and &quot;Hello Out There&quot; was never commercially released.

Whale&#x27;s last professional engagement was directing &quot;Pagan in the Parlour&quot;, a farce about two New England spinster sisters who are visited by a Polynesian whom their father, when shipwrecked years earlier, had married. The production was mounted in Pasadena for two weeks in 1951. Plans were made to take it to New York, but Whale suggested taking the play to London first. Before opening the play in England, Whale decided to tour the art museums of Europe. In France he renewed his acquaintanceship with Curtis Harrington, whom he had met in 1947. While visiting Harrington in Paris, he went to some gay bars. At one he met a 25-year-old bartender named Pierre Foegel, whom Harrington believed was nothing but &quot;a hustler out for what he could get&quot;. The 62-year-old Whale was smitten with the younger man and hired him as his chauffeur.

A provincial tour of &quot;Pagan in the Parlour&quot; began in September 1952 and it appeared that the play would be a hit. However, Hermione Baddeley, starring in the play as the cannibal &quot;Noo-ga&quot;, was drinking heavily and began engaging in bizarre antics and disrupting performances. Because she had a run of the play contract she could not be replaced and so producers were forced to close the show.

Whale returned to California in November 1952 and advised David Lewis that he planned to bring Foegel over early the following year. Appalled, Lewis moved out of their home. While this ended their 23-year romantic relationship, the two men remained friends. Lewis bought a small house and dug a swimming pool, prompting Whale to have his own pool dug, although he did not himself swim in it. He began throwing all-male swim parties and would watch the young men cavort in and around the pool. Foegel moved in with Whale in early 1953 and remained there for several months before returning to France. He returned in 1954 permanently, and Whale installed him as manager of a gas station that he owned.

Whale and Foegel settled into a quiet routine until the spring of 1956, when Whale suffered a small stroke. A few months later he suffered a larger stroke and was hospitalized. While in the hospital he was treated for depression with shock treatments.

Upon his release, Whale hired one of the male nurses from the hospital to be his personal live-in nurse. A jealous Foegel maneuvered the nurse out of the house and hired a female nurse as a non-live-in replacement. Whale suffered from mood swings and grew increasingly and frustratingly more dependent on others as his mental faculties were diminishing.

==Death==
Whale died by suicide by drowning himself in his Pacific Palisades swimming pool on 29 May 1957 at the age of 67. He left a suicide note, which Lewis withheld until shortly before his own death decades later. Because the note was suppressed, the death was initially ruled accidental. The note read in part:
Whale&#x27;s body was cremated per his request, and his ashes were interred in the Columbarium of Memory at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale. Because of his habit of periodically revising his date of birth, his niche lists the incorrect date of 1893. When his longtime partner David Lewis died in 1987, his executor and Whale biographer James Curtis had his ashes interred in a niche across from Whale&#x27;s.

==Sexual orientation==
James Whale lived as an openly gay man throughout his career in the British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in that era. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go out of his way to publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale&#x27;s, put it, &quot;Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay.&quot; While there have been suggestions that Whale&#x27;s career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed &quot;The Queen of Hollywood&quot;, Harrington states that &quot;nobody made a thing out of it as far as I could perceive&quot;.

With knowledge of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale&#x27;s work, particularly in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; in which a number of the creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).

Gay film historian Vito Russo, in considering Pretorius, stops short of identifying the character as gay, instead referring to him as &quot;sissified&quot; (&quot;sissy&quot; itself being a Hollywood&#x27;s gay stock character). Pretorius serves as a &quot;gay Mephistopheles&quot;, a figure of seduction and temptation, going so far as to pull Frankenstein away from his bride on their wedding night to engage in the unnatural act of non-procreative life. A novelisation of the film published in England made the implication clear, having Pretorius say to Frankenstein &quot;&#x27;Be fruitful and multiply.&#x27; Let us obey the Biblical injunction: you of course, have the choice of natural means; but as for me, I am afraid that there is no course open to me but the scientific way.&quot; Russo goes so far as to suggest that Whale&#x27;s homosexuality is expressed in both &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Bride&quot; as &quot;a vision both films had of the monster as an antisocial figure in the same way that gay people were &#x27;things&#x27; that should not have happened&quot;.

Whale&#x27;s partner David Lewis stated flatly that Whale&#x27;s sexual orientation was &quot;not germane&quot; to his filmmaking. &quot;Jimmy was first and foremost an artist, and his films represent the work of an artist—not a gay artist, but an artist.&quot; Whale&#x27;s biographer Curtis rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, stating that if the highly class-conscious Whale felt himself to be an antisocial figure, it would have been based not in his sexuality but in his origin in the lower classes.

==Film style==
Whale was heavily influenced by German Expressionism. He was a particular admirer of the films of Paul Leni, combining as they did elements of gothic horror and comedy. This influence was most evident in &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;. Expressionist influence is also in evidence in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, drawn in part from the work of Paul Wegener and his films &quot;The Golem&quot; (1915) and &quot;The Golem: How He Came into the World&quot; (1920) along with &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) from Robert Wiene, which Whale reportedly screened repeatedly while preparing to shoot &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; roughly alternates between distorted expressionistic shots and more conventional styles, with the character of Dr. Waldman serving as &quot;a bridge between everyday and expressionist spaces&quot;. Expressionist influence is also evident in the acting, costuming and the design of the Monster. Whale and makeup artist Jack Pierce may also have been influenced by the Bauhaus school of design. The expressionist influence lasted throughout Whale&#x27;s career, with Whale&#x27;s final film, &quot;Hello Out There&quot;, praised by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; as &quot;a virtuoso pattern of light and shade, a piece of fully blown expressionist filmmaking plonked down unceremoniously in the midst of neo-realism&#x27;s heyday&quot;.

Whale was known for his use of camera movement. He is credited with being the first director to use a 360-degree panning shot in a feature film, included in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Whale used a similar technique during the &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; sequence in &quot;Show Boat&quot;, in which the camera tracked around Paul Robeson as he sang the song. (The sequence also uses expressionist montages illustrating some of the lyrics.) Often singled out for praise in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is the series of shots used to introduce the Monster: &quot;Nothing can ever quite efface the thrill of watching the successive views Whale&#x27;s mobile camera allows us of the lumbering figure&quot;. These shots, starting with a medium shot and culminating in two close-ups of the Monster&#x27;s face, were repeated by Whale to introduce Griffin in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; and the abusive husband in &quot;One More River&quot;. Modified to a single cut rather than two, Whale uses the same technique in &quot;The Road Back&quot; to signal the instability of a returning World War I veteran.

==Legacy==
Influential film critic Andrew Sarris, in his 1968 ranking of directors, lists Whale as &quot;lightly likable&quot;. Noting that Whale&#x27;s reputation has been subsumed by the &quot;Karloff cult&quot;, Sarris cites &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; as the &quot;true gem&quot; of the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; series and concludes that Whale&#x27;s career &quot;reflects the stylistic ambitions and dramatic disappointments of an expressionist in the studio-controlled Hollywood of the thirties&quot;.

Whale&#x27;s final months are the subject of the novel &quot;Father of Frankenstein&quot; (1995) by Christopher Bram. The novel focuses on the relationship between Whale and a fictional gardener named Clayton Boone. &quot;Father of Frankenstein&quot; served as the basis of the 1998 film &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; with Ian McKellen as Whale and Brendan Fraser as Boone. McKellen was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Whale. Bram&#x27;s novel has also been adapted as a play which premiered in London at the Southwark Playhouse in February 2015.

Only two of Whale&#x27;s films received Oscar nominations: &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (for its musical score), and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (for its sound recording).

A memorial sculpture was erected for Whale in September 2001 on the grounds of a new multiplex cinema in his home town of Dudley. The sculpture, by Charles Hadcock, depicts a roll of film with the face of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster engraved into the frames, and the names of his most famous films etched into a cast concrete base in the shape of film canisters. Other sculptures related to Whale&#x27;s cinema career were planned, referencing his early work in a local sheet metal factory, but none had been installed as of 2019.

&quot;Horror in Hollywood: The James Whale Story&quot;, a retrospective of Whale&#x27;s artwork, opened at the Dudley Museum and Art Gallery in October 2012 and ran through to January 2013.
